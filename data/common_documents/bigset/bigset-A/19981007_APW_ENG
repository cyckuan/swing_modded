French sailor leads as solo racers skirt Tropical Storm Lisa
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marc Thiercelin of France slipped past two big
name competitors to grab the lead in the first leg of the
27,000-mile (43,450-kilometer) Around Alone sailing race.
	   Thiercelin, navigating his 60-foot (18-meter) boat SOMEWHERE,
took advantage of the fact that fellow Frenchwoman Isabelle
Austisser was having equipment problems to gain a 23-mile
(37-kilometer) lead over her by late Tuesday. He also overtook Josh
Hall of Britain, and nursed that lead to nearly 56 miles (90
kilometers).
	   Austisser reported breaking the main forestay on her boat, PRB,
which left her unable to use her largest genoa sail. She is the
only female sailor in the race and one of the favorites to win.
	   In Class II, for boats up to 50 feet (15 meters), J.P. Mouligne
of France had a 19-mile (30- kilometer) lead over Mike Garside of
Britain.
	   The 14-boat fleet left Charleston, South Carolina on Sept. 27,
heading across the Atlantic to Cape Town, South Africa, on the
first leg of a four-leg competition.
	   Up until now, the racers' most persistent problem has been
finding steady wind as they cross the area known as the Doldrums.
But on Tuesday, the fleet was keeping a wary eye on its first big
storm _ Tropical Storm Lisa, which had 45 mph (72 kph) winds and
gusts past 50 mph (80 kph).
	   Forecasters said the solo sailors should be OK if they keep to
the west of the storm.
	   The approximately nine-month race, held once every four years,
began in 1982 and used to be called The BOC Challenge.
	   In the 1994-95 race, both Austisser and Hall had to be rescued
at sea after their boats became disabled and sank. Their
experiences prompted boat designers to increase ballast systems and
other safety features so the huge, sleek racing machines can stay
afloat even in the worst weather.

Jailed dissident's family appeals for Blair's help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police hauled away a prominent dissident
Wednesday, and the mother of a jailed, ailing human rights
campaigner appealed for help from visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, a rights group reported.
	   Xu Wenli was eating breakfast in his Beijing apartment when
three police officers came and took him away, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
reported. His whereabouts and the reason for the police action were
not immediately known.
	   One of the most senior democracy campaigners out of prison and
not in exile, Xu has recently supported efforts by dissidents to
try to use China's nascent and spotty legal code to set up an
opposition political party and human rights monitoring group.
	   Xu spent 12 of the last 17 years in prison, much of them in
solitary confinement. Since his release in 1993, he has been
detained frequently, often during visits of high-level foreign
dignitaries.
	   In a direct appeal to Britain's Blair, the mother of former
Beijing University student Li Hai urged the prime minister to
discuss her son's case with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center said.
	   Li, was a member of the Peace Charter movement, a group calling
for peaceful democratic change. He was arrested in 1995 and
sentenced to nine years in prison the following year in a closed
trial for violating the vague state secrets law, apparently for
compiling a list of political prisoners.
	   The 44-year-old Li suffers from gallstones, hepatitis and high
blood pressure and has sought a medical parole, the group said,
citing his mother, Gong Liwen.
	   According to Gong, authorities at the Liangxiang prison outside
Beijing have denied Li adequate medical care and prevented his
family from providing food to supplement meager prison rations.
	   Blair could raise Li's case with Jiang as a ``typical example of
China's violations of human rights and perhaps do something
concrete to show that his visit has helped improve the situation in
China,'' the group said in a statement.
	   According to Li's family, while imprisoned he has been beaten
with electric batons and forced to work 15 hours of hard labor a
day.
	   Blair, the first British prime minister to visit China in seven
years, pledged to raise human rights issues with his hosts before
leaving Britain, and the topic was discussed in a meeting Tuesday
with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. But Blair said he would adopt a
quiet approach on such issues.

Ireland's president thanks Canadians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ireland's President Mary McAleese thanked
Canadians for supporting her country during its troubled times and
said the situation is improving.
	   ``Ireland has undergone a very significant transformation, thank
God,'' said McAleese, who is on a 13-day state visit _ the first
official visit by an Irish head of state to Canada.
	   ``There's a surging sense of confidence. It's blossoming.''
	   About 100,000 people in Toronto welcomed Ireland's ceremonial
leader.
	   McAleese said for the first time in Ireland's history it now has
more people immigrating than emigrating.
	   She boasted that Ireland's high-tech economy is on par with
other European nations and said employment is rising.
	   ``The success we enjoy belongs to so many here,'' she said,
noting the financial contributions Canada has made, plus the
efforts of Canadian Gen. Jean de Chastelain to mediate a peace pact
between Northern Ireland's conflicting factions.
	   McAleese and her husband Martin have already met Prime Minister
Jean Chretien and will visit Montreal; Sydney, Nova Scotia;
Halifax; Saint John, New Brunswick; and Quebec City before leaving
from St. John's, Newfoundland, on Oct. 13.
	   ``It's been very interesting to meet people from the Ottawa
Valley, and to hear, four generations later, the Irish accent
that's fresh as if they just come straight across on the boat,''
said McAleese, 46. ``If I feel at home it's because I am at home.''

Top track and field athlete faces jail over drug importing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A jury on Wednesday found Olympic
decathlete Simon Poelman guilty of illegally importing the party
drug Ecstacy, and has been remanded in custody for sentence.
	   After a High Court jury trial, Poelman was found guilty of
mailing 2,000 tablets of the drug into the country from Belgium,
concealed inside a toy stuffed rabbit.
	   Prosecutors told the court the drug had a value of New Zealand
dollars 200,000 (U.S. dlrs 100,000). Poelman claimed he had given
the parcel containing the rabbit to another person to post, and was
unaware it carried concealed drugs.
	   Reporters in the court said Poelman, the country's
best-performed multi-discipline athlete for the past decade, shook
his head and whispered ``damn'' when the guilty verdict was read.
	   He was ordered jailed pending sentencing on Oct. 30 on the
illegal drug importation charge, which carries a maximum penalty of
a 14-year jail term.
	   Poelman was New Zealand's decathlon representative at the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last month, but won no
medals.
	   He made his Commonwealth Games debut in Edinburgh in 1986, when
he won a bronze medal in the decathlon.
	   In the 1990 Auckland Games, he grabbed silver in the same event
and bronze in the pole vault.
	   Poelman also represented New Zealand at the 1988 and 1992
Olympics, and was once ranked as high as sixth in the world in the
decathlon.

Blair looks to promote business with China, as dissident detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair turned his
attention Wednesday to promoting business ties with China, but
human rights issues intruded with police taking a prominent
dissident from his home.
	   The police action against Xu Wenli, who spent 12 years in prison
after the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, came at an awkward moment.
Blair's Labor Party government has vowed to exercise an ethnical
foreign policy and before leaving Britain he promised to raise
human rights concerns, albeit softly.
	   Xu was led away from his home Wednesday morning around the time
Blair was presiding at the signing of contracts and plans for
British business investments worth over dlrs 830 million.
	   Both China and Britain have sought to use Blair's five-day
visit, the first by a British Prime Minister in seven years, to
highlight improved ties following years of rancor over Hong Kong.
	   On Tuesday, the two governments declared a comprehensive
partnership intended to open a new chapter in relations following
the smooth return of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997.
	   The partnership covers everything from boosting trade to
cooperation on environmental protection and increasing
military-to-military contacts.
	   In addition to sightseeing and contract signings, Blair was to
cap his official schedule Wednesday by meeting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin. It was unclear if Blair would address human rights
concerns with Jiang as he did with Premier Zoo Renege on Tuesday.
	   Aside from police action against Mu, the mother of a jailed and
ailing dissident sent Blair a letter urging him to press Jiang for
her son's release, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Li Hi was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to nine years in prison
in a closed trial for violating the state secrets law, apparently
by compiling a list of political prisoners.
	   China had hoped to head off criticisms of human rights abuses by
signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a
key U.N. rights treaty, on Monday, the eve of Blair's arrival.
	   Traveling with a group of British business leaders, the prime
minister witnessed sinnings of four contracts to build a water
treatment plant and a coal-fired power station and make
pharmaceuticals and small satellites in China.
	   With distrust over Hong Kong behind them, Britain has become
China's No. 1 investor and second largest trading partner among
European Union nations.
	   Trade for the first seven months of the year totaled dlrs 3.48
billion, an increase of more than 18 percent over the same period
in 1997, according to Chinese officials.
	   Blair will champion British business interests Thursday in
Shanghai, China's financial capital, where he will tour the stock
exchange, lunch with the mayor and open a factory and an insurance
office.
	   He heads to Hong Kong Friday, his first visit since attending
the hangover ceremonies 15 months ago.

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stocks rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early afternoon Nikkei, dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in early
afternoon trading Wednesday on optimism Japan was moving ahead with
plans to address its ailing banking system and boost economic
growth. Tokyo stocks surged.
	   The dollar bought 130.57 yen in early afternoon, down 2.29 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late overnight level
of 130.85 yen in New York.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
572.52 points, or 4.40 percent, moving to 13,594.16 by
midafternoon. The average gained 73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, on
Tuesday.
	   Making a rare comment on the foreign exchange market, Japan's
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he was closely watching current
dollar-yen exchange-rate movements.
	   ``If a stronger yen means Japan's fundamentals are being
positively evaluated, that's good news, but if it's speculation it
is a problem. I'm watching it closely,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Finance Ministry's
international bureau, praised what he called a correction in the
yen's weakness.
	   ``A correction to excessive yen weakness is welcome. It will
continue,'' he told reporters at the ministry.
	   The dollar weakened after Japan's ruling party promised to push
for expansion and early passage of an economic stimulus package
first announced in August.
	   The original package called for a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 54
billion) tax cut and a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 77 billion) public
spending program.
	   Market players were also encouraged by growing optimism the
government would move quickly to enact a plan to use public money
to shore up ailing banks.
	   Also affecting the dollar was speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve may move to cut interest rates further in line with
imminent moves by European central banks, traders said.
	   On the stock market, bank shares were among the biggest gainers
in morning trading amid prospects that legislation to allow the
government to use public funds to recapitalize weak but viable
banks will be approved during the current extended parliamentary
session.
	   The ruling party was set to submit a bill to Parliament on
Wednesday that incorporated many of the political opposition's
proposals, making quick passage likely, news reports said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 37.64 points, or 3.76 percent, to 1,034.59. On

Japan's ruling party submits bank crisis bill to Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party submitted a bill on Wednesday
to allow the government to use public money to bailout ailing
banks.
	   Japanese banks, many of them among the world's largest, are
desperately in need of fresh capital to restore reserves lost from
writing off bad loans and as a buffer against possible further
losses.
	   The bill would establish the mechanism for injecting such
capital into the debt-ridden banks.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party have been under intense pressure from world leaders to move
more aggressively to tackle the bad-loan crisis threatening the
nation's banks and contributing to Japan's worsening recession.
	   The current extraordinary session of Parliament, originally
scheduled to end Wednesday, was expected to be extended for nine
days to give lawmakers time to deliberate the proposal.
	   But the bill were expected clear Parliament quickly after two
opposition groups dropped their objections to the plan Tuesday.
	   The bank bill includes provisions that would allow the
government to provide funds to both weak and healthy banks as a
means for easing the nation's credit crunch and to help strong
lenders take over failed institutions.
	   Tokyo's benchmark stock average soared Wednesday on hopes the
laws will be approved soon and help strengthen banks, traders said.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues jumped 641.61 points,
or 4.93 percent, in afternoon trading to 13,663.25.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Marauding bands of young activists shot
and killed at least four people, including two policemen, and set
fire to more than 100 vehicles in Pakistan's largest city on
Wednesday _ the second day of unrest following the killing of two
political leaders.
	   Two men, semi-conscious and badly beaten, were dragged from a
vehicle and shot, said ambulance workers who recovered the bodies.
Eight people have been killed in the unrest so far, according to
police and ambulance workers. The bodies of several of the dead
showed signs of torture.
	   Entire neighborhoods in Karachi, a city of 14 million people,
have been shut down since Monday when Abdul Qadir and Aamir Zaki of
the Muttiheda Qami Movement were shot to death. Armed activists
were seen forcing store owners to remain shut again Wednesday.
	   They also warned buses and taxis to stay off the roads, which
were littered with rocks, bricks and broken furniture in eastern
and central Karachi.
	   Police patrolled in bullet proof vests and armored vehicles,
backed up by paramilitary troops known as Rangers with automatic
rifles and armored personnel carriers.
	   An ethnic-based party, the MQM split into two factions several
years ago. Since then, the rival groups have been waging a bitter
and increasingly violent battle for control of the city. Violence
between the rival factions escalated earlier this year as their
battle for control of the city intensified. Police officials say
the death toll is more than 600.
	   The slain leaders belonged to the largest MQM faction led by
Altaf Hussein, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Britain
for the past five years. Hussein's faction is one of the the
largest parties in the Sindh provincial legislature and is
currently a member of the ruling coalition government. However
differences with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League has strained the
coalition.
	   Hussein's faction has accused the government of dragging its
feet in its efforts to clamp down on the rival Haqiqi faction. In
the Sindh Parliament, the Hussein faction has withdrawn from the
Cabinet while remaining within the coalition.
	   Shoaib Bokhari, a spokesman for the Hussein faction, warned that
his party will withdraw all together if the killers of the two
leaders are not arrested and the Rangers withdrawn from Karachi.
	   Some supporters of the Hussein faction say the Rangers, who are
controlled by the federal government, are being used to control the
group.

King Sihanouk against changing constitution to break deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has said he is
against modifying the Cambodian constitution to allow strongman Hun
Sen to form a government without the opposition, according to a
statement released Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 seats in
parliament in July 26 elections, short of the two-thirds majority
needed to rule without a coalition.
	   Cambodia's two opposition parties have so far refused to forge a
ruling partnership with Hun Sen's party, leaving the country in a
political deadlock with parliament unable to convene more than two
months after the polls.
	   The opposition alleges Hun Sen's electoral victory was achieved
through fraud and intimidation. International observers said that
by and large the election was clean.
	   The opposition is demanding a thorough investigation of hundreds
of alleged cases of election violations before it will consider
joining a coalition government.
	   In a transcript of a Tuesday interview with his staff, Sihanouk
said that despite misgivings he would not oppose a constitutional
amendment allowing a simple majority in parliament to form the next
government, as long as the change was made legally.
	   But a two-thirds majority in parliament is also needed for
approval of any constitutional amendment.
	   It was not clear if the idea to change the constitution was
being floated by Hun Sen's backers or members of the opposition who
want parliament to convene without having to become allied with the
leader of the CPP.
	   Hun Sen and ruling party president Chea Sim met with Sihanouk on
Tuesday in an effort to seek the king's influence to break the
deadlock in negotiations.
	   However, in a question to Sihanouk, the king's staff said
``opposition anti-Hun Sen'' politicians wanted to modify the
constitution to allow the Cambodian leader's party sole control of
the next government.
	   The king responded that any constitutional amendment must be
made legally, and that politicians should not ask him to pressure
either side to make the change.
	   ``I am against any modification of our constitution, but if this
or that representative of the `opposition' or other representatives
want to modify our constitution, conforming to the `permission'
accorded by the constitution itself, I would not oppose it,''
Sihanouk said.
	   ``But don't come and seek `maneuvers' and `pressure' from the
king. Our politicians are responsible for their own actions,'' he
added.
	   Opposition politician Ing Kieth, who as the oldest member of
parliament is given the task of convening its first meeting, met
with the king Saturday to discuss the deadlock.
	   He said the opposition, for the time being, is opposed to any
amendment of the constitution.
	   The king suggested in the Tuesday interview that he would stay
in Cambodia through the end of the month because the Buddhist
clergy had requested his presence during religious ceremonies held
for his 76th birthday on Oct. 31.

Millions expected to march against Yeltsin across Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians have so far endured an economic crisis
stoically, with few public outbursts against a government that
appears unable to stop the slide in their currency, buying power
and standard of living.
	   But Wednesday they were expected to turn their private
frustrations into one of the country's largest protests in recent
years.
	   Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people were expected
to take part in marches and other demonstrations across the country
organized by trade unions, the Communist Party and other critics of
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The protests began in the Far East, where demonstrators in
Vladivostok gathered at a shipbuilding factory for an afternoon
march to the city's main square.
	   Workers staged work stoppages and held union meetings at
factories throughout the city, but no roads or rail lines were
blocked, and there were no major disruptions of everyday life.
	   On the eve of the protests, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made
a nationally televised appeal to Russians to remain calm, both
during the demonstrations and for the duration of the economic
crisis.
	   Primakov promised there would be no food shortages this winter
and said the government would start paying overdue wages and
pensions.
	   ``The populace will be fully provided with vegetables, fruit and
potatoes,'' Primakov said. ``I appeal to everyone not to rock our
common boat in today's too-turbulent sea.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov predicted as many as 40
million of Russia's 148 million people could take part in
Wednesday's protests, but others say it will be closer to the
nearly 2 million people who participated in a similar protest in
March 1997.
	   Russia's economic conditions have deteriorated considerably
since then, but the protest organizers may have hurt themselves by
sending out mixed messages.
	   The unions want to focus on the economy, which is expected to
shrink by more than 5 percent this year. Millions of workers get
paid months late, and inflation now is forecast at 200 percent.
	   ``The problems of debts, (unpaid) wages and (lack of) jobs
appeared not today and not on Aug. 17,'' said Mikhail Shmakov,
leader of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, referring to
the day when the government effectively devalued the ruble and
defaulted on domestic debt.
	   The economic turmoil ``has been gradually developing in the
country during the past few years,'' he said.
	   The Communists, meanwhile, have been calling for Yeltsin's
resignation and see the protests as a way to further weaken the
president, who still has two years left in his term.
	   But the Communists find themselves in a bit of an awkward
position because several of their members are playing key roles in
Primakov's new government.
	   Yeltsin has maintained an extremely low profile since the
economic crisis struck, spending most of his time at a presidential
residence on the western outskirts of Moscow.
	   The Communists and the unions have pledged that the protests
will be peaceful. Nonetheless, police and interior troops have been
put on alert throughout Russia.
	   More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry troops
will be deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior Ministry
official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Moscow city officials have said the demonstration in the capital
could draw up to 150,000 people, who will march to the edge of Red
Square.
	   Seeking to discourage angry rhetoric aimed at the government,
Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov warned that criminal
proceedings could be launched against opposition leaders who
recently called for the government's ouster by force.
	   Such statements are punishable by law, Krasheninnikov told a
news conference Tuesday. Justice Ministry officials plan to attend
rallies to see whether speakers comply with the law.
	   ``I would like to specifically warn those trying to incite
tensions that the authorities will closely follow the events. If we
hear calls for violent overthrow of the constitutional order, we
will make our conclusions,'' the minister said.

New pro-Anwar rally held as Mahathir refuses to appoint deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Wednesday he would not appoint a replacement for Anwar Ibrahim
as anti-government protests remerged with thousands demanding
justice for his ousted, jailed deputy.
	   After chairing a meeting of his United Malays National
Organization Party until early hours, Mahathir said he would wait
to fill Anwar's seat until the party's internal election in 1999.
	   Last week, Mahathir, 72, said he could ``drop dead'' at any
time, fueling speculation that he was about to announce a deputy
after consulting his party's supreme council.
	   ``This is not a matter discussed by the party. That is my
prerogative. That is my responsibility and I do not need to refer
to anyone,'' Mahathir told reporters after the meeting at party
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
	   As the meeting was going on, a crowd of about 10,000 people
gathered late Tuesday night in the eastern state of Pahang for an
anti-government rally organized by a new opposition coalition, the
Malaysian Justice Movement.
	   Thousands of postcards addressed to the prime minister were
circulated. The cards demanded Mahathir hold a general election or
step down.
	   The cards also urged Mahathir to repeal the Internal Security
Act, a draconian law that allows for imprisonment without trial,
said an organizer, Shamsul Maarif Ismail.
	   Anwar, Malaysia's former deputy premier, was arrested under the
ISA on Sept. 20 for organizing a huge anti-Mahathir rally. He is
also charged on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sexual acts for
which he will be tried beginning Nov. 2.
	   Tuesday's rally took place at the regional headquarters of the
Islamic opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia or PAS which is part of
the new coalition of three opposition parties and more than a dozen
non-governmental organizations.
	   It was the first rally after a week of calm following several
anti-government street demonstrations in the capital that riot
police dispersed with tear gas and water cannons.
	   Shamsul said the rally was the beginning of a nationwide
roadshow for wide-scale lobbying against the ISA.
	   Anwar's arrest came after two weeks of nationwide rallies
resounding with calls for government reform and Mahathir's
resignation.
	   Mahathir had groomed Anwar as his heir for five years, but fired
him abruptly, saying he was morally unfit to lead. The two had
differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared
the deputy was a threat to his 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir also said Wednesday the party had fired 10 UMNO members
for their anti-party activities, an obvious reference to their bias
in favor of Anwar.
	   The Malaysian leader also reacted angrily at the growing
condemnation by world leaders to the treatment Anwar is receiving
in captivity.
	   ``If we mind our own business, it will be better for
everybody,'' he said.
	   Soon after Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises
on his arm and neck, condemnation poured in from many of Malaysia's
neighbors and Western nations.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie canceled a scheduled visit to
Malaysia, but said he might still attend the November meeting of
leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The United States said it would downgrade President Clinton's
scheduled visit to Kuala Lumpur for the APEC summit next month.

Vietnam railways to cut north-south route by two hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Reunification Express is getting a
little closer to its name.
	   Thanks to recent improvements, the Vietnam Railway Authority
said Wednesday it will be cutting the travel time between Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh City by two hours.
	   But the train, also known as the Red Rattler, won't be setting
any rail speed records. It still will take 32 hours to cover the
nearly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) trip.
	   Vu Xuan Hong, chief of the Railway Authority office, said
completion of a semi-automatic signal system between Vinh and Ho
Chi Minh City, along with recent rail and locomotive upgrades, have
made the reduction possible.
	   The Reunification Express has become a symbol of a unified
Vietnam. The first such express train started in 1976, a year after
the fall of Saigon to the communist North.
	   The travel time has been cut from 80 hours at that time to 42
hours in 1992, 38 hours in 1995 and 34 hours since 1996, with more
cuts in sight.
	   Eight railway bridges are being upgraded with loans from the
Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), with 10 smaller
bridges to be upgraded soon.
	   Vietnam Railways transported 10.5 million passengers and more
than 4 million tons of cargo last year, making it the most
important transport network between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Thousands mourn murdered Mongolian politician

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ In a public outpouring of grief,
thousands of Mongolians turned out Wednesday to mourn a popular
government minister knifed to death for unknown reasons.
	   The body of Sanjaasureniin Zorig, a leader of the 1990 triumph
over Soviet-sponsored communism, was laid to rest at a cemetery for
senior officials on the outskirts of the capital, Ulan Bator.
	   Some 7,000 mourners showed up to slowly file past Zorig's open
casket as it lay in state at Government House. Between 12,000 to
15,000 people lined the streets to watch as an army truck slowly
carried the casket to the cemetery.
	   ``This tragedy has really brought the nation together. We are
mourning Zorig's loss like a family,'' said A. Ariunbat, a student.
	   Scuffles occurred when some people realized they would not get
to see Zorig's body. Police struggled to hold the crowd back, and
several elderly people fainted in the crush.
	   Governing democrats, opposition politicians and ordinary
citizens all have gathered in the center of the city daily to
express sadness over Zorig's killing late Friday night.
	   The killing shocked Mongolia's fractious political establishment
and complicated a political standoff between democrats and former
communists that has left the impoverished country without an
effective government for four months.
	   Before his death, Zorig, the minister of infrastructure and
telecommunications, was emerging as a compromise candidate to end
the political stalemate.
	   Police have refused to speculate about motives behind the
killing. A special investigative team is hunting for the killers,
and checks along Mongolia's long, sparsely populated borders with
China and Russia were tightened.
	   Zorig's killers entered his apartment Friday night, tied up his
wife and waited for him to return home. He was then stabbed. An ax
was found near the body, but apparently had not been used.

Bible Code book is bogus, says Australian computer scientist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A skeptical professor said Wednesday
that if the best-seller ``The Bible Code'' found Biblical
predictions of the Moon landing and the assassination of Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, he can find similar clairvoyance in
Herman Melville's epic novel ``Moby Dick.''
	   Brendan McKay, a computer engineer at the Australian National
University, says he can find coded references in ``Moby Dick'' that
predict the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Leon
Trotsky, Martin Luther King Jr. and even the death of Princess
Diana.
	   He readily admits that that such predictions are pure bunkum --
and says so are those set out in Michael Drosnin's ``The Bible
Code.''
	   That best-seller claims to reveal a hidden code in the Bible, by
skipping over words and associating others, which predicted Rabin's
assassination a year before it happened.
	   It also predicted an earthquake in Los Angeles in 2010 and many
other impending disasters.
	   The hidden code operates on the principle that say, the fifth or
fifty-fifth letter in every word of a particular text forms a
sentence.
	   The trouble is that the ``codes'' are usually so complex that it
takes a computer to extract them.
	   The book has received substantial criticism; a Los Angeles Times
reviewer said Drosnin's book ``is all good fun if you don't take it
seriously.''
	   McKay doesn't pretend that Melville, writing ``Moby Dick'' in
1851, had the ability either to predict the most newsworthy
assassinations of the 20th Century or indeed to encode them into
his book.
	   The professor, who says he is not religious, also does not
believe that God dabbled in that arcane pursuit either, when
dictating the Bible.
	   McKay, aided by a small, mainly Jewish team of experts tried to
repeat an experiment by Israeli mathematicians Doron Witzum,
Eliyahu Rips and Yoav Rosenberg of the Jerusalem College of
Technology and the Hebrew University.
	   The Jewish members of McKay's team were chosen for their
knowledge of Hebrew, the original language of the bible.
	   They failed.
	   They then looked for ``skip codes'' in other literary works,
chosen only for their substantial length.
	   The Book of Revelations was particularly rewarding -- it

Japan may end fingerprinting of foreign residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan may abolish a controversial law that requires
fingerprinting of all foreign residents, government officials said
Wednesday.
	   Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura told a parliamentary session
late Tuesday that his ministry was moving to scrap the requirement
that foreigners submit a fingerprint when registering to live in
Japan, according to Susumu Yamagami an official in the Justice
Ministry's immigration department.
	   The practice of fingerprinting foreigners for identification has
been controversial since it was adopted in 1952.
	   Currently, some 600,000 foreigners _ including workers from
overseas, students and foreign spouses of Japanese citizens _ are
subjected to fingerprinting.
	   Critics said the system is discriminatory and casts foreign
residents as criminals.
	   Koreans living in Japan have fought especially hard against the
law. Many ethnic Korean families have lived here for generations
but because Japan does not grant citizenship by birth, they are
still treated like temporary residents.
	   A revision to the rule in 1992 exempted most of them from the
fingerprinting requirement, but among the Korean community, the law
is still a symbol of discrimination.
	   The move toward lifting the requirement for all foreigners came
just before South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in Tokyo on
Wednesday to begin four days of talks.
	   The timing of the justice minister's announcement was not
related to the visit, Yamagami said. At the same time the
government revised the law in 1992 it adopted a resolution to
consider lifting the fingerprinting requirement for all foreigners
this year, he said.
	   Under the proposed revision, foreign residents would be required
only to submit a photo and signature when filling out applications
to reside in Japan.
	   Strong opposition by the National Police Agency had blocked
complete abolition of the requirement when the government revised
the law five years ago, and the agency was again expected to argue
fingerprinting foreigners is necessary for maintaining public
security.

Philippine Airlines returns to skies after 13-day shutdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-laden Philippine Airlines
returned to the country's skies Wednesday, ending a 13-day closure
prompted by disagreements with its largest labor union over a
management-proposed recovery plan.
	   ``There are things that you don't value much until they are lost
to you,'' said PAL pilot Emmanuel Generoso. ``This is what happened
with PAL.''
	   In a bright sign for the future of Asia's oldest airline, which
weary passengers have nicknamed ``Plane Always Late,'' its first
flight took off on time and arrived in southern Zamboanga city 13
minutes early.
	   ``This is a good beginning,'' said PAL assistant vice president
Angel Sambo. ``There were no hassles.''
	   But not all employees shared his view.
	   Some militant workers opposed to the recovery plan did not
report to work. They say they will challenge the plan in court,
claiming it violates the constitution's guarantee of the right of
workers to form unions and bargain collectively for labor benefits.
	   Under the plan, initially rejected but then approved last week
by PAL's largest union, workers agreed to a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and several seats on its board.
	   PAL's management says the CBA suspension had been demanded by
creditors and potential investors who worried about the carrier's
history of labor problems.
	   The airline, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1
billion in debts, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by
the region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   PAL's closure on Sept. 23 left much of the Philippine
archipelago without air service. To help fill the vacuum, President
Joseph Estrada's administration enlisted Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
and Dragon Airlines to temporarily fly some of PAL's domestic
routes.
	   Those flights ended Wednesday.
	   Officials say both Cathay Pacific and the United States'
Northwest Airlines have begun talks on buying stakes in PAL.
	   A Cathay Pacific team has been in the Philippines since last
week to study PAL's operations. Northwest officials were expected
to arrive in Manila on Wednesday.
	   PAL says it plans to resume international service on Oct. 15.

Asian markets open higher, lifted by global market recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Markets across Asia opened sharply higher
Wednesday, lifted by the global market recovery overnight and
expectations of interest rates cuts across Europe, as well as a
stronger Japanese yen and hopes of fresh economic reforms in the
world's second largest economy.
	   Share prices in Japan soared, and the key indexes in Hong Kong
and Singapore had risen more than 2 percent each by midday.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei average of 225 selected issues
soared 429.09 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at midday at
13,513.73.
	   Market sentiment was bullish on possible guidelines from
Parliament to recapitalize weak but viable banks. The plan allows
the government to purchase preferred shares issued by certain banks
in need of fresh capital.
	   ``Confidence appears to be picking up this afternoon,'' said
Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the yen strengthened against the
U.S. dollar, following comments from Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and other officials that they were closely watching current
dollar-yen exchange-rate movements.
	   ``If a stronger yen means Japan's fundamentals are being
positively evaluated, that's good news, but if it's speculation it
is a problem. I'm watching it closely,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   The dollar bought 130.57 yen in early afternoon, down 2.29 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late overnight level
of 130.85 yen in New York.
	   The rallies in Japanese stocks and the yen boosted confidence
across the region, as Japan's economic recovery is seen as
essential to pull the region out of the 15-month financial turmoil
and avert a possible global crisis.
	   Expectations of interest rate cuts in Europe, following Spain's
rate cut Tuesday by 50 basis points, also spurred buying in Asia,
analysts said.
	   ``Anticipation of a rate cut in Europe raised hopes for a global
trend to cut interest rates,'' said Kenny Tang, research manager at
Tung Tai Securities Co. Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   Equity markets across Europe rallied following Spain's rate cut.
The key bourses in Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland and the
Netherlands closed up Tuesday between 4.4 percent to 7.8 percent.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng index soared 162.99
points, or 2.2 percent, to 7,727.53 at midday, although trading was
thin as investors remained cautious ahead of Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa's policy speech Wednesday afternoon.
	   Market participants were expecting Tung to announce plans to
lift the economy out of the recession.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index was up 2.2
percent, or 19.59 points, at 911.07 from Tuesday's close.
	   In the Philippines, the key PSE index closed 3.6 percent higher
on hopes that foreigners would soon be allowed to own land.
Taiwan's key Weighted Index closed up 2.14 percent, mostly on a
technical rebound.
	   The key indexes in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia were between
1.5 percent to 2.8 percent higher in early trading.

Tokyo stocks soar 6 percent higher, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices finished sharply higher
Wednesday on optimism Japan was moving ahead with plans to address
its ailing banking system and boost economic growth. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
803.97 points, or 6.17 percent, closing the day's trading at
13,825.61. The average gained 73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, on
Tuesday.
	   The dollar bought 130.06 yen in mid-afternoon, down 2.80 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late overnight level
of 130.85 yen in New York.
	   On the stock market, bank shares were among the biggest gainers
amid prospects that legislation to allow the government to use
public funds to recapitalize weak but viable banks will be approved
during the current extended parliamentary session.
	   The ruling party submitted a bill to Parliament on Wednesday
that incorporated many of the political opposition's proposals,
making quick passage likely.
	   The bank bill includes provisions that would allow for the
government to inject funds to both weak and healthy banks as a
means of easing the nation's credit crunch and to help strong
lenders take over failed institutions.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened after
Japan's ruling party promised to push for expansion and early
passage of an economic stimulus package first announced in August.
	   The original package called for a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 54
billion) tax cut and a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 77 billion) public
spending program.
	   Making a rare comment on the market, Japan's Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi said he was closely watching current dollar-yen
exchange-rate movements.
	   ``If a stronger yen means Japan's fundamentals are being
positively evaluated, that's good news, but if it's speculation it
is a problem. I'm watching it closely,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Finance Ministry's
international bureau, praised what he called a correction in the
yen's weakness.
	   Market players were also encouraged by growing optimism the
government would move quickly to enact a plan to use public money
to shore up ailing banks.
	   Also affecting the dollar was speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve may move to cut interest rates further in line with
imminent moves by European central banks, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent, to 1,046.98. On
Tuesday, the TOPIX edged up 0.26 points, or 0.03 percent.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
16.74 points _ or 0.2 percent _ to 7,742.98 after shedding an early
154-point gain and briefly dipping into negative territory.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.765 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.725
percent, driving its price down to 109.33 yen from 109.73 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in
Tokyo Wednesday to begin four days of talks on new economic aid,
North Korea's missile program and how to ease lingering animosities
over Japan's brutal rule of Korea more than 50 years ago.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to offer a
dlrs 3 billion package of loans to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid package for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Obuchi's talks with Kim will also touch on the more symbolic but
sensitive issue of Tokyo's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from
1910-1945.
	   Japanese leaders want to offer a formal apology that is sincere
enough to appease smoldering Korean resentment without offending
conservatives in Japan.
	   The issue has come up during each of the nine previous visits by
Korean presidents since the war.
	   But it has a new urgency now as Tokyo hopes to pave the way for
Emperor Akihito to attend ceremonies in South Korea when the two
nations jointly host the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. No
Japanese emperor has visited South Korea.
	   Kim arrived for the official outdoor welcoming ceremony at the
state guesthouse amid overcast skies, riding in a black limousine
with Akihito amid tight security. Some 16,000 police officers were
mobilized in the Tokyo area for the visit.
	   The national anthems of the two nations were played before the
two men, accompanied by their wives, entered the guesthouse.
	   According to Japan's Yomiuri newspaper, Kim and Obuchi will
endorse guidelines for a ``new partnership,'' which will include a
strong apology by Tokyo for the Japanese colonization.
	   The guidelines are also expected to include a promise by Kim to
lift restrictions on Japanese culture in South Korea, where
Japanese movies are still banned.
	   ``As co-travelers of the 21st century, the two countries must
work closely together for peace in Asia and the world,'' Kim said
before boarding a special plane at Seoul's Sungnam airport.
	   The two leaders will also discuss last month's rocket launch by
North Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the
North has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   On Thursday, Kim and Obuchi are expected to sign a number of
agreements, including one promising the new loans by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to help small businesses in South
Korea.
	   In May, the government-run bank lent dlrs 1 billion to South
Korean companies. Seoul is currently struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.

Indonesian president calls on opposition figure to maintain peace
</HEADLINE>
at gathering

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie has reportedly
called on prominent opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri to
ensure that a planned gathering of her supporters on the tourist
island of Bali this week remains peaceful.
	   Government officials have said they feared that the potential
for violence might harm Bali's image as a safe tourist destination.
	   Thousands of supporters of Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, are expected to attend the congress of
her faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party, PDI, from Thursday
to Saturday.
	   Many are coming from the neighboring main island of Java, which
was badly hit by riots in May and subsequent unrest.
	   ``(Habibie) has conveyed to Megawati that she is responsible for
security because Bali is the gateway for Indonesian tourism,'' The
Jakarta Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Bali Governor Dewa Made
Beratha as saying after a meeting with the president.
	   The official Antara news agency has said about 3,000 police and
military along with 1,000 civilian security guards will be deployed
on the ``Island of the Gods,'' a major source of foreign exchange
for crisis-ridden Indonesia.

REport: Rioting youths attack Singapore brothels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 20 rioting Singapore youths went on a
rampage, vandalizing four brothels in an apparent extortion racket,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Armed with wooden poles, short blades and sledgehammers, the
youths struck just after midnight Monday morning, The Straits Times
said.
	   No one was hurt in the highly organized attack, during which the
youths marched down the street in four columns, ``waving their
weapons in the air and chanting ... songs and vulgar words,''
according to brothel owner William Koh.
	   ``They just ran in and started smashing the glass windows,''
brothel caretaker Johnny Sim was quoted as saying in the report.
``There were some customers in my brothel. People were screaming in
panic and trying to get out of the way.''
	   Singapore police said they were investigating the incident.
	   ``No effort will be spared to catch those responsible for the
attacks,'' police spokesman Ng Guat Heng was quoted as saying.
	   Despite living in the red-light district, several residents of
the neighborhood told the newspaper that this was the first such
incident to occur there.
	   Taiwanese expatriate Robert Chang told the newspaper that ``this
is the first time we had such a Macau-style gangland attack'' in
the area.
	   The Portuguese colony of Macau, near Hong Kong, has been hit by
gang-related violence.
	   Under Singapore's strict gangster laws, anyone convicted of
rioting with dangerous weapons faces a maximum punishment of seven
years in jail and caning.

Economist: Australia likely to avert recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's growth is likely to grind
down in the coming year but a recession should be averted, Mark
Rider, chief economist at Warburg Dillon Read, said Wednesday.
	   Speaking at a briefing by the investment brokerage firm, Rider
said the global economy would ``flirt with recession'' but was
likely to avoid a contraction.
	   ``While we're looking at (Australian) growth coming down to a
low point of 2 percent over the coming year, we still feel that
with the current low level of interest rates and the adjustment
we've seen in the exchange rate, that will help buffer the economy
and limit the extent and we don't feel at this stage the economy
will go into recession,'' he said.
	   ``Probably whether that happens is if we get a much more
significant deterioration in the global economy,'' he added.
	   Warburg Dillon Read has forecast global growth of 1.3 percent in
calendar 1999.
	   By the June quarter next year the global economy will have
stalled, Rider said, but the U.S. Federal Reserve's easing of
monetary policy last week should ``underwrite U.S. growth'' and
stave off world recession.
	   ``The U.S. and Europe will hold things together,'' he said.
	   In Asia, with the exception of China and Taiwan, growth would be
very slow to come through, although the region's downturn should
have bottomed.
	   ``The risk is that the turning point is being pushed out further
and further,'' Rider said.

Police shoot dead suspected serial killers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police in southern India shot dead two
brothers suspected in a series of murders and rapes, saying they
tried to escape while being driven to court, police said Wednesday.
	   An escort of seven policemen were driving Kommiri Gundala Gopal,
38, and Kommiri Subramaniam, 33, to court on Tuesday when the van
they were traveling in skidded and overturned in a wooded area near
Tirupati, a town 1,625 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of the Indian
capital New Delhi, police said. The two brothers took advantage of
the confusion, snatched a revolver from a policeman and fired on
them.
	   ``They were asked to surrender but when they opened fire, the
police also fired at them, killing them on the spot,'' said K.S.
Jayachandra, inspector general of police.
	   Police have ordered an inquiry. The policemen escorting the two
had bruises but no bullet injuries.
	   The suspects were being taken to court because police had
requested they be held in jail until investigations were complete.
	   They had been arrested on the basis of finger prints recovered
from the scenes of the crimes.
	   The brothers were accused of killing 42 people and raping 12
women in Andhra Pradesh state and in the border districts of
neighboring Tamil Nadu state. Southern Indians traditionally use
their family name first.
	   Police said the two usually killed their victims by hitting them
on the head with wooden stumps or iron rods. The women were raped
and then killed.
	   The brothers were arrested in July after a manhunt involving
more than 1,000 policemen.

Official blames speculators for record devaluation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the dollar worth more than four Israeli
shekels (NIS) for the first time, Israel's finance minister on
Wednesday hinted at a plot to undermine the Israeli currency.
	   ``There are clearly certain parties purchasing foreign currency
and driving the shekel down,'' Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said
after the Israeli currency plunged 2.7 percent to a record low
Tuesday.
	   Interviewed on Israel radio, Neeman refused to name the parties,
but hinted in the direction of Israel's banks looking for quick
profits.
	   Banner headlines on the front pages of Israeli newspapers
knocked news of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
shuttle diplomacy mission into second place. The afternoon daily
Maariv ran a black, white and yellow headline across the page that
read simply, ``$1  &QC;  NIS 4.01.''
	   Reacting quickly, many Israeli merchants raised prices,
explaining that their imported merchandise is linked to the dollar
exchange rate. The shekel has lost 13 percent of its value against
the dollar since the beginning of the year.
	   This development could endanger the Israeli government's
proudest economic achievement, reducing the annual inflation rate
to single figures. High interest rates and government budget cuts
have slowed the Israeli economy, reducing inflation, but also
contributing to a 9.2 percent unemployment rate, high for Israel.
Israeli analysts say the local economy is in recession.
	   Speaking from Washington, where he is attending the conference
of the International Monetary Fund, Neeman predicted that the
shekel devaluation would be reversed when the unnamed speculators
decide to take profits. ``If dollars are bought, they will also be
sold,'' he said, ``it's a market of supply and demand.''
	   He called on Israel's public to remain calm and refrain from a
``frenzy'' of purchases as a hedge against inflation.
	   Neeman insisted that Israel remains an ``island of stability''
in a world of economic ``upheaval.''

China closes down major trust and investment firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central bank has ordered the closure of
debt-swamped Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., an
investment arm of southern Guangdong province, bank officials said
Wednesday.
	   The People's Bank of China has taken steps to entrust the debt
and assets of the firm, known as Gitic, to other financial
institutions, said a bank official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The closure appears to be part of an industry-wide crackdown by
financial regulators on China's trust and investment companies,
which are known for running up high debts on the interbank market,
where borrowers take loans from a second party to pay existing
debt.
	   Recent credit reviews indicated the firm would not be able to
repay its mounting debts.
	   ``The company can't pay for its maturing debts,'' an executive
in Gitic's general manager's office told Dow Jones Newswires. While
he declined to specify the amount of debt, the Gitic executive, who
also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the central bank would
``protect the legal rights of debt holders.''
	   In a related move, Moody's Investors Service said it placed the
ratings of Gitic on review for possible downgrade following reports
of the company's closure.
	   The ratings agency said the review reflected ``the critical
financial weaknesses of Gitic, including its deeply impaired asset
quality.''
	   The Guangdong-based company also had a unit listed on the Hong
Kong stock exchange, Gitic Enterprises Ltd. A diversified
conglomerate, it reported an 89 percent drop in net profits in the
first half of the year.
	   According to BasiSfield, a Hong Kong-based debt market database,
Gitic has outstanding foreign currency debt totaling about US dlrs
1.38 billion, including project finance facilities and debt
guarantees provided to affiliated companies.
	   That total includes a U.S. dlrs 200.0 million 20-year rule 144a
bond issued by Gitic in 1996 and a US dlrs 150.0 million 10-year
bond issued by the company in 1993.
	   Zhu Min, an economic adviser to the Bank of China's president,
said the closure of Gitic was a preemptive step taken to ensure the
Chinese financial sector avoids the pitfalls Asian neighbors have
stumbled into.
	   ``I think it's a healthy development and a good thing to
maintain stability,'' Zhu said.
	   China has so far managed to block the regional turmoil from
undoing its own financial system - largely by preventing outflows
of capital through the limited convertibility of its currency.
	   However, many of China's banks and corporations suffer from the
same plight of its neighbors: high levels of non-performing loans
coupled with speculative investments.

New pro-Anwar rally held as Mahathir refuses to appoint deputy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Minor editing in lede paragraph &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Wednesday he would not appoint a replacement for Anwar Ibrahim
as anti-government protests broke out again with thousands
demanding justice for his ousted, jailed deputy.
	   After chairing a meeting of his United Malays National
Organization Party until early hours, Mahathir said he would wait
to fill Anwar's seat until the party's internal election in 1999.
	   Last week, Mahathir, 72, said he could ``drop dead'' at any
time, fueling speculation that he was about to announce a deputy
after consulting his party's supreme council.
	   ``This is not a matter discussed by the party. That is my
prerogative. That is my responsibility and I do not need to refer
to anyone,'' Mahathir told reporters after the meeting at party
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
	   As the meeting was going on, a crowd of about 10,000 people
gathered late Tuesday night in the eastern state of Pahang for an
anti-government rally organized by a new opposition coalition, the
Malaysian Justice Movement.
	   Thousands of postcards addressed to the prime minister were
circulated. The cards demanded Mahathir hold a general election or
step down.
	   The cards also urged Mahathir to repeal the Internal Security
Act, a draconian law that allows for imprisonment without trial,
said an organizer, Shamsul Maarif Ismail.
	   Anwar, Malaysia's former deputy premier, was arrested under the
ISA on Sept. 20 for organizing a huge anti-Mahathir rally. He is
also charged on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sexual acts for
which he will be tried beginning Nov. 2.
	   Tuesday's rally took place at the regional headquarters of the
Islamic opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia or PAS which is part of
the new coalition of three opposition parties and more than a dozen
non-governmental organizations.
	   It was the first rally after a week of calm following several
anti-government street demonstrations in the capital that riot
police dispersed with tear gas and water cannons.
	   Shamsul said the rally was the beginning of a nationwide
roadshow for wide-scale lobbying against the ISA.
	   Anwar's arrest came after two weeks of nationwide rallies
resounding with calls for government reform and Mahathir's
resignation.
	   Mahathir had groomed Anwar as his heir for five years, but fired
him abruptly, saying he was morally unfit to lead. The two had
differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared
the deputy was a threat to his 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir also said Wednesday the party had fired 10 UMNO members
for their anti-party activities, an obvious reference to their bias
in favor of Anwar.
	   The Malaysian leader also reacted angrily at the growing
condemnation by world leaders to the treatment Anwar is receiving
in captivity.
	   ``If we mind our own business, it will be better for
everybody,'' he said.
	   Soon after Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises
on his arm and neck, condemnation poured in from many of Malaysia's
neighbors and Western nations.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie canceled a scheduled visit to
Malaysia, but said he might still attend the November meeting of
leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The United States said it would downgrade President Clinton's
scheduled visit to Kuala Lumpur for the APEC summit next month.

exchange rate. The shekel has lost 13 percent of its value against
the dollar since the beginning of the year.
	   This development could endanger the Israeli government's
proudest economic achievement, reducing the annual inflation rate
to single figures. High interest rates and government budget cuts
have slowed the Israeli economy, reducing inflation, but also
contributing to a 9.2 percent unemployment rate, high for Israel.
Israeli analysts say the local economy is in recession.
	   Speaking from Washington, where he is attending the conference
of the International Monetary Fund, Neeman predicted that the
shekel devaluation would be reversed when the unnamed speculators
decide to take profits.
	   ``If dollars are bought, they will also be sold,'' he said,
``It's a market of supply and demand.''
	   He called on Israel's public to remain calm and refrain from a
``frenzy'' of purchases as a hedge against inflation.
	   Neeman insisted that Israel remains an ``island of stability''
in a world of economic ''upheaval.''

South Korean president arrives in Tokyo for talks

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in
Tokyo Wednesday to begin four days of talks on new economic aid,
North Korea's missile program and how to ease lingering animosities
over Japan's brutal rule of Korea more than 50 years ago.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to offer a
dlrs 3 billion package of loans to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid package for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Obuchi's talks with Kim will also touch on the more symbolic but
sensitive issue of Tokyo's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from
1910-1945.
	   Japanese leaders want to offer a formal apology that is sincere
enough to appease smoldering Korean resentment without offending
conservatives in Japan.
	   The issue has come up during each of the nine previous visits by
Korean presidents since the war.
	   But it has a new urgency now as Tokyo hopes to pave the way for
Emperor Akihito to attend ceremonies in South Korea when the two
nations jointly stage the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. No
Japanese emperor has visited South Korea.
	   Kim arrived for the official outdoor welcoming ceremony at the
state guesthouse under overcast skies and amid tight security. Some
16,000 police officers were mobilized in the Tokyo area for the
visit.
	   Later, Kim boarded a black limousine to ride to the Imperial
Palace with Akihito. The two men, accompanied by their wives,
entered the palace's main building as a marching band played the
South Korean national anthem.
	   According to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri, Kim and Obuchi will
endorse guidelines for a ``new partnership'' when they meet
Thursday, which will include a strong apology by Tokyo for Japan's
colonial rule.
	   The guidelines are also expected to include a promise by Kim to
lift restrictions on Japanese culture in South Korea, where
Japanese movies are still banned.
	   ``As co-travelers of the 21st century, the two countries must
work closely together for peace in Asia and the world,'' Kim said
before boarding a special plane at Seoul's Sungnam airport.
	   The two leaders will also discuss last month's rocket launch by
North Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the
North has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   Kim and Obuchi are expected to sign a number of agreements,
including one promising the new loans by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan to help small businesses in South Korea.
	   In May, the government-run bank lent dlrs 1 billion to South
Korean companies. Seoul is currently struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.

Moody's may downgrade rating of Norinchukin Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday it has
placed under review for possible downgrading its rating of another
major Japanese financial institution, the Norinchukin Bank.
	   Moody's placed under review Norinchukin's single-A1 long-term
deposit and debt rating, its A1 issuer rating and the D-plus bank
financial strength rating.
	   The bank's Prime-1 short-term debt rating was not affected by
the review, Moody's said.
	   The review was prompted by Moody's concerns that political
instability may affect the degree of the government support
expected for Norinchukin and its affiliated entities of the
agricultural cooperative credit system.
	   Norinchukin also has sizable exposures to the troubled
non-banking sector, Moody's said.
	   Japan is stuck in its worst recession since World War II, and
its banks are saddled with massive bad loans.
	   Political parties have been arguing for months over what role
the government should play to ease the crisis, and analysts fear
their action may be too little, too late.
	   Moody's ratings are an assessment of a bank's ability to pay
back its debt and deposits. A lower rating is associated with
higher risk for investors and depositors.

Taiwan's ruling Nationalists move into controversial office

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Amid angry protests, Taiwan's ruling
Nationalists finally moved into their gleaming new headquarters
Wednesday after 18 months of delays caused by haggling over
building codes and accusations of partisanship.
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who is also the 104-year-old party's
chairman, inaugurated the 12-story building in the center of
Taipei's administrative district with popping champagne corks and a
campaign rally for year-end elections.
	   Outside, chants of protesters from opposition groups merged with
the boom of drums and clash of cymbals of the lion dancers hired
for the celebration.
	   ``This land is the property of the people. The Nationalists
stole it and (Taipei Mayor) Chen Shui-bian let them get away with
it,'' Kao Cheng-yen, an environmental activist and leader of the
tiny Green Party, told reporters as he was dragged away by police.
	   Kao and other protesters from the Greens, the New Party and the
Taiwan Independence Party claim the Nationalists illegally occupied
the land after Japanese rule ended in 1945, and acquired it later
at an artificially low price.
	   Taipei Mayor Chen, who represents the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, initially refused to issue the building use
permits, claiming that codes required screening by a special review
board. The Nationalists said the shining glass and marble structure
met all legal requirements, and accused Chen of playing politics.
	   The sides reached an agreement this summer under which the
Nationalists donated part of the site to the city, allegedly in
return for helping Chen solve other zoning problems.
	   Though generally popular, Chen faces a tough challenge from
Nationalist candidate and former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou in
elections Dec. 5.
	   The Nationalists are considered the world's richest political
party, with an estimated U.S. dlrs 3 billion in assets.

Japan's ruling party submits bank crisis bill to Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, comments on LTCB; ADDS byline
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Pres Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party submitted a bill on Wednesday
to allow the government to use public money to bail out ailing
banks, sending stock prices soaring in a rush of optimism that the
government was finally beginning to act.
	   Japanese banks, many of them among the world's largest, are
desperately in need of fresh capital to restore reserves lost from
writing off bad loans and to buffer them against possible further
losses.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party have been under intense pressure from world leaders to move
more aggressively to tackle the bad-loan crisis threatening the
nation's banks and contributing to Japan's worsening recession.
	   The bill submitted Wednesday would establish a mechanism for
injecting such capital into the debt-ridden banks. It includes
provisions allowing the government to provide funds to both weak
and healthy banks as a means for easing the nation's credit crunch
and to help strong lenders take over failed institutions.
	   Tokyo's benchmark stock average soared on hopes the laws will be
approved soon. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
803.97 points, or 6.17 percent, to close trading at 13,825.61.
	   The current extraordinary session of Parliament, originally
scheduled to end Wednesday, was expected to be extended for nine
days to give lawmakers time to deliberate the proposal.
	   But the bill was likely to clear Parliament quickly after two
opposition groups dropped their objections to the plan Tuesday.
	   Also Wednesday, a top administration spokesman said the
government will not necessarily push for the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan to merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
	   The comment by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was a
reversal of the policy so far of encouraging the two banks to
merge.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest lenders, has
been plagued by speculation it may collapse under the weight of bad
debts, and has been at the center of the banking crisis debate.
	   Shares of LTCB, finished at 12 yen (9 cents) per share on
Wednesday, unchanged from the previous all-time low recorded on
Tuesday.

Paul picked at fly-half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Bradford's Robbie Paul has been
picked ahead of Gene Ngamu as New Zealand fly-half for Friday's
second rugby league test against Australia.
	   Paul became available for selection when his club team missed
out on the finals in England. New Zealand, which holds a 1-0 lead
in the three-test series, has nine Auckland Warriors in the 17-man
squad.
	   Rookie forwards Nathan Cayless and Tony Puletua will make their
international debuts for the Kiwis on Friday.
	   Cayless, the Parramatta prop, and Penrith backrower Puletua were
both selected on the interchange bench along with Tony Iro and
Ngamu. The side will be captained by Matthew Ridge.
	   New Zealand coach Frank Endacott's career is in doubt following
the sale of the Warriors and speculation that he will be sacked by
the club's new owners. Endacott's predicament, and the Kiwis'
failure to win a series against Australia in 45 years, have been
cited as the main motivating factors for New Zealand ahead of the
match.

Twenty Tamil rebels killed in clashes in northern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Twenty Tamil rebels were killed in
sporadic fighting with government troops in northern Sri Lanka,
where at least 1,200 people died last week in the biggest battle in
two years, officials said Wednesday.
	   Soldiers on patrol north of the town of Mankulam clashed Tuesday
with a group of guerrillas and killed 18 of them without suffering
any losses, said Major Kumar Dewage, a military spokesman.
	   Two other guerrillas were killed Tuesday in separate fighting in
the nearby Trincomalee district, Dewage said.
	   The rebels did not immediately comment on the incidents.
	   The military captured Mankulam on Sept. 29, two days after
rebels took the nearby town of Kilinochchi. The weeklong savage
fighting killed 1,200 combatants on all sides.
	   Kilinochchi, 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of the capital,
Colombo, and Mankulam, 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of
Kilinochchi, are along a strategic highway that links the isolated
military-controlled northern town of Jaffna, with the government
held south of the Indian Ocean island. The military has wrested
two-thirds of it from the rebels since starting the highway
offensive in May 1997.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.

Millions expected to march against Yeltsin across Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs on protests in eastern Russia. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians frustrated by the country's deep economic
recession took to the streets in nationwide protests Wednesday that
were expected to be among the largest mass rallies in recent years.
	   Russians have been enduring their economic crisis stoically,
with few public outbursts against President Boris Yeltsin's
government, which has been unable to halt an economic decline
that's ravaged the country for most of this decade.
	   But hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people were
likely to take part in rallies across the country organized by
trade unions, the Communist Party and other critics of Yeltsin.
	   ``Look at the hole the Russian people have fallen into. Look at
the people on their knees,'' Marina Rubintsina, a 19-year-old
student, told demonstrators in the eastern port city of
Vladivostok. ``We don't have a future.''
	   Vladivostok is the largest city on Russia's east coast, but the
rally on the main square drew only about 3,000 people, according to
police. Organizers put the number at 6,000. By either count, it was
far short of expectations.
	   The marchers included union workers, pensioners, students and
members of widely divergent political factions. Some carried photos
of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, while others hoisted flags from
Russia's czarist era. Many carried anti-government banners. ``Stop
the genocide of the Russian people,'' read one.
	   ``We are on the crest of a wave that will roll over the country
and break over the walls of the Kremlin,'' Vladimir Grishukov, a
Communist member of parliament, told the crowd.
	   However, there were no reports of any unrest early in the day.
	   On the eve of the protests, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made
a nationally televised appeal to Russians to remain calm, both
during the demonstrations and for the duration of the economic
crisis.
	   Primakov promised there would be no food shortages this winter
and said the government would start paying overdue wages and
pensions.
	   ``The populace will be fully provided with vegetables, fruit and
potatoes,'' Primakov said. ``I appeal to everyone not to rock our
common boat in today's too-turbulent sea.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov predicted as many as 40
million of Russia's 148 million people could take part in
Wednesday's protests, but others say it will be closer to the
nearly 2 million people who participated in a similar protest in
March 1997.
	   Russia's economic conditions have deteriorated considerably
since then, but the protest organizers may have hurt themselves by
sending out mixed messages.
	   The unions want to focus on the economy, which is expected to
shrink by more than 5 percent this year. Millions of workers get
paid months late, and inflation now is forecast at 200 percent.
	   The Communists, meanwhile, have been calling for Yeltsin's
resignation and see the protests as a way to further weaken the
president, who still has two years left in his term.
	   But the Communists find themselves in a bit of an awkward
position because several of their members are playing key roles in
Primakov's new government.
	   Yeltsin has maintained an extremely low profile since the
economic crisis struck, spending most of his time at a presidential
residence on the western outskirts of Moscow.
	   The Communists and the unions have pledged that the protests
will be peaceful. Nonetheless, police and interior troops have been
put on alert throughout Russia.
	   More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry troops
are being deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior
Ministry official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Moscow city officials have said the demonstration in the capital
could draw up to 150,000 people, who will march to the edge of Red
Square.

Chipper: Braves need to break out of business-like approach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Chipper Jones is looking for a change in the
Atlanta Braves this October.
	   Not on the mound or in the batter's box, but in the dugout.
	   ``I think this business-type attitude hasn't gotten the job done
the last couple of years,'' the third baseman said.
	   ``I fully expect every time we do something good, for guys to
get off the bench,'' he said. ``I think the team needs to thrive
upon those situations and let off a little steam.''
	   The Braves will get their chance Wednesday night _ provided the
rain in the forecast holds off _ when they take on the San Diego
Padres in Game 1 of the NL championship series.
	   The Braves are built for success over the long haul of the
regular season _ seven straight trips to the NLCS prove that _ but
many have wondered whether they are lacking the emotional element
that some say is necessary to win it all.
	   Pitching and hitting and fielding are no problem, as 106
victories this year attest. But, as only one World Series
championship may indicate to their fans and opponents, perhaps
these Braves teams have been minus one key ingredient.
	   ``You have to have that extra emotion at this time of year,''
said San Diego's Jim Leyritz, a postseason hero with six home runs
in 36 at-bats.
	   ``Maybe that extra edge is what's missing sometimes,'' he said.
``They have been here before, but they haven't won the World Series
that many times.''
	   The Padres, in the NLCS for the first time since 1984, clearly
were enjoying themselves as they worked out Tuesday at Turner
Field.
	   Andy Ashby hooted after outjumping Wally Joyner for a fly.
Leyritz shouted when he launched a drive to left. Carlos Hernandez
danced and did his best ``Rocky'' imitation.
	   Before the Padres' practice, the Braves took their turn.
	   Greg Maddux neatly dropped a bunt down the third-base line.
Keith Lockhart worked on his double-play pivot. Walt Weiss
practiced his hit-and-run swing.
	   Mostly in silence, by the way.
	   ``There's no doubt there's a lot of emotion on our team,''
Braves general manager John Schuerholz said. ``I just think players
handle emotions in different ways. Some wear it on their sleeves,
some don't.''
	   Unlike some clubs that look to add rah-rah types _ the Dodgers
wanted Kirk Gibson for his attitude as much as his ability for the
1988 season _ the Braves don't search in that direction.
	   ``We're not looking for cheerleaders,'' Schuerholz said.
	   And, of course, it takes more than talk to win games. Yet listen
to Tony Gwynn describe the Padres' mental state right now: ``We're
coming in euphoric, man.''
	   Certainly no one would think of ``euphoric'' when mentioning the
Braves. ``Efficient'' and ``effective,'' for sure, but not
``euphoric.''
	   Ashby is actually worried about getting too enthused for his
start in the opener.
	   ``The main thing for me is just control my emotions and my
excitement to a point where I can go out and do my job,'' said
Ashby, 2-0 against Atlanta this year. ``But it's a great feeling,
and there's nothing like it.''
	   The Padres partied for 90 minutes after beating Houston in the
first round of the NL playoffs, parading around the field at San
Diego while pitcher Kevin Brown and others spoke to the fans on the
public-address system.
	   The Braves also celebrated with champagne after their
first-round win over Chicago, showing more spirit than in recent
years. John Smoltz, 2-0 against the Padres this year going into his
start in Game 1, said there was a reason.
	   ``We changed our roster pretty dramatically in the offseason. We
have a lot of guys that have not been through this,'' he said.
``It's going to create more excitement for them, for us.
	   ``Some guys have played their whole lives and have not gotten
here,'' he said. ``I think nine or 10 guys are new to this, and
that brings new life and blood to what you're going through.''
	   Braves manager Bobby Cox contends there's plenty of emotion on
his team, even if it doesn't always show. Asked whether Atlanta has
anyone who gets as fired up as Leyritz, he answered: ``Twenty-five
guys on our side.''

Myanmar government arrests 54, accuses Vatican of inciting unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government said
Wednesday it had arrested 54 people for staging anti-government
demonstrations and accused groups funded by the Vatican, the U.S.
government and financier George Soros of inciting unrest.
	   Of the 54 arrested, 23 were members of the National League for
Democracy, the political party of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, and included one elected member of parliament.
	   ``In July and August of this year, the NLD has stepped up its
confrontational activities and attempted to create unrest and
upheaval,'' Col. Thein Swe, a high-ranking military intelligence
officer, said at a news conference.
	   The 54 people were arrested for participating in brief
``hit-and-run'' street demonstrations calling for an end to
military rule in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   More than 1,000 people joined in the first, near Yangon
University on Aug. 24. The second erupted near the Sule Pagoda in
downtown Yangon on Sept. 22.
	   Thein Swe said the dissidents instigated unrest in collaboration
with exiled Myanmar students in Thailand who are backed financially
by the Vatican-based Jesuit Refugee Services, the U.S.
government-funded National Endowment for Democracy, and the Open
Society Institute of billionaire George Soros.
	   The 54 were not among the 967 members of the opposition detained
by the government since May to prevent the NLD from convening the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly, but
the military has refused to allow it to meet. The 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize winner was under six years of house arrest at the time of the
election.
	   Gen. Kyaw Win, the deputy chief of intelligence, told the news
conference that the 967 were not in fact detained, but had been
invited to government guest houses for discussions.
	   Asked when they would be invited to return home, he said it
depended upon the activities of the NLD.
	   Kyaw Win, who was a student activist in the 1960s, answers
directly to intelligence chief Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the military
government's most powerful leaders. He insisted the military had
dealt gently with the NLD by not sending its members to prison or
outlawing the party.
	   ``You remove a thorn with a needle, not an ax,'' he said.
``However, if the NLD accelerates its confrontational tactics to a
certain extent, the government will have to act in the interest of
the people and the country.''
	   Kyaw Win dismissed condemnations heaped upon the military by
many Western governments for the mass detentions of opposition
members and other human rights abuses.
	   ``We are a military government trying for the establishment of a
democratic country,'' he said. ``You cannot judge us by the
standards of fully developed democratic countries.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Arguing Italy needs stability, Premier Romano Prodi
went before Parliament Wednesday, hoping to win over a few wavering
lawmakers to ensure survival of a government that already is
Italy's second-most enduring in a half-century.

Yankees 7, Indians 2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes.
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stomping the Cleveland Indians wasn't enough for
David Wells and the New York Yankees.
	   They wanted to bury them, break their spirit, send a message
that Cleveland's upset win last year won't happen again.
	   So even after pitching 8 1-3 shutout innings in Tuesday night's
7-2 win in the series opener, it wasn't enough for Wells, who gave
up a two-run homer Manny Ramirez in the ninth.
	   Wells, after all, knows something about perfection.
	   ``I was geared tonight. I really wanted this,'' Wells said.
``You win the first game, it can set a tone.''
	   The tone the Yankees are setting is of a train whistle _ on a
train steaming over everything in sight. They blew out Jaret Wright
with a five-run first inning that left a row of blank, confused
faces in the Indians' dugout.
	   And it doesn't get any easier for Cleveland, which has fallen
behind 1-0 in a postseason series for the eighth straight time.
	   David Cone, who tied for the AL lead in wins at 20-7, was
scheduled to pitch in Yankee Stadium's famous October twilight
shadows Wednesday against the Indians' Charles Nagy.
	   ``Most teams have one No. 1 starter,'' Indians manager Mike
Hargrove lamented. ``The Yankees are a little more blessed than
others.''
	   Wells, who pitched a perfect game against Minnesota on May 17,
had 23 consecutive shutout innings before Ramirez's 12th postseason
homer. After manager Joe Torre took Wells out of the game, the
Boomer was so angry he sent his glove slamming into the dugout
telephone on his way to the clubhouse.
	   ``I just made a pitch that was stupid and left it down the
middle,'' he said.
	   OK, but what about the 99 percent of the game the Yankees'
dominated?
	   After losing to Cleveland in the first round last year, some of
the Yankees thought a message needed to be sent _ especially to
Wright, who beat them twice in last year's five-series. And who
broke a bone in Luis Sojo's hand with a spring training pitch. And
who hit Paul O'Neill with a pitch during the season.
	   ``If he gets into a rhythm, he's tough to beat,'' Yankees
shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``We wanted to jump on him early and
get the crowd into the game.''
	   Singles by Chuck Knoblauch, Jeter and O'Neill put the Yankees
ahead and brought pitching coach Mark Wiley out to the mound.
	   An RBI single by Bernie Williams made it 2-0 and brought action
in the bullpen Tino Martinez bounced into a fielder's choice and
Tim Raines struck out, but Wright threw a run-scoring wild pitch,
walked Shane Spencer, then left after Jorge Posada singled in
another run. Scott Brosius singled in run off Chad Ogea for a 5-0
lead.
	   ``I didn't want to have it snowball on me,'' said Wright, who
gave up a pair of three-run homers in the Game 1 loss to Boston
last week. ``Obviously, it did.''
	   Of Wright's 36 pitches, just 18 were strikes. The Yankees swung
and missed just twice against him.
	   ``That's a letdown for the other team,'' Torre said. ``When you
knock a starter out in the first inning, that's a big thing for
us.''
	   Posada piled it on with a homer leading off the sixth. O'Neill
and Williams chased Ogea with consecutive doubles opening the
seventh.
	   By then the crowd had thinned out, no doubt tired from a night
of cheering that began when Charisse Strawberry, the wife of
stricken outfielder Darryl Strawberry, bounced the ceremonial first
pitch.
	   Wright's pitches weren't much better.
	   ``I don't know why have so much trouble in the first game of a
series,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said.
	   This year, everyone's had trouble with the Yankees, who have won
four straight in the postseason and a season-high 11 in a row
overall.
	   With their 118th win this year, the Yankees matched the major
league record set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who won 116 in the
regular season and two more in the World Series.
	   ``The message to the fans was unbelievable,'' Wells said. ``They
deserve that because they're such dedicated fans. They hold grudges
more than we hold grudges.''

Strawberry surely loved Yankees' big first inning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry needs his rest these days, and
the New York Yankees made sure he got to sleep early.
	   With Strawberry watching from his hospital bed after undergoing
surgery this past weekend to remove a cancerous tumor in his colon,
New York scored five runs in the first inning Tuesday night in a
7-2 rout over the Cleveland Indians in the opener of the AL
championship series.
	   No. 39 was on everyone's mind _ and just about everyone's cap _
in Yankee Stadium. Before the game, Strawberry's wife, Charisse,
threw out the ceremonial first pitch after briefing the media on
her husband's improving condition.
	   ``He's feeling upbeat,'' she said. ``His spirits are up, he's a
little weak and hungry. Otherwise, he looks real good.''
	   Several of Strawberry's teammates and New York owner George
Steinbrenner have visited him in the past few days at Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital, and on Tuesday he also received flowers from
Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan.
	   Charisse Strawberry said the support she and her husband have
received has been tremendous.
	   ``It's meant more than I can even say in words,'' she said.
``Even though Darryl isn't here, his heart and spirit are here. And
he's flattered and overwhelmed by the support.''
	   She said Strawberry should be able to go home Saturday or
Sunday. Asked if he wanted to come to Yankee Stadium for a game
after that, she said: ``I would love it. I guess he would, too.''
	   ``He wants the guys to `go get 'em,' as he would say,'' she
said.
	   She was escorted to the mound by pitcher David Cone, and was
accompanied by two of their children, 4-year-old Jordan and
3-year-old Jade. When the Yankees were introduced, a picture of
Strawberry appeared on the scoreboard and the crowd responded with
a standing ovation.
	   Her pitch didn't make it over the plate, but the fans reacted as
if it were a perfect strike.
	   She then left to join him at the hospital.
	   Fans taped signs of encouragement for Strawberry on the facade
of the stadium's upper deck.
	   ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' read one. Another said, ``Do it
for Strawberry.'' But perhaps a small white sign said it best: ``We
Love You Darryl.''
	   In addition to the ``Ks'' for each David Wells strikeout, fans
in the upper deck hung No. 39 jerseys _ seven in all.
	   Fans also signed a huge, pinstriped get-well card outside the
stadium.
	   ``Darryl, our hearts are with you,'' said longtime Yankees
public address announcer Bob Sheppard.
	   While the Yankees had No. 39 embroidered on their caps, several
of the Indians also planned to salute the Yankees slugger by
stenciling the number on theirs.
	   ``I've been a big fan of his since I was a kid, and I got a
chance to talk with him this year,'' said Bartolo Colon, who'll
start Game 3 in Cleveland on Friday.

Vietnam railways to cut north-south route by two hours
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City distance, 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Reunification Express is getting a
little closer to its name.
	   Thanks to recent improvements, the Vietnam Railway Authority
said Wednesday it will be cutting the travel time between Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh City by two hours.
	   But the train, also known as the Red Rattler, won't be setting
any rail speed records. It still will take 32 hours for the nearly
1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile) trip.
	   Vu Xuan Hong, chief of the Railway Authority office, said
completion of a semi-automatic signal system between Vinh and Ho
Chi Minh City, along with recent rail and locomotive upgrades, have
made the reduction possible.
	   The Reunification Express has become a symbol of a unified
Vietnam. The first such express train started in 1976, a year after
the fall of Saigon to the communist North.
	   The travel time has been cut from 80 hours at that time to 42
hours in 1992, 38 hours in 1995 and 34 hours since 1996, with more
cuts in sight.
	   Eight railway bridges are being upgraded with loans from the
Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, with 10 smaller
bridges to be upgraded soon.
	   Vietnam Railways transported 10.5 million passengers and more
than 4 million tons of cargo last year, making it the most
important transport network between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Swissair flight from Zurich
with 245 passengers aboard skidded off a runway Wednesday after the
pilot experienced braking problems. Authorities said there were no
reports of damage or injury.
	   The MD-11 jetliner was tugged to its parking area, and then
proceeded to its next destination, Cape Town, said officials at
Johannesburg International Airport.
	   The mishap at 7:20 a.m. (0520 GMT) came after a night of
occasional heavy rain. No details on what might have caused the
braking problem were immediately released.
	   On Sept. 2, a Swissair MD-11 crashed off the coast of Nova
Scotia, killing 229 people.

Chief executive delivers blueprint for economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said Wednesday
that Hong Kong should strengthen ties with the rest of China for
faster recovery from recession, and urged international cooperation
to stop economic crises from spreading.
	   Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into
1999,'' he said in his second policy address.
	   Week's after Tung's inaugural such address last year, Hong Kong
was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming economy
is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, property prices have
fallen by 50 percent, and unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   He said the recovery of Hong Kong's economy relies on ``the
improvement of external environment, moderation of interest rates,
stability of property prices, and increase of public confidence.''
	   Hong Kong also needs to ``strengthen our cooperation with the
mainland in all areas,'' he said. The former British colony, which
rejoined mainland China last July 1, needs to strengthen its role
as the center for raising capital for the country, he added.
	   ``The fact that China has given Hong Kong full support is
something we should take comfort in,'' Tung said.
	   China has repeatedly pledged support for Hong Kong, and
reiterated it would not devalue its currency, the yuan, a stance
that helps to strengthen investors' confidence in the territory.
	   Tung also reiterated that ``the linked exchange rate is to
stay.''
	   The Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar has been under
serious attack by speculators betting the Hong Kong dollar will
sink. To defend the currency link, the government has to keep
interest rates high.
	   Tung also defended the much-criticized government market
intervention in late August, when it spent an estimated 15 percent
of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves to buy stocks and futures
to keep share prices at levels that would punish speculators
betting on a decline.
	   The government later imposed more stringent trading regulations
to make illegal trading and speculation more difficult.
	   Tung said the intervention and new regulations were needed to
counter harmful speculative activities and stabilize interest
rates.
	   He said it was ``not our intention to interfere with market
forces.''
	   Tung also reiterated his call for all countries to cooperate to
tighten regulation to monitor global fund movements.
	   ``Time is ripe for the international community to cooperate,''
he said.

China wants Taiwan talks to promote reunification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A week before a crucial meeting intended to right
derailed ties, China has urged rival Taiwan to agree to
negotiations on reunification, state-run media reported Wednesday.
	   Chen Yunlin, head of the government's top Taiwan policy office,
urged Taiwanese leaders to respond positively to China's proposal
for political negotiations.
	   Chen's comments at a Taiwan policy gathering Tuesday indicate
that the two governments _ heirs to the opposing sides in China's
seven-decade-long civil war _ hold different expectations for next
week's meeting between two elder statesmen.
	   Taiwan wants the Oct. 14 meeting between its top negotiator, Koo
Chen-fu, and China's Wang Daohan to revive talks on practical
issues that Beijing broke off nearly 3 1/2 years ago. By solving
fishing disputes and the like, Taiwanese leaders hope to build
confidence between the estranged governments.
	   China has a more ambitious agenda. Wang's deputy, Tang Shubei,
was quoted Wednesday as saying that political issues need to be
tackled immediately to protect ``the rights and interests of
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.''
	   Tang specifically called for an agreement to end hostilities and
another to inaugurate direct postal, shipping and air services.
Taiwanese fears of being swallowed by the much larger mainland mean
airplanes currently stop off in Macau before traveling on to China;
telephone calls are routed through Japan.
	   Despite the differing visions, Wang and Koo could still manage a
compromise in their first face-to-face meeting in five years.
	   Speaking at the same meeting Chen and Tang addressed, Wang
suggested that the two government-backed bodies that once handled
the now-ruptured talks on practical issues could make preparations
for future ``political dialogue.''
	   China broke off the talks between its Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
in 1995 out of anger over Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's visit to
the United States.
	   Beijing, which views Taiwan as a rebel province, saw Lee's trip
as the firmest evidence he was backing away from eventual
reunification.
	   China and Taiwan have only been ruled by the same government for
four of the last 100 years. The last separation occurred when Mao
Tse-tung's Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the
mainland in 1949.

Albright sees Israeli president before Netanyahu-Arafat meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Wednesday
he is ``a bit more optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking after hosting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright for breakfast.
	   Albright was hold three-way talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat later in the day. This is the second and last day of her
shuttle diplomacy mission, aimed at preparing for a meeting of the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington later this month.
	   Albright is nudging Arafat and Netanyahu toward agreeing on a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank, part of a
series of interim agreements signed by the two sides starting in
1993. Negotiations have been stalemated for a year and a half.
	   U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said significant
progress has been made in Albright's talks so far.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report over
breakfast, but he expected the negotiations to continue this month.
He said reaching an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. ``I
think this must be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must
decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this, too.''
	   The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported Wednesday that the
director of the CIA, George Tenet, arrived here recently to
negotiate a security agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Israel's main demand of the Palestinians is to stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement was
vetoed by Israel.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook extreme
southern Greece on Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of injuries or serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.2, occurred at
9:24 a.m. (0624 GMT) under the sea bed about 200 kilometers (120
miles) southwest of Athens, officials said.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.

U.S. envoy fails to persuade Yugoslav president to end crackdown

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council declared
that the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they areprepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. No decision is expected until Thursday, when NATO
ambassadors meet in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   One source said Kosovo was more important to Milosevic than
Bosnia, which broke away from Milosevic's Serb-dominated government
in 1992, igniting the 3 1-2 -year Bosnia war. That war ended in
1995 when Milosevic accepted a peace agreement Holbrooke
negotiated.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting indicated
that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke told CNN.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims. Holbrooke said Tuesday in Kosovo he'd been
told that the police presence remained strong.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``The stakes are high,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday, warning that unchecked Serb violence could lead to
instability throughout the region. ``The time is now to end the
violence in Kosovo.''
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress that even a
pullback of troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward
off NATO attacks. Airstrikes might be followed by some
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told Associated Press Television News that the complete withdrawal
of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of the question.
	   ``Is there a country in the world that would do so, especially
with an armed rebellion in their hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   Canada said Tuesday it had evacuated all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy. Other countries
are expected to follow suit.

Korean conglomerates balk at industry shakeup

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two top South Korean computer chip
makers said Wednesday they have failed to work out details of a
proposed merger, casting doubt on the government's plan to
restructure the country's bloated conglomerates.
	   Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. and LG Semicon, which control a
combined 17 percent of the world market for computer memory chips,
agreed in September to merge in an industry shakeup aimed at
streamlining South Korea's semiconductor and six other debt-ridden
industries.
	   The two were given until last week to announce details of their
planned merger. But on Wednesday, Hyundai and LG said they needed
more time _ until the end of November _ to settle the dispute over
who takes control of the merged company.
	   ``The government seriously doubts if big businesses will ever
keep their restructuring promises,'' said Chung Hae-joo, a
government policy coordinator in the prime minister's office.
	   ``If they balk at this very beginning stage of restructuring,
the country will never be able to get rid of its huge, overlapping
investments and recover its competitiveness,'' Chung added.
	   Chung declined further comment. But aides to President Kim
Dae-jung have indicated that the government would order
state-controlled banks to call in loans from big businesses
resisting reform.
	   In September, the nation's five biggest conglomerates promised
to merge their key, overlapping subsidiaries in the computer chip,
aerospace, rolling stock, oil, automobile and petrochemical
industries.
	   On Wednesday, three of those deals _ semiconductor, rolling
stock and electric power plants _ were either in doubt or
retracted.
	   In September, Hyundai, Daewoo and Hanjin said they would merge
their rolling stock units. On Wednesday, Hyundai pulled out of the
deal.
	   Hyundai and Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Corp. also
reversed an earlier agreement to consolidate their power plant
businesses.
	   Mostly family-run enterprises known as chaebol, South Korean
conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and
over-diversifying during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds
for the country's current financial crisis.
	   The International Monetary Fund demanded a reorganization of
Korean conglomerates as a condition for a record dlrs 58 billion
bailout in December.
	   A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 cross-funded
subsidiaries.
	   South Korean big businesses have survived repeated government
attempts to reduce their size. They have often announced
restructuring plans but seldom followed through.
	   Hyundai and LG have borrowed heavily to expand their
semiconductor facilities. Hyundai Electronics is dlrs 8.2 billion
in debt, or 9.3 times its equity. LG Semicon's debt totals dlrs 5
billion, six times its equity.

Right Livelihood: the other idealistic Swedish prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads to UPDATE with this year's winners &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ He was wealthy, Swedish and idealistic
_ a close parallel to Alfred Nobel. But Jakob von Uexkull thought
the Nobel Prizes had lost their way, so he decided to found his
own.
	   Now, the Right Livelihood awards _ commonly called the
``alternative Nobels'' _ are gaining some of the respect and notice
given to the Nobels themselves. They are eagerly reported by news
media and presented in a ceremony in the Swedish Parliament.
	   Von Uexkull, a stamp dealer, sold his collection for about dlrs
1 million and started the awards in 1980 to recognize work that he
believed the Nobel Prizes were ignoring. At first the prizes were
regarded as an eccentric fancy, and even subversive, von Uexkull
said.
	   The first year, a major Swedish newspaper speculated on
``whether this was a CIA or a KGB plot to discredit the Nobel
Prizes,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
	   In fact, he said, he first wanted to help the Nobels rather than
found his own prizes.
	   He said he got the idea when he was at a philatelists' meeting
when he was in his 30s and found himself sitting between a very
young dealer and a very old one _ an image of where he had been and
where he was going.
	   ``I hadn't really intended on becoming an old stamp dealer,'' he
said. ``I'd always felt the stamp business was a means to an end.''
	   Noting that the Nobel Foundation had agreed to found the
economics prize, which wasn't specified in Nobel's will, he said he
approached the group with an offer to fund another prize. ``Can I
give them a million dollars and then get on with my life?'' is how
he characterized his thinking at the time.
	   But his idea was turned down and he felt compelled to go it
alone.
	   Since 1980, the awards have recognized a wide range of activists
and alternative scientists.
	   This year's recipients, announced Wednesday were the
London-based International Baby Food Action Netowrk, American
cancer-prevention specialist Samuel Epstein, Chilean environmental
activist Juan Pablo Orrego and Croatian peace activists Katarina
Kruhonja and Vesna Terselic.
	   This year's prize pool of 1.8 million kronor (dlrs 234,000) was
split equally among the four winners. They were chosen by a jury
that included von Uexkull, Richard Jolly of the United Nations
Development Program and Sweden's ambassador to Zambia, Kristina
Svensson.
	   The awards aren't given in specific categories. What the winners
over the years have in common is that ``we go more to the root of
the problem'' than the Nobel Prizes, which von Uexkull said
emphasize the top end of hierarchies: achievements in conventional
science and political thought.
	   The Nobel Prizes, with their idealistic goals and international
perspective, were revolutionary for Nobel's day, von Uexkull said.
But he thinks they lost some of that vision as they became
world-renowned.
	   In Nobel's time, ``science was unquestioned ... we don't have
that same faith in science'' as a cure for all problems, he said.
	   While the Nobels have become weighted down in ostentatious
banquets and stuffy formality, von Uexkull keeps his Right
Livelihood operation relaxed and frugal.
	   Coming to Stockholm from London, where he now lives _ an
expatriate as Nobel was _ von Uexkull stayed away from the
sprawling Grand Hotel where the Nobel laureates stay, choosing an
obscure hotel with a lobby big enough for only four chairs and a
table.
	   ``I'm not somebody ascetic. I enjoy the good life,'' he said.
	   But he holds back on self-indulgence, remembering that his award
winners are ``people risking much more than I have ever risked.''

	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police in southern India shot dead two
brothers suspected in a series of murders and rapes, saying they
tried to escape while being driven to court, police said Wednesday.
	   An escort of seven policemen were driving Kommiri Gundala Gopal,
38, and Kommiri Subramaniam, 33, to court on Tuesday when the van
they were traveling in skidded and overturned in a wooded area near
Tirupati, a town 1,625 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of the Indian
capital New Delhi, police said. The two brothers took advantage of
the confusion, snatched a revolver from a policeman and fired on
them.
	   ``They were asked to surrender but when they opened fire, the
police also fired at them, killing them on the spot,'' said K.S.
Jayachandra, inspector general of police.
	   Police have ordered an inquiry. The policemen escorting the two
had bruises but no bullet injuries.
	   The suspects were being taken to court because police had
requested they be held in jail until investigations were complete.
	   They had been arrested on the basis of finger prints recovered
from the scenes of the crimes.
	   The brothers were accused of killing 42 people and raping 12
women in Andhra Pradesh state and in the border districts of
neighboring Tamil Nadu state. Southern Indians traditionally use
their family name first.
	   Police said the brothers usually killed their victims, mostly
poor daily wage earners, by hitting them on the head with wooden
stumps, sickles or iron rods. The women were raped and then killed.
The motive was robbery, but they killed their victims because they
did not want to leave behind evidence, the brothers told
journalists in a meeting arranged by the police after their arrest.
	   The brothers were arrested in July after a manhunt involving
more than 1,000 policemen.
	   and the testimony of two 5-year-old twins who saw them kill
their parents in May this year.

Albright sees Israeli president before Netanyahu-Arafat meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word in 2nd graf, UPDATES with Israeli
official saying no progress has been made, UPDATES with Fatah
leaflet calling for clashes in Hebron &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Wednesday
he is ``a bit more optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking after hosting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright for breakfast.
	   Albright was to hold three-way talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat later in the day.
	   This is the second and last day of her shuttle diplomacy
mission, aimed at preparing for a meeting of the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington
later this month.
	   Albright is nudging Arafat and Netanyahu toward agreeing on a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank, part of a
series of interim agreements signed by the two sides starting in
1993. Negotiations have been stalemated for a year and a half.
	   U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said significant
progress has been made in Albright's talks so far.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report over
breakfast, but he expected the negotiations to continue this month.
He said reaching an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. ``I
think this must be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must
decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this, too.''
	   An Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity said key
issues remained unresolved, including a revised agreement on
security cooperation.
	   Israel's main demand of the Palestinians is to stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement was
vetoed by Israel.
	   The Maariv daily said the director of the CIA, George Tenet,
arrived here recently to negotiate the security agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians. U.S. officials said they would not
comment on Tenet's travel plans, but did not deny the report.
	   In Hebron, meanwhile, Arafat's Fatah movement called for clashes
with Israeli troops on Friday to protest the prolonged closure of
the city by the Israeli army.
	   The city of 130,000 Palestinians has been sealed for the past
week, barring residents from entering or leaving town. The closure
was imposed after an assailant threw two hand grenades at Israeli
troops, injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian civilians.
	   A Fatah leaflet called for ``a day of clashes'' with Israeli
troops along the lines dividing Hebron.

 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Sweden-Alternative Nobels. Will be led with
background on recipients &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A Chilean activist fighting to save the
Biobio River and an American cancer-prevention specialist were
named Wednesday as among the winners of the Right Livelihood
Awards, commonly called the ``alternative Nobels.''
	   The four awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 58,500), went
to Juan Pablo Orrego of Chile; Samuel Epstein of the University of
Illinois-Chicago; the London-based International Baby Food Action
Network; and Croatian peace activists Katarina Kruhonja and Vesna
Terselic.
	   The recipients all ``are engaged in the global struggle to put
limits on corporate power,'' awards founder Jakob von Uexkull said
at a news conference.
	   Von Uexkull sold an extensive stamp collection to provide seed
money for the awards, which are aimed at recognizing work that he
and the Right Livelihood Foundation believe gets ignored by the
more-famous Nobel Prizes.
	   The awards began in 1980 and have acquired a substantial amount
of prestige. The winners will receive the prizes in a ceremony in
the Swedish Parliament on Dec. 9, the day before the Nobel Prizes
are presented in Stockholm.
	   The jury for this year's prize included von Uexkull, Richard
Jolly of the United Nations Development Program and Sweden's
ambassador to Zambia Kristina Svensson.

Prime Minister Blair issues new warning over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday issued a
fresh warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that NATO is
ready to use military force to halt the bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Blair, in a BBC radio interview from Beijing, said military
action was drawing closer.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' said Blair, who is in the
middle of an official visit to China. ``People like myself have
been saying for a long period of time now if we don't act, or
threaten to act, then President Milosevic will simply take no
notice of us.''
	   His comments came on the heels of United Nations Security
Council members calling Tuesday for ``full and sustained
compliance'' with the two-week-old resolution demanding that
Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end its attacks on
civilians.
	   Serbian military police still maintain a strong presence in
Kosovo despite repeated international demands for them to ease
their crackdown on separatists.
	   ``We have to make sure now that (Milosevic) is complying with
the UN resolutions,'' Blair said. ``We have to make sure he is
withdrawing from a position where he is able to commit these
atrocities, these acts of barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know
very clearly that if he doesn't then serious action will follow.''
	   Asked when attacks might take place, Blair said: ``We have to
judge the timing, but it's pretty clear that this issue is coming
to a point of urgency.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central bank has ordered the closure of
debt-swamped Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., an
investment arm of southern Guangdong province, bank officials said
Wednesday.
	   The People's Bank of China has taken steps to entrust the debt
and assets of the firm, known as Gitic, to other financial
institutions, said a bank official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The closure appears to be part of an industry-wide crackdown by
financial regulators on China's trust and investment companies,
which are known for running up high debts on the interbank market,
where borrowers take loans from a second party to pay existing
debt.
	   Recent credit reviews indicated the firm would not be able to
repay its mounting debts.
	   ``The company can't pay for its maturing debts,'' an executive
in Gitic's general manager's office told Dow Jones Newswires. While
he declined to specify the amount of debt, the Gitic executive, who
also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the central bank would
``protect the legal rights of debt holders.''
	   In a related move, Moody's Investors Service said it placed the
ratings of Gitic on review for possible downgrade following reports
of the company's closure.
	   The ratings agency said the review reflected ``the critical
financial weaknesses of Gitic, including its deeply impaired asset
quality.''
	   The Guangdong-based company also had a unit listed on the Hong
Kong stock exchange, Gitic Enterprises Ltd. A diversified
conglomerate, it reported an 89 percent drop in net profits in the
first half of the year.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China Development Corp. has formed a joint
venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. to invest in unlisted
high-tech companies in Japan, it said Wednesday.
	   China Development Mitsubishi Corp. is capitalized at 495 million
yen (U.S. dlrs 3.8 million), with China Development holding a 60
percent stake and Mitsubishi and its wholly owned Taiwan unit the
remaining 40 percent.
	   China Development is charged with collecting the first
investment portion of about US dlrs 80 million from institutional
investors in Taiwan, said a statement from the company, christened
China Development Mitsubishi Corp.
	   Commitments from investors should be collected by year end and
investing can begin in January of next year, the company said.
	   The new company also hopes to eventually transfer Japanese
technology to Taiwan, where venture capital companies have played a
major role in financing high tech start ups and are now expanding
abroad.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday it has
placed under review for possible downgrading its rating of another
major Japanese financial institution, the Norinchukin Bank.
	   Moody's placed under review Norinchukin's single-A1 long-term
deposit and debt rating, its A1 issuer rating and the D-plus bank
financial strength rating.
	   The bank's Prime-1 short-term debt rating was not affected by
the review, Moody's said.
	   The review was prompted by Moody's concerns that political
instability may affect the degree of the government support
expected for Norinchukin and its affiliated entities of the
agricultural cooperative credit system.
	   Norinchukin also has sizable exposures to the troubled
non-banking sector, Moody's said.
	   Japan is stuck in its worst recession since World War II, and
its banks are saddled with massive bad loans.
	   Political parties have been arguing for months over what role
the government should play to ease the crisis, and analysts fear
their action may be too little, too late.
	   Moody's ratings are an assessment of a bank's ability to pay
back its debt and deposits. A lower rating is associated with
higher risk for investors and depositors.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations' exports to
Japan have fallen sharply as the Japanese economy has slipped into
recession, according to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi.
	   However, Supachai said he expects Japan to recover from its
worst recession in 50 years and register an economic growth of 1
percent to 2 percent after a year, which could reverse the export
decline.
	   ``It will take some time because the loss of confidence in Japan
is quite deep-seated,'' he said late Tuesday. ``By next year, we
should be doing far better in terms of our exports to Japan.''
	   Supachai, who is also Thailand's minister of commerce, is in
Manila to attend a conference of trade ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   He was unable to give exact figures on the region's overall
export decline but said Thailand's exports to Japan shrank by 16
percent to 17 percent during the first half of 1998.
	   Japan's economic troubles and the export decline were discussed
by ASEAN officials Tuesday. The ASEAN countries were discussing the
drop in exports with Japan individually, Supachai said.
	   ___
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Reunification Express is getting a
little closer to its name.
	   Thanks to recent improvements, the Vietnam Railway Authority
said Wednesday it will be cutting the travel time between Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh City by two hours.
	   But the train, also known as the Red Rattler, won't be setting
any rail speed records. It still will take 32 hours to cover the
nearly 1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile) trip.
	   Vu Xuan Hong, chief of the Railway Authority office, said
completion of a semi-automatic signal system between Vinh and Ho
Chi Minh City, along with recent rail and locomotive upgrades, have
made the reduction possible.
	   The Reunification Express has become a symbol of a unified
Vietnam. The first such express train started in 1976, a year after
the fall of Saigon to the communist North.
	   The travel time has been cut from 80 hours at that time to 42
hours in 1992, 38 hours in 1995 and 34 hours since 1996, with more
cuts in sight.
	   Eight railway bridges are being upgraded with loans from the
Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), with 10 smaller
bridges to be upgraded soon.
	   Vietnam Railways transported 10.5 million passengers and more
than 4 million tons of cargo last year, making it the most
important transport network between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
	   ___
	   	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a telltale sign of the hard times
hitting Southeast Asia, Thailand's capital leads the
recession-plagued region in vacant office space, an international
property consultant said Wednesday.
	   In Bangkok's central business district, 22 percent of offices
are vacant, compared with 15.6 percent in Jakarta, 11 percent in
Kuala Lumpur and just 4 percent in Manila, according to a report
released by Jones Lang Wootton.
	   The consulting firm said that with several new office buildings
nearing completion, the vacancy rate in Bangkok may reach 40
percent by the end of the year.
	   Because of the oversupply, however, prices per square meter are
about 30 percent cheaper than in other regional capitals.
	   Massive overbuilding in the real estate sector helped spark
Thailand's economic and financial crises.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two top South Korean computer chip
makers said Wednesday they have failed to work out details of a
proposed merger, casting doubt on the government's plan to
restructure the country's bloated conglomerates.
	   Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. and LG Semicon agreed in
September to merge in an industry shakeup aimed at streamlining
South Korea's semiconductor and six other debt-ridden industries.
	   The two were given until last week to announce details of their
planned merger. But on Wednesday, Hyundai and LG said they needed
more time _ until the end of November _ to settle the dispute over
who takes control of the merged company.
	   ``The government seriously doubts if big businesses will ever
keep their restructuring promises,'' said Chung Hae-joo, a
government policy coordinator in the prime minister's office.
	   ``If they balk at this very beginning stage of restructuring,
the country will never be able to get rid of its huge, overlapping
investments and recover its competitiveness,'' Chung added.
	   Chung declined further comment. But aides to President Kim
Dae-jung have indicated that the government would order
state-controlled banks to call in loans from big businesses
resisting reform.
	   In September, the nation's five biggest conglomerates promised
to merge their key, overlapping subsidiaries in the computer chip,
aerospace, rolling stock, oil, automobile and petrochemical
industries.
	   On Wednesday, three of those deals _ semiconductor, rolling
stock and electric power plants _ were either in doubt or
retracted.

As scandals surface, Thailand's Chuan warns Cabinet on corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ It was the first order of business
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai raised at the first meeting
of his new Cabinet this week.
	   ``Corruption will not be tolerated. I can't protect any
dishonest person,'' Chuan told his ministers.
	   The irony is that the seven-party coalition government led by
Chuan, widely regarded as one of the most honest politicians in
Thai history, is awash in corruption scandals.
	   They began shortly after he was named prime minister last
November, and the allegations _ some substantiated, others unproven
_ include:
	   _ The minister of transport and communications was accused of
rigging bids for a digital communications network.
	   _ The minister of interior allegedly used timber from a national
park to build his home, while investigating illegal loggers.
	   _ The minister of health and his deputy were forced to resign
over price fixing of medical supplies at hospitals.
	   _ The deputy minister of agriculture resigned after farmers
complained the ministry was selling them seeds at inflated prices.
	   _ Farmers groups now charge the ministry is inflating the price
of fertilizer.
	   _ A deputy education minister has accused one of his
counterparts of rigging bids and overcharging schools for
computers.
	   _ There has been speculation that kickbacks were involved in
awarding a contract to turn Bangkok's zoo into an amusement park.
	   Just a few years ago, when Thailand's economy was booming, there
was little public outrage over politicians taking payoffs or
skimming off contracts.
	   ``But not now, when we are going through an economic crisis.
People's tolerance level has been lowered,'' said Professor Kasian
Tejapira, a political scientist at Thammasat University in Bangkok.
	   If even half of the corruption allegations are true, then
millions of dollars have been lost at a time when unemployment is
nearing 2 million and the government is receiving a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Recent polls show the public still supports the prime minister.
But confidence in his coalition's honesty is declining.
	   The scandals also threatened the unity of the governing
coalition, which had only a slim parliamentary majority.
	   To ensure his government would not fall, Chuan brought in
another party Monday. While that increased the number of government
lawmakers, polls showed voters doubted the honesty of the new
coalition partner.
	   ``This new lineup is not for the sake of the people, but to
lengthen the life of the government,'' said Weng Tojirakan of the
Confederation for Democracy, an activist group. ``But if the prime
minister cannot root out corruption, then the government will not
last.''
	   Despite Chuan's warning to his ministers, parliament's makeup
makes it likely new scandals will emerge.
	   While many of the 387 lawmakers are honest, law enforcement
officials say there are also many godfathers, alleged drug
smugglers, oil smugglers, people profiting from prostitution and
other vices, people accused of looting financial institutions and
even some who have been arrested for assault.
	   Furthermore, corrupt bureaucrats were behind many scandals.
Thailand is only a few decades removed from a feudal society where
officials expected gifts in exchange for basic services.
	   ``Corruption is ingrained in our system,'' Professor Kasian said
about the persistence of that attitude.
	   Former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who leads the
opposition, has vowed to launch a no-confidence debate against
Chuan using the corruption scandals as ammunition.
	   He is unlikely, however, to succeed. Most Thais believe the
opposition is more corrupt than the government.

Far-right leader hints he'll be a no-show in any German trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen indicated
Wednesday that he would not show up for an eventual trial in
Germany for referring to Nazi gas chambers as a ``detail in the
history of the Second World War.''
	   ``I'm not normally very keen on obeying orders and never when
they come from abroad,'' Le Pen, head of the National Front party,
said on the all-news television channel LCI.
	   The European Parliament on Tuesday stripped Le Pen's immunity
from prosecution so a German court can try him for his remarks last
year at a news conference in Munich.
	   Munich prosecutors want to charge Le Pen under German laws
making it a criminal offense to trivialize the Holocaust. Le Pen
could face a maximum of five years in jail if convicted.
	   Chief prosecutor Manfred Wick said his office will open an
investigation into Le Pen's comments as soon as it has been
formally notified of the decision of the European Parliament, where
Le Pen is a deputy.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted unless the 626-member assembly votes for a lifting of
immunity.
	   In the LCI interview, Le Pen reiterated his contention that he
is a victim, claiming his words were twisted.
	   ``The German prosecutor had to falsify (my) sentence,'' Le Pen
said, so that it corresponds to the legal definition of what is
referred to as negationism -- denying the Holocaust took place.
	   Le Pen has already been convicted and fined in France for
referring to the gas chambers as a ``detail in history.''
	   French Culture Minister Catherine Trautman hailed the decision
of the Strasbourg-based European Parliament to lift Le Pen's
immunity.
	   ``A European deputy like Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has chosen to
deny history and create a scandalous provocation in Germany, must
be judged like any other citizen,'' the minister said on Europe 1
radio.
	   Le Pen has often been accused of racism or anti-Semitism, and
been taken to court on numerous occasions, winning some court
fights and losing others.
	   Another legal battle awaits him in France. On Nov. 17, a court
will rule on his appeal of a conviction for assaulting a Socialist
politician last year.
	   If he loses his appeal, he will be ineligible to hold an elected
office for two years.

EU opens WTO talks with India over rules on foreign car parts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union has asked the World
Trade Organization for formal consultations with India over rules
on imports of car parts, an EU official said Wednesday.
	   Nigel Gardner, a spokesman for the EU executive Commission, said
the EU called for a first round of WTO-led consultations on
Tuesday.
	   ``Our complaint concerns restrictions on foreigners. Foreign car
makers investing in India are forced to use a minimum amount of
Indian-made components and to export part of what they
manufacture,'' Gardner said.
	   Gardner says the EU is ``quite hopeful'' it can come to a
friendly settlement with India over this issue in the coming
months, without having to resort to a WTO panel to settle the
issue.
	   Under WTO procedure, the EU can call on a panel to rule on the
issue if consultations fail within 60 days.
	   Gardner said India had agreed in previous talks with the EU to
phase out import restrictions on cars by March 31, 2000.
	   ``But this is only a partial agreement and doesn't cover all the
problems,'' Gardner said.

Yeltsin talks with Blair, Russian foreign minister on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin conferred Wednesday with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Russia's foreign minister on
the conflict in Kosovo, the president's press service said.
	   Yeltsin ordered Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to attend a Friday
meeting in London of the six-member Contact Group on Yugoslavia,
Russian news agencies reported. The group includes the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia.
	   NATO is building up forces at a base in southern Italy and has
threatened airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces that are
cracking down on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province in southern Yugoslavia. Russia fiercely
opposes airstrikes.
	   Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop NATO strikes, and Belarus offered military
assistance to their traditional Slav ally.
	   Ivanov told Yeltsin that Russia's efforts to discourage
airstrikes ``resulted in a growing understanding of the feasibility
for a political settlement,'' the Interfax news agency quoted
Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as saying.
	   Also Wednesday, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky
called for a meeting of representatives from NATO countries'
embassies in Moscow to discuss the Kosovo conflict.

Germany's incoming government warns of looming budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with eastern governor against raising gas tax;
Coalition talks to start at 1300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Charging Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government with manipulating the books for next year's budget,
Germany's incoming center-left government warned against
expectations of big new programs after it takes office.
	   Coalition talks between Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democrats and the small Greens party were resuming
Wednesday, focusing on the budget and unemployment.
	   But Social Democrat finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier warned
``there isn't a lot of room for big election presents'' because of
tight finances.
	   Budget experts from both parties said their review of government
finances found revenues next year will be 20 billion marks (dlrs 12
billion) less than calculated by Kohl's outgoing government.
	   Another 20 billion marks is at risk in the coming years due to
over-generous economic growth forecasts, the Greens' Fritz Kuhn
said after Tuesday's meeting.
	   Kohl's parliamentary faction leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, denied
any gap in the 1999 budget presented by Finance Minister Theo
Waigel last month.
	   Matthaeus-Maier said the Social Democrats remained committed to
reversing cuts in retirement benefits passed by Kohl's government
that were to take effect Jan. 1.
	   The parties also have already committed themselves to quickly
put in place a jobs program to fight unemployment among young
people.
	   Wednesday's session also is to tackle programs for raising
living standards in the former communist east.
	   Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic governor of eastern
Brandenburg state, appealed to both sides to exempt the
still-struggling east from any gasoline tax increases. The Greens
are pushing for sharp rises to encourage conservation.
	   Noting that wages were already lower in the east, Stolpe told
the Lausitzer Rundschau newspaper that ``every harsh price hike
would only additionally cement this discrimination.''
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end. But a Greens leader said Tuesday her
party expects at least two posts in Schroeder's Cabinet.
	   Juergen Trittin will become Environment Minister, and Joschka
Fischer will take over the Foreign Ministry, said Gunda Roestel,
who co-chairs the Greens party with Trittin.
	   Roestel said the party had proposed two female candidates as
justice minister, adding that the talks were ``sharpening.''
	   The Greens said Sunday they wanted to name four ministers, at
least two of whom should be women.
	   Social Democratic lawmaker Ulla Schmidt on Tuesday also called
on Schroeder to appoint women to at least 40 percent of the top
jobs in his government.

Italy's premier takes case to save government to Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Prodi quotes; edits to conform, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Wrkiter &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Arguing Italy needs stability, Premier Romano Prodi
went before Parliament Wednesday, hoping to win over a few wavering
lawmakers to ensure survival of a government that already is
Italy's second-most enduring in a half-century.
	   Prodi appealed to the legislature on behalf of his center-left
government, which was threatened with collapse by the defection of
its far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, led by Fausto
Bertinotti.
	   The government faces an expected vote of confidence Friday that
will test whether Prodi can still command a majority in Parliament.
	   ``I don't think that any of the forces in the majority can hold
back their support,'' Prodi told lawmakers. ``I think that even
you, Bertinotti, must be feeling the same weight and the same
responsibilities that we feel.''
	   Refoundation provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over
the weekend and saying it would not vote for the government's
deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
	   Prodi told the legislators that approval of the budget was ``key
to proving Italy's credibility.''
	   He said the stability during his 2 1/2 year term allowed Italy
to qualify for participation in Europe's common currency, and that
the government's collapse would put Italy's position within the
European Union at risk.
	   ``We cannot and must not return to being seen by other European
Union countries as the weak link, as an immature democracy and as a
country of constant instability.''
	   Prodi said Italy could not permit itself to reach the date of
the euro's launch, set for January, 1999, ``weakened and
uncertain.''
	   Refoundation provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over
the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting
1999 budget.
	   But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.
Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party
president Monday, saying the party's hard-line stance was ``wrong
and dangerous.''
	   Prodi was hoping to profit from the break, picking up the few
more votes he needs to command a majority in the 630-seat Chamber
of Deputies.
	   The premier said he will quit if he loses a vote of confidence.
That would leave President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the choice of
asking him or someone else to try to form a new government or
calling early parliamentary elections.
	   The center-right opposition led by ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi
has that early elections were Italy's only proper course now _ but
his is about the only faction in that wants to go that route.
	   Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3 1/2
years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.

Congo's Kabila visits Nigeria to discuss conflict at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Congo's troubled President Laurent Kabila
is in Nigeria's capital on a 24-hour state visit, a Nigerian
government statement said Wednesday.
	   Kabila arrived late Tuesday and was met by Nigeria's military
ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. The two leaders held brief talks
before attending at state dinner.
	   The conflict in Congo and the threat it poses to the greater
Central African region was expected to be the main focus of
meetings between Kabila and Abubakar.
	   Kabila has been battling a rebel army since the start of August
when Tutsi ethnic fighters joined up with defecting government
soldiers to stage a revolt in the capital and the country's far
east.
	   The uprising was put down in the capital, Kinshasa, but fighting
continues in eastern Congo, where rebel forces control several
important cities.
	   Kabila has enlisted military support of Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Chad in his war against the rebel force, which the
government says is backed and largely controlled by neighboring
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   A senior Nigeria government official said he believed Kabila was
planning to ask Abubakar for military assistance. Nigeria's
military plays a lead policing role in much of West Africa through
participation in a regional peacekeeping and intervention force.

Report: Sudanese army kills 50 rebels in southwest Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese troops killed 50 rebels and
seized arms and ammunition during a battle in a new war front in
the southwest, an independent newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The daily Alwan newspaper quoted Agriculture Minister Nafie Ali
Nafie as saying that government forces countered an attack by some
500 rebels in the mountainous Mandi region of South Kordofan
province.
	   It was not possible to independently verify the report and the
rebel group did not immediately comment.
	   ``Our forces killed over 50 outlaws and captured quantities of
ammunition and we lost no soldier,'' said Nafie, who is in charge
of mobilization in the southwestern South Kordofan province.
	   He did not say when the fighting took place, but it was the
first time clashes were reported in this province, indicating that
the rebels may have expanded their area of operation.
	   Before this, the fighting was limited to the southern Eastern
Equatoria province where Sudan said it has crushed the rebels.
	   Sudan says the guerrillas are supported by Eritrean and Ugandan
troops, a charge both countries deny.
	   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, drawing support
from Christians and followers of tribal religions, have been waging
a military campaign against the Islamic-led Sudanese government
since 1983 for more autonomy for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

Warlord threatens the West with his paramilitary units
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A notorious Serbian warlord has
threatened to summon his paramilitary fighters to battle in case of
NATO military intervention in Serbia, media reported Wednesday.
	   Speaking at a local television station, Zeljko Raznjatovic, also
known as Arkan, pledged to re-activate his paramilitaries,
assembled under the so-called Serbian Volunteer Guard to defend
Kosovo and Serbia.
	   ``It is not important who we have to face but the sanctity of
that which we are defending and we are defending holy Serb land,''
Arkan said in the interview, referring to the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   Serbs view Kosovo as the heartland of Serbia's medieval kingdom
and the cradle of its Christian Orthodox Church.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles... We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power,''
the warlord declared.
	   Arkan's paramilitary units fought in the wars in Bosnia and
Croatia where his ``Tigers'' were among the most feared Serb troops
and were widely accused by Muslims and Croats of atrocities.
	   After the wars, Raznjatovic disbanded the troops and turned to
private business and enterprise instead.
	   He is also sought throughout Europe on criminal charges, mostly
bank robberies, but was not among those publicly indicted so far by
the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

New pro-Anwar rally held as Mahathir refuses to appoint deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Wednesday he would not appoint a replacement for Anwar Ibrahim
as anti-government protests broke out again, with thousands
demanding justice for his ousted, jailed deputy.
	   After chairing a meeting of his United Malays National
Organization, Mahathir said he would wait to fill Anwar's seat
until the party's internal election in 1999.
	   Last week, Mahathir, 72, said he could ``drop dead'' at any
time, fueling speculation that he was about to announce a new
deputy after consulting his party's supreme council.
	   ``This is not a matter discussed by the party. That is my
prerogative,'' Mahathir told reporters after the meeting.
	   As the meeting was going on, about 10,000 people gathered late
Tuesday night in the eastern state of Pahang for a rally organized
by a new opposition coalition, the Malaysian Justice Movement.
	   The rally took place at the regional headquarters of the Islamic
opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia, which is part of the new
coalition of three opposition parties and more than a dozen private
organizations.
	   It was the first rally after a week of calm following several
anti-government street demonstrations in the capital that riot
police dispersed with tear gas and water cannons.
	   One of the organizers, Shamsul Maarif Ismail, said the rally was
the beginning of a nationwide road show for wide-scale lobbying
against the Internal Security Act, a law that allows for
imprisonment without trial.
	   Thousands of postcards addressed to the prime minister were
circulated. The cards demanded that Mahathir hold a general
election or step down.
	   Anwar, Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, was arrested
under the ISA on Sept. 20 for organizing a huge anti-Mahathir
rally. He is also charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
sexual acts for which he goes on trial Nov. 2.
	   Malaysia's Bar Council sent a letter Wednesday to the
inspector-general of police, protesting the harassment of lawyers
defending Anwar.
	   The council said in a statement that it had received complaints
from several lawyers connected with Anwar's case that they had been
called to police headquarters.
	   Last week, police interrogated one of Anwar's defense attorneys
who had accompanied Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to her third round
of police questioning.
	   Mahathir had groomed Anwar as his heir for five years, but fired
him abruptly, saying he was morally unfit to lead. The two had
differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared
the deputy was a threat to his 17-year rule.
	   Meanwhile, the governing party appointed a string of new
officials to party posts around the country to replace those
removed in a purge of pro-Anwar officials.
	   Mahathir dismissed 10 members Wednesday for anti-party
activities, an obvious reference to their bias in favor of Anwar.
	   Also Wednesday, Mahathir reacted angrily to the growing
condemnation by world leaders of the treatment Anwar is receiving
in captivity.
	   ``If we mind our own business, it will be better for
everybody,'' he said.
	   Soon after Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises
on his arm and neck, condemnation poured in from many of Malaysia's
neighbors and Western nations.

Biobio River and an American cancer-prevention specialist were
named Wednesday as among the winners of the Right Livelihood
Awards, commonly called the ``alternative Nobels.''
	   The four awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 58,500), went
to Juan Pablo Orrego of Chile; Samuel Epstein of the University of
Illinois-Chicago; the London-based International Baby Food Action
Network; and Croatian peace activists Katarina Kruhonja and Vesna
Terselic.
	   The recipients all ``are engaged in the global struggle to put
limits on corporate power,'' awards founder Jakob von Uexkull said
at a news conference.
	   Orrego helped found the Grupo de Accion por el Biobio in 1991,
to work against plans by the Chilean energy company ENDESA to build
a series of six dams on spectacular river.
	   ``The campaign work has, in a relatively short time, been
remarkably successful, enabling GABB to make the previously secret
plans for dam construction a hot issue of environment, human rights
and to question the present development model in Chile,'' the
awards foundation said.
	   Epstein, a prefessor of occupational and enviromental medicine,
is chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, which works to
prevent exposure to carcinogens in air, water, food and the
workplace. The award also noted CPC's research indicating that milk
and meat from cattle treated with synthetic hormones can cause
cancer.
	   IBFAN ``brought together non-governmental organizations which
were addressing infant feeding ... in a common aim: improving
breastfeeding rates, reducing dependence on industrial artificial
milk products, and protecting families' freedom of choice,'' the
foundation said.
	   Terselic, found of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign, and Kruhonja,
director of the Center for Peace, Non-violence and Human Rights in
the city of Osijek, are both working to heal the post-war tensions
in Croatia.
	   Von Uexkull sold an extensive stamp collection to provide seed
money for the awards, which are aimed at recognizing work that he
and the Right Livelihood Foundation believe gets ignored by the
more-famous Nobel Prizes.
	   ``We are a complement to the Nobel Prizes _ and a compliment''
because establishing the Right Livelihood Awards was a recognition
of the Nobels' prestige, von Uexkull said.
	   The awards began in 1980 and have acquired a substantial amount
of prestige. The winners will receive the prizes in a ceremony in
the Swedish Parliament on Dec. 9, the day before the Nobel Prizes
are presented in Stockholm.
	   The jury for this year's prize included von Uexkull, Richard
Jolly of the United Nations Development Program and Sweden's
ambassador to Zambia Kristina Svensson.

Russians take to the streets to protest economy, Yeltsin

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians frustrated by the country's deep economic
recession took to the streets in nationwide protests Wednesday, but
the crowds at the day's early rallies were much smaller than
organizers predicted.
	   Russians have been enduring their economic crisis stoically,
with few public outbursts against President Boris Yeltsin's
government, which has been unable to halt an economic decline
that's ravaged the country for most of this decade.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people were expected to take part in
rallies across the country organized by trade unions, the Communist
Party and other critics of Yeltsin. Organizers had predicted that
up to 40 million people would take part.
	   ``Look at the hole the Russian people have fallen into. Look at
the people on their knees,'' Marina Rubintsina, a 19-year-old
student, told demonstrators in the eastern port city of
Vladivostok. ``We don't have a future.''
	   Vladivostok is the largest city on Russia's east coast, but the
rally on the main square drew only about 3,000 people, according to
police. Organizers put the number at 6,000. By either count, it was
far short of expectations.
	   In the Russian Far East and in parts of eastern Siberia, the
turnout at various rallies appeared to be under 100,000, well below
forecasts, the Interior Ministry said, according to Russian news
agencies.
	   In Vladivostok, the marchers included union workers, pensioners,
students and members of widely divergent political factions. Some
carried photos of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, while others
hoisted flags from Russia's czarist era. Many carried
anti-government banners. ``Stop the genocide of the Russian
people,'' read one.
	   In the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Alexander Lebed, the
regional governor and a likely presidential candidate, supported
calls for Yeltsin to step down.
	   ``Today Yeltsin is alone,'' said Lebed, who was among an
estimated 15,000 marchers in the city. ``People are pushed to the
extreme. Western investors have become fierce and are angry with
him.''
	   As of early afternoon in Moscow, there had been no reports of
trouble at any of the rallies.
	   On the eve of the protests, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made
a nationally televised appeal to Russians to remain calm, both
during the demonstrations and for the duration of the economic
crisis.
	   Primakov promised there would be no food shortages this winter
and said the government would start paying overdue wages and
pensions.
	   ``The populace will be fully provided with vegetables, fruit and
potatoes,'' Primakov said. ``I appeal to everyone not to rock our
common boat in today's too-turbulent sea.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov predicted as many as 40
million of Russia's 148 million people could take part in
Wednesday's protests, but others said it would be closer to the
nearly 2 million people who participated in a similar protest in
March 1997.
	   Russia's economic conditions have deteriorated considerably
since then, but the protest organizers may have hurt themselves by
sending out mixed messages.
	   The unions want to focus on the economy, which is expected to
shrink by more than 5 percent this year. Millions of workers get
paid months late, and inflation now is forecast at 200 percent.
	   The Communists, meanwhile, have been calling for Yeltsin's
resignation and see the protests as a way to further weaken the
president, who still has two years left in his term.
	   But the Communists find themselves in a bit of an awkward
position because several of their members are playing key roles in
Primakov's new government.
	   Yeltsin has maintained an extremely low profile since the
economic crisis struck, spending most of his time at a presidential
residence on the western outskirts of Moscow.
	   The Communists and the unions have pledged that the protests
will be peaceful. Nonetheless, police and interior troops have been
put on alert throughout Russia.
	   More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry troops
are being deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior
Ministry official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Moscow city officials have said the demonstration in the capital
could draw up to 150,000 people, who will march to the edge of Red
Square.

	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a last attempt to narrow
the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held talks Wednesday with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials said Albright has made little
progress during her two-day visit. Albright hopes to prepare the
ground for a Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Albright briefed Israeli President Ezer
Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said he was ``a bit more
optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report, but
expected the negotiations to continue. He said reaching an
agreement depends on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu.
	   ``I think this must be done,'' he said, ``But the prime minister
must decide this, and Arafat has something to say about this,
too.''
	   Wednesday's three-way meeting was held at the Erez crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat
did not speak to reporters during their separate arrivals.
	   Albright is nudging, 3rd graf pvs.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Critics of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's long
stewardship of the Christian Democrats continued Wednesday to
demand more radical change at the top following last month's
election debacle.
	   Party leaders decided Tuesday to keep Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's
handpicked successor, as parliamentary faction boss and recommended
he be chosen as the new party chairman at a Nov. 7 convention.
	   But Saxony state Gov. Kurt Biedenkopf, who abstained in
Tuesday's voting, warned the party not to concentrate both
positions in one man.
	   The faction leader must work with the CDU's Bavarian partner,
the Christian Social Union, he told Super Illu magazine. But the
party chairman's job must be to raise the profile of the CDU itself
now that it's in the opposition.
	   CDU lawmaker Peter Altmeier, one of the so-called ``Wild Youth''
group of Kohl critics, told Saarland Radio that more leadership
posts needed to be given to younger party members.
	   Party renewal cannot be limited to just promoting Schaeuble and
Kohl's outgoing defense minister, Volker Ruehe, he said.
	   Kohl announced he would not run for re-election as CDU chairman
after Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder trounced him in the Sept.
27 election.

	   EREZ, Israel (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
flew to the border crossing town of Erez on Wednesday for three-way
talks with Palestinian and Israeli leaders on a long-sought West
Bank accord.
	   Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of
hurdles in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while she is in
the region. But Albright hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held
Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether Arafat was ready to
inch closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United States basically
shares, that the Palestinian authority could do more to control
terrorists on territory under its control.
	   Albright said Tuesday there were ``tough choices that both sides
have to make'' before U.S. President Bill Clinton hosts the summit
with Netanyahu and Arafat. The summit date is not fixed yet, with
Oct. 15 and Oct. 20 possible starting dates. The location could be
the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, or somewhere else
in the Washington area.
	   Netanyahu has basically agreed to relinquish 13 percent of the
West Bank, on top of the 27 percent promised to the Palestinians
earlier, with 3 percent set aside for a nature preserve under joint
Israeli-Palestinian security control.
	   But with security and other issues still up in the air, Rubin
said the peace process is ``not back on track'' yet.
	   ``I think we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where
some heavy lifting is going to be required,'' Rubin said Tuesday.
``We do not envisage it as a photo-op in which everything is
pre-cooked.''
	   After Albright leaves the Mideast, probably Wednesday, U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
	   Whatever the outcome, Albright said the United States intends to
pursue a better relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for
its own sake.''
	   ``We have thought for some time about increasing the level of
discourse,'' she said.
	   But she declined to say whether the administration was setting
the stage for dealing ultimately with a Palestinian state.

U.S. envoy fails to persuade Yugoslav president to end crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke quotes, Blair warning, Contact Group
meeting Friday, warlord threatens action against NATO; TRIMS.
Milosevic-Holbrooke talks expected to start at 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the Security Council declared that
the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London. Holbrooke said he planned to
meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday in
Brussels.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting indicated
that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``We have to make sure he (Milosevic) is withdrawing from a
position where he is able to commit these atrocities, these acts of
barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know very clearly that if he
doesn't then serious action will follow,'' Blair said in a BBC
radio interview Wednesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Serb nationalists already are lining up behind Milosevic in his
defiant stance toward the West. The notorious Serb warlord known as
Arkan has threatened to regroup his paramilitary fighters, widely
accused of atrocities in the war in Bosnia, to attack Western
forces if they intervene.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles,'' he said in comments
reported by Belgrade media Wednesday. ``We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power.''
	   Canada said Tuesday it had evacuated all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy. Other countries
are expected to follow suit.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and held a meeting with Russia's
foreign minister on the conflict in Kosovo, the president's press
service said.
	   Yeltsin ordered Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to attend a Friday
meeting in London of the six-member Contact Group on Yugoslavia,
Russian news agencies reported. The group includes the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia.
	   Yeltsin's talks with Blair focused on the problems in Kosovo,
but Yeltsin's office did not provide any additional details. Blair
is currently in China.
	   NATO is building up forces at a base in southern Italy and has
threatened airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces that are
cracking down on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province in southern Yugoslavia. Russia fiercely
opposes airstrikes.
	   Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop NATO strikes, and Belarus offered military
assistance to their traditional Slav ally.
	   Ivanov told Yeltsin that Russia's efforts to discourage
airstrikes ``resulted in a growing understanding of the feasibility
for a political settlement,'' the Interfax news agency quoted
Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as saying.
	   Also Wednesday, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky
called for a meeting of representatives from NATO countries'
embassies in Moscow to discuss the Kosovo conflict.

Hong Kong shares rally on gains in Japanese stocks, currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices rallied Wednesday,
boosted largely by the sharp gains of Japan's key stock index and
the Japanese currency, traders said.
	   The Hang Seng Index gained 180.18 points, or 2.4 percent,
closing at 7,744.72. The markets were closed Tuesday for a public
holiday.
	   Trading amounted to 3.81 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
488 million), compared with 2.85 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 365 million) Monday.
	   Stock investors shrugged off the annual policy speech by Hong
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, which hadn't ended before the
stock market closed.
	   ``He hasn't said anything so far,'' said Antony Mak, a trader at
Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   Investors focused on overseas markets and interest rates,
traders said. Markets in the United States and Europe rebounded
Tuesday after heavy losses last week.
	   Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged 6 percent Wednesday to 13,825.61
and the yen was trading at around 128 to the U.S. dollar in late
afternoon, compared with around 130.85 late Tuesday in New York.
	   A stronger yen eases pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and local
interest rates.
	   Moreover, Vickers' Mak said, ``people expect global (interest)
rate cuts,'' which would boost stocks.
	   The market was barely fazed by the collapse Tuesday of Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp.
	   On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China shut down the company,
which was overburdened with debt.
	   The Hang Seng red-chip index, which tracks the shares of
mainland-controlled Hong Kong companies, fell 5.83 points, or less
than 1 percent.
	   The gains in the Hong Kong stock market Wednesday were uneven,
with a few property shares climbing strongly, while others were
slipping.
	   Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. gained 1.55 Hong Kong dollars to
28.40, and Cheung Kong Holdings gained 50 cents to 34.8, but Hang
Lung Development Ltd. lost 50 cents to 6.55.
	   The financial sector was buoyed by falling interest rates.
Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings gained 4.00 to 138.00, and its
affiliate Hang Seng Bank gained 60 cents to 49.10.

Chemical spill causes dlrs 4 million in damage to Kyrgyz lake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sodium cyanide spill that's been blamed for the
deaths of three people and pollution problems in the largest lake
in Kyrgyzstan has caused at least dlrs 4 million in damage, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The figure does not include agricultural losses, said Deputy
Prime Minister Boris Silayev, who heads the commission
investigating the May 20 spill.
	   A truck carrying 20 tons (22 short tons) of highly toxic sodium
cyanide powder to a gold mine veered off a mountain road and
crashed into the Barskaan River, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul,
one of central Asia's largest bodies of water. The lake is the
center of a valuable nature preserve and home to several rare
species.
	   Kumtor Operating Co., which operates the gold mine, has paid for
some of the damage, Silayev said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Kumtor is a subsidiary of Canada's Cameco company, the world's
largest publicly traded uranium company. With dlrs 500 million in
the Kumtor mine, Cameco is a major foreign investor in the
impoverished former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan.
	   Cameco has said the spill was too small to seriously affect such
a large lake.
	   Local officials said fish and cattle were killed near the spill
and about 600 people sought medical treatment for poisoning.
Farmland has been contaminated by villagers who used water from the
river on their crops. World Health Organization experts recommended
that residents avoid produce grown in the area.

U.S. envoy fails to persuade Yugoslav president to end crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke quotes, Blair warning, Contact Group
meeting Friday, warlord threats against NATO; TRIMS.
Milosevic-Holbrooke talks expected to start at 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the Security Council declared that
the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London. Holbrooke said he planned to
meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday in
Brussels.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
on Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting indicated
that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``We have to make sure he (Milosevic) is withdrawing from a
position where he is able to commit these atrocities, these acts of
barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know very clearly that if he
doesn't then serious action will follow,'' Blair said in a BBC
radio interview Wednesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Serb nationalists already are lining up behind Milosevic in his
defiant stance. A notorious Serb warlord known as Arkan has
threatened to regroup his paramilitary fighters, widely accused of
atrocities in the war in Bosnia, to attack Western forces if they
intervene.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles,'' he said in comments
reported by Belgrade media Wednesday. ``We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power.''
	   Canada said Tuesday it evacuated all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy. Other countries
are expected to follow suit.

Jailed dissident's family appeals for Blair's help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with dissident returning home &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police hauled away but later released a prominent
dissident Wednesday, and the mother of a jailed, ailing human
rights campaigner appealed for help from visiting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, a rights group reported.
	   Police officers questioned Xu Wenli for about six hours before
allowing him to return home Wednesday afternoon, said his wife, He
Xintong. They asked him about political activists that he knows and
other dissidents' efforts to set up an opposition political party,
she said.
	   She said she did not believe that Xu's questioning was linked to
Blair's visit. The officers told her before taking Xu away that he
was not being placed under arrest and that they expected to release
him before the day was out, she added.
	   One of the most senior democracy campaigners out of prison and
not in exile, Xu has recently supported efforts by dissidents to
try to use China's nascent and spotty legal code to set up an
opposition political party and human rights monitoring group.
	   Xu has spent 12 of the last 17 years in prison, much of them in
solitary confinement. Since his release in 1993, he has been
detained frequently, often during visits of high-level foreign
dignitaries.
	   In a direct appeal to Britain's Blair, the mother of former
Beijing University student Li Hai urged the prime minister to
discuss her son's case with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, said the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement, a Hong
Kong-based rights group.
	   Li was a member of the Peace Charter movement, a group calling
for peaceful democratic change. He was arrested in 1995 and
sentenced to nine years in prison the following year in a closed
trial for violating the vague state secrets law, apparently for
compiling a list of political prisoners.
	   The 44-year-old Li suffers from gallstones, hepatitis and high
blood pressure and has sought a medical parole, the group said,
citing his mother, Gong Liwen.
	   According to Gong, authorities at the Liangxiang prison outside
Beijing have denied Li adequate medical care and prevented his
family from providing food to supplement meager prison rations.
	   Blair could raise Li's case with Jiang as a ``typical example of
China's violations of human rights and perhaps do something
concrete to show that his visit has helped improve the situation in
China,'' the group said in a statement.
	   According to Li's family, while imprisoned he has been beaten
with electric batons and forced to work 15 hours of hard labor a
day.
	   Blair, the first British prime minister to visit China in seven
years, pledged before leaving Britain to raise human rights issues
with his hosts, and the topic was discussed in a meeting Tuesday
with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. But Blair said he would adopt a
quiet approach on such issues.

Italy's premier takes case to save government to Parliament

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Arguing Italy needs stability, Premier Romano Prodi
went before Parliament Wednesday, hoping to win over a few wavering
lawmakers to ensure survival of a government that already is
Italy's second-most enduring in a half-century.
	   Prodi appealed to the legislature on behalf of his center-left
government, which was threatened with collapse by the defection of
its far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, led by Fausto
Bertinotti.
	   The government faces an expected vote of confidence Friday that
will test whether Prodi can still command a majority in Parliament.
	   ``I don't think that any of the forces in the majority can hold
back their support,'' Prodi told lawmakers. ``I think that even
you, Bertinotti, must be feeling the same weight and the same
responsibilities that we feel.''
	   Refoundation provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over
the weekend and saying it would not vote for the government's
deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
	   Prodi told the legislators that approval of the budget was ``key
to proving Italy's credibility.''
	   He said the stability during his 2 1/2 year term allowed Italy
to qualify for participation in Europe's common currency, and that
the government's collapse would put Italy's position within the
European Union at risk.
	   ``We cannot and must not return to being seen by other European
Union countries as the weak link, as an immature democracy and as a
country of constant instability.''
	   Prodi said Italy could not permit itself to reach the date of
the euro's launch, set for January, 1999, ``weakened and
uncertain.''
	   Bertinotti's refusal to back Prodi has caused a split within
Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing,
resigned as party president Monday, saying the party's hard-line
stance was ``wrong and dangerous.''
	   Prodi was hoping to profit from the break by picking up the few
more votes he needs to command a majority in the 630-seat Chamber
of Deputies.
	   The premier said he will quit if he loses a vote of confidence.
That would leave President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the choice of
asking him or someone else to try to form a new government or
calling early parliamentary elections.
	   The center-right opposition led by ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi
has that early elections were Italy's only proper course now _ but
his is about the only faction in that wants to go that route.
	   Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3 1/2
years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.

Albright meets with Netanyahu, Arafat on withdrawal deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat quote, color from meeting, Palestinian
confirmation that CIA chief is participating in negotiations &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a last attempt to narrow
the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held three-way talks Wednesday with the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders.
	   Albright, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said around a square table so
small their knees and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials said Albright has made little
progress during her two-day visit. Albright, who is to leave the
Mideast on Wednesday evening, had hoped to prepare the ground for a
Mideast summit in Washington in mid-October.
	   It was not clear whether U.S. President Bill Clinton would risk
holding such a summit without any progress having been made in
preparatory talks.
	   Heading into the meeting at Erez, Arafat blamed Israel for the
continued deadlock in the negotiations. Addressing a gathering of
U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said he has long accepted a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security gestures.
	   ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said.
	   Israel's main demand is that the Palestinians stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement
brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials was
vetoed by Netanyahu.
	   Palestinian and Israeli officials said no progress has been made
on revising the document. The director of the CIA, George Tenet,
has arrived in the region and is participating in the negotiations,
said a Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Albright briefed Israeli President Ezer
Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said he was ``a bit more
optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report, but
expected the negotiations to continue this month. He said reaching
an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. ``I think this must
be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must decide this, and
Arafat has something to say about this, too.''
	   In Hebron, meanwhile, Arafat's Fatah movement called for clashes
with Israeli troops on Friday to protest the prolonged closure of
the city by the Israeli army.
	   The city of 130,000 Palestinians has been sealed for the past
week, barring residents from entering or leaving town. The closure
was imposed after an assailant threw two hand grenades at Israeli
troops, injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian civilians.
	   A Fatah leaflet called for ``a day of clashes'' with Israeli
troops along the lines dividing Hebron.

	   The cause of the crash was under investigation. It did not
appear linked to the separatist war in Kashmir.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Rescue workers in northern Nigeria were
pulling bodies from the Kaduna River on Wednesday after a packed
ferry capsized and 57 people drowned.
	   It was unclear when exactly the accident occurred, although
local authorities said it was earlier this week.
	   Of the 57 confirmed victims, 12 were from the same family, the
local Punch newspaper reported. A number of the victims were
children.
	   The cause of the accident had not yet been determined, although
investigators were on the scene, a local police spokesman said by
telephone.
	   Officials were still trying to determine the total number of
people on board the boat, the police officer said without giving
his name.
	   River ferries, old and often in complete disrepair, ply the
inland waters of Nigeria typically with passengers well beyond
their capacities.

China, part diplomat, part prude, bans Starr report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's press censors have banned the U.S.
independent counsel's report detailing President Bill Clinton's
affair with a White House intern, media and publishing sources said
Wednesday.
	   Chinese-language versions of the Starr report have joined a long
list of proscribed publications, ranging from soft-porn magazines
like Penthouse to the subtly subversive novels of Chinese lowlifes
by Wang Shuo.
	   In the case of the Starr report, officials disliked its
salacious details and worried that its contents would somehow
damage improving Chinese-U.S. relations, said the sources, who work
in enterprises strictly supervised by the government and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Like much else in China these days, the ban is likely to have
little effect. Pornographic magazines and videos can be bought on
many street corners.
	   Although the private lives of Chinese leaders are off-limits to
the media, interest is high. Underground copies of a banned book
about the late Mao Tse-tung's dalliances still circulate. A popular
Chinese Internet search engine, Sohoo, is still recording several
thousand hits a day at its Clinton scandal site.
	   One or two publishers of popular consumer guides supposedly
printed the Chinese-language Starr report and distributed copies to
local book stalls and sellers, the sources said.
	   The Communist Party-run Propaganda Department, which has
ultimate authority over the media, decided to issue the ban last
week, and the government's Press and Publications Administration
ordered book stores this week to take copies of the report off the
shelves, the sources said.
	   In a rare display of openness, the state-run Beijing Morning
Post reported the ban on Tuesday. But executives with the newspaper
contacted by telephone later refused to comment.
	   A Beijing city propaganda official, who identified himself as
Mr. Zhang, said the Beijing Morning Post ran an unauthorized report
and that no final decision had been made. Press and Publications
Administration officials also would not comment.
	   Since Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky became
front-page news in the United States in January, Chinese reporters
have been subjected to endless Propaganda Department directives not
to report any sexual details, the sources said.
	   One source said the Propaganda Department tried to put together
an edited, cleaned-up version of the Starr report, but found it
impossible to do.

Russian premier gives Communist key role in economic policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Protest

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday gave
his Communist deputy broad powers over the new Cabinet's economic
course, news reports said.
	   However, Primakov also plans to personally oversee the Finance
Ministry, which suggests he wants to reserve for himself the final
say on major economic decisions.
	   Primakov's First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who
served as the last head of the Soviet central planning agency, has
pushed for full control over the economic-related ministries.
	   Maslyukov will be in charge of economics and trade ministries
and various other bodies, including the committee for state
property management that oversees privatization.
	   Maslyukov will also step in as acting premier during Primakov's
absence and oversee talks with the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and other international lenders, the Russian media
reported.
	   Liberal economists have been critical of Maslyukov, saying he is
likely to opt for at least some Soviet-style controls on the
economy.
	   But Primakov has decided to oversee the finance, foreign,
defense and interior ministries, as well as tax service and customs
committee and several other agencies, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   The premier says he will continue with economic reforms, but
opposes the ``wild capitalism'' that has characterized Russia's
moves toward a market economy.
	   Primakov spoke on national television Tuesday evening, the day
before nationwide strikes, and assured Russians that the government
would pay off all wage and pension arrears and make sure there
would be no shortage of basic foods.
	   In another development, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
criticized a recent statement by Maslyukov, who said Russia would
be unable to pay off its debts this fall without help from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Zadornov insisted that Russia could make it even without IMF
aid, and added that Maslyukov's words didn't help advance Russia's
interests, the business daily Kommersant said Wednesday.
	   Zadornov, speaking to reporters in Washington, didn't explain
how the government would finance its spending without Western aid.
	   ``We must clearly understand, that any attempt to solve wage and
pension debts by cranking up money-printing presses will lead to
sharp rise in prices,'' Zadornov said on Russian television.
	   Government officials on Tuesday forecast that inflation would
reach about 200 percent in 1998.

Romania likely to postpone controversial Bell helicopter deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile has said
Romania cannot afford to go ahead with a dlrs1.45 billion
helicopter deal with American company Bell Textron and will likely
postpone the project, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Returning to Bucharest Tuesday after a six-day visit to
Washington, Vasile said officials from the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund and the U.S. administration had advised
that the contract was not ``feasible'' in the near future.
	   ``I agree with this,'' Vasile said, according to the daily
Adevarul.
	   Romania and Bell Textron signed a preliminary contract for a 70
percent stake in Romanian helicopter-manufacturer IAR Brasov in
1997. In July, the government agreed to guarantee a dollars 1.45
billion loan to the company.
	   Under the agreement, Romania must purchase 96 AH1RO Dracula
helicopters to be produced by Bell and IAR.
	   But the deal was put on hold later amid wide criticism from
media and some politicians, who argued it was too expensive for
Romania's cash-strapped budget. The government has slashed
expenditures to shrink the budget deficit.
	   Finance Minister Daniel Daianu opposed the deal and said he
would resign rather than sign it. He was later dismissed by
President Emil Constantinescu, officially for other reasons.
	   Constantinescu favors the project. A government commission is
expected to decide on its fate by year's end.

U.S. envoy fails to persuade Yugoslav president to end crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Britain advising its nationals to leave
Yugoslavia, Milosevic-Holbrooke talks now expected to start
Wednesday afternoon (1200 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said, indicating Milosevic has still not fully
complied.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the Security Council declared that
the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London. Holbrooke also may brief U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday in Brussels.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
afternoon indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``We have to make sure he (Milosevic) is withdrawing from a
position where he is able to commit these atrocities, these acts of
barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know very clearly that if he
doesn't then serious action will follow,'' Blair said in a BBC
radio interview Wednesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Serb nationalists already are lining up behind Milosevic in his
defiant stance toward the West. The notorious Serb warlord known as
Arkan has threatened to regroup his paramilitary fighters, widely
accused of atrocities in the war in Bosnia, to attack Western
forces if they intervene.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles,'' he said in comments
reported by Belgrade media Wednesday. ``We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power.''
	   Britain's Foreign Office said Wednesday it was advising Britons
in Yugoslavia to leave. Canada has evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
other countries are expected to follow suit.

Singapore takes delivery of advanced U.S. fighter planes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has added six advanced U.S. fighter
planes to its arsenal, and will take delivery of eight more soon,
the Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.
	   The McDonnell Douglas F-16 C/D Fighting Falcon planes arrived
Saturday, bringing to 10 the number of these multi-role fighters
stationed in Singapore, a ministry spokeswoman said.
	   Eight additional F-16s are on order from a 1994 deal, the
ministry said in a statement. The first four were delivered in
August.
	   The island republic maintains a strong air force relative to its
other military branches, and has bought much of its military
hardware from the United States, where it has to send its pilots
for training because of space restraints.
	   The U.S. Defense Department said in June that Singapore was
considering buying eight Boeing-made Apache attack helicopters and
other military hardware worth dlrs 620 million.
	   Singapore is a vocal supporter of American military presence in
the Asia-Pacific region, saying it is important for regional
stability and security.
	   The U.S. Navy maintains a logistics headquarters in Singapore.

Asian markets rally, lifted by global market recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW thruout with closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Markets across Asia closed sharply higher
Wednesday, lifted by major gains by Japan's currency and stock
prices and hopes for quick reforms in the world's second-largest
economy.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its second-largest points
gain this year _ and closed at 13,825.61. It had gained 73.52
points, or 0.57 percent, Tuesday.
	   Investors were encouraged when the governing Liberal Democratic
Party submitted to Parliament a bank rescue bill that incorporated
many of the political opposition's proposals, making quick passage
likely.
	   Under the bill, the government could inject funds into both weak
and healthy banks to help ease the nation's credit crunch and
promote takeovers of failed institutions by stronger lenders.
	   ``There is a lot of buying back of shares on expectations that a
strong economic stimulus package will be implemented to counter the
extremely poor state of the economy,'' said Takeshi Kubota, manager
of the equity information department at Meiko Securities.
	   Meanwhile, the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar
following comments by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
other officials that they were closely watching current dollar-yen
exchange rate movements.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 128.18 yen, down 4.68 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late overnight level
of 130.85 yen in New York. The dollar now has fallen a total of
7.58 yen in two days.
	   Asian markets also were lifted by the global market recovery
overnight and expectations of interest rate cuts across Europe,
after Spain's cut Tuesday of 50 basis points. European markets rose
between 4.4 and 7.8 percent.
	   ``Anticipation of a rate cut in Europe raised hopes for a global
trend to cut interest rates,'' said Kenny Tang, research manager at
Tung Tai Securities Co. Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   Thailand's key SET index gained 6.08 percent to 263.23 points;
Indonesia's JSX index gained 3.12 percent to 266.170; and
Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index soared 3.4 percent,
closing at 921.57.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 180.18
points, or 2.4 percent, closing at 7,744.72. The markets were
closed Tuesday for a public holiday.
	   Stock investors shrugged off the annual policy speech by Hong
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, which hadn't ended before the
stock market closed.
	   ``He hasn't said anything so far,'' said Antony Mak, a trader at
Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   The Philippines' key PSE index closed 3.6 percent higher at
1,121.75 points on hopes that foreigners would soon be allowed to
own land and on overall global optimism.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: After being in positive territory for most of the
day, shares slipped at the close on profit-taking. The benchmark
Composite Index closed down 3.55 points at 370.90.
	   SYDNEY: The benchmark All Ordinaries index was up 2 percent at
2,540.2.
	   TAIPEI: The key Weighted Price Index closed up 2.14 percent at
6,674.89, mostly on a technical rebound in the wake of Tuesday's
1.3 percent tumble.
	   WELLINGTON: The key index was up 0.64 percent at 1,715.88 points
on a technical rebound.
	   SEOUL: South Korean stocks were buoyed by the weaker U.S.
dollar. The key Kospi index gained 1.7 percent to 313.49.

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl for
European Commission president?
	   Members of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union suggested in
interviews released Wednesday that the European post would be
ideally suited Kohl, whose push for closer European integration was
one of the cornerstones of his 16 years as chancellor.
	   ``Kohl's towering experience in foreign and European affairs is
recognized on all sides,'' said Lower Saxony state party chairman
Christian Wulff. ``There'd be certainly great support in Europe for
such a suggestion.''
	   Ole von Beust, CDU leader in the Hamburg state government,
called on Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder to nominate Kohl to
succeed current president Jacques Santer, whose 5-year term expires
in 2000.
	   The president of the European Commission is chosen by the
leaders of the 15 European Union governments and must be confirmed
by the European Parliament.
	   The president heads a 20-member EU executive that runs the
union's day-to-day affairs.

Two mine workers killed in accidents in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two mine workers were killed in separate
accidents in eastern Ukraine, pushing this year's number of mine
fatalities to more than 300, officials said Wednesday.
	   One worker died from an electrical shock in the coal-producing
Luhansk region on Tuesday and another, a train driver, died
following an unspecified breach of safety rules at a separate mine
in the area.
	   Both mines where the accidents occurred belong to the the
Donbasantratsyt state coal company, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   A total of 301 people have died in mine accidents in Ukraine so
far in 1998, about 100 more than over the same period last year,
according to government statistics.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been increasing
steadily in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year was in April, when a methane
gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the eastern Donetsk
region.

Ukraine reports fall in industrial production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's industrial production in the
first nine months of 1998 fell 0.3 percent compared to the same
period last year, officials said Wednesday.
	   The country's metallurgy and machine-building industries
accounted for the fall, deputy presidential chief of staff Pavlo
Haidutsky said.
	   He said the two sectors, which account for about 40 percent of
Ukraine's industrial production and export most of their products,
were struck by the crisis in international markets, which forced
them to significantly cut their exports.
	   Ukraine has experienced steady economic decline since the Soviet
collapse in 1991, but reported small economic growth in the first
half of 1998.
	   However, the former Soviet republic's economy is expected to
shrink again this year due to a financial crisis that hit the
country following the turmoil in neighboring Russia.

Chief executive delivers blueprint for economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with more detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa offered no new
proposals Wednesday to rescue Hong Kong from recession, but
promised in a policy address that the the government is committed
to maintaining a free market economy.
	   Tung painted a gloomy picture in his second such address, saying
Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into 1999.''
	   He said the budget deficit may far exceed the June estimate of
20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.56 billion) due to the
economic downturn, and the deficit may retard growth in government
expenditure in the next few years.
	   Hong Kong's economic recovery hinges on ``an improvement in the
external economic environment, a steadying of interest rates,
stability in property market and the restoration of public
confidence,'' he said.
	   The government's priority now is to stabilize property prices,
which have fallen 50 percent since last October, he added.
	   He announced the suspension of a small subsidized middle-class
housing program in an attempt to boost the private market, but
stopped short of scrapping a housing construction target set last
year, which has been widely blamed for the property slump.
	   He also declined to disclose the government's plan when a
nine-month freeze on land sales expires next March.
	   Week's after Tung's inaugural policy address last year, Hong
Kong was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming
economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   In Wednesday's address, Tung urged Hong Kong to strengthen ties
with the rest of China for faster recovery from recession, and
urged international cooperation to monitor global fund movements
and stop economic crises from spreading.
	   ``In an integrated global market, no single economy can expect
to be immune from the results of financial turmoil elsewhere in the
world,'' he said.
	   Tung also reiterated that ``the linked exchange rate is to
stay,'' and ``no foreign exchange control shall be applied.''
	   The Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar has been under
serious attack by speculators betting the Hong Kong dollar will
sink. To defend the currency link, the government has to keep
interest rates high.
	   Tung also defended the much-criticized government market
intervention in late August, when it spent an estimated 15 percent
of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves to buy stocks and futures
to keep share prices at levels that would punish speculators
betting on a decline.
	   The government later imposed more stringent trading regulations
to make illegal trading and speculation more difficult.
	   Tung said the intervention and new regulations were needed to
counter harmful speculative activities and stabilize interest
rates.
	   He said it was ``not our intention to interfere with market
forces,'' and that the aim was ``to consolidate Hong Kong's ability
to manage its monetary affairs.''
	   Tung emphasized the need to diversify Hong Kong's economic base.
Despite the projected deficit, he pledged 5 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 641 million) to promote the high-tech industry.
	   To most people's disappointment, Tung largely failed to promise
new measures to ease unemployment.
	   Before his speech, a small group of protesters slipped a
petition into his car, and waved a banner saying, ``Failure. Out of
Control. Unemployment. Disappointment.''

Faction health official warns of drought in Bay, Bakool regions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ A Somali political faction Wednesday
warned of a serious drought in southern Bay and Bakool regions.
	   Dr. Ali Mohamed Ibrahim, health affairs secretary for the Somali
Democratic Movement, said 3,000 people are facing starvation in 10
remote villages in the Bakool region. He said two small children
and an elderly woman died from hunger in one of the villages.
	   The drought comes after heavy flooding earlier in the year that
washed away grain stored from the previous harvest and crops that
had been planted.
	   ``The land has almost become barren after the crops have been
washed away last year,'' Ibrahim told reporters in the Somali
capital.
	   He said hundreds of people have fled their homes to seek
sanctuary and pray for rain at the Sheikh Aweys shrine in Biyoley
village, 75 kilometers (46 miles) northeast of Huddor, the regional
capital.
	   Huddor is 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of Mogadishu.
	   People arriving from the affected region say the situation is
aggravated by clashes between militiamen loyal to Mogadishu warlord
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the Rahawein Resistance Army.
	   The fighting discourges subsistence farmers from returning to
their plots.
	   Ibrahim said diseases related to malnutrition like tuberculosis
and diarrhea, as well as malaria, are gaining ground in the region
where no humanaitarian organizations are operating because of the
lack of security.
	   Ibrahim said the World Food Program has only managed to deliver
400 tons of food to the region in the past two months, barely
enough to feed one village.

Albright holds three-way talks with Netanyahu, Arafat

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright convened three-way talks Wednesday with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders in hopes of moving closer to a
long-sought West Bank accord.
	   Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of
hurdles in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The three had a three-way handshake as they posed for
photographs at the start of the low-expectation meeting. Albright,
Netanyahu and Arafat sat around a square table so small their knees
and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while she is in
the region. But Albright hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held
Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether Arafat was ready to
inch closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United States basically
shares, that the Palestinian authority could do more to control
terrorists on territory under its control.
	   Albright said Tuesday there were ``tough choices that both sides
have to make'' before U.S. President Bill Clinton hosts the summit
with Netanyahu and Arafat. The summit date is not fixed yet, with
Oct. 15 and Oct. 20 possible starting dates. The location could be
the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, or somewhere else
in the Washington area.
	   Netanyahu has basically agreed to relinquish 13 percent of the
West Bank, on top of the 27 percent promised to the Palestinians
earlier, with 3 percent set aside for a nature preserve under joint
Israeli-Palestinian security control.
	   But with security and other issues still up in the air, Rubin
said the peace process is ``not back on track'' yet.
	   ``I think we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where
some heavy lifting is going to be required,'' Rubin said Tuesday.
``We do not envisage it as a photo-op in which everything is
pre-cooked.''
	   After Albright leaves the Mideast, probably later Wednesday,
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin
Indyk will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
	   Whatever the outcome, Albright said the United States intends to
pursue a better relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for
its own sake.''
	   ``We have thought for some time about increasing the level of
discourse,'' she said.
	   But she declined to say whether the administration was setting
the stage for dealing ultimately with a Palestinian state.
	   Heading into the meeting at Erez, Arafat blamed Israel for the
continued deadlock in the negotiations. Addressing a gathering of
U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said he has long accepted a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security gestures.
	   ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said.
	   Israel's main demand is that the Palestinians stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement
brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials was
vetoed by Netanyahu.
	   Palestinian and Israeli officials said no progress has been made
on revising the document. CIA Director George Tenet has arrived in
the region and is participating in the negotiations, said a
Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

sanctuary and pray for rain at the Sheikh Aweys shrine in Biyoley
village, 75 kilometers (46 miles) northeast of Huddor, the regional
capital.
	   Huddor is 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of Mogadishu.
	   People arriving from the affected region say the situation is
aggravated by clashes between militiamen loyal to Mogadishu warlord
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the Rahawein Resistance Army.
	   The fighting discourges subsistence farmers from returning to
their plots.
	   Ibrahim said diseases related to malnutrition such as
tuberculosis and diarrhea, as well as malaria, are gaining ground
in the region where no humanaitarian organizations are operating
because of the lack of security.
	   Ibrahim said the World Food Program has only managed to deliver
400 tons of food to the region in the past two months, barely
enough to feed one village.

	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright convened three-way talks Wednesday with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders in hopes of moving closer to a
long-sought West Bank accord.
	   Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of
hurdles in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The three had a three-way handshake as they posed for
photographs at the start of the low-expectation meeting. Albright,
Netanyahu and Arafat sat around a square table so small their knees
and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.
	   At one point during the meeting, Albright got up and walked out
of the room, leaving Netanyahu and Arafat to talk alone. It was the
first time in a year the two leaders spoke without mediators.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while Albright
is in the region. But she hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border, 6th graf pvs.

Taiwan dollar rises to 5-month high in heavy trading

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The central bank bought up to U.S. dlrs
500 million to slow the appreciation of the local currency as the
Taiwan dollar rose against the U.S. dollar for the seventh straight
trading day Wednesday, foreign exchange dealers said.
	   Despite the central bank's intervention, the U.S. dollar still
fell to an 18-week low of 33.346 Taiwan dollars as exporters,
importers and holders of foreign currency deposits continued to
dump the U.S. currency because of the surging Japanese yen, dealers
said.
	   The last time the dollar was that low was on June 1, when it
bought 33.230 Taiwan dollars.
	   Trading volume hit U.S. dlrs 876.5 million, the highest level in
a year.
	   The central bank was buying the U.S. currency because exporters
were complaining of the speed of Taiwan's recent currency
appreciation, and to replenish foreign reserves spent defending the
Taiwan dollar during its recent fall, said a dealer at a European
bank.
	   Central bank intervention is likely to continue Thursday, with
the U.S. dollar expected to fall below 33 Taiwan dollars in coming
sessions, said a dealer at a U.S. bank.

Report: French tests confirm nerve gas components on Iraqi
</HEADLINE>
warheads &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ France has detected traces of nerve gas on Iraqi
warheads, The New York Times reported Wednesday, four months after
the United States reached the same conclusion and accused Iraq of
lying about its chemical weapons program.
	   Testing on samples taken from the weapons reportedly show
evidence of chemicals linked to VX, a drop of which on the skin, or
inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes.
	   Iraq, which has had to endure seven years of United Nations
weapons inspections, has admitted it tried to make VX but has
denied it was ever able to make enough of it or stabilize it
sufficiently to load into weapons.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify Iraq has destroyed its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range missiles to
deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift crippling
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the
Gulf War.
	   Swiss tests on warheads turned up negative.
	   But a U.S. army laboratory, in tests whose results were
disclosed in June, concluded that missile fragments contained
traces of the gas.
	   Weapons experts told the Times that the French findings would
confirm the American tests. They showed the presence of components
found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed by Iraq and
dug up by U.N. inspectors.
	   Diplomats said the French were delaying the release of final
tests because they didn't want to undermine Iraq's push at the
United Nations this week to lift the sanctions, the Times said.
	   France, which has major commercial interests in Iraq, has urged
the United Nations to move faster to ease the sanctions imposed
after the Gulf War.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday that the
Security Council has a ``legal'' and ``moral'' obligation to lift
economic sanctions imposed against the nation after the Gulf War.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HINWIL, Switzerland (AP) _ Brazilian racing driver Pedro Diniz
has been signed by Swiss-based Sauber Petronas for the 1999 season,
the auto racing team said Wednesday.
	   Diniz, 28, who currently drives for the Arrows-Yamaha team, will
pair up with veteran French driver Jean Alesi, a press release from
Sauber said.
	   ``We are delighted that we could sign Pedro Diniz who has the
necessary experience with four years in Formula One and 65 Grands
Prix under his belt,'' the release quotes team principal Peter
Sauber as saying.
	   ``I am convinced that with Jean Alesi and Pedro Diniz, we will
have the strong driver pairing in the coming season to reach our
ambitious goals.''
	   Diniz said the team has the technical potential and the people
to make an important step forward next season.
	   He will take the place of British driver Johnny Herbert, who is
moving from Sauber to Stewart-Ford.

Thirsty for cash, the government targets the alcohol industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY107-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Smirnov's family began making vodka more
than a century ago, and has always had to satisfy two unquenchable
thirsts: the Russian love of strong drink, and the government's
craving for taxes.
	   Russia's czars got up to half their revenue from taxing vodka.
The Communists went one better, nationalizing the entire industry,
including the Smirnov firm. And now President Boris Yeltsin's
government seeks to fill its empty treasury by imposing greater
control on Russia's prolific alcohol producers.
	   ``The government already takes almost everything we make,''
claimed Smirnov, a burly, bearded man who runs Smirnov vodka from a
pastel yellow mansion just a few blocks from the Kremlin. ``If they
ruin the alcohol business, then Russia won't have any money or
anything to drink.''
	   But with the Russian government broke, and the economy crumbling
by the day, the alcohol industry is once again an irresistible
target.
	   Yeltsin issued a decree Tuesday that calls for the government to
take a controlling stake in all 184 distilleries that legally make
pure alcohol.
	   In most instances, the government already has a controlling
interest in the distilleries, but that hasn't prevented a river of
untaxed, illicit spirits from flowing onto the market.
	   The companies that purchase their pure alcohol from the
distilleries and then make name brands, such as Stolichnaya and
Smirnov vodka, will remain in private hands, but they fear the
greater regulation will affect them as well.
	   According to the government, Russians consume a staggering 2.1
billion liters of vodka a year _ that's 28 bottles for every man,
woman and child.
	   But fewer than 1 billion liters come from government-licensed
producers, which means that more than half of all vodka is eluding
the tax man.
	   Some bootleg booze comes from the licensed distilleries that
secretly produce extra alcohol. The remainder comes from the
bootleggers.
	   Russia's free-for-all capitalism has created a robust, if
chaotic, market with dozens of domestic and foreign companies
selling cheap, plentiful booze. Indeed, the alcohol business is one
of the country's few hardy industries.
	   Boris Smirnov has been able to re-establish the firm that the
Communists commandeered. He's also engaged in a protracted legal
battle with the American-made brand, Smirnoff, which has been
produced abroad since the 1930s, when a Smirnov family member who
had left Russia sold the name.
	   Smirnov's company now offers pepper vodka, as well as lemon,
orange and cranberry. There's even cowberry and whortleberry vodka.
	   Consumers are happy, but the government now gets no more than 4
percent of its revenues from alcohol taxes, down from roughly 25
percent during much of the Communist era.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said the government has no
intention of nationalizing private firms, but it does want a better
grip on the wholesale alcohol trade. The new plan could raise an
additional 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion) a year.
	   The scheme revives an age-old question about: Who is more
addicted to the bottle, ordinary Russian citizens or their
government?
	   The newspaper Trud traced the first Russian alcohol tax to the
10th century, uncovered reports of bootleggers in the 15th century,
and said the first anti-alcohol campaign began _ and failed _ in
1652.
	   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev tried to persuade his
countrymen to give up the bottle a decade ago. They didn't, and he
earned their eternal enmity.
	   Yeltsin, who's been known to enjoy a drink, has portrayed legal
consumption as a patriotic duty.
	   ``When people spend their money on vodka, it should go to the
treasury, not to swindlers,'' Yeltsin said in a radio address last
year. ``We will give (the tax money) to pensioners, soldiers,
doctors and teachers. It will help build the economy.''
	   Yeltsin's government last year banned vodka sales from street
kiosks, where much bootleg vodka is sold. But enterprising kiosk
owners built tiny add-on rooms so they could then pretend they were
full-fledged stores, and thereby sell vodka.
	   The government also tried to raise the minimum price for vodka,
but that just further stimulated the black market. Legal vodka
costs 30 rubles (dlrs 2) a bottle, and remains affordable even for
poor Russians.
	   Smirnov said his company makes less than one ruble (seven U.S.
cents) for each bottle of vodka it sells, and almost half of that
goes to taxes.
	   ``The government should do more to fight bootleggers,'' Smirnov
said. ``It should implement all the old laws before it introduces
new ones.''

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German runner Uta Pippig, a three-time
Boston marathon winner, has been suspended by the German Athletics
Federation for abnormally high levels of testosterone, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Pippig was tested during training in Boulder, Colorado, on April
23, said Theo Rous, vice president of the German Athletics
Federation (DLV) and its chief anti-doing official.
	   ``We have a suspicion. Until now, Ms. Pippig has not banned, no
guilt has been proven,'' Rous said.
	   But if DLV legal committee rules that Pippig is guilty of doping
she will be banned for two years, Rous said.
	   Both test samples revealed abnormally high levels of
testosterone, a male sex hormone used by athletes to enhance
performance illegally, said Klaus Mueller, chief of the Kreischa
lab that examined Pippig's samples.
	   Pippig told the lab she took some medicine to battle a viral
infection, but Mueller ruled out that it could have led to such
results.
	   ``Such a connection does not exist,'' he told InfoRadio Berlin.
Mueller would not speculate on what else could have caused
abnormally high levels of testosterone.
	   Pippig won the Boston Marathon three years in a row, between
1994 and 1996, and the New York Marathon in 1993. She has also won
the Berlin Marathon three times.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Marauding bands of young activists shot
and killed two policemen and set fire to more than 100 vehicles,
including passenger buses, in Pakistan's largest city on Wednesday
_ the second day of unrest following the killing of two political
leaders.
	   Another three people, semi-conscious and badly beaten, were
dragged from a vehicle and shot, said ambulance workers who
recovered the bodies.
	   Eight people have been killed in the unrest so far, according to
police and ambulance workers. The bodies of several of the dead
showed signs of torture.
	   Police said three security personnel were wounded when gunmen
attacked their armored van as they patrolled the violent streets.
Their condition was not life threatening.
	   Throughout this usually teeming city of 14 million people the
streets were deserted and in the hardest hit areas people stayed
indoors while outside the sounds of gunfire was continuous.
	   Some neighborhoods have been shut down since Monday when Abdul
Qadir and Aamir Zaki of the Muttiheda Qami Movement were shot to
death. Armed activists were seen forcing store owners to remain
shut again Wednesday.
	   They also warned buses and taxis to stay off the roads, which
were littered with rocks, bricks and broken furniture in eastern
and central Karachi.
	   Police patrolled in bullet proof vests and armored vehicles,
backed up by paramilitary troops known as Rangers with automatic
rifles and armored personnel carriers.
	   An ethnic-based party, the MQM split into two factions several
years ago. Since then, the rival groups have been waging a bitter
and increasingly violent battle for control of the city.
	   There also were reports of a total shut down in other cities of
southern Sindh province where the MQM also dominates.
	   Violence between the rival factions escalated earlier this year
as their battle for control of the city intensified. Police
officials say the death toll is more than 600.
	   The slain leaders belonged to the largest MQM faction led by
Altaf Hussein, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Britain
for the past five years. Hussein's faction is one of the the
largest parties in the Sindh provincial legislature and is
currently a member of the ruling coalition government. However
differences with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League has strained the
coalition.
	   Hussein's faction has accused the government of dragging its
feet in its efforts to clamp down on the rival Haqiqi faction. In
the Sindh Parliament, the Hussein faction has withdrawn from the
Cabinet while remaining within the coalition.
	   ``We have already warned the government to take action,'' said
Kamar Khalid Yunus, a spokesman for the Hussein faction. He accused
Pakistan's powerful intelligence agencies of masterminding the
attacks on the MQM workers in an attempt to weaken its political
strength.
	   ``We just don't believe the government can control the
intelligence agencies,'' he said.
	   Some supporters of the Hussein faction say the Rangers, who are
controlled by the federal government, also are being used to
control the group.

Cambodian government to stay put until next administration formed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ As negotiations between the ruling
party and opposition remained deadlocked, Cambodia's government
repeated Wednesday its intention to remain in place until the next
administration is formed.
	   A television station supporting Cambodian leader Hun Sen
publicized a directive signed by Hun Sen and his co-prime minister
Ung Huot ordering government officials to continue working in their
current capacities.
	   ``The current government, which is expected to leave office,
will remain to conduct its day-to-day business until the new
government assumes office,'' the co-premiers wrote.
	   Negotiations between Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party
opposition deadlocked Monday when both sides refused to budge from
the positions they have held since Hun Sen narrowly won the July 26
national election.
	   The ruling party, which won a majority in parliament but not the
two-thirds necessary to form the government by itself, is eager to
see a new coalition government installed.
	   But the opposition claims that Hun Sen's electoral victory was
achieved through fraud and intimidation. It insists that its
allegations must be thoroughly investigated before parliament holds
its first official meeting.
	   Wednesday's televised order appeared to be in reaction to a
statement released Sunday by the junior opposition party led by
former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party contended that a Cabinet meeting held last
week was illegal on grounds that the current government cannot
continue to function unless the new National Assembly extends it
mandate.
	   Hun Sen has repeatedly and forcefully rejected such suggestions.
During one negotiating session with the opposition last month, the
Cambodian leader warned that an attempt to set up an interim
caretaker government would be tantamount to a coup and would
provoke military action by the government.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday night, the Security Council
declared that the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied
with U.N. resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
special Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London. Holbrooke also may brief U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday in Brussels.
	   But momentum toward intervention was building. Britain and
France both recommended Wednesday that their nationals leave
Yugoslavia; Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday in Beijing.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
afternoon indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   ``I believe everything will be settled peacefully, but if they
strike we will defend ourselves,'' Marjanovic said.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``We have to make sure he (Milosevic) is withdrawing from a
position where he is able to commit these atrocities, these acts of
barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know very clearly that if he
doesn't then serious action will follow,'' Blair said in a BBC
radio interview Wednesday.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Serb nationalists already are lining up behind Milosevic in his
defiant stance toward the West. The notorious Serb warlord known as
Arkan has threatened to regroup his paramilitary fighters, widely
accused of atrocities in the war in Bosnia, to attack Western
forces if they intervene.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles,'' he said in comments
reported by Belgrade media Wednesday. ``We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Markets across Asia closed sharply higher
Wednesday, lifted by major gains by Japan's currency and stock
prices and hopes for quick reforms in the world's second-largest
economy. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its second-largest
points gain this year _ and closed at 13,825.61. Investors were
encouraged when the governing Liberal Democratic Party submitted to
Parliament a bank rescue bill that incorporated many of the
political opposition's proposals, making quick passage likely.
Thailand's key SET index gained 6.08 percent to 263.23 points;
Indonesia's JSX index gained 3.12 percent to 266.170; and
Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index soared 3.4 percent,
closing at 921.57. Meanwhile, the yen strengthened against the U.S.
dollar following comments by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and other officials that they were closely watching current
dollar-yen exchange rate movements. In late afternoon, the dollar
bought 128.18 yen, down 4.68 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below its late overnight level of 130.85 yen in New York. The
dollar now has fallen a total of 7.58 yen in two days. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party submitted a bill on Wednesday
to allow the government to use public money to bail out ailing
banks, sending stock prices soaring in a rush of optimism that the
government was finally beginning to act. Japanese banks, many of
them among the world's largest, are desperately in need of fresh
capital to restore reserves lost from writing off bad loans and to
buffer them against possible further losses. Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been under
intense pressure from world leaders to more aggressively tackle the
bad-loan crisis that contributes to Japan's recession. The bill
submitted Wednesday would establish a mechanism for injecting
capital into the debt-ridden banks. It also lets the government to
provide funds to both weak and healthy banks to ease the nation's
credit crunch and to help strong lenders take over failed
institutions. (JAPAN-BANK BILL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Wednesday gave his Communist deputy broad powers over the new
Cabinet's economic course, news reports said. However, Primakov
plans to personally oversee the Finance Ministry, which suggests he
wants to keep the final say on major economic decisions. The
premier says he will continue with economic reforms, but opposes
the ``wild capitalism'' that has characterized Russia's moves
toward a market economy. Primakov's First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, who served as the last head of the Soviet central
planning agency, will be in charge of economics and trade
ministries and various other bodies, including the committee that
oversees privatization. Liberal economists criticized Maslyukov,
saying he is likely to opt for at least some Soviet-style controls
on the economy. Russians frustrated by the country's deep economic
recession took to the streets in nationwide protests Wednesday, but
the crowds at the day's early rallies were much smaller than
organizers predicted. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY, RUSSIA-PROTESTS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the dollar worth more than four Israeli
shekels for the first time, Israel's finance minister hinted
Wednesday at a plot to undermine the Israeli currency. ``There are
clearly certain parties purchasing foreign currency and driving the
shekel down,'' Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said after shekel
plunged 2.7 percent to a record low Tuesday. Interviewed on Israel
radio, Neeman refused to name the parties, but hinted at banks
looking for quick profits. Banner headlines on the front pages of
Israeli newspapers knocked news of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's shuttle diplomacy mission into second place.
Reacting quickly, many Israeli merchants raised prices, explaining
that their imported merchandise is linked to the dollar exchange
rate. The shekel has lost 13 percent of its value against the
dollar since the beginning of the year, raising the specter of
inflation. (ISRAEL-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world's finance ministers have plenty of
ideas on fighting a global economic crisis that President Bill
Clinton calls the worst in a half century _ but they can't agree.
Heading toward a Thursday conclusion of a somber annual meeting for
the 182-nation International Monetary Fund, ministers and central
bank governors from wealthy and developing nations voiced
enthusiasm for action to stimulate economic growth. But they have
been unable to come up with any clear strategy to promote recovery
in Asia and keep Latin America from slipping over the precipice. On
Capitol Hill, House and Senate negotiators agreed Tuesday to grant
the full dlrs 18 billion the Clinton administration sought for the
International Monetary Fund _ if a package of reforms for the
organization can be worked out. In the past, the administration has
opposed such strings. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)

	   EREZ, Israel (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
flew to a border town for three-way talks Wednesday with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders on a long-sought West Bank accord.
Albright faced many hurdles in her second day of Mideast
peacemaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Ruled out in advance was
concluding an agreement while she is in the region. But Albright
hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most particularly security
measures to shield Israel from terrorism, ahead of a White House
summit later in the month. At Erez, on the border of Israel and
Palestinian-held Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether Arafat
was ready to move closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United
States basically shares, that the Palestinian authority could do
more to control terrorists on territory under its control.
(ALBRIGHT-MIDEAST)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With a House vote set for Thursday on
launching an open-ended impeachment inquiry, Democrats rushed to
counter Republican plans while still underscoring their disapproval
of President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. At the
White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart accused the Republican
leadership of using the impeachment issue ``to embarrass the
president'' and produce political gain for Republicans at the polls
this fall. Republican officials expressed confidence they would
prevail, thus making Clinton the third president in history to face
possible impeachment proceedings. The Republican-controlled House
Judiciary Committee approved a sweeping impeachment inquiry in a
party-line vote on Monday, after first brushing aside two
Democratic alternatives. Officials said the Republican plan permits
the committee to look at offenses uncovered in a separate
congressional probe of fund-raising practices in Clinton's 1996
campaign. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said that it hadn't yet gotten
satisfactory guarantees that the Security Council would conduct an
honest review of U.N. sanctions if Baghdad resumes cooperation with
arms inspectors. Without mentioning Washington by name, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday that the
``disturbing'' statements made by some council members this week
were to blame for the as-yet unresolved dispute. Aziz said that
after speaking to 14 of the 15 council members _ the United States
excluded _ he had the sense that they were willing to conduct an
honest review. Aziz has been in New York for over a week to try to
work out a deal with the U.N. chief in which Baghdad would reverse
its Aug. 5 decision to suspend cooperation with inspectors and in
return get a ``comprehensive review'' of its seven-year effort to
disarm itself. The review could force the council to recognize
Iraq's progress in destroying its weapons of mass destruction while
building momentum among some council members to ease sanctions on
Iraq, which have deprived it of its most valuable commodity, oil,
for eight years. (UN-IRAQ)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in
Tokyo Wednesday to begin four days of talks on new economic aid,
North Korea's missile program and how to ease lingering animosities
over Japan's brutal rule of Korea more than 50 years ago. Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to offer a dlrs 3 billion
package of loans to help South Korea overcome its severe economic
downturn. The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30
billion aid package for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in
response to international demands that Japan do more to ease the
region's financial crisis. Obuchi's talks with Kim will also touch
on the more symbolic but sensitive issue of Tokyo's occupation of
the Korean Peninsula from 1910-1945. Japanese leaders want to offer
a formal apology that is sincere enough to appease smoldering
Korean resentment without offending conservatives in Japan.

Report: Taliban ready to try Bin Laden for Khobar if Saudis want
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia is willing to
try Saudi renegade Osama bin Laden for the 1996 bombing of a U.S.
military complex in Saudi Arabia, provided a trial is requested by
the families of Saudi victims, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The respected Arab daily Al-Hayat said the Taliban recently
informed Saudi Arabia of ``its readiness to try'' the
multimillionaire Arab who has lived in exile in Afghanistan since
1996.
	   At least one of his Afghan training camps for Muslim militants
was attacked by the United States in retaliation for the bombings
of U.S. embassies in Africa in August. The United States said bin
Laden masterminded and financed the bombings, which killed 259
people and wounded thousands.
	   Al-Hayat said Taliban's offer appears to be an attempt to
restore relations with Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its diplomats
from Afghanistan last month, reportedly for hosting bin Laden.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report from either
Saudi officials or the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The United States suspects Bin Laden of financing several
terrorist strikes around the world, including the June 1996 bombing
of Khobar Towers, a U.S. military apartment complex in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were killed and
about 500 people were injured.
	   The Saudi government did not release any information on whether
any Saudis were killed or injured.
	   Saudi Arabia, one of the staunchest U.S. allies in the Gulf,
stripped bin Laden of his citizenship after Egypt, Algeria and
Yemen accused him of financing subversion. He was also disowned by
his family. A deeply religious man, bin Laden had participated in
the Afghan guerrilla war against the Soviet-backed government.
	   Al-Hayat, a London-based Saudi-owned newspaper, said the Taliban
also suggested that bin Laden be deported to a third country on the
condition that he will not be handed over to the United States.
	   Al-Hayat, monitored in Cairo, said the Saudis rejected a
suggestion that a committee of scholars from both countries discuss
their differences.

Philippine president says Asia needs wealthy nations' help out of
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Asian countries cannot recover
quickly from the region's financial storm without help from the
world's wealthiest nations because agencies such as the
International Monetary Fund have ``frighteningly insufficient''
funds, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday.
	   Estrada urged the United States and other rich nations to
contribute more to the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
	   The international financial institutions have been at the
forefront of bailing out Asian countries, including Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, ravaged by the 15-month financial
crisis.
	   Estrada said their help is crucial, ``but it is now clear that
the resources of these institutions, particularly the IMF, are
frighteningly insufficient.''
	   Therefore, additional commitments for financial support from
industrialized nations are needed for a quick recovery from the
regional crisis, Estrada told a meeting of trade ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Estrada also renewed a call for ASEAN to organize an
international conference on ways of reducing the negative impact on
developing countries of free flows of capital. Large amounts of
money flowed into many Asian countries for a number of years, and
then suddenly dried up last year as investors became wary of the
region.
	   ``The world is dealing with a new phenomenon of massive amounts
of capital flowing across national boundaries at lightning speed _
bloating economies into fragile bubbles as they rush in, and
shaking economies to their foundations as they are withdrawn,'' he
said.
	   Estrada said it was important for ASEAN countries to continue
reducing trade barriers and integrating their economies more
tightly to attract more investment.
	   ASEAN trade officials agreed Tuesday to hasten plans to demolish
trade barriers in the region to encourage business and investment
and help Asia recover from the financial storm.
	   The officials set a goal of complete elimination of tariffs for
many products traded in the region by the year 2003, instead of
their previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5 percent by
that year.
	   Later Wednesday, ASEAN officials were to sign an agreement
creating an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove barriers to
investment from other ASEAN countries by the year 2010, and by 2020
for investment from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country would be
granted the same privileges in areas such as land ownership and
investment rights as their counterparts in another ASEAN country in
which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions if a country's
constitution limits equal treatment.
	   Estrada also urged ASEAN countries to allow freer exchanges of
views, alluding to Southeast Asian countries troubled by internal
strife and sensitive to outside opinions.
	   While struggling to solve their economic problems, ASEAN
governments should also find ways of easing the plight of poor
people who have been particularly hurt, Estrada said.
	   ``The poorest of our masses, they who get hurt first and the
hardest in any economic downturn, will always be restive, and
rightly so, if the fruits of development go mostly to the already
well-off,'' he said.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Philippine stock index jumps 3.6 percent on yen gains, land

ownership report &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply
Wednesday on the back of gains by the Japanese yen against the
dollar and an unconfirmed report that the government may allow
foreigners to own land, traders said.
	   The higher yen also helped boost the peso, which closed higher
against the dollar.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 42.59 points,
or 3.6 percent, to 1,212.75, adding to its 3.62-point gain Tuesday.
	   Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for sales of
Orion-Squire Securities Inc., said the yen's strong performance
encouraged investors. The dollar fell below 130 yen in early
trading on speculation that interest rates may soon be cut in
Europe.
	   Aklan said buying interest, especially for property stocks, was
also spurred by a newspaper report Wednesday quoting sources as
saying the government intends to allow foreigners to wholly own
small pieces of land under certain conditions. At present,
Philippine laws bar foreigners from owning property.
	   ``That news was a big boost since it is expected to attract
foreign investors into the country and spur the property sector,''
said Aklan.
	   Gains posted by the yen helped quell fears of a fresh round of
currency weakness in the region, Aklan said. ``The stronger yen
more or less helped reduce speculation that the Hong Kong dollar
and China's yuan may be devalued soon,'' he said.
	   Wednesday's market gain may continue Thursday, but investors are
likely to remain cautious and may even be tempted to lighten up
their holdings soon after, Aklan said.
	   ``Nothing has really changed to justify buying activity,'' he
said, noting that the specter of a global recession remains.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.643 pesos, down from
Tuesday's average of 43.778 pesos. It was last traded at 43.680
pesos.
	   Traders said transactions were dominated by banks seeking to
take quick profits from buying and selling dollars.
	   The peso continues to follow the yen's trend as corporate demand
for dollars remains low, traders said.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market. It
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent and 16
percent, respectively.

Rebels, government battle for Congolese air base

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ A truckload of fighters wounded in the
battle for the strategic air base at Kindu arrived Wednesday in
this small town that is serving as a rear base for the rebel
attack.
	   Forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila _ that reportedly
include troops from Sudan _ appeared to be putting up strong
resistance since the rebels launched their attack Monday.
	   A dozen of weary, sweaty soldiers, some limping and others with
their bullet wounds wrapped in bloody bandages, were unloaded from
the truck in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu.
	   They were waiting to be airlifted to hospital in Goma, the rebel
stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) to the east on the Rwandan
border.
	   Rebel commander Richard Mondo said his forces continued to shell
Kindu and the fighting was still going on.
	   It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle
for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using
as a launching pad for air strikes on Goma and other rebel-held
towns in the east.
	   It is not clear who has been flying the planes and whether they
are part of the Democratic Republic of Congo's meager air force.
	   In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said in a communique on
Tuesday the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC) had fought off fresh rebel
attacks, leaving 18 rebels dead and others wounded or captured.
	   ``Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now
launched an offensive after defending its positions. The civilians
there are cooperating fully with the FAC as their counterparts did
previously in Kinshasa,'' said the statement broadcast on state-run
television.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers
in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ were said to be
facing stiff resistance.
	   Rebel commanders say their forces number at least 2,000 men
against an estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently reinforced
by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo.
	   Mondo said he was expecting air shipments of munitions to
bolster the offensive.
	   Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and
demonstrate they have what it takes to carry their two-month
rebellion into the rest of Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel
victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai
provinces, rich in copper and diamonds.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the
outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail
out Kabila.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion
that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and
creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.

NATO is ``ready to act,'' chief says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countdown for a NATO strike on Yugoslavia has
started and a final decision is likely ``in the coming days,'' NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana was quoted as saying in Wednesday's
edition of the French newspaper Le Monde.
	   ``We are ready to act,'' Solana was quoted as saying, adding
that only the ``final step'' -- activating NATO forces -- remains
before taking action.
	   ``I don't believe that we'll go beyond next week,'' Solana said
of a final decision.
	   ``We are awaiting the results of our efforts currently in
progress'' to end the crisis over Kosovo through negotiations.
	   Senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was in Belgrade for talks
with President Slobodan Milosevic to press him to comply with a
U.N. resolution.
	   Milosevic must meet U.N. conditions ``fully and in an
irreversible manner'' to avoid a NATO strike,'' Le Monde quoted
Solana as saying.
	   ``I repeat, the conditions that must be met, through negotiation
or through force,'' Solana said, listing the conditions: a
cease-fire and the withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo, the
return of refugees, the opening of negotiations between Belgrade
and the representatives of Kosovars for an interim accord on the
status of the province and international control.
	   Solana told the daily that a system of verification, which could
involve diverse forces be they NATO's or the United Nation's, is
needed to ensure that Serbia respects any commitments it makes.
Such a ``verification mechanism'' would have to be in place
``immediately'' after the start of any cease-fire, he added.
	   He said he viewed ``ground surveillance'' to ensure conditions
are being fulfilled as a ``fundamental necessity.''
	   Solana indicated that an OK from the U.N. Security Council was
not a necessity for NATO to act. Russia, one of the Council's five
permanent members, is opposed to a NATO strike.
	   The founding act of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gives
it ``the right to act alone,'' Solana was quoted as saying.
	   ``If we do nothing, we are moving toward a human catastrophe in
Kosovo'' as winter approaches, the NATO leader said.
	   ``If Mr. Milosevic does not respect U.N. resolutions, we are
ready to act,'' Le Monde quoted him as saying.

Police shoot dead suspected serial killers

 &UR; Eds: FIXES garble in last graf, adds reference to testimony of
5-year-old twins in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Police in southern India shot dead two
brothers suspected in a series of murders and rapes, saying they
tried to escape while being driven to court, police said Wednesday.
	   An escort of seven policemen were driving Kommiri Gundala Gopal,
38, and Kommiri Subramaniam, 33, to court on Tuesday when the van
they were traveling in skidded and overturned in a wooded area near
Tirupati, a town 1,625 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of the Indian
capital New Delhi, police said. The two brothers took advantage of
the confusion, snatched a revolver from a policeman and fired on
them.
	   ``They were asked to surrender but when they opened fire, the
police also fired at them, killing them on the spot,'' said K.S.
Jayachandra, inspector general of police.
	   Police have ordered an inquiry. The policemen escorting the two
had bruises but no bullet injuries.
	   The suspects were being taken to court because police had
requested they be held in jail until investigations were complete.
	   They had been arrested on the basis of fingerprints recovered
from the scenes of the crimes and the testimony of two 5-year-old
twins who saw them kill their parents in May this year.
	   The brothers were accused of killing 42 people and raping 12
women in Andhra Pradesh state and in the border districts of
neighboring Tamil Nadu state. Southern Indians traditionally use
their family name first.
	   Police said the brothers usually killed their victims, mostly
poor daily wage earners, by hitting them on the head with wooden
stumps, sickles or iron rods. The women were raped and then killed.
The motive was robbery, but they killed their victims because they
did not want to leave behind evidence, the brothers told
journalists in a meeting arranged by the police after their arrest.
	   The brothers were arrested in July after a manhunt involving
more than 1,000 policemen.

Russian oil tycoon predicts number of oil companies will merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's largest oil company predicted
that the country's economic crisis along with the slump in world
prices will lead to a consolidation of the nation's oil companies,
a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Vagit Alekperov of Lukoil company told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta that only few oil powerhouses, capable to compete on world
markets, would survive the current turmoil.
	   ``Oil companies will enlarge worldwide,'' he said. ``If we want
to be competitors, if we want to be an oil power, then we have to
create not 10 or 15, but two to three true international oil
companies.''
	   Alekperov said he expected Russia's oil production to contract
by 6-7 percent next year as world oil prices are likely to drop
further.
	   Oil executives have previously said they expect the country's
oil production to drop by 10 million to 15 million tons in 1998.
Oil production totaled about 297 million metric tons in 1997,
according to the State Statistics Committee.
	   In addition, he said, the Russian government's decision to
impose a 90-day moratorium on the country's debt payments is likely
to scare away Western investors. Alekperov said Lukoil has
continued to pay its foreign creditors despite the government's
move.
	   ``We have international obligations,'' he said. ``They are
material obligations and the state didn't prevent us from settling
our debts.''
	   Alekperov also voiced concern over the government's efforts to
step up tax collections from the country's largest exporters and
its plans to require exporters to sell most of their hard-currency
earnings at a special trading session controlled by Russia's
Central Bank.
	   In a separate development, a member of the board of Russia's
natural gas monopoly Gazprom said the government may sell part of
its 40-percent stock in the company.
	   So far the government has decided to sell 5 percent of the
stock, but may later sell up to 15 percent, Alexander Semenyaka
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A 25-percent stake in the company would be enough for the
government to control Gazprom, because no other investors have a
stake that large, Semenyaka said.

Berkovic threatens to quit West Ham after clash with Hartson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eyal Berkovic has threatened to quit West Ham
after claiming team-mate John Hartson kicked his head ``like a
football'' at a recent training session.
	   The Israeli international said Hartson deliberately kicked him
in the head, leaving him in agony and unable to eat for two days.
	   The Mirror newspaper Wednesday revealed graphic pictures of the
incident, taken from an amatuer video recording, on its front and
back pages. The images clearly showed Hartson kicking Berkovic, who
was on his knees, in the face.
	   The incident followed a tackle which left Berkovic on the
ground.
	   Hartson, the tackler, later went to help Berkovic to his feet
but the Israeli midfielder waved his arms at the gesture. Hartson
allegedly retaliated with a kick and was led away by trainers as
Berkovic slumped back to the ground.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic was quoted saying in the Mirror.
	   He said the incident occured in a training run before West Ham's
Sept. 28 clash with Southampton but the West Ham management had
tried to cover it up.
	   The 7 million pound (dlrs 11.76) midfielder said he enjoyed
playing at West Ham but didn't think he could ``forgive and
forget'' Hartson's actions.
	   ``I am considering my future and I may have to move,'' he said.
	   Hartson, who is in France this week, said he liked Berkovic and
rated him a quality player.
	   The Welsh striker said he had apologized but would not comment
on Berkovic's allegations.
	   West Ham coach Harry Redknapp has denied any bad feeling between
the players.

German central banker nixes lowering rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's top central banker nixed
lowering interest rates in an interview released Wednesday, despite
calls to do so by the country's potential finance minister.
	   German Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer told the weekly
newspaper Die Zeit that the central bank has already done its bit
to provide for growth.
	   ``In Germany, interest rates are at a record low _ not only the
short term, but also the long term, which is decisive,'' Tietmeyer
was quoted as saying. ``We have therefore already made our
contribution to the German economy.''
	   A U.S. rate cut last week raised speculation in the financial
market that Germany, Europe's strongest economy, might follow suit,
in an effort to boost the economy.
	   Germany's finance minister-designate, Oskar Lafontaine, last
week said he was in favor of a rate cut, raising questions about
possible conflict between the central bank and Germany's incoming
government.
	   The Bundesbank is widely respected for its political
independence, which it guards carefully.
	   Asked to comment about Lafontaine's calls for a lower rate,
Tietmeyer said, ``I do consider a public and controversial
discussion legitimate.''
	   The Bundesbank was an independent institution, he added.
	   ``This status has always been accepted, and I'm sure that it
will also hold in the future,'' Tietmeyer said.
	   The center-left Social Democrats defeated long-term Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition in national elections last
week, and are expected to form a government at the end of October.

Report: Taiwanese, Chinese fishermen may unite against nuclear
</HEADLINE>
dump &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite a ban on direct contacts, Chinese
fishermen may join their Taiwanese neighbors in fighting plans for
a nuclear waste dump on a remote Taiwan-controlled island, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Residents of Putian County in China's coastal Fujian province
are alarmed about plans for the dump on Little Wuchiu Island, just
15 kilometers (9 miles) away, Taiwan's China Times Express
reported.
	   It quoted a resident of nearby Wuchiu Island as saying Chinese
fishermen have contacted islanders about the possibility of taking
joint action against the dump.
	   Juan Chin-sheng, a secretary at the Wuchiu township government,
declined to comment on the report, but said local residents
remained firm in their opposition to the dump.
	   In Putian, a spokesman for the county government said he was
unaware of the planned dump or any possible joint action against
it. But he said Putian would oppose the dump should Taiwan decide
to build it.
	   ``Of course we will oppose it,'' he said. ``The pollution would
be serious, it would be dangerous. We would fear a leak.''
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalists have banned direct transpiration,
communications and trade with the Chinese mainland since 1949, when
they fled the Communist takeover there. The ban is widely flaunted
in the Taiwan controlled islands off the Chinese coast.
	   In February, Taiwan's state-owned power company opted to build
the dump on the military and fishing outpost of Little Wuchiu.
	   Wuchiu and Little Wuchiu have just 300 residents, but the
township has vowed to resist the dump project. Taiwan Power Co. is
currently carrying out environmental impact assessments on the
island, and has promised 150 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.4
million) in compensation and subsidies to island residents.
	   The dump, scheduled to be completed in 2003, could store up to 1
million barrels of low-level radioactive waste.
	   Taiwan now stores more than 170,000 barrels of radioactive
waste, 97,000 at a facility on Orchid Island, where residents have
forced the power company to halt further shipments. The rest are
stored at three nuclear power plants where facilities already are
over capacity.

Report: Taliban ready to try Bin Laden for Saudi bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia is willing to
try Saudi renegade Osama bin Laden for the 1996 bombing of a U.S.
military complex in Saudi Arabia, provided a trial is requested by
the families of Saudi victims, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The respected Arab daily Al-Hayat said the Taliban recently
informed Saudi Arabia of ``its readiness to try'' the
multimillionaire Arab who has lived in exile in Afghanistan since
1996.
	   At least one of his Afghan training camps for Muslim militants
was attacked by the United States in retaliation for the bombings
of U.S. embassies in Africa in August. The United States said bin
Laden masterminded and financed the bombings, which killed 259
people and wounded thousands.
	   Al-Hayat said Taliban's offer appears to be an attempt to
restore relations with Saudi Arabia, which withdrew its diplomats
from Afghanistan last month, reportedly for hosting bin Laden.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report from either
Saudi officials or the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan.
	   The United States suspects Bin Laden of financing several
terrorist strikes around the world, including the June 1996 bombing
of Khobar Towers, a U.S. military apartment complex in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were killed and
about 500 people were injured.
	   The Saudi government did not release any information on whether
any Saudis were killed or injured.
	   Saudi Arabia, one of the staunchest U.S. allies in the Gulf,
stripped bin Laden of his citizenship after Egypt, Algeria and
Yemen accused him of financing subversion. He was also disowned by
his family. A deeply religious man, bin Laden had participated in
the Afghan guerrilla war against the Soviet-backed government.
	   Al-Hayat, a London-based Saudi-owned newspaper, said the Taliban
also suggested that bin Laden be deported to a third country on the
condition that he will not be handed over to the United States.
	   Al-Hayat, monitored in Cairo, said the Saudis rejected a
suggestion that a committee of scholars from both countries discuss
their differences.

Barcelona stadium to host European Champions' League final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Barcelona could play final at home

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Spanish soccer giant Barcelona will be
playing on home turf if it reaches the final of the European
Champions' Cup after UEFA on Wednesday selected the club's Nou Camp
stadium as the venue for the competition's crowning game.
	   The May 26 final of the flagship competition was expected to be
scheduled for a neutral venue.
	   But European soccer's governing body said after a meeting here
that for organizational reasons it could not wait until later in
the tournament to see which clubs made it through to the final.
	   Barcelona is in Group D of the Champions' League and has already
won a match and tied another after two rotations in its four-team
group.
	   The six group winners, as well as the two best runners-up,
qualify for the quarter-finals.
	   UEFA said the move was not unprecedented because Barcelona
played at home in the 1982 final of the European Cup Winners' Cup,
where it beat Belgium's Standard Liege 2-1.
	   Villa Park, the Birmingham home of English Premier League club
Aston Villa, will host the May 19 final of the Cup Winners' Cup,
while Spartak Moscow's 84,000-seat Luzhniki stadium will be the
venue for the May 12 final of the UEFA Cup.
	   Nou Camp, which has a capacity of 92,000, and Luzhniki were
among the 12 five-star venues listed by UEFA as possible sites for
the final of its Champions' League competition.
	   Villa Park, which has a capacity of 39,339, was classed as a
four-star venue.

Minor suspected of killing British soldier goes on trial

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ A minor accused of killing a British
soldier went on trial Wednesday, along with four suspected
accomplices.
	   The minor, identified only by initials D.S., is charged with
premeditated murder. The victim, Simian Jeans, was hit in the head
with a stone during an argument in the coastal city of Split in
1966 and died nine days later.
	   The trial is closed to the public, due to main suspect's minor
status. His age was not available but people under 18 are
considered minors in Croatia.
	   The four others are charged with assault.
	   Jeans, 25, was in Croatia as a British member of the NATO-led
force mostly deployed in neighboring Bosnia in the aftermath of the
war.
	   Jeans and fellow soldiers tangled with locals on Sept. 6, 1996
in a city discotheque. They separated, but afterward, the Croatians
attacked them outside, beating them with steel bars, stones and
chunks of marble, said the indictment quoted by the state-run HINA
news agency.
	   The other British soldiers were not seriously injured.
	   HINA also cited a police statement that concluded that the
soldiers were neither drunk nor responsible for provoking the
brawl.

Senior bureaucrat in Thai health ministry rejects resignation
</HEADLINE>
calls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The senior civil servant in Thailand's
health ministry has refused to heed his colleagues' calls to resign
to take responsibility for a corruption scandal, local newspapers
reported Wednesday.
	   Two senior political appointees in the ministry, the minister
and one of his deputies, resigned after it was disclosed that state
hospitals were forced to buy supplies at inflated prices from
designated private suppliers.
	   At a meeting of some 500 doctors and medical officials Tuesday,
a senior official of the ministry's Communicable Disease Control
department and other doctors called for the resignation of Health
Ministry Permanent Secretary Prakrom Vuthipongse, the newspaper
Bangkok Post reported
	   The CDC's Dr. Vichai Chokeviwat said Prakrom had to take
responsibility for the affair because he was close to one of the
officials who investigators said was responsible for the scandal.
	   The head of a hospital in the northeastern province of Nakhon
Ratchasima, Dr. Waranyoo Satayavongtip, also criticized Prakrom.
	   ``Frankly speaking, the permanent secretary's standing has been
damaged,'' he said. ``When the case surfaced, he did not help us at
all and now we have no confidence in his ability to lead us in the
right direction.''
	   Prakrom responded that he had no plans to resign.
	   Some anti-corruption activists at the meeting charged that the
procurement scandal was continuing, the Post reported.
	   Prakrom said he would investigate the allegations.

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a last attempt to narrow
the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held three-way talks Wednesday with the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders.
	   During the two-hour meeting, Albright twice left the room to let
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat talk alone. It was the first time in a year that
Arafat and Netanyahu spoke without mediators.
	   In a change of plans, the three decided to continue their talks
over lunch. Initial plans called for Netanyahu to return to
Jerusalem and only Arafat and Albright to have lunch together.
	   At the start of the three-way meeting, the three sat around a
square table so small their knees and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.

Habibie cancels trip to Malaysia citing busy work schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has
canceled a planned trip to neighboring Malaysia this month and
might not attend an Asia-Pacific leaders' meeting there in
November, news reports said Wednesday.
	   The Indonesian Observer quoted Foreign Minister Ali Alatas as
saying Habibie is facing a busy work schedule at home.
	   However, the announcement, which had been widely anticipated,
follows criticism by Habibie of the treatment meted out to
Malaysia's sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been
arrested on sex and corruption charges.
	   In an interview published by the newspaper The Nation in
Thailand during the weekend, Habibie voiced concern about Anwar,
whom he described as a friend.
	   In the interview, Habibie also said he would find it difficult
to attend the meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group to be held in Kuala Lumpur next month.
	   Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the
successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the
two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against
Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Anwar has been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal
under Malaysian law.
	   In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he
said he had been beaten by police, heightening international
attention to his case.
	   Had Habibie's visit to Kuala Lumpur gone ahead this month, it
would have been his first official presidential trip outside of
Indonesia since he came to power five months ago.
	   Habibie replaced autocratic President Suharto in May after riots
and protests against Suharto's rule amid the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   Recently, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was
considering not going to the APEC meeting because of Anwar's
arrest.

Photographer takes World Cup star to court after bar scuffle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A photographer on Wednesday filed a
complaint against Fabien Barthez, alleging that the French World
Cup goalkeeper destroyed his film after a scuffle in a Toulouse
bar.
	   Nicolas Auera, who works for the Toulouse daily La Depeche du
Midi, alleged that Barthez grabbed his film after he shot photos of
the shaven-headed goalkeeper with his companion, model Linda
Evangelista.
	   Auera filed a complaint against Barthez, Evangelista and the
owner of the bar, not identified by name.
	   Auera, recounting the Monday incident to The Associated Press,
said Barthez refused an interview and photos to a colleague at Le
Peri restaurant-bar. Auera said he took a seat on the terrace,
hoping to get a shot when the couple left.
	   ``Fabien Barthez jumped on me and took me inside the bar. There,
the owner squeezed my neck against the bar,'' the photographer
claimed. He said that Ms. Evangelista asked how she could recover
the film. ``I opened the camera myself.''
	   But the soccer star then grabbed the unwound role of film --
that included other reporting assignments, the photographer
alleged.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said.
	   Despite a Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units, a U.S. spokesman admitted Wednesday there was no
international consensus for military action against the Serbs.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London.
	   Preparations for intervention continued Wednesday. Britain and
France both recommended that their nationals leave Yugoslavia.
Germany said it had begun removing families of staffers in its
Belgrade embassy.
	   Canada has already evacuated all nonessential diplomatic staff
and their families from Belgrade, and U.S. officials said
dependents of its embassy employees would soon be evacuated.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said in Beijing.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him he must comply with
U.N. resolutions or face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood, Holbrooke had only terse public comments
Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely serious,'' he said.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday night, the Security Council
declared that the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied
with U.N. resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
special Serb police units.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London. Holbrooke also may brief U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday in Brussels.
	   But momentum toward intervention was building. Britain and
France both recommended Wednesday that their citizens leave
Yugoslavia; Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday in Beijing.
	   After a Tuesday night meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in
Belgrade, diplomatic sources said Milosevic was still refusing to
accept international demands, particularly the withdrawal of all
security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader repeatedly claimed
there has been no military activity in the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
afternoon indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
	   ``I believe everything will be settled peacefully, but if they
strike we will defend ourselves,'' Marjanovic said.
	   The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out. So
far, however, international diplomatic observers have disputed Serb
claims.
	   On Tuesday, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles
of all sorts _ from armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded
with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   ``We have to make sure he (Milosevic) is withdrawing from a
position where he is able to commit these atrocities, these acts of
barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know very clearly that if he
doesn't then serious action will follow,'' Blair said in a BBC
radio interview Wednesday.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   Serb nationalists already are lining up behind Milosevic in his
defiant stance toward the West. The notorious Serb warlord known as
Arkan has threatened to regroup his paramilitary fighters, widely
accused of atrocities in the war in Bosnia, to attack Western
forces if they intervene.
	   ``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles,'' he said in comments
reported by Belgrade media Wednesday. ``We shall not allow
ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power.''

Rebels, government battle for Congolese air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: in 6th graf, CLARIFIES that Goma has not been bombed and that
base used for build up of government ground troops as well &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ A truckload of fighters wounded in the
battle for the strategic air base at Kindu arrived Wednesday in
this small town that is serving as a rear base for the rebel
attack.
	   Forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila _ that reportedly
include troops from Sudan _ appeared to be putting up strong
resistance since the rebels launched their attack Monday.
	   A dozen of weary, sweaty soldiers, some limping and others with
their bullet wounds wrapped in bloody bandages, were unloaded from
the truck in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu.
	   They were waiting to be airlifted to hospital in Goma, the rebel
stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) to the east on the Rwandan
border.
	   Rebel commander Richard Mondo said his forces continued to shell
Kindu and the fighting was still going on.
	   It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle
for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using
as a launching pad for air strikes on eastern towns as well as an
assembly point for ground troops.
	   It is not clear who has been flying the planes and whether they
are part of the Democratic Republic of Congo's meager air force.
	   In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said in a communique on
Tuesday the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC) had fought off fresh rebel
attacks, leaving 18 rebels dead and others wounded or captured.
	   ``Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now
launched an offensive after defending its positions. The civilians
there are cooperating fully with the FAC as their counterparts did
previously in Kinshasa,'' said the statement broadcast on state-run
television.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers
in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ were said to be
facing stiff resistance.
	   Rebel commanders say their forces number at least 2,000 men
against an estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently reinforced
by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo.
	   Mondo said he was expecting air shipments of munitions to
bolster the offensive.
	   Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and
demonstrate they have what it takes to carry their two-month
rebellion into the rest of Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel
victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai
provinces, rich in copper and diamonds.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the
outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail
out Kabila.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion
that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and
creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Swissair pilot had trouble
landing his airliner with 245 passengers aboard on Wednesday
because of strong winds and a wet runway but brought it to a halt
without causing any injuries.
	   Johannesburg International Airport general manager Rory Mackey
said the MD-11 jetliner, on a flight from Zurich, went off the area
designated as a runway. An airport statement said the plane
``skidded off the edge of the runway,'' but Mackey clarified that
the aircraft never left the paved area.
	   A Swissair spokesman in Zurich said the pilot needed a longer
area to brake because of a strong tailwind and a rain-wet runway,
and that he missed the turnoff into the terminal.
	   Authorities said there were no reports of damage or injury.
	   The MD-11 jetliner was tugged to its parking area, and then
proceeded to its next destination, Cape Town, airport officials
said.
	   On Sept. 2, a Swissair MD-11 crashed off the coast of Nova
Scotia, killing 229 people.

Blair looks to promote business with China, as dissident detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS grafs 7-11 with Blair meeting Jiang, picks up 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair turned his
attention to promoting business ties with China Wednesday but human
rights issues intruded, with police taking a prominent dissident
from his home.
	   The police action against Xu Wenli, who spent 12 years in prison
after the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, came at an awkward moment.
Blair's Labor Party government has vowed to exercise an ethical
foreign policy and before leaving Britain he promised to raise
human rights concerns, albeit softly.
	   Xu was led away from his home Wednesday morning around the time
Blair was presiding at the signing of contracts and plans for
British business investments worth more than dlrs 830 million.
	   Police allowed the veteran dissident to return home Wednesday
afternoon after about six hours of questioning about political
activists that he knows and other dissidents' efforts to form an
opposition political party, said his wife, He Xintong.
	   Both China and Britain have sought to use Blair's five-day
visit, the first by a British prime minister in seven years, to
highlight improved ties following years of rancor over Hong Kong.
	   On Tuesday, the two governments declared a comprehensive
partnership intended to open a new chapter in relations following
the smooth return of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997. The
partnership covers everything from boosting trade to cooperation on
environmental protection and increasing military-to-military
contacts.
	   In addition to sightseeing and contract signings, Blair capped
his official schedule Wednesday by meeting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
	   The two leaders discussed the Asian financial crisis, China's
economic reforms and its recovery from massively destructive
flooding this summer, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang.
	   Tang said that Jiang delivered a lengthy lecture on China's
policy on Tibet, its role in ending Tibetan serfdom and its
economic aid to the remote Himalayan region.
	   ``Prime Minister Blair listened with interest to the briefing
given by President Jiang,'' Tang said.
	   Tang said Blair did not raise any cases of human rights abuses
or religious repression in Tibet, but he did mention Xu Wenli's
interrogation by police earlier in the day and the two leaders
exchanged views on his case.
	   Aside from police questioning of Xu, the mother of a jailed and
ailing dissident sent Blair a letter urging him to press Jiang for
her son's release, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Li Hai was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to nine years in
prison in a closed trial for violating the state secrets law,
apparently by compiling a list of political prisoners.
	   China had hoped to head off criticisms of human rights abuses by
signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a
key U.N. rights treaty, on Monday, the eve of Blair's arrival.
	   Traveling with a group of British business leaders, the prime
minister witnessed signings of four contracts to build a water
treatment plant and a coal-fired power station and make
pharmaceuticals and small satellites in China.
	   With distrust over Hong Kong behind them, Britain has become
China's No. 1 investor and second largest trading partner among
European Union nations. Trade for this year's first seven months
totaled dlrs 3.48 billion, an increase of more than 18 percent from
January-July 1997, according to Chinese officials.
	   Blair will champion British business interests Thursday in
Shanghai, China's financial capital. He will tour the stock
exchange, lunch with the mayor and open a factory and an insurance
office.
	   He heads to Hong Kong Friday, his first visit since attending
the handover ceremonies 15 months ago.

Reformists prevented from contesting polls to crucial caucus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Most reformists who applied to run for
elections to an important caucus have been rejected by a hard-line
council that vets candidates, according to their final list.
	   Of the 396 people who had applied, 167 were approved to run for
the Oct. 23 elections to the Assembly of Experts. Their names were
published in Iranian newspapers Wednesday.
	   The Assembly of Experts' most important job is to choose Iran's
spiritual leader, the country's most powerful position.
	   The current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wields far more
power than the popularly elected president. He is commander in
chief of the armed forces, determines foreign policy and controls
the state media.
	   The final list is evidence of the overriding clout of the
hard-liners in Iran's clerical government where moderate President
Mohammad Khatami and his small band of moderates are struggling to
ease social and political restrictions.
	   Among those eliminated by the hard-line Guardian Council were a
number of advisers close to Khatami.
	   One of them, Deputy President Abdollah Nouri, is a former
interior minister who was impeached in June by hard-line members of
Parliament, an apparent victim of his loyalty to Khatami.
	   Besides vetting candidates for the Assembly of Experts, the
12-member Guardian Council also approves candidates for Parliament
and the presidency.
	   Before he was impeached, Nouri had planned to submit a bill in
Parliament, proposing to curb the Guardian Council's powers and
open the way for a more liberal Assembly of Experts and Parliament.
	   The assembly, formerly with 70 members, will now have 86 members
who will serve an eight-year term.
	   Another rejected candidate for the assembly is Hadi Khamenei,
Khatami's adviser for press affairs and the younger brother of
Ayatollah Khamenei.
	   On Tuesday, he had led a demonstration of more than 4,000
students protesting against a crackdown on press freedom and the
system of pre-selecting candidates for the Assembly of Experts.
	   In recent months, hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down
six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested six
journalists for allegedly printing lies. All publications must
obtain printing licenses from the judiciary.
	   Ayatollah Khamenei has called on the judiciary to deal with what
he says is ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.

Chechen warlord wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Chechen warlord was gravely wounded Wednesday in
what Chechen police called an attempt on his life, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Arbi Barayev, the head of a combat group called the Islamic
Regiment, is believed to be connected with the wave of kidnappings
that has washed over Chechnya since the end of the 1994-96
independence war with Russia, the news agency said.
	   The report claimed that he was involved in last week's
kidnapping, torture and murder of a Russian government
representative in Chechnya, Akmal Saidov.
	   Another government envoy, Valentin Vlasov, was kidnapped on May
1 and is believed to be alive.
	   Hundreds of Russians and foreigners have been abducted by gangs
seeking ransom, and dozens are still being held. The latest
kidnapping victims are three Britons and a New Zealander working
for a British phone company, who were seized in the Chechen capital
Grozny over the weekend.
	   The kidnappings have increased the pressure on Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov, who is already on the defensive against opponents
who are calling for him to step down. Maskhadov's government has
proven unable to stem the republic's soaring crime rate.
	   Georgy Kurin, Russia's current envoy to the breakaway republic,
denied Wednesday that a date had been set for a meeting between
Maskhadov and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin had said the two
leaders would meet Saturday, provoking a flurry of criticism of
Maskhadov by his hard-line opponents who want no talks with Russia.

Marine suspected in hit and run on Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine is a suspect in a hit-and-run
accident on the southern island of Okinawa Wednesday that has left
a Japanese high school student in critical condition, a Marine
spokesman said.
	   Okinawa police said the car that the Marine was driving on a
highway in the village of Kitanakagusuku struck 18-year-old Yuki
Uema of nearby Ginowan city, who was riding on a small motorcycle.
	   The Marine was stopped by military authorities who noticed a
cracked windshield and other unusual damage to his car as he tried
to enter Camp Foster, said spokesman Maj. Dan Ryan.
	   That Marine and another Marine, who was a passenger in the car,
were detained, then questioned by Okinawa police, Ryan said. The
Marines have been returned to Futenma Marine Air Station, where
they are assigned, he said, but the driver is likely to be called
in for further questioning.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley called on Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura to express condolences to Uema's family, the U.S.
Embassy said in a statement.
	   ``The ambassador expressed our military's renewed determination
to live as good neighbors in the Japanese communities to which they
are assigned,'' it said.
	   Resentment against the American military is deeply rooted on
Okinawa, where most of the U.S. troops in Japan are stationed.
	   Okinawa police are investigating the cause of the accident,
which may have involved a second car that also fled the scene,
according to witness reports, said police spokesman Katsuya
Matayoshi.
	   The Marines have offered their condolence to the victim and her
family and have sent over base doctors to help her treatment, Ryan
said. The Marine Corps is cooperating fully with the police
investigation.

	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a last attempt to narrow
the gaps on a West Bank troop withdrawal, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held three-way talks Wednesday with the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders.
	   During the two-hour meeting, Albright twice left the room to let
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat talk alone. It was the first time in a year that
Arafat and Netanyahu spoke without mediators.
	   Asked about the talks, Albright said ``they are moving on'' and
Netanyahu said they were ``good.''

	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A week after a carbomb injured 13 people in
Naples, police Wednesday disarmed a bomb planted in a moped outside
the city's courthouse.
	   Bomb experts went to the site after police received an anonymous
tip. The bomb was composed of 400 grams (14 ounces) of plastic
explosive and could have caused widespread damage, police said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   Last week's attack in a crowded neighborhood was blamed on the
Camorra crime syndicate.

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright convened three-way talks Wednesday with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders in hopes of moving closer to a
long-sought West Bank accord.
	   Her spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Albright faced dozens of
hurdles in her second day of Mideast peacemaking with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The three had a three-way handshake as they posed for
photographs at the start of the low-expectation meeting. Albright,
Netanyahu and Arafat sat around a square table so small their knees
and elbows were almost touching.
	   Posing for photographers, Netanyahu and Arafat shook hands
across the table and then Albright place her hand on top of theirs.
	   At one point during the meeting, Albright got up and walked out
of the room, leaving Netanyahu and Arafat to talk alone. It was the
first time in a year the two leaders spoke without mediators.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while Albright
is in the region. But she hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held
Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether Arafat was ready to
inch closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United States basically
shares, that the Palestinian authority could do more to control
terrorists on territory under its control.
	   After a two-hour session at the crossing, the talks shifted to
Arafat's guest house in Gaza.

Group charges Thailand, U.N. fail to protect Myanmar refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT Oct. 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand and the United Nations' main
agency for refugees have failed to provide adequate protection for
more than 100,000 people who have fled Myanmar, a human rights
lobbying group charged Wednesday.
	   A report from the New York-based group Human Rights Watch says
that for more than a decade, protection for Myanmar refugees in
Thailand has been inconsistent and often non-existent, due largely
to the policies of the Thai government and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Many of the refugees fled persecution that resulted from their
political beliefs or ethnic background, but the policies have
failed to accord them the protection due under international law,
it says.
	   ``In almost no way can Thai policy be said to comply with
international refugee norms and standards, and in many respects
UNHCR's policies in Thailand do not even comply with its own
guidelines and policies,'' the group charges.
	   The Thai government's actions can be explained by strategic and
economic interests, its experience with refugees from Indochina,
and the lack of an adequate legal framework, says the report.
	   While the UNHCR must act diplomatically to maintain a working
relationship with its Thai hosts, it says, the agency has been
``unnecessarily weak in its efforts to challenge Thai policies that
undermine refugee protection.''
	   It charges says that over the past 10 years, the Thai government
has repeatedly violated the obligation not to send refugees back to
any country where they are likely to face persecution.
	   It expresses concern that the pressures of the continuing
economic crisis in Thailand place refugees and asylum-seekers in
even greater danger as the Thai government seeks to expel all
undocumented migrants and often makes little distinction between
migrants and refugees.
	   The refugees who have suffered worst, says Human Rights Watch,
are members of the ethnic minorities. UNHCR had no presence in and
only limited access to their camps, which since 1994 have been
vulnerable to cross-border attacks by troops from Myanmar _ also
called Burma _ or breakaway factions of rebel groups.
	   The Thai government also took the position that as Myanmar's
military regime signed cease-fires with various ethnic armies and
the level of fighting decreased, ``ethnic minority refugees had
nothing to fear by returning home,'' says the report. ``They
ignored the pattern of systematic human rights violations,
including forced labor, that had led many of the refugees to flee
in the first place.''
	   It says the camps are becoming increasingly closed, and many
will not permit any new refugees to enter.
	   A new Thai government that took office last November has made
commitments to human rights, which could lead to an improvement in
the treatment of refugees, it says.
	   However, the UNHCR has failed to negotiate a new role for itself
that would allow it to give adequate protection to the refugees,
the report adds.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Bruno Munari, an architect and artist who
was a leading member of Italy's futurist movement, has died at 90.
	   Munari had suffered from cancer for several years and died in
his Milan home Sept. 29, Italian news agencies reported.
	   After obtaining a degree in architecture, Munari began
experimenting with a variety of materials and technology in his
works. In 1948 he founded the Movimento Arte Concreta, known as the
Mac artistic movement.
	   Munari's paintings, sculptures and mobiles are on display at
galleries and museums throughout Europe. They include ``Macchine
Inutili'' (Useless Works) and an album of 27 plates known as
``Cantastoria Campari'' (Campari Street Singer).
	   Munari is survived by his wife Dilma and son Alberto.

Canadian players Stephane Morin dies at rink side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former NHL forward Stephane Morin
collapsed during a German league game and died, his club Berlin
Capitals said Wednesday.
	   Morin, 29, left the ice early in the second period complaining
that he was feeling ill late Tuesday. Shortly afterward, he
collapsed unconscious in the team's box, apparently from a heart
attack, Berlin Capitals spokesman Peter Harbig said.
	   Doctors on the scene tried to revive Morin but were
unsuccessful. He was taken to a hospital where doctors pronounced
him dead.
	   Morin had scored the final of three goals for the Capitals in
the first period of their game at Revier Lions in Oberhausen, in
the Ruhr Valley.
	   The game was stopped after Morin's collapse.
	   Morin, who had played for Quebec Nordiques and Vancouver Canucks
in the NHL, was born in Montreal. He also had played in the AHL and
IHL.
	   He is survived by his wife Karen and son Frederick.
	   Morin is the second Canadian ice hockey player to die in Germany
this year.
	   Mark Teevens died in April of a long embolism while watching his
Bad Neuheim team play a game.

Sudan legislator warns U.S. products may be contaminated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A leading Sudanese member of Parliament
has urged the government to be wary of American products, saying
they could be laced with toxic substances to harm Sudanese people.
	   ``American drugs could be contaminated and we should not discard
any such possibility,'' Islamist legislator, Yassin Omar Imam, said
Tuesday.
	   He made the comments during a discussion in Parliament on the
Aug. 20 U.S. missile strike on a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant that
the United States claimed was making chemical weapons agents.
	   Imam described the U.S. administration as a ``group of thugs''
that will never leave Sudan alone. The U.S. administration would
even use chemical or biological weapons against Sudan, Imam said.
He did not elaborate.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood, Holbrooke had only terse public comments
Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely serious,'' he said.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Despite a Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units, a U.S. spokesman admitted Wednesday there was no
international consensus for military action against the Serbs.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO
is not there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London.
	   Preparations for intervention continued Wednesday. Britain and
France both recommended that their citizens leave Yugoslavia.
Germany said it had begun removing families of staffers in its
Belgrade embassy.
	   Canada has already evacuated all nonessential diplomatic staff
and their families from Belgrade, and U.S. officials said
dependents of its embassy employees would soon be evacuated.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said in Beijing.

Armstrong gets wet weather with eye on time trial

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ American Lance Armstrong was
prepared for rainy weather but not cold, rainy weather as he looks
for a chance in Thursday's elite men's time trial at the World
Cycling Championship.
	   Armstrong arrived from Nice, France Tuesday and immediately went
out and sought some protection against the cold, buying some
all-weather gloves and jacket in a local shop.
	   With temperatures about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F), Armstrong
wanted some extra protection against the cold after overnight rains
in southern Netherlands.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong, who announced he had testicular
cancer just before the world championships two years ago, returns
to the event as one of the favorites. He won the road title in
1993.
	   The Austin, Texas rider's return hasn't been easy after taking
the 1997 season off to battle his cancer with chemotheraphy and
operations. His cancer is in remission now.
	   He came back this year but dropped out of the Paris-Nice race in
France this past March and questioned whethere he wanted to
continue racing.
	   Returning to the United States, Armstrong didn't look at his
bicycle for four weeks, then headed for a training camp in rainy
North Carolina.
	   ``I really had to decide there if I loved the bike and whether
or not I loved doing six hours a day in the pouring rain,'' he
said. ``I left there knowing that I really enjoy what I do.''
	   He wants to become a source of inspiration to many others who
have to battle cancer.
	   ``I would like to be an example for ... all cancer patients, not
just young men with testicular cancer, and their families,''
Armstrong said. ``I realized how lonely I was and how hard it was.
I promised myself that I would do whatever I could in the future to
make it easier for the next person.''
	   Since returning to Europe, he has had a series of top results.
He won the four-day Tour of Luxembourg and a German tour,
Rheinland-Pfalz.
	   He also was fourth in the Tour of the Netherlands.
	   Then his fourth place finish in the Tour of Spain propelled him
back to the top level of cyclists present at the World
Championships.
	   With those successes behind him, he comes to the worlds in top
form with the added encouragement that a number of top riders are
missing from the lineup.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- and France's two world champions of last
year, time trial winner Laurent Jalabert and road champion Laurent
Brochard are out.
	   That leave's Armstrong, Spain's Abraham Olano and another
comeback rider, Chris Boardman, as the top contenders in Thursday's
43.5-kilometer (27-mile) time trial.
	   Olano took the time trial in the Tour of Spain where Armstrong
was just eight seconds behind.
	   Boardman, the 1994 world time trial champion, is still searchimg
his form after crashing out in the Tour de France's second stage.
	   Armstrong is scheduled to start ninth from the last in
Thursday's race with Boardman, Olano and Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine
the final three.
	   Armstrong is also a contender for Sunday's men's road race. The
course is 15 laps through the Dutch coutnryside, a total of 258
kilometers (162 miles).
	   ``It is very much a classic course,'' Armstrong said. ``Very
difficult, long and (with) short, steep climbs. ''
	   In Wednesday's races, 17-year old Fabian Cancellara of
Switzerland won the junior men's time trial, covering a
23-kilometer (14.3-mile) course in 29 minutes, 39.15 seconds.
	   Torsten Heikmann of Germany was second, 2.46 seconds behind,
with Italy's Fillippo Pozzato third.

West Bank settlement gets city status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face
of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Ariel.
	   Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move
Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18
miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
	   Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit
to Ariel was arranged. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan,
could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy
accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a
message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
	   For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles
to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians denounce
the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
	   Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready for occupancy in
April. He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional
units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the
work has not begun.
	   Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when
Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on
construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to
cancel the freeze.
	   Ariel was established in 1977. Nahcman said raising the status
of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means
permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
	   Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with
the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel
while the ceremony is in progress.
	   A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in
Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.

Chief executive delivers blueprint for economic recovery

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa offered no new
proposals Wednesday to rescue Hong Kong from recession, but
promised in a policy address that the the government is committed
to maintaining a free market economy and protecting the currency
peg.
	   Tung painted a gloomy picture in his second annual address,
saying Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into
1999.''
	   He said the budget deficit may far exceed the June estimate of
20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.56 billion) due to the
economic downturn, and the deficit may retard growth in government
expenditure in the next few years.
	   Hong Kong's economic recovery hinges on ``an improvement in the
external economic environment, a steadying of interest rates,
stability in property market and the restoration of public
confidence,'' he said.
	   The government's priority now is to stabilize property prices,
which have fallen 50 percent since last October, he added.
	   He announced the suspension of a subsidized middle-class housing
program in an attempt to boost the private market, but stopped
short of scrapping a housing construction target set last year,
which has been widely blamed for the property slump.
	   He also declined to disclose the government's plan when a
nine-month freeze on land sales expires next March.
	   Week's after Tung's inaugural policy address last year, Hong
Kong was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming
economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   Analysts, economists and politicians gave his latest address a
lukewarm response. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which closed the
day 2.4 percent higher mainly on good news from Japan, rose only a
few points after his address, which hadn't finished when the market
closed.
	   ``There's nothing substantial,'' said Vanessa Yeung, head of
research at G.K. Goh Securities (HK) Ltd. ``These kinds of policies
will not help the economy in the short term.''
	   Political analyst Ivan Choy of City University said the address
would further hurt citizens' confidence in Tung, which has plunged
substantially with the economy.
	   ``He's so out of touch with the citizens' concern,'' Choy said,
referring to growing unemployment and pay cuts. To most people's
surprise, Tung largely ignored those issues in his speech.
	   ``He wasn't honest with the people when he diagnosed Hong Kong's
problems,'' Choy added.
	   Lawmaker Martin Lee, leader of the opposition Democratic Party,
Hong Kong's largest, said Tung ``lacks leadership, and his speech
lacked direction.''
	   Before his speech, a small group of protesters slipped a
petition into his car, and waved a banner saying, ``Failure. Out of
Control. Unemployment. Disappointment.''
	   In his speech, Tung urged Hong Kong to strengthen ties with the
rest of China for faster economic recovery, and urged international
cooperation to monitor global fund movements and stop economic
crises from spreading.
	   He also reiterated that ``the linked exchange rate is to stay,''
and ``no foreign exchange control shall be applied.''
	   The Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar has been under
serious attack by speculators betting the Hong Kong dollar will
sink. To defend the currency link, the government has to keep
interest rates high.
	   Tung also defended the much-criticized government market
intervention in late August, when it spent an estimated 15 percent
of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves to buy stocks and futures
to keep share prices at levels that would punish speculators
betting on a decline.
	   The government later imposed more stringent trading regulations
to make illegal trading and speculation more difficult.
	   He said it was ``not our intention to interfere with market
forces,'' and that the aim was ``to consolidate Hong Kong's ability
to manage its monetary affairs.''

5,000 people flee flash floods in southern Philippine city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 5,000 people fled their
homes when heavy rains caused flash floods near a southern
Philippine city, a relief official said Wednesday.
	   The rains began early this week and hit heavily logged mountain
areas. Large water flows from the areas caused a river to overflow,
flooding villages in the town of Vitali, just outside Zamboanga,
said city social services officer Francisco Baredo.
	   Relief officials estimated that at least 900 thatched houses
near the river bank were swept away or torn down by strong winds.
At least 20 children, including five infants, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries when they attempted to escape the rampaging
waters. No one was reported killed.
	   The floods destroyed a wooden bridge and damaged hundreds of
hectares (acres) of crop lands and fish ponds in the area.
Agriculture officials estimated that the floods destroyed at least
17 million pesos (dlrs 395,000) worth of rice.
	   Most of those who fled were temporarily housed in school
buildings.
	   Zamboanga is about 850 kilometers (530 miles) south of Manila.

Yeltsin talks with Blair, Russian foreign minister on Kosovo

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with details of Yeltsin's talk with Blair,
Zhirinovsky's quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and met with Russia's foreign
minister Wednesday in hopes of finding a diplomatic solution to the
conflict in Kosovo.
	   In the conversation with Blair, Yeltsin voiced concern over the
``calls for military action in the Balkans from certain forces in
NATO'' the Kremlin said. Blair is currently on a visit to China.
	   ``Boris Yeltsin underlined that such developments would be
disastrous for global peace and drastically change the situation''
in the region, a Kremlin statement said.
	   NATO is building up forces at a base in southern Italy and has
threatened airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces that are
cracking down on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province in southern Yugoslavia. Russia fiercely
opposes airstrikes.
	   Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop NATO strikes.
	   Also, Yeltsin told Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to attend a
Friday meeting in London of the six-member Contact Group on
Yugoslavia, Russian news agencies reported. The group includes the
United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia.
	   Ivanov told Yeltsin that Russia's efforts to discourage
airstrikes have ``resulted in a growing understanding of the
feasibility for a political settlement,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as saying.
	   Also Wednesday, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky
called for the rupture of diplomatic relations with NATO countries
if they proceed with airstrikes.
	   He said the use of force against the Serbs would be a ``dress
rehearsal for a similar future action in Russia.''
	   ``They are fighting not for the human rights, but for the
destruction of Russia's only ally in Europe,'' Zhirinovsky said at
a news conference.

Armstrong gets wet weather with eye on time trial

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ American Lance Armstrong was
prepared for rainy weather but not cold, rainy weather as he looks
for a chance in Thursday's elite men's time trial at the World
Cycling Championship.
	   Armstrong arrived from Nice, France Tuesday and immediately went
out and sought some protection against the cold, buying some
all-weather gloves and jacket in a local shop.
	   With temperatures about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F), Armstrong
wanted some extra protection against the cold after overnight rains
in southern Netherlands.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong, who announced he had testicular
cancer just before the world championships two years ago, returns
to the event as one of the favorites. He won the road title in
1993.
	   The Austin, Texas rider's return hasn't been easy after taking
the 1997 season off to battle his cancer with chemotheraphy and
operations. His cancer is in remission now.
	   He came back this year but dropped out of the Paris-Nice race in
France this past March and questioned whethere he wanted to
continue racing.
	   Returning to the United States, Armstrong didn't look at his
bicycle for four weeks, then headed for a training camp in rainy
North Carolina.
	   ``I really had to decide there if I loved the bike and whether
or not I loved doing six hours a day in the pouring rain,'' he
said. ``I left there knowing that I really enjoy what I do.''
	   He wants to become a source of inspiration to many others who
have to battle cancer.
	   ``I would like to be an example for ... all cancer patients, not
just young men with testicular cancer, and their families,''
Armstrong said. ``I realized how lonely I was and how hard it was.
I promised myself that I would do whatever I could in the future to
make it easier for the next person.''
	   Since returning to Europe, he has had a series of top results.
He won the four-day Tour of Luxembourg and a German tour,
Rheinland-Pfalz.
	   He also was fourth in the Tour of the Netherlands.
	   Then his fourth place finish in the Tour of Spain propelled him
back to the top level of cyclists present at the World
Championships.
	   With those successes behind him, he comes to the worlds in top
form with the added encouragement that a number of top riders are
missing from the lineup.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- and France's two world champions of last
year, time trial winner Laurent Jalabert and road champion Laurent
Brochard are out.
	   That leave's Armstrong, Spain's Abraham Olano and another
comeback rider, Chris Boardman, as the top contenders in Thursday's
43.5-kilometer (27-mile) time trial.
	   Olano took the time trial in the Tour of Spain where Armstrong
was just eight seconds behind.
	   Boardman, the 1994 world time trial champion, is still searchimg
his form after crashing out in the Tour de France's second stage.
	   Armstrong is scheduled to start ninth from the last in
Thursday's race with Boardman, Olano and Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine
the final three.
	   Armstrong is also a contender for Sunday's men's road race. The
course is 15 laps through the Dutch coutnryside, a total of 258
kilometers (162 miles).
	   ``It is very much a classic course,'' Armstrong said. ``Very
difficult, long and (with) short, steep climbs. ''
	   In Wednesday's races, 17-year old Fabian Cancellara of
Switzerland won the junior men's time trial, covering a
23-kilometer (14.3-mile) course in 29 minutes, 39.15 seconds.
	   Torsten Hiekmann of Germany was second, 2.46 seconds behind,
with Italy's Fillippo Pozzato third.

International Monetary Fund have ``frighteningly insufficient''
funds, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday.
	   Estrada called on the United States and other rich nations to
contribute more to the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
	   The international financial institutions have been at the
forefront of bailing out Asian countries, including Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, ravaged by the 15-month financial
crisis.
	   Estrada said their help is crucial, ``but it is now clear that
the resources of these institutions, particularly the IMF, are
frighteningly insufficient.''
	   Therefore, additional commitments for financial support from
industrialized nations are needed for a quick recovery from the
regional crisis, Estrada told a meeting of trade ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Estrada also renewed a call for ASEAN to organize an
international conference on ways of reducing the negative impact on
developing countries of free flows of capital. Large amounts of
money flowed into many Asian countries for a number of years, and
then suddenly dried up last year as investors became wary of the
region.
	   ``The world is dealing with a new phenomenon of massive amounts
of capital flowing across national boundaries at lightning speed _
bloating economies into fragile bubbles as they rush in, and
shaking economies to their foundations as they are withdrawn,'' he
said.
	   Estrada said it was important for ASEAN countries to continue
reducing trade barriers and integrating their economies more
tightly to attract more investment.
	   ASEAN trade officials agreed Tuesday to hasten plans to demolish
trade barriers in the region to encourage business and investment
and help Asia recover from the financial storm.
	   The officials set a goal of complete elimination of tariffs for
many products traded in the region by the year 2003, instead of
their previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5 percent by
that year.
	   On Wednesday, ASEAN officials also signed an agreement creating
an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove barriers to investment
from other ASEAN countries by the year 2010, and by 2020 for
investment from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country would be
granted the same privileges in areas such as land ownership and
investment rights as their counterparts in another ASEAN country in
which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions if a country's
constitution limits equal treatment.
	   Estrada also urged ASEAN countries to allow freer exchanges of
views, alluding to Southeast Asian countries troubled by internal
strife and sensitive to outside opinions.
	   While struggling to solve their economic problems, ASEAN
governments should also find ways of easing the plight of poor
people who have been particularly hurt, Estrada said.
	   ``The poorest of our masses, they who get hurt first and the
hardest in any economic downturn, will always be restive, and
rightly so, if the fruits of development go mostly to the already
well-off,'' he said.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

India send Zimbabwe in to bat on first test day

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ India's cricket captain Mohamad
Azharuddin won his tenth toss in a row here Wednesday and, for the
fourth time in succession on the tour of Zimbabwe, put the home
side in to bat.
	   The score was 81 for one wicket at lunchtime on the first day of
the five-day test.
	   Azharuddin's decision to ask Zimbabwe to bat on a lively but
true wicket owed more to psychology than anything else. Local
experts say that this wicket will last the full five days so that
batting fourth, if that becomes necessary, should cause no
problems.
	   After the 29 overs bowled in the first session, honors were more
or less even with Zimbabwe reaching 81 runs for the loss of Craig
Wishart, who made 21.
	   This was a good scalp for India as Wishart had taken a century
off them in
	   the last of three one-day internationals a week ago.
	   Gavin Rennie was on 21 digging in for the anchor role at lunch
break. For one stretch of eight overs he did not score. Murray
Goodwin, on the other hand, was much more adventurous and took 15
runs off Sauraj Ganguly and Robin Singh in a six balls spell.
	   Azharuddin used six bowlers, opening with Javagal Srinath, who
bowled five no-balls, and Ajit Agarkar. It was his first change,
with Sauraj Ganguly, who got the break, inducing a catch from
Wishart to Harbhajan Singh in the gully.
	   The India team, much as expected, also included Sachin
Tendulkar, Navjot Sidhu, Rahul Dravid, Robin Singh, Anil Kumble,
Nayan Mongia and 12th man Ajay Jadeja.
	   Zimbabwe were forced to make several changes, fast bowler Eddo
Brandes not being fit enough for five days. Capt. Alastair Campbell
preferred Adam Huckle to Paul Strang as leg spinner. Neil Johnson
replaced Grant Flower, whose injured wrist is taking some time to
heal.
	   Johnson left Zimbabwe as a child, made the South African ``A''
side and has now returned, as Murray Goodwin did from Australia, to
his native country. Henry Olonga returns after a spell away from
the game.
	   Other Zimbabwe players included Andy Flower, Craig Evans, Neil
Johnson, Heath Streak, Mpumulelo Mbangwa and 12th man Trevor
Madondo.

Police investigate sex abuse of minor in Ivory Coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A former government minister and
Lebanon's ambassador to the Ivory Coast have been implicated in a
scandal involving allegations of forced sexual encounters with a
14-year-old boy.
	   Ministry of Security officials speaking on condition of
anonymity confirmed on Wednesday said they were investigating the
charges, but refused to disclose details of the case.
	   The French-language daily Le Jour, however, reported that at
least six people had been arrested in connection with the alleged
abduction, drugging and repeated sexual assault of the 14-year-old.
	   An official at Lebanon's embassy in Abidjan denied allegations
that Ambassador Mohammed Daher was linked to the case.
	   ``It's a set-up,'' an embassy consular officer said, refusing to
give his name.
	   A press conference with Daher was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon, the officer said.
	   Le Jour reported that Daher and an unnamed former government
minister had sexually abused the boy for more than six months.
	   The newspaper said several prominent Lebanese business leaders
in Abidjan had also been implicated in the case.
	   The embassy consular officer, however, said the stories and the
charges were fabricated to defame the Lebanese community in the
Ivory Coast. As in much of West Africa, expatriate Lebanese
businessmen control vast portions of the commercial industry in the
Ivory Coast, often evoking resentment in the local community.
	   A police official working at Abidjan's central Prefecture
dealing with complaints involving minors confirmed the arrest of a
number of individuals last week in connection with the case.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity he said the parents of an
Ivorian minor from the town of Dabou, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) east of the commercial capital of Abidjan, had filed
complaints against several people.
	   The police official refused to give further information except
to say that case was ``delicate'' and needed special authorization
from the Ministry of Security to discuss with journalists.
	   The case has been transferred to the Attorney-General's office,
he said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Attorney-General's
office.

Bulgaria scraps shipment of radiation-contaminated mushrooms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria has scrapped a planeload of
mushrooms slated for export after experts found they contained a
radioactive substance, a paper reported Monday.
	   The mushrooms, picked in southern Bulgaria, contained
radioactive Caesium-137, Peter Konstantinov of the National
Institute Hydrology and meteorology told the daily 24 Chassa.
	   The report didn't specify the size and destination of the cargo,
or the degree of radioactivity.
	   Konstantinov added the radiation probably came from the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in the Ukraine.

ASEAN begins economic monitoring system in attempt to avert future
</HEADLINE>
crises &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries have begun
a pioneering scheme in which they will monitor each others'
economies in an attempt to avert future crises in the region, an
official said Wednesday.
	   Finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations agreed on informal procedures for carrying out the
monitoring in a meeting Sunday on the sidelines of an annual
IMF-World Bank conference in Washington, ASEAN deputy
secretary-general Suthad Setboonsarng said.
	   Suthad said ASEAN's nine member countries pledged to share vital
economic data, including foreign exchange rates, capital flows,
growth rates and interest rates.
	   ``We have all the details worked out and we'll start
implementing now,'' Suthad said.
	   ASEAN governments will provide the data voluntarily and will not
be compelled to follow recommendations from other ASEAN members.
	   ``It's not mandatory,'' Suthad said, describing the informal
exchange of information as a ``chat.''
	   ``The objective is to provide an early-warning system and a peer
review process,'' he said.
	   A coordinating group under ASEAN's secretariat in Jakarta will
collect the data, with technical support from the Asian Development
Bank. ASEAN finance ministers will meet twice a year, starting next
March in Hanoi, to analyze the data and provide recommendations.
	   Officials have said the surveillance system could help prevent
future crises, but won't necessarily be a quick-fix for the
region's 15-month-old financial crisis.
	   The start of the plan had been stalled because some ASEAN
countries initially balked at the prospect of sharing sensitive
economic data.
	   Suthad said the surveillance system will complement current
monitoring schemes of the International Monetary Fund.
	   Suthad is in Manila to attend a two-day meeting of ASEAN trade
ministers, which began Wednesday.
	   ASEAN countries began contemplating such a monitoring scheme a
few months after currency upheavals suddenly began ravaging their
once rapidly growing economies last year.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Transport strike over violence in second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fresh assault on a suburban train driver gave new
impetus to some metro, train and bus drivers who went on strike for
a second day Wednesday to protest increasing violence on France's
public transport system.
	   Train traffic between Paris and southern suburbs served by the C
and D line that enters the Montparnasse station was totally
paralyzed by drivers who walked off the job.
	   Trains to Chartres, Versailles and Rambouillet -- three tourist
destinations -- also stayed in their stations.
	   The Paris bus authority said that only 40 percent of the
capital's buses were functioning Wednesday morning.
	   An assault Tuesday night on a conductor at Villeneuve-le-Roi in
the Val de Marne, west and southwest of Paris, fed strikers'
concerns over safety.
	   Details of the incident were not immediately available. But such
violence has steadily increased on suburban trains and buses.
	   Unions are demanding more protection in a city where about 9
million people depend on public transit daily.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called a meeting of
officials of the train and bus authority for late Wednesday
afternoon. Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot and Jean-Jack
Queyranne, interim Interior Minister, were to attend the session,
according to the prime minister's office.
	   ``The problems are real, deep,'' said Gayssot after the weekly
Cabinet meeting Wednesday, saying measures must quickly be put into
place.
	   The Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that about 200 extra
national police would patrol subway, bus and commuter train lines.
	   Some 2 million bus commuters were left stranded Tuesday by the
latest walkout to hit French public transportation. The metro has
not been affected.
	   The Paris transit authority, RATP, plans to add police
protection and also has promised to hire 350 youths as transit
attendants, more than tripling the number already in the Paris
area, as part of the leftist government's youth jobs program.
	   Coming from disadvantaged areas, the youths are trained to
dissuade their aggressive peers from resorting to violence.

Tories try attacking government instead of each other
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Taking heart from the government's
announcement of lower-than-expected economic growth, opposition
Conservatives attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair's record Tuesday
but weren't entirely distracted from their own feuds.
	   Continuing divisions over Europe were personified in the figures
of two former prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath,
who appeared together on the platform at the party's annual
conference for the first time in years.
	   Lady Thatcher applauded as Conservatives attacked the European
Union and the single currency, while Heath sat stony-faced.
	   Party leaders found an opening to attack the government
following Treasury chief Gordon Brown's announcement that economic
growth would be below forecasts.
	   Though stock markets around the world have been slumping,
Conservative lawmaker Francis Maude told the conference: ``This is
a downturn made in Downing Street.''
	   ``If you raise taxes and attack savings, pile on extra costs and
spend through the roof, interest rates will be higher, as sure as
night follows day,'' Maude said.
	   ``You are to blame, Gordon. You are Culpability Brown,'' he
said, making a pun on the name of the famed British landscape
designer, Capability Brown.
	   The second day of the four-day conference dawned with news in
The Daily Telegraph that support for the Conservative had fallen
further.
	   In the latest Gallup survey, 23 percent said they would vote
Conservative, down from 28 percent in early September, while the
governing Labor Party's support was 57 percent. The survey had a
margin of error of three percentage points.
	   That confirmed that the Conservatives have made no progress
toward recovering support since their landslide defeat in May 1997.
	   Lady Thatcher and Heath were on the platform for a debate on
Europe, the issue at the heart of Tory divisions.
	   ``I say to our European friends _ we will walk with you, talk
with you, buy with you and sell with you, but we'll be damned if we
will be governed by you,'' said Roger Helmer, a prospective
candidate for the European Parliament.
	   Thatcher applauded; Heath did not.
	   Young Conservative delegate Francis Hoar attacked Heath
directly, saying Heath had not told the country when it joined the
Common Market that a single currency was inevitable.
	   ``He knew that but he choose to forget about that and then not
to inform us of that,'' Hoar said, as delegates applauded.
	   After the debate, Heath told reporters it was ``sad that it was
so unrealistic. It's not related to what's happening in Europe or
the rest of the world.
	   ``That famous dogma _ we want to be at the center of Europe but
not run by it _ what does that mean?'' he asked.

Ukraine and Argentina sign military cooperation agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The defense ministers of Ukraine and
Argentina signed a military cooperation agreement Wednesday,
officials said.
	   Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk stressed at the
meeting with his visiting counterpart Jorge Dominguez that the
former Soviet republic views itself as a ``neutral country that is
not affiliated with any blocs.''
	   But he stressed that Ukraine was determined to expand
cooperation with foreign partners in the framework of NATO's
Partnership for Peace program.
	   Dominguez, in turn, said Argentina was interested in cooperating
with Ukraine in the field of military personnel training and would
like to have closer contacts with Kiev to prepare for future
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping missions.
	   Dominguez, who also invited Kuzmuk to visit Argentina next year,
said his delegation planned to visit a number of Ukrainian defense
plants and highly evaluated Ukraine's military industries, the
Interfax news agency reported.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defence of his crown Wednesday with a crushing victory over German
qualifier Axel Pretzsch in the first round of the dlrs 1 million
Swiss Indoors.
	   ``Hopefully I'll be successful here,'' said Rusedski, the losing
finalist in Toulouse last weekend. ``I like it here and I have a
record of nine wins and only one loss here.
	   ``But it's one of the most spectacular draws there's been here
in a long time with Sampras, Agassi and Rafter, so we'll see.''
	   Ranked 14 in the world, Rusedski needed just 52 minutes to
steamroll past Pretzsch 6-2, 6-2.
	   Holder of the fastest serve on the Tour, Rusedski used that
strength to stun the world number 311, blasting three consecutive
aces past Pretzsch in his opening serve.
	   Rusedski's return proved just as effective against the young,
shellshocked German, who was playing in his first career ATP Tour
event.
	   While Pretzsch managed to hold onto his opening serve of the
match, the Briton easily broke him twice in each set on way to a
place in the second round.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I played,'' said Rusedski,
returning to form after spending two months nursing his left ankle
after tearing ligaments at Queens in June. ``Everything is coming
together nicely.
	   ``And Axel has to be a very good player since he did beat two
very experienced veterans to qualify.''
	   Pretzsch defeated Niklas Kulti of Sweden and Czech Martin Damm,
ranked 70, to qualify for the first round.
	   Rusedski will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil,
in the second round.
	   Despite meeting two qualifiers in the first two rounds, Rusedski
is not convinced it is an easy draw for him.
	   ``Both of them have played at least three matches before playing
me,'' said Rusedski. ``Last year I needed three sets to beat David
in the first round, and he's beaten Goran Ivanisevic twice here in
the past.
	   ``Then if I advance I play Sampras, Rosset or Ferreira, so it's
not an easy draw.''
	   In other first round play, Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson, ranked
26, defeated Czech Bohdan Ulihrach 6-4, 6-4.
	   Later, world No. 1 Pete Sampras will play 1994 champion Wayne
Ferreira, and two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter will meet
Czech Daniel Vacek.
	   Wildcard Boris Becker takes on Sweden's Thomas Johansson.

U.S. envoy tries again to persuade Yugoslav president to end

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments ahead of Wednesday's latest talks. ``The
situation's extremely serious,'' he said.
	   Despite a Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units, a U.S. spokesman said Wednesday there was still
no consensus for military action.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels and the six-nation Contact Group on the
Balkans convenes Friday in London.
	   Preparations for intervention continued Wednesday. Britain and
France both recommended that their nationals leave Yugoslavia.
Canada has already evacuated all nonessential diplomatic staff and
their families from its Belgrade embassy, and U.S. officials said
dependents of its embassy employees would soon be evacuated.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
It also invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to send a mission to Kosovo, officials said.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier _ in addition to 11,000 military police,
half the total in all of Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   ``NATO is still not satisfied with compliance,'' the official
said.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.

Lawyer appeals extradition order to Israeli Supreme Court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An order allowing extradition of teenage murder
suspect Samuel Sheinbein home to Maryland has been appealed to
Israel's Supreme Court, one of his lawyers said Wednesday.
	   Sheinbein, 18, has been charged in the grisly murder and
dismemberment of a fellow Maryland teenager in September 1997.
Claiming Israeli citizenship, he fled here two days after the
scorched, mutilated body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was discovered in a
garage near the Sheinbein home.
	   According to Israeli law, Israeli citizens cannot be extradited
to stand trial abroad. Sheinbein's father was born in pre-state
Palestine and was granted Israeli citizenship after the founding of
the state in 1948.
	   In a ruling last month, Jerusalem District Judge Moshe Ravid
upheld the younger Sheinbein's claim to Israeli citizenship but
said he still has no right to stay in the country because he had
not maintained close ties to Israel.
	   Sheinbein's attorney, Eitan Maoz, said Wednesday the judge's
ruling was ``strange.''
	   Appealing to the Supreme Court earlier this week, Sheinbein's
attorneys argued that there is only one grade of Israeli
citizenship, and that the law states clearly that Israeli citizens
cannot be extradited.
	   Maoz told The Associated Press that the appeal is based on the
contention that ``the concept of a citizen as one who has a strong
link to Israel has no basis'' in Israeli law.
	   If the Israeli high court overturns the lower court's ruling,
Sheinbein could be tried here, and would serve his sentence in
Israel if convicted.
	   The Israeli state attorney had challenged Sheinbein's claim to
citizenship, noting that his family left Israel in the 1950s and
the youth had never been here before.
	   The case cast a shadow on Israel-U.S. relations, as lawmakers
demanded that Israel turn over the teenager for trial in Maryland.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said he was
surprised at allegations by Malaysia's former deputy prime minister
that he was beaten by police.
	   ``I was taken aback at the accusations of Anwar Ibrahim that he
was beaten until he was unconscious for several hours,'' Lee said
in an interview with The Australian.
	   ``Prime Minister Mahathir (Mohamad) has said there will be an
investigation,'' Lee said. ``If it is true Anwar was beaten
unconscious, it's bad.''
	   A transcript of the Sept. 30 interview was obtained Wednesday by
The Associated Press.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Although Malaysia has been
buffeted by an economic crisis and political protests, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday he does not have to hold
an election to prove he is still popular.
	   ``Malaysia will not have elections for some time yet,'' Mahathir
said at a meeting of businessmen and economic advisers.
	   Despite the protests against his 17-year-old rule triggered by
the firing and subsequent arrest of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and
the crushing recession, Mahathir said he believes that most
Malaysians back the government.
	   ``My assessment is that people still support the government,''
the 72-year-old leader said.
	   He said there had been no defections from the governing United
Malays National Organization, which claims a membership of 2.4
million in a nation of 22 million.
	   ``UMNO is solid,'' said Mahathir, who is the party president.
``There is no exodus from the party.''
	   But he did mention that 10 party officials, believed to be close
to ousted deputy prime minister Anwar, 51, had been expelled and
another 10 were being asked to explain their stance.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Mahathir refused to replace his former heir
apparent, creating uncertainty about political succession in this
Southeast Asian nation.
	   Although he admitted that the economic crisis was the worst the
country had faced so far, Mahathir said he was confident that
Malaysia would recover quickly from recession.
	   ``We will be, if not the first, among the first to recover,'' he
said. Malaysia was among the last in Asia to be hit by the
financial and stock market turmoil.
	   Mahathir also criticized the policies that were pursued by Anwar
as finance minister, saying these were partly responsible for the
economic troubles.
	   He defended switching to a policy of lower interest rates and
higher government spending to revive the economy. Anwar had pursued
austerity measures and followed a model advocated by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Mahathir said that in the initial days of the economic crisis,
the government did not spend enough money and cut back on
development. ``The result is obvious,'' he said.
	   Mahathir had said earlier, however, that Anwar's dismissal on
Sept. 2 was not over policy differences or a perceived leadership
challenge, but because of immoral acts. Anwar, charged with 10
counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, is to go on trial
Nov. 2.
	   Mahathir also criticized IMF chief Michel Camdessus for
proposing to him policies that could have led to the closure of
many companies.
	   ``He was adamant,'' Mahathir said, recounting conversations with
the IMF chief.
	   Mahathir noted that Camdessus had stopped visiting Malaysia
after the government jettisoned Anwar's policies. ``Might have lost
a friend,'' he said.
	   Camdessus was among the many international personalities who
expressed concern when Anwar appeared in court badly bruised and
with a black eye, alleging police torture.
	   ``He was a very good minister of finance'' for Malaysia and
helped his country resist Asia's financial crisis, Camdessus said.
	   Anwar has denied all the charges, saying they were trumped up by
his political enemies. He was arrested Sept. 20 after two weeks of
nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Tuesday, a huge anti-government rally was held in the eastern
state of Pahang by a new opposition coalition, the Malaysian
Justice Movement.
	   Thousands of postcards addressed to the prime minister were
circulated, demanding that Mahathir hold a general election or step
down. The cards also urged Mahathir to repeal the Internal Security
Act, a harsh law that allows for imprisonment without trial.

Tribunal official: Yugoslavia hindering Kosovo investigations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav authorities have been
barring U.N. war crimes tribunal staff from investigating
allegations of atrocities in Kosovo, a tribunal official said
Wednesday.
	   Deputy prosecutor Graham Blewitt said Belgrade officials last
week suddenly began claiming the tribunal has no jurisdiction to
conduct investigations in Kosovo. Until recently, tribunal staff
were allowed to carry out investigations in the region.
	   Although staff are still allowed to travel in the troubled
Yugoslav province where Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence, they are forbidden to conduct investigations, Blewitt
said.
	   He would not speculate on why Belgrade authorities changed their
stance, but the decision appears to coincide with reports of
massacres of Kosovo civilians by Serb forces in the region.
	   ``The prosecutor finds the position of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia government to be totally unacceptable,'' Blewitt said.
	   ``The prosecutor believes that it is in the best interest of the
FRY and of all people in Kosovo and Serbia to allow the
prosecutor's investigators to fulfill their duties and thus to
contribute to the establishment of the full truth about the
conflict in Kosovo and the prosecution of those responsible for the
crimes falling within the tribunal's jurisdiction.''
	   Last week, when the office of Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour was
seeking to expand tribunal investigations in Kosovo, staff were
told they were no longer allowed to investigate.
	   Earlier this week, Belgrade also denounced the foreign media for
massacre reports it said were ``fabrications and lies.''
	   Blewitt said his staff were trying to investigate reports of
atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict. He would give no
details of the investigations or indicate if indictments were in
the works.
	   The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to punish
crimes committed following the break up of the former Yugoslavia,
has said it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``The prosecutor intends to pursue her investigations into the
events in Kosovo and urges the authorities of the FRY to reconsider
their position and to comply with its international obligations to
cooperate fully with the tribunal,'' Blewitt said.

Bulgaria to export up to 500,000 tons of wheat to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will export 500,000 tons of
wheat to Russia under a deal to be finalized later this week, a
report said Monday.
	   The daily Trud quoted Stoyan Alexandrov, head of the Central
Cooperative Bank as saying the quantity was equal to Bulgaria's
wheat surplus this year.
	   Two years ago Bulgaria imported wheat to cover shortages
stemming from government controlled prices and slow land
restitution.
	   This year Bulgaria posted a wheat surplus after the government
liberalized prices and speeded up the transition of farming land
into private hands.

Berkovic threatens to quit West Ham after clash with Hartson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Hartson comments

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eyal Berkovic has threatened to quit West Ham
after claiming team-mate John Hartson kicked his head ``like a
football'' at a recent training session.
	   The Israeli international said Hartson deliberately kicked him
in the head, leaving him in agony and unable to eat for two days.
	   The Mirror newspaper Wednesday revealed graphic pictures of the
incident, taken from an amatuer video recording, on its front and
back pages. The images clearly showed Hartson kicking Berkovic, who
was on his knees, in the face.
	   The incident followed a tackle which left Berkovic on the
ground.
	   Hartson, the tackler, later went to help Berkovic to his feet
but the Israeli midfielder waved his arms at the gesture. Hartson
allegedly retaliated with a kick and was led away by trainers as
Berkovic slumped back to the ground.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic was quoted saying in the Mirror.
	   He said the incident occured in a training run before West Ham's
Sept. 28 clash with Southampton but the West Ham management had
tried to cover it up.
	   The 7 million pound (dlrs 11.76) midfielder said he enjoyed
playing at West Ham but didn't think he could ``forgive and
forget'' Hartson's actions.
	   ``I am considering my future and I may have to move,'' he said.
	   Hartson responded Wednesday by saying Berkovic was using the
incident as an excuse to move to a bigger club.
	   ``If Eyal wants to leave the club, then maybe he should go and
see the manager to sort things out,'' he said.
	   ``He shouldn't bring this thing up about me to try and get away
from the club.''
	   The Welsh striker said Berkovic's fued with team-mate John
Moncur during a match at Chelsea earlier this year had been another
ploy to leave the club.
	   However, Hartson told a club supporters' telephone line that he
considered Berkovic a quality player and didn't want him to leave
the club.
	   West Ham coach Harry Redknapp has denied any bad feeling between
the players.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An order allowing extradition of teen-age
murder suspect Samuel Sheinbein home to Maryland has been appealed
to Israel's Supreme Court, one of his lawyers said Wednesday.
	   Sheinbein, 18, has been charged in the grisly murder and
dismemberment of a fellow Maryland teen-ager in September 1997.
Claiming Israeli citizenship, he fled here two days after the
scorched, mutilated body of Alfredo Tello Jr. was discovered in a
garage near the Sheinbein home.

Yugoslavia agrees to OSCE mission in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Yugoslav government has invited the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to send its
mission to Kosovo, Poland's foreign ministry said Wednesday.
	   Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, who is head of the OSCE this
year, received a letter from the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic inviting the mission to the troubled province, ministry
spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski told the state news agency PAP.
	   PAP said Dobrowolski declined to give details pending a news
conference later Wednesday to be given by Geremek.
	   A permanent OSCE mission in Kosovo, where Serb forces are
battling ethnic Albanians seeking autonomy, was one of the
organization's conditions for readmitting Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.

Singapore police seize largest ever haul of pirated CDs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore police have reported their largest
seizure of pirated goods ever _ about 450,000 music, video and
software CDs worth 5.4 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 3.2
million).
	   A statement Wednesday from the Criminal Investigation Department
said 18 members of a ``major syndicate'' were arrested in the
operation Tuesday, which ``crippled (their) illegal activities.''
	   The action was the result of months of investigations into a
syndicate that smuggled and distributed the pirated CDs across the
island republic, it said.
	   Representatives from five industry watchdog organizations
assisted police in the operation, the statement added.
	   Singapore places some responsibility for investigating and
enforcing its Copyright Act with the private sector, a procedure
criticized by the U.S. government.
	   American officials have urged more active participation by the
Singapore authorities. In May, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshevsky put Singapore on the Watch List of 32 countries where
intellectual property rights are deemed to be endangered.
	   But the U.S. report on intellectual property rights conceded
that Singapore's ``government has shown a willingness in recent
months to enforce the copyright laws itself rather than leave the
responsibility to right holders.''
	   It added that the United States would continue to monitor the
situation.
	   In April, the government introduced new measures to protect
intellectual property rights and curb software piracy.
	   Singapore has also conducted a number of highly publicized raids
this year in an effort to restore its image and crack down on the
growing trade in pirated music, videos and software.
	   In the first quarter of the year, authorities and industry
bodies averaged 15 raids a day, according to earlier news reports.
	   Under the law, anyone convicted of selling or distributing
pirated goods faces a maximum punishment of five years in prison
and 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 60,000) in fines.

Whale watchers look on horrified as killer whales attack baby
</HEADLINE>
humpback &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A boatload of tourists watched as two
groups of killer whales hunted and killed a baby humpback whale off
Australia's east coast Tuesday.
	   The newspaper Courier Mail reported Wednesday that the group of
whale watchers saw the killer whales, also known as orcas, separate
a humpback calf from its mother and kill it as a pod of humpbacks
passed North Stradbroke Island, in Queensland state, on their
annual southern migration.
	   Peter Hale, executive director of the Center for Conservation
Biology at the University of Queensland, said killer whales hunted
all kinds of animals and that an attack on another whale species
was not unusual.
	   He said great white, or white pointer, sharks and orcas often
followed migrating humpbacks from the cold waters near Antarctica
north to the warmer waters off the Queensland coast during autumn
and back again in the spring.
	   Orcas usually single out the old, sick and very young humpbacks
that are less able to take evasive action, Hale said.
	   Last year, whale watchers at Byron Bay in northern New South
Wales saw adult humpbacks being pursued by a pod of killer whales
but the humpbacks escaped, he said.
	   Last century, whalers with harpoons would kill humpbacks, and
killer whales would close in and feast on the discarded humpbacks'
lips and tongues.
	   Hale said he could not recall the killing of a humpback by
killer whales actually being witnessed.
	   ``It just happened to occur during the day in calm weather where
people could see it off Point Lookout on North Stradbroke Island,''
he said.

EU gives Denmark two months to allow sales of beers, sodas in cans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union Commission warned
Denmark Wednesday it must lift a ban on the sale of canned drinks
within two months or face a court action.
	   In a statement, the Commission, the EU's executive body said
Denmark's general ban on the use of metal cans for beverages does
not comply with EU rules on packaging.
	   ``Denmark allows exactly the same kind of cans for other
products you may find in a supermarket, so Denmark obviously
doesn't have a problem with the cans themselves,'' said Peter
Jorgensen, spokesman for the EU's Danish Environment Commissioner
Ritt Bjerregaard.
	   Under EU law, Denmark or any other EU country cannot block the
marketing of a type of packaging that the Commission has ruled is
acceptable across the 15-nation bloc.
	   The Commission has also given Denmark two months to change laws
under which domestic manufacturers cannot market drinks in
non-refillable glass and plastic packaging.
	   The Green party in the European parliament denounced the
Commission's decision.
	   ``The Commission wants Denmark to stop its environmental
friendly policy of banning aluminium and steel cans for soft drinks
and beer and encouraging the use of refillable glass and plastic
packaging,'' a statement said.
	   ``Instead of taking the environmental champions to court, the
European Commission should rewrite the EU packaging directive to
make it environmental friendly,'' Green parliamentarian Hiltrud
Breyer said.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Opening an official visit, Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said his country wants to help
Mozambique develop. A newspaper reported Portugal will reschedule
part of Mozambique's debt.
	   Guterres, on his first day of a five-day official visit to this
former Portuguese colony, held talks Tuesday with President Joaquim
Chissano, who had his own ideas about where any assistance would be
best spent.
	   ``There is still a lot to do to eliminate poverty, hunger and
problems of education and health,'' Chissano said in his speech to
Guterres, who was accompanied by several Cabinet ministers and a
group of businessmen.
	   Portugal is second only to South Africa as the source of foreign
investment in Mozambique. Current Portuguese investments are
estimated at 123 million dollars, in 198 projects.
	   The Maputo daily Noticias, citing an unnamed Mozambican
government source, said about 7 million dollars of Mozambique's 465
million-dollars debt to Portugal is to be rescheduled during
Guterres' visit.
	   The two countries are also expected to sign agreements during
Guterres' visit, one for support to the Mozambican budget, and the
other granting 2.5 million dollars to be used in completing the
rehabilitation of the northern railway between the port of Nacala
and the Malawian border.
	   --
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo
have signed an agreement regulating the participation of Chadian
troops in the Congo government's fight to put down a rebellion.
	   The accords signed Tuesday were proof that ``Africans can solve
their own
	   problems,'' Congo's Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene told
reporters.
	   Chadian Defense Minister Omar Kadjalamine Boukhar said the
deployment of his country's troops in Congo was in line with a
decision taken at a meeting of west and central African heads of
states last month in Gabon.
	   As many as 1,000 troops from Chad are believed to be already in
Congo.
	   Chad joins a coalition of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian
troops fighting in support of Congolese President Laurent Kabila
who is battling a rebel army of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and political opponents.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Demonstrators opposed to the allocation of
parts of a forest for a housing project set three bulldozers and an
adjacent United Nations office ablaze on Wednesday.
	   The demonstration was organized by the Green Belt Movement,
which plants trees countrywide, and the private Kenya Human Rights
Commission.
	   There has been public outcry over the decision to build on parts
of Karura Forest, next to U.N. Environment Program offices. The
forest is the source of three small rivers.
	   The demonstrators, mostly women and young men, broke the gate
before setting ablaze the bulldozers and the office. They also
planted trees on land cleared for street construction.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A leading Zambian jurist on Wednesday
denounced constitutional powers that allow President Frederick
Chiluba to declare a state of emergency.
	   Alfred Chanda, assistant law dean at the University of Zambia
who has frequently appeared in the High Court on behalf of detained
state opponents, also decried the failure of the country's courts
to protect government opponents.
	   ``Zambia is obliged to meet international human rights
standards. If it fails to meet those it will be condemned,'' Chanda
said at a seminar organized by the country's independent Human
Rights Commission.
	   Chanda said Zambia's current constitution allowed Chiluba, who
came to power under the country's first democratic elections in
1991, to waive all rights except to life, to freedom from slavery
and from degrading treatment, once an emergency was in force.
	   Chanda condemned the country's judges for a recent ruling they
had no constitutional right to probe last October's declaration of
a state of emergency by Chiluba following a failed army coup.
Rejecting a petition by jailed opposition leader Dean Mung'omba,
the judges said Chiluba could not be forced to give any reasons for
declaring the emergency, which was rescinded in March.
	   Chanda urged the constitution be amended to give judges the
unquestioned right to invalidate emergency powers.
	   --
	   ELDORET, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel Arap Moi on Wednesday
officially opened Eldoret International Airport located in his home
region in central Kenya, an airport official said.
	   Kenya Airports Authority spokeswoman Selina Atieno said the
Eldoret Airport, 280 kilometers (175 miles) northwest of Nairobi,
is managed by the Liege International Airport of Belgium and KAA.
	   The airport was constructed despite criticism from international
donors and opposition leaders that it was a waste of money and its
sole purpose is to serve Moi and his home region.
	   In April, Auditor General D. G Njoroge said Moi's office misused
2.67 billion shillings (dlrs 37.6 million) in unbudgeted funds to
construct the airport.
	   Atieno said Eldoret is the third airport in Kenya equipped to
handle international traffic. The others are Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport in Nairobi and Moi International Airport in
the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa.
	   The French firm SNC Lavalin began construction on the airport in
1991. Criticism forced the government to scale down the project
from an initial cost of more than shillings 6 billion (dlrs 100
million) to shillings 3.72 billion (dlrs 62 million).
	   Eldoret is not a tourist center. No foreign airlines make
scheduled flights there.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The former head of Nigeria's national
petroleum company has been appointed to the position of Petroleum
Advisor, the government has announced.
	   Aret Adams, who once held the Nigerian Petroleum Corporation's
top post, was appointed Tuesday by head of state Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar.
	   In August, Abubakar scrapped the country's oil ministry and said
he would
	   appoint a civilian technocrat to oversee the West African
country's lucrative petroleum sector.
	   Although Nigeria has one of the world's largest oil industries,
the country is plagued by chronic shortages of refined fuel and a
number of refineries stand idle as a result of neglect and graft.
	   Also Tuesday, Abubakar named appointees to three other key
offices _ a new chief press secretary and new advisers on political
affairs and drug control.

meeting set, Russian parliament seeks meeting with NATO
ambassadors. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin spoke by telephone with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and met with Russia's foreign
minister Wednesday in hopes of finding a diplomatic solution to the
conflict in Kosovo.
	   In the conversation with Blair, Yeltsin voiced concern over the
``calls for military action in the Balkans from certain forces in
NATO'' the Kremlin said. Blair is currently on a visit to China.
	   ``Boris Yeltsin underlined that such developments would be
disastrous for global peace and drastically change the situation''
in the region, a Kremlin statement said.
	   NATO is building up forces at a base in southern Italy and has
threatened airstrikes against Serb forces that are cracking down on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, an Albanian-majority
province in southern Yugoslavia.
	   Russia fiercely opposes airstrikes against Yugoslavia, its
traditional ally. Both are Slavic countries that practice an
Orthodox religion.
	   Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop NATO strikes.
	   Also, Yeltsin told Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to attend a
meeting of the six-member Contact Group on Yugoslavia, Russian news
agencies reported. The group includes the United States, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Russia.
	   Russian media said the meeting would be held Friday in London,
but the British Foreign Office said no such meeting was scheduled.
	   Ivanov told Yeltsin that Russia's efforts to discourage
airstrikes have ``resulted in a growing understanding of the
feasibility for a political settlement,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted Yeltsin scalled for the
rupture of diplomatic relations with NATO countries if they proceed
with airstrikes.
	   He said the use of force against the Serbs would be a ``dress
rehearsal for a similar future action in Russia.''
	   ``They are fighting not for the human rights, but for the
destruction of Russia's only ally in Europe,'' Zhirinovsky said at
a news conference.

Bulgaria to export up to 500,000 tons of wheat to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will export 500,000 tons of
wheat to Russia under a deal to be finalized later this week, a
report said Wednesday.
	   The daily Trud quoted Stoyan Alexandrov, head of the Central
Cooperative Bank as saying the quantity was equal to Bulgaria's
wheat surplus this year.
	   Two years ago Bulgaria imported wheat to cover shortages
stemming from government controlled prices and slow land
restitution.
	   This year Bulgaria posted a wheat surplus after the government
liberalized prices and speeded up the transition of farming land
into private hands.

Myanmar won't lift decades-old currency controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Myanmar will not lift its decades-old
controls on foreign exchange despite calls against protectionism
among Southeast Asian nations, a Myanmar official said Wednesday.
	   Brig. Gen. David Abel also urged countries belonging to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to impose temporary controls
on capital flows to shield their economies from massive transfers
of capital out of their borders.
	   For years, Southeast Asia was a favored destination for
investment and loans. But much of that investment dried up last
year following the start of the region's currency crisis.
	   Abel said controls are needed especially in poor countries to
guard against people who move large amounts of capital to make
profits, unmindful of the destructive effects on the economy and
people.
	   ``It creates a lot of vacuum in the world. They put in the money
and all of a sudden draw it off. We're finished,'' Abel said.
	   ``They don't think of anybody but themselves, so poor people
will suffer,'' he added.
	   Abel said he supports Malaysia's decision to clamp temporary
controls on foreign exchange to help stabilize its ailing economy.
	   Abel, a minister in Myanmar's State Peace and Development
Council, is attending an annual meeting of ASEAN's economic and
trade ministers.
	   Speaking at the opening of the two-day meeting Wednesday,
Philippine President Joseph Estrada called on ASEAN countries to
fight an urge to impose controls to cope with the effects of Asia's
financial storm.
	   Military-run Myanmar has been politically isolated for decades.
Last year, it was accepted as a member of ASEAN despite protests
from Western nations over its human rights record.
	   It strictly controls the entry and transfer of foreign
currencies through a foreign exchange regulation act that took
effect in 1947.

Indonesian official says confidence rising in rupiah
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An Indonesian economic official said
Wednesday that confidence in the rupiah is returning but warned
against an overly sharp appreciation in the currency.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's coordinating minister for
economics, finance, industry and development supervision, said the
pace of the rupiah's recent rise calls for ``some attention'' and
that the appreciation may be too sharp.
	   But, he added, ``I'm very happy about the direction.''
	   Ginandjar, attending a meeting in Manila of trade ministers from
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the government
wants to see a ``gradual'' appreciation in the currency.
	   ``For instance, we don't want to see the rupiah jump to 8,000''
to the dollar, he said.
	   The rupiah was among the currencies hit hardest by Asia's
financial crisis.
	   Ginandjar stressed that the government is committed to a
market-determined exchange rate and that there will be no
intervention to slow the rupiah's rise.
	   He said it was too early to say whether a plan that could force
exporters to repatriate their foreign exchange earnings would be
made mandatory or voluntary.
	   On Wednesday, the rupiah closed higher against the U.S. dollar
in active trading. After breaking the psychologically important
level of 10,000 rupiah to the dollar shortly after trading started,
it ended Asian trading at 9,600 rupiah to the dollar, stronger than
its close Tuesday of 10,000 rupiah.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance will hold a special
joint council with Russia here Friday to brief the Russians on
NATO's possible actions in Kosovo and stress they share the

Philippine vehicle sales down 55 percent in first nine months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars and
commercial vehicles in the Philippines totaled 27,512 in this
year's first nine months, down 55 percent from 61,413 a year
earlier, an industry association said Wednesday.
	   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
attributed the sharp decline to tighter credit and higher interest
rates.
	   Banks have become very selective with their loan approvals since
the regional financial crisis broke. Those able to receive loans
must pay sharply higher rates.
	   In September alone, sales of passenger cars fell 32 percent from
a year earlier to 1,984.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov gave his Communist
deputy broad powers over the new government's economic course,
Russian media reported Wednesday.
	   However, Primakov plans to personally oversee the Finance
Ministry, indicating he wants to reserve for himself the final say
on major economic decisions.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who served as the
last head of the Soviet central planning agency, has pushed for
full control over the economic-related ministries.
	   Maslyukov will be in charge of economic and trade ministries and
various other bodies, including the committee for state property
management that oversees privatization.
	   He will also be acting prime minister during Primakov's absence
and oversee talks with the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and other international lenders, Russian media reported.
	   Liberal economists have been critical of Maslyukov, saying he is
likely to opt for at least some Soviet-style controls on the
economy.
	   Primakov says he will continue with economic reforms, but
opposes the ``wild capitalism'' that has characterized Russia's
moves toward a market economy.
	   Primakov has decided to personally oversee the finance, foreign,
defense and interior ministries, as well as tax service and customs
committee and several other agencies, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported Wednesday.
	   Cabinet ministers will still be appointed to those ministries,
but their policies will be subject to final approval by Primakov,
and ultimately by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Also Wednesday, Maslyukov said the government would drop import
duties on several key food items and lower them on other food and
medicines, in an effort to fill store shelves emptied by the
economic crisis. He did not say what products would be affected.
	   Primakov spoke on national television Tuesday evening, the day
before nationwide strikes, and assured Russians that the government
would pay off all wage and pension arrears and make sure there
would be no shortage of basic foods.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov criticized a recent
statement by Maslyukov, who said that Russia would be unable to pay
its debts this fall without help from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Zadornov insisted that Russia could make the payments without
IMF aid, and that Maslyukov's words didn't help advance Russia's
interests, the business daily Kommersant said.
	   Zadornov, who is in Washington pushing the IMF and other lenders
to give more money to Russia, didn't explain how the government
would finance its spending without Western aid.
	   ``We must clearly understand, that any attempt to solve wage and
pension debts by cranking up money-printing presses will lead to
sharp rise in prices,'' Zadornov said on Russian television.
	   The IMF wants the Russian government to come up with a sound
economic program approved by the parliament as a condition for
further loans.
	   Maslyukov said the government expects to complete its plan to
revive the economy by the end of the month and indicated that it
may still turn to money-printing if it does not get IMF aid.
	   ``So far, prospects for our cooperation with the international
financial organizations remain unclear and that's why the
government hasn't made a decision yet on which financial and
economic plan it would implement to stabilize the situation,''
Maslyukov said at a meeting with western bankers, according to the
Russian news agencies.
	   The delivery of the next installment of a previously negotiated
IMF loan would ``create conditions to stop any talk about printing
money,'' he added.

Albright meets with Netanyahu, Arafat on withdrawal deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lunch over, quote from Palestinian negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Israeli and Palestinian
leaders met for more than three hours Wednesday in their most
extensive talks in a year, but a Palestinian negotiator said they
made no progress toward agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided to continue talks in Washington in
mid-October, said the Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath.
	   ``The only thing that was agreed on is that we are going to
Washington on the 14th,'' Shaath told reporters.
	   The two leaders had been brought together by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright who tried to narrow the gaps during a
two-day shuttle and prepare the ground for a Washington summit.
	   The meeting at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip began with a three-way handshake, with Albright, Netanyahu
and Arafat sitting at a square table so small their elbows and
knees were almost touching.
	   The three smiled for photographers. Albright twice left the room
to let Arafat and Netanyahu talk alone. The two had not spoken
without a mediator for over a year.
	   The talks then moved to a nearby Palestinian guesthouse where
the three had lunch. It marked the first time Netanyahu ventured
into Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   Asked about the talks, Albright said ``they are moving on'' and
Netanyahu said they were ``good.''
	   Heading into the meeting at Erez, Arafat had blamed Israel for
the continued deadlock in the negotiations. Addressing a gathering
of U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said he has long accepted a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security gestures.
	   ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said.
	   Israel's main demand is that the Palestinians stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement
brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials was
vetoed by Netanyahu.
	   Palestinian and Israeli officials said no progress has been made
on revising the document. The director of the CIA, George Tenet,
has arrived in the region and is participating in the negotiations,
said a Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Albright briefed Israeli President Ezer
Weizman over breakfast. Weizman said he was ``a bit more
optimistic, but not entirely'' about the fate of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
	   Weizman said he heard nothing concrete in Albright's report, but
expected the negotiations to continue this month. He said reaching
an agreement depends on Arafat and Netanyahu. ``I think this must
be done,'' he said, ``but the prime minister must decide this, and
Arafat has something to say about this, too.''

Report: Russia supplied Serbs with missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia has supplied the Serbs with advanced
surface-to-air missile equipment that will threaten NATO aircraft
if the go-ahead is given for airstrikes in the province of Kosovo,
The Times of London reported Wednesday.
	   Quoting unnamed senior defense officials in London, The Times
said the Serbs had acquired new air defense systems that ``had to
be taken very seriously.''
	   The threat was discussed Tuesday at a meeting of the chiefs of
staff of Britain's Ministry of Defense, the newspaper said.
	   The Serbs have been supplied with new warheads, fuses and
sensors for their mobile Sam 6 missiles, and the upgrade of the old
Russian surface-to-air missile has made it faster and given it an
extended range, the report said.
	   It was not clear whether the arms had been acquired through
official Russian channels or via unofficial Russian suppliers, The
Times said.
	   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council called for ``full and
sustained compliance'' with a two-week-old resolution demanding
that Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end its attacks
on civilians in the separatist province.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore banks may be ready for their second

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments ahead of Wednesday's latest talks. ``The
situation's extremely serious,'' he said.
	   Despite a Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units, a U.S. spokesman said Wednesday there was still
no consensus for military action.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels.
	   Preparations for intervention continued Wednesday. Britain,
France and Germany all recommended that their nationals leave
Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   Following a meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in Belgrade
Tuesday night, diplomatic sources said there was no change in
Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands, particularly
on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military activity in
the province for eight days _ something the ethnic Albanians
dispute.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
It also invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to send a mission to Kosovo, officials said.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier _ in addition to 11,000 special military and
anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   ``NATO is still not satisfied with compliance,'' the official
said.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces
shelled four villages Tuesday night and Wednesday in the Malisevo
region southwest of Pristina. The report could not be verified.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.

ASEAN members sign agreement to liberalize investment in Southeast

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Trade ministers from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations signed an agreement Wednesday to remove
restrictions on investment in the region in an effort to make it
more attractive to investors and overcome its financial crisis.
	   ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said the agreement to
establish an ``ASEAN Investment Area'' will make it easier for
investors in one country to invest in other countries in the
region.
	   The agreement, which officials hope will boost trade and
investment in the once economically vibrant region, capped the
first day of the annual ASEAN economic ministers' meeting.
	   Investment in Southeast Asia has dropped sharply since the
region's currency crisis hit 15 months ago. The AIA is a bid to
make the region again ``very competitive, with a very transparent
and attractive investment climate,'' says Melito Salazar Jr.,
Philippine undersecretary of trade and industry.
	   Most ASEAN members are either mired in recession or grappling
with sharply lower growth as a result of the crisis.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Under the agreement, national treatment _ applying the same
investment rules to both local and foreign businessmen _ will be
extended to ASEAN investors by 2010 and to all other investors 10
years later.
	   All industries will be opened to outside investors, except those
that affect national security and public morals, those relating to
the protection of human, animal or plant life and those necessary
to comply with laws to protect the public.
	   In case of ``serious'' balance of payments and financial
difficulties, an ASEAN country may adopt investment restrictions,
but such measures should be temporary and should not harm other
members of ASEAN, according to the agreement.
	   Each country can also draw up a list of investment areas or
industries that it cannot immediately open up to others in ASEAN.
This ``exclusion list,'' however, will be phased out by 2010,
except for Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, ASEAN's most recent members.
	   Vietnam will be allowed to phase out its exclusion list by 2013
and Laos and Myanmar by 2015.
	   The trade ministers also signed an agreement under which they
will notify each other of any changes in trade policies, including
tariffs, quotas, surcharges, customs valuation, export taxes,
licensing, and foreign exchange controls related to trade.

Bulgaria scraps shipment of radiation-contaminated mushrooms

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A planeload of mushrooms found to contain
a radioactive substance was scrapped by Bulgarian authorities.
	   The mushrooms, picked in southern Bulgaria and destined for
export, contained radioactive cesium-137, Peter Konstantinov of the
National Institute Hydrology and meteorology told the daily 24
Chassa for a story Wednesday.
	   Konstantinov was quoted as saying the radiation probably came
from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in Ukraine.
	   The report didn't give the amount of mushrooms destroyed or
specify the degree of radioactivity. It also did not say their
destination.

Thailand to seek part of dlrs 30 billion Japanese financing
</HEADLINE>
package &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Thailand will seek to tap part of a
dlrs 30 billion financing package being offered by Japan to help
Southeast Asian countries overcome their currency crisis, a Thai
official said Wednesday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said Thailand needs
supplementary financing to help alleviate its present financial
squeeze.
	   Tapping the Japanese financing would help support the issuing of
government bonds in international markets, he said.
	   Japan is putting together the dlrs 30 billion aid package in
response to international demands that it do more to ease the
region's financial crisis.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the plan
envisages the Export-Import Bank of Japan guaranteeing debts and
buying government bonds of the Asian countries.
	   Supachai said that following Thailand's agreement last year with
the International Monetary Fund for financial support, it became
clear that further financing was needed, particularly to boost the
capital of financial institutions such as the Bank for Agriculture
and the Housing Bank.
	   Thailand is the beneficiary of a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF-arranged
credit line.
	   He made clear, however, that any funds tapped from the Japanese
financing package would not be plowed into the country's commercial
banks.
	   Supachai, speaking outside a meeting of trade ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the funds could play a
significant part in successfully launching government bonds.
	   He noted that external factors have already driven up the
margins on existing Thai bonds to ``prohibitive heights.''
	   Thailand had planned to issue an initial tranche of dlrs 1
billion or dlrs 2 billion in global bonds this year, but
indefinitely postponed its plans after premiums on similar U.S.
Treasury bonds rose as high as 700 basis points, from around
300-400 basis points in the second quarter.
	   Supachai noted that a recent Thai bond guaranteed by the World
Bank for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand achieved
a far better risk rating than some other domestic bonds.
	   He said that if the Japanese financing package could be used to
address this kind of issue, it would help to mobilize additional
funds for Thailand.
	   ``We can cope with the situation at the moment, but it would
certainly help alleviate the credit squeeze,'' he said.
	   Supachai made clear that any funds tapped from the package would
not be used to repay Thailand's loans to Japanese banks.

Police find bomb planted in moped outside Naples courthouse

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ A week after a car bomb injured 13 people
in Naples, police Wednesday found explosives planted in a moped
outside the city's courthouse.
	   Bomb experts went to the site after police received an anonymous
tip. The bomb was composed of 400 grams (14 ounces) of plastic
explosives and could have caused widespread damage had it been
connected to a detonator and went off, police said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility.
	   Last week's attack in a crowded neighborhood was blamed on the
Camorra crime syndicate. There was also a bazooka attack on the
villa of suspected boss which damaged a gate but caused no
injuries.

U.S. envoy tries again to persuade Yugoslav president to end

crackdown &QL;

Yugoslavia, ethnic Albanians claim Serb shelling; DELETES incorrect

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy scheduled more talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood, Holbrooke had only terse public comments
ahead of Wednesday's latest talks. ``The situation's extremely
serious,'' he said.
	   Despite a Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units, a U.S. spokesman said Wednesday there was still
no consensus for military action.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels.
	   Preparations for intervention continued Wednesday. Britain,
France and Germany all recommended that their citizens leave
Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people
have been driven from their homes in the southern province in
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Following a Tuesday night meeting between Milosevic and
Holbrooke in Belgrade, diplomatic sources said there was no change
in Milosevic's refusal to accept international demands,
particularly on the withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo.
The Yugoslav leader repeatedly claimed there has been no military
activity in the province for eight days _ something the ethnic
Albanians dispute.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the Kosovo conflict,
Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to the province
Wednesday for discussions with the Serbian-installed interim
government in Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize.
It also invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to send a mission to Kosovo, officials said.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
The Serbs claim all special police units, in the forefront of
strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been pulled out.
	   So far, however, international diplomatic observers have
disputed Serb claims.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   ``NATO is still not satisfied with compliance,'' the official
said.
	   Western leaders, accusing Milosevic of breaking countless past
promises, say all moves to end the conflict must be verifiable and
irreversible.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces
shelled four villages Tuesday night and Wednesday in the Malisevo
region southwest of Pristina. The report could not be verified.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.

Naina Yeltsin: Doctors say Yeltsin ``more or less'' healthy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced
his health ``more or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she
hesitated even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so
much conjecture on this topic.''
	   Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups.
	   ``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs.
Yeltsin declared.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern, and
the worry has been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his
condition. Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996
presidential election and had a heart attack, followed by multiple
bypass surgery, in the months after his victory.
	   Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for Russians who took part
Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages. She also said that
criticism of the president was normal, though it was offensive when
it focused on anything other than his professional performance,
such as his age.
	   ``It seems to me ... that people expected a miracle from him,''
Mrs. Yeltsin said. ``But surely you can't curse a person for not
being a magician.''
	   Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that her family would leave Russia
after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000 as ``absolute nonsense.''
	   ``I think we'll live like all normal people. At least it will be
calmer than it is now.''

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ After lengthy talks with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced on Wednesday an Oct. 15 summit would be held in
Washington to try to work out agreement on a West Bank accord.
	   ``We made significant progress,'' she said after meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   In fact, Albright told reporters, ``We are in a far better
position to finalize all the issues.''
	   Albright's meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu followed up on
discussion the two leaders had with President Clinton last month.
At the time, President Bill Clinton invited them back to Washington
to try to finalize a West Bank accord.

Pro-Syria minister to boycott army chief's election as president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally
on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army
commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect
the military man for the executive post.
	   Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he and
his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member
Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23.
	   Although a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
will hardly spoil the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could
embolden others to express discontent at the choice and the process
of his election.
	   Lahoud is virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and
the parliament speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the
all-important backing of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   ``Historically, we do not approve that a military man takes
control of the country,'' Jumblatt told reporters after a meeting
with outgoing President Elias Hrawi.
	   Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is
common among anti-Syrian politicians, it is rare for somebody like
Jumblatt to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by
Syrian President Hafez Assad who keeps 30,000 troops in Lebanon.
	   Like Jumblatt, some in Lebanon fear that a military man as
president could mean intelligence agents will track civilian life
just as they did between 1958 and 1964 during the presidency of
Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander to become head of
state.
	   In nominating Lahoud, ``rules were not respected,'' Jumblatt
said. ``Things were supposed to run in a more democratic way,''
said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces during
the 1975-90 civil war.
	   The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi
leaves office after a six-year term.
	   Jumblatt said ``there is adequate political diversity and
competition in the country,'' implying that choosing a military man
for president was unnecessary.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fears about
military intrusion. He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep the
army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.''
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and
political support at home and has good relations with Syria.
	   He gained public admiration for reuniting an army fractured by
civil war and in ending the reign of militias. Many hope he will
cleanse the government of nepotism and wastage of public funds.
	   Lahoud's nomination complies with a tradition that the president
be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and
Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The government is run by the
joint efforts of the three officials.
	   Jumblatt said his party will also boycott a Parliamentary
session to amend the Constitution so that senior public servants
can run for president.
	   Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of
Catholic bishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed
the choice of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said.

Police evacuate U.S. embassy building after bomb threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police on Wednesday evacuated the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo and searched the building after an anonymous
caller claimed a bomb was planted in the premises, officials said.
	   Police searched inside and outside the building but found
nothing, said police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. mission did not comment on the report, but an official
told The Associated Press that the embassy was operating normally.
	   Police officials said an embassy official received a call at
5:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) informing about a bomb. The officials did not
say how many staffers were evacuated but at that hour the embassy
would have been manned only by a skeletal overnight staff.
	   The embassy received another call at 7:30 a.m. (5:30 GMT), the
officials said. The caller, a man speaking with a southern Egyptian
accent, demanded the release by Oct. 12 of two Egyptian clerics
from American and Israeli prisons, said the officials.
	   Failure to release them will result in American embassies being
targeted, said the caller who identified himself as Abu el-Yamin.
He claimed to be a member of the ``Holy Struggle in the Path of
Allah,'' a previously unknown group, the officials said.
	   Islamic militants who have been fighting since 1992 to oust
Egypt's secular government of President Hosni Mubarak are based
mostly in the south.
	   The caller did not specify which embassies would be targeted or
mention any bomb at the embassy in Cairo, said the officials.
	   The clerics that the caller wanted released are Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric serving life sentence in
the United States for a plot to bomb U.S. landmarks; and Sheik
Mohammed Abdel-Rahman from an Israeli prison.
	   Security for the U.S. Embassy and other American institutions
has been stepped up since the twin bombings on Aug. 7 of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The blasts killed 259 people and
wounded thousands.

Rebels, government battle for Congolese air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ The bloody bandages of injured rebels
trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the
three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu was not going
well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle
for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using
to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground
troops.
	   Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attacks,
which began Monday, continued on Wednesday. Mondo said he was
expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel
offensive.
	   On Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at
Kalima, a small town 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu,
serving as a rear base for the attack. Sweaty and weary, some
limping and others bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a
hospital in Goma, the rebel stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles)
east, on the Rwandan border.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers
in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ faced stiff
resistance.
	   In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the
Congolese Armed Forces, known as the FAC, had killed 18 rebels in
warding off the attacks.
	   ``Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now
launched an offensive after defending its positions,'' said a
ministry statement broadcast on state-run television. ``The
civilians there are cooperating fully with the FAC as their
counterparts did previously in Kinshasa,'' the capital.
	   Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and
demonstrate can carry their two-month rebellion into the rest of
Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel victory would also
open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich in copper
and diamonds.
	   The rebels targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the
outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail
out Kabila.
	   Rebel commanders say their 2,000 fighters face an estimated
5,000 government troops, apparently reinforced by Sudanese
soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion
that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and
creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.

EREZ CHECKPOINT: the meetings.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   She noted that the two leaders spontaneously decided to extend
their talks over lunch at a nearby Palestinian guesthouse, and that
Netanyahu crossed into Palestinian-controlled territory for the
first time in order to join Arafat in the meal.
	   Albright cautioned, however, that ``an awful lot of problems
still have to be resolved and those are the kind the leaders have
to resolve while we are in Washington.''
	   Albright said the meetings in Washington would begin Oct. 15 and
would be open-ended. She said both Netanyahu and Arafat had agreed
to commit ``substantial and intensive'' time to the effort in
Washington to reach an agreement. She said U.S. President Bill
Clinton would be ``very much involved'' in the negotiations.
	   She said ``substantial progress'' had been made on five issues,
including the operation of a Palestinian airport and an industrial
park, during Wednesday's talks.
	   In the meantime, she urged both sides to ``keep their eye on the
ball'' and not to take unilateral actions before the summit.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath was less optimistic, saying
no agreements were reached Wednesday except to continue talks in
Washington.
	   The meeting at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip began with a three-way handshake, with Albright, Netanyahu
and Arafat sitting at a square table so small their elbows and
knees were almost touching.
	   The three smiled for photographers. Albright twice left the room
to let Arafat and Netanyahu talk alone. The two had not spoken
without a mediator for over a year.
	   Heading into the meeting at Erez, Arafat had blamed Israel for
the continued deadlock in the negotiations. Addressing a gathering
of U.N. officials in Gaza City, Arafat said he has long accepted a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security gestures.
	   ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign of approval
for the American initiative, but in spite of that we are continuing
our negotiations today,'' Arafat said.
	   Israel's main demand is that the Palestinians stop extremists
from attacking Israel. A previous draft of a security agreement
brokered by Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials was
vetoed by Netanyahu.
	   Palestinian and Israeli officials said no progress has been made
on revising the document. The director of the CIA, George Tenet,
has arrived in the region and is participating in the negotiations,
said a Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy held more talks Wednesday with
Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav president
to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments ahead of the latest talks that started
at mid-afternoon Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely serious,''
he said.

West Bank settlement gets city status
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mideast-Albright &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face
of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Ariel.
	   Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up an attempt to try to move
Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward agreement over a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18
miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
	   Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit
to Ariel was arranged. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan,
could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy
accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a
message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
	   Ariel was established in 1977. Nachman said raising the status
of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means
permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
	   For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles
to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians denounce
the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
	   Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with
the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel
while the ceremony is in progress.
	   A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in
Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.

Prime Minister issues new warning over Kosovo; Foreign Office
</HEADLINE>
advises Britons to leave Yugoslavia
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Blair quote graf 2; minor editing to conform

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday issued a
fresh warning over Kosovo to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
as the Foreign Office told Britons to leave the Balkan state.
	   ``President Milosevic may think the international community will
not act. But in the end it will act, and we're at the end now, and
he must listen to our warnings or face the consequences,'' Blair
said in a speech to British business representatives in Beijing
during a visit to China.
	   In London, the Foreign Office was contacting all 117 Britons
registered as living in Yugoslavia, and advising them to leave ``in
view of the increasingly volatile situation,'' said a spokesman,
speaking on the customary terms anonymity.
	   ``We advise against travel to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and we also advise British nationals in the FRY to leave
immediately,'' a statement from the Foreign Office said. The
warning was transmitted on British Broadcasting Corp. World Service
radio, and posted on the Foreign Office's Internet website.
	   Earlier Prime Minister Blair, who has spoken to both Russian and
United States presidents in the past 24 hours, said military action
was drawing closer, and that NATO is ready to use military force to
halt the bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' Blair said in a BBC radio
interview from Beijing. ``People like myself have been saying for a
long period of time now if we don't act, or threaten to act, then
President Milosevic will simply take no notice of us.''
	   His comments came on the heels of United Nations Security
Council members calling Tuesday for ``full and sustained
compliance'' with the two-week-old resolution demanding that
Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end its attacks on
civilians.
	   Serbian military police still maintain a strong presence in
Kosovo despite repeated international demands for them to ease
their crackdown on separatists.
	   ``We have to make sure now that (Milosevic) is complying with
the UN resolutions,'' Blair said. ``We have to make sure he is
withdrawing from a position where he is able to commit these
atrocities, these acts of barbarism in Kosovo, and he should know
very clearly that if he doesn't then serious action will follow.''
	   Asked when attacks might take place, Blair said: ``We have to
judge the timing, but it's pretty clear that this issue is coming
to a point of urgency.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.

	   ``The president is going to be very much involved in a lot of
the detailed work,'' Albright said. ``He has a very special and
uncanny ability to work with people who have difficult problems
like these. He puts himself in their shoes.''
	   Albright praised the cooperation of Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   ``This new spirit was very helpful and I hope very much that it
will be carried on to Washington,'' she said. ``I am very realistic
that there are still hard decisions to be made.''
	   Albright returned to the region this week at Clinton's request
to try to narrow differences in advance of the summit.
	   She told reporters Wednesday that several issues that had been
in dispute for nearly two years had been eased during her three-way
meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat, which ended with a lunch of lamb
and fish at Arafat's guest house on the Palestinian side.
	   These included Israel's projected withdrawal from more of the
West Bank, establishment of an ``anti-incitement'' committee to
improve security, and establishment of a Palestinian industrial
zone in Gaza.
	   She said the summit would extend over several days, telling
reporters, ``We are prepared to spend some substantial time in the
bargaining.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said no precise site
for the summit had been chosen.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy held more talks Wednesday with
Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav president
to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood, Holbrooke had only terse public comments
ahead of the latest talks that started Wednesday afternoon. ``The
situation's extremely serious,'' he said.

NATO military strikes akin to war, Russian defense minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A NATO military strike against Yugoslavia
would be akin to war that could lead to even more bloodshed in
Kosovo, Russia's defense minister said Wednesday.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Marshal Igor Sergeyev
said after meeting with his Greek counterpart.
	   Sergeyev's comments displayed Moscow's unwavering opposition to
military action against Yugoslavia, whose troops have battled
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo for more than six months.
	   Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes in the province, where ethnic Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the population.
	   ``So we believe diplomatic efforts must continue, and in these
efforts the whole of the European community must be involved,''
said Sergeyev, who is on a five-day visit to Greece. He added that
non-NATO nations such as China and Belarus must also be included in
discussions over the crisis.
	   NATO, meanwhile, is building up forces at a base in southern
Italy for possible air strikes. Russia has threatened to use its
veto in the U.N. Security Council to stop such an attack.
	   Although not as adamant as Russia, Greece also objects to the
military option. Both Russia and Greece have religious ties to the
Orthodox Serbs.
	   ``In Kosovo, there is no military solution. The solution in
Kosovo can be and will be only political,'' said Greek Defense
Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos.
	   Like other Balkan countries, Greece fears any escalation of
violence in Kosovo could lead to the conflict spilling over the
borders of Yugoslavia into neighboring countries.
	   His comments also revealed that even the European Union is not
united in full support of the NATO air strikes.
	   ``Greece insists on the need to exhaust all political and
diplomatic efforts in order to avoid a development in Kosovo with
the intervention of NATO military forces,'' Tsochadzopoulos said.
	   Sergeyev echoed the calls for further diplomatic attempts at
defusing the crisis.
	   ``There is a folk saying that every war eventually leads to
peace,'' he said. ``But this is a question of whether it is worth
it for a war to begin.''

Jewish Agency: 110,000 Russians may emigrate annually to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Up to 110,000 Russian Jews may emigrate to Israel
each year, almost twice the current number, a Jewish Agency
official was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Felix Decktor, press secretary of the Moscow branch of the
agency, told the Interfax news agency that Russian Jews had shown
more interest in emigrating to Israel since the end of August.
Russia's latest economic crisis broke that month, when the
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on its loans.
	   ``People wishing to hear advice have been forming a line outside
the agency's gate over the last weeks, something we have not
witnessed before,'' Decktor was quoted as saying. He said that the
number of Russians who had signed up for Hebrew language courses
had doubled.
	   Interfax did not say whether Decktor attributed the increase to
an increase in economic insecurity or Jewish fears of increased
anti-Semitism.
	   After the initial rush to emigrate in the early 1990s, some
50,000-60,000 Russians were moving to Israel each year before the
crisis, Decktor said.

Lions clinch Pacific League pennant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Seibu Lions clinched their second consecutive
Pacific League pennant, their 13th overall, when they split a
doubleheader Wednesday with the Kintetsu Buffaloes at Seibu Dome.
	   The Lions lost the first game 6-5, but won the second 5-2 when
Domingo Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team, drove
in the first run with a sacrifice fly in the first inning and
Kazuhiro Wada smashed a two-run home run in the fifth.
	   The second-place Nippon Ham Fighters lost all chance of catching
up when they lost a doubleheader to the Chiba Lotte Marines, 3-2
and 5-1. With all their 135 games for the season completed, the
Fighters were 4 1/2 games behind the Lions.
	   The Lions also had an insurmountable five-game lead over the
third-place Orix BlueWave, who have three games remaining.
	   The Lions will meet the Central League winner, yet to be
decided, in the best-of-seven Japan Series starting Oct. 17.
	   In last year's series, the Lions lost four games to one to the
Yakult Swallows. Their history dates to 1979, when the former
Fukuoka-based Taiheiyo Club Lions were bought by the Seibu group
with a new franchise outside Tokyo.
	   At Chiba, in their first game against the Fighters, the Marines
scored on former Milwaukee Brewers player Julio Franco's sacrifice
fly in the first inning, Masaumi Shimizu's squeeze bunt in the
second and Kip Gross' balk in the fifth.
	   Gross, formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, gave up eight hits
and took the loss. He is 3-4.
	   In the second game, Tomohiro Kuroki limited the Fighters to four
hits with seven strikeouts for his 12th victory against nine
defeats.
	   In the Central League, the second-place Chunichi Dragons lost
5-3 to the Swallows at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, leaving the Yokohama
BayStars only one victory away from clinching their first pennant
in 38 years _ and only their second ever.
	   The BayStars now are six games ahead of the Dragons, and both
teams have six games remaining this season.
	   Katsuyuki Dobashi drove in the tie-breaking run with a sacrifice
fly in the three-run eighth for the Swallows.
	   A scheduled game between the BayStars and the Hanshin Tigers at
Koshien Stadium was rained out.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy held more talks Wednesday with
Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav president
to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood in the U.S. delegation, Holbrooke had
only terse public comments ahead of the latest talks that started
at mid-afternoon Wednesday. ``The situation's extremely serious,''
he said.

Protesters seize Shell Oil facilities in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Angry youths protesting against the
government have taken control of nine Shell Oil relay stations in
southern Nigeria, company authorities confirmed Wednesday.
	   The flow of crude oil through a number of pipeline relay
facilities has been shut down, halting the transfer of about
250,000 barrels a day.
	   The facilities were seized in several areas over the past few
days by groups of demonstrators angry at local government election
preparations, Shell Nigeria Managing Director Ron Van Den Berg was
quoted as saying in the Lagos-based Tribune newspaper.
	   Voter registration for next year's presidential elections began
this week throughout Nigeria and youth groups in the oil-rich Niger
River delta region have been using the occasion to protest what
they say is their exclusion from the country's political process.
	   Shell officials in Nembe district in southern Nigeria's Delta
state said a group of demonstrators over the weekend attacked four
flow stations and forced the evacuation of company employees from
the area.
	   On Saturday, another group of protesters forced the closure of
Shell flow station facilities in the Odeama Creek area. Three
company boats were also seized along with 12 crew members. a
company official said by telephone.
	   Further west in the same state, members of the Ijaw ethnic group
threatened to attack several Shell facilities, forcing the
precautionary withdrawal of staff workers and the shutdown of at
least four other flow stations.
	   Shell's Nigerian joint venture, the Shell Petroleum Development
Corporation, has appealed to the the country's military government
to settle the dispute with the protesters to allow the company to
resume normal operations.

Germany's incoming government warns of looming budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UDPATES with talks begun. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens,
hashing out policy for their incoming government, argued Wednesday
over which taxes to cut and which to raise to combat unemployment.
	   Party leaders, including Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder,
went into a round of coalition talks without commenting on the
dispute.
	   But earlier, Franz Muentefering, general manager of the Social
Democrats, warned against expectations of big new programs because
finances were tighter than expected.
	   Budget experts from both parties on Tuesday said their review of
accounts found revenues next year will be 20 billion marks (dlrs 12
billion) less than calculated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government.
	   Another 20 billion marks is at risk in the coming years due to
over-generous economic growth forecasts, they added.
	   ``In checking the books we found holes that are really bigger
than we thought, and global economic conditions are also
difficult,'' Muentefering said. ``Now we have to find a realistic
basis.''
	   Kohl's government denied there was any gap in the 1999 budget
presented by Finance Minister Theo Waigel last month and accused
the incoming coalition of trying to deceive voters.
	   ``This is an invention of the future `red-green' coalition to
conceal their policies of planned tax hikes and to divert attention
from frivolous campaign promises,'' said Adolf Roth, Kohl's budget
spokesman in parliament.
	   Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democrats in parliament,
said the new government still plans to push for an income tax cut
promised during the election campaign.
	   And Schroeder told the Bild newspaper that fighting unemployment
would remain his top priority.
	   But finding ways to cover the bill are proving difficult.
	   The environmentalist Greens say across-the-board increases in
taxes on energy would not only encourage conservation, but also
make up for revenue lost from job-creating moves, such as reducing
non-wage costs employers must pay to cover employee benefits.
	   But Schroeder has ruled out any big jump in gasoline taxes and
Muentefering suggested the Social Democrats would not go along with
other ``ecology taxes'' demanded by the Greens either.
	   ``There'll be tax reform and it'll have an ecological component,
but that's not the only way to get a handle on this problem of
cutting non-wage costs,'' Muentefering said.
	   Greens leaders complained other suggestions by their negotiating
team were being rejected as ``not financeable.''
	   Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic governor of eastern
Brandenburg state, appealed to both sides to exempt the
still-struggling east from any gas tax increases.
	   Noting that wages were already lower in the east, Stolpe told
the Lausitzer Rundschau newspaper that ``every harsh price hike
would only additionally cement this discrimination.''
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end.

Russia prepares for first launch in international space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Space Agency started final
preparations Wednesday for the launch of the first component of the
dlrs 21 billion international space program, officials said.
	   A cargo module, built by the Russian Khrunichev company under a
dlrs 200 million contract with Boeing, is scheduled to be launched
on Nov. 20.
	   Khrunichev officials said they started activating the module's
temperature-control system at the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former
Soviet republic of Kazakstan and would switch on the orientation
and other systems within a month, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The launch of the module known as Zarya, Russian for sunrise,
was originally scheduled for late 1997. It was pushed back one year
because of Russia's failure to build a key component that would
house the crew.
	   The crew compartment now is scheduled to be launched in July,
instead of April as earlier planned.
	   Some experts warned that it could be risky to let the cargo
module to stay in orbit unmanned for a long time. However,
representatives of the 16 countries taking part in the project
dismissed those doubts at a meeting in Moscow last week and decided
that Zarya's launch should go ahead as scheduled.
	   NASA is expected to follow in early December with the launch of
an American-built passageway.
	   Earlier this week, the Russian government promised to pay its
dlrs 44.5 million debt to the Russian Space Agency before the end
of the year so that it can complete the crew compartment.
	   The announcement followed the space agency's decision, announced
Monday, to sell its research time on the international station to
NASA for dlrs 60 million to raise money for the construction.

Iranian leader calls for stopping misuse of freedom of expression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Wednesday criticized what he described as conspirators
misusing freedom of expression and said their actions amounted to
treason, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Critique and criticism of the government's policies are not
bad, but, when someone attempts to undermine the foundations of the
government, it is a treason and not freedom of expression... The
enemy's hands are seen in such practices,'' the agency quoted
Khamenei as saying.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the judiciary have shut down
six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested six
journalists for allegedly printing lies.
	   The crackdown is stymying efforts by moderate President Mohammad
Khatami to give more freedom to the press.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under increasing attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Khamenei has in the past called on the judiciary to deal with
what he described as ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   ``We have said time and again that expressing views on every
issue is free and those having objections to the government's plans
are entitled to publish their objections and no one will stop them.
But there exists a fundamental difference between objection and
sabotage,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying Wednesday.
	   ``If anyone today undermines the economy and the work of this
government _ this government which is the servant of the people _
he is our enemy. We must confront him,'' he said.

French woman fails to depose in court in rape case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ The grandson of a slain politician may
go free after the French tourist he allegedly raped failed to
appear in court.
	   Judge Sant Prakash on Wednesday closed the prosecution's case
after waiting for months for the alleged rape victim to appear.
	   The woman from Lyons, France, returned to her country a month
after she registered the rape, and she did not visit India again.
In June, Himmat Singh, the government attorney, told the court that
the woman was reluctant to testify against Gurkirat Singh for fear
her life would be in danger if she returned to India.
	   If convicted, Gurkirat Singh, grandson of former Chief Minister
Beant Singh of Punjab state, could be jailed up to 10 years. But
the case will be weak without the woman's testimony.
	   The prosecution case earlier suffered a blow after a key
witness, who at the time of the alleged rape in 1994 was the
woman's boyfriend, refused to identify any of the accused in court,
though he testified that she was raped.
	   Judge Prakash has so far examined 36 witnesses. He will now
record the statement of Gurkirat Singh and six other accused.
	   K.L. Khetrapal, an external affairs ministry official, told the
court on Wednesday that diplomatic channels could not be used for
serving summons on the victim since ``no treaty existed between
India and France for assistance in criminal matters.''
	   The woman was having drinks with friends at a bar in this
northern Indian city in 1994 when Gurkirat Singh walked in with six
friends and a column of security guards. The guards were provided
by the government since his grandfather was leading a government
onslaught against a violent Sikh separatist movement and his family
had received death threats.
	   The guards later chased the woman's car and forcibly took her
away, accusing her of carrying drugs. The woman was then allegedly
raped by the seven men, including Gurkirat Singh, in a factory,
prosecutors said.
	   The alleged victim filed a police complaint and deposed before a
magistrate, but later left for France.
	   Chief Minister Beant Singh was killed in a car-bomb explosion
triggered by terrorists in 1995.

Myanmar government arrests 54, accuses Vatican of inciting unrest

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government said
Wednesday it had arrested 54 people for staging anti-government
demonstrations and accused groups funded by the Vatican, the U.S.
government and financier George Soros of inciting unrest.
	   Of the 54 arrested, 23 were members of the National League for
Democracy, the political party of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi. They included one elected member of parliament.
	   ``In July and August of this year, the NLD has stepped up its
confrontational activities and attempted to create unrest and
upheaval,'' Col. Thein Swe, a high-ranking military intelligence
officer, said at a news conference.
	   The United Nations' top human rights official called the arrests
``very worrying.''
	   They indicate that ``the government continues to ignore basic
human rights standards and the concern of the international
community,'' Mary Robinson said in a statement from her Geneva
headquarters.
	   On Tuesday, Robinson _ the U.N. high commissioner for human
rights _ had said she had been ``following with increasing concern
the intensification of repression against Myanmar's political
opposition over the last few weeks.'' She urged its government to
release political detainees.
	   The 54 people were arrested for participating in brief
``hit-and-run'' street demonstrations calling for an end to
military rule in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   More than 1,000 people joined in the first, near Yangon
University on Aug. 24. The second erupted near the Sule Pagoda in
downtown Yangon on Sept. 22.
	   Thein Swe said the dissidents instigated unrest in collaboration
with exiled Myanmar students in Thailand who are backed financially
by the Vatican-based Jesuit Refugee Services, the U.S.
government-funded National Endowment for Democracy, and the Open
Society Institute of billionaire George Soros.
	   The 54 were not among the 967 members of the opposition detained
by the government since May to prevent the NLD from convening the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly, but
the military has refused to allow it to meet. The 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize winner was under six years of house arrest at the time of the
election.
	   Gen. Kyaw Win, the deputy chief of intelligence, told the news
conference that the 967 were not in fact detained, but had been
invited to government guest houses for discussions.
	   Asked when they would be invited to return home, he said it
depended upon the activities of the NLD.
	   Kyaw Win, who was a student activist in the 1960s, answers
directly to intelligence chief Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the military
government's most powerful leaders. He insisted the military had
dealt gently with the NLD by not sending its members to prison or
outlawing the party.
	   ``You remove a thorn with a needle, not an ax,'' he said.
``However, if the NLD accelerates its confrontational tactics to a
certain extent, the government will have to act in the interest of
the people and the country.''
	   Kyaw Win dismissed condemnations heaped upon the military by
many Western governments for the mass detentions of opposition
members and other human rights abuses.
	   ``We are a military government trying for the establishment of a
democratic country,'' he said. ``You cannot judge us by the
standards of fully developed democratic countries.''

Albright says Arafat, Netanyahu to hold Washington summit Oct. 15

	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ After lengthy talks with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced on Wednesday an Oct. 15 summit would be held in
Washington to try to work out agreement on a West Bank accord.
	   ``We made significant progress,'' she said after meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   In fact, Albright told reporters, ``We are in a far better
position to finalize all the issues'' needed to conclude an
agreement on the West Bank.
	   Albright's meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu followed up on
discussion the two leaders had with President bill Clinton last
month. At the time, Clinton invited them back to Washington to try
to finalize a West Bank accord.
	   ``The president is going to be very much involved in a lot of
the detailed work,'' Albright said. ``He has a very special and
uncanny ability to work with people who have difficult problems
like these. He puts himself in their shoes.''
	   Albright praised the cooperation of Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   ``This new spirit was very helpful and I hope very much that it
will be carried on to Washington,'' she said. ``I am very realistic
that there are still hard decisions to be made.''
	   Albright noted this was the first time that Netanyahu had
ventured into Palestinian-held territory. ``These two leaders here
are putting their shoulders to the wheel,'' she said.
	   Albright returned to the region this week at Clinton's request
to try to narrow differences in advance of the summit.
	   She told reporters Wednesday that several issues that had been
in dispute for nearly two years had been eased during her three-way
meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat, which ended with a lunch of lamb
and fish at Arafat's guest house on the Palestinian side.
	   These included Israel's projected withdrawal from more of the
West Bank, establishment of an ``anti-incitement'' committee to
improve security, and establishment of a Palestinian industrial
zone in Gaza.
	   She said the summit would extend over several days, telling
reporters, ``We are prepared to spend some substantial time in the
bargaining.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said no precise site
for the summit had been chosen.
	   The three had a three-way handshake as they posed for
photographs at the start of the low-expectation meeting.
	   Ruled out in advance was concluding an agreement while she is in
the region. But Albright hoped to narrow unresolved issues, most
particularly security measures to shield Israel from terrorism, in
advance of a White House summit later in the month.
	   At this border crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held
Gaza, Albright intended to find out whether Arafat was ready to
inch closer to Netanyahu's view, which the United States basically
shares, that the Palestinian authority could do more to control
terrorists on territory under its control.
	   After a two-hour session at the crossing, the talks shifted to
Arafat's guest house in Gaza.
	   Albright said Tuesday there were ``tough choices that both sides
have to make'' before the summit. The location could be the Wye
Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, or somewhere else in the
Washington area.
	   Netanyahu has basically agreed to relinquish 13 percent of the
West Bank, on top of the 27 percent promised to the Palestinians
earlier, with 3 percent set aside for a nature preserve under joint
Israeli-Palestinian security control.
	   But with security and other issues still up in the air, Rubin
said the peace process is ``not back on track'' yet.
	   After Albright leaves the Mideast, probably Wednesday, U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
	   Albright said the United States intends to pursue a better
relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for its own sake.''
	   ``We have thought for some time about increasing the level of
discourse,'' she said. But she declined to say whether the
administration was setting the stage for dealing ultimately with a
Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
	   HINWIL, Switzerland (AP) _ Brazilian driver Pedro Diniz has been
signed by Swiss-based Sauber Petronas for the 1999 Formula One
season, the team said Wednesday.
	   Diniz, 28, who is driving for the Arrows-Yamaha team this
season, will pair with veteran French driver Jean Alesi, a press
release from Sauber said.
	   ``We are delighted that we could sign Pedro Diniz who has the
necessary experience with four years in Formula One and 65 Grands
Prix under his belt,'' the release quotes team principal Peter
Sauber as saying.
	   ``I am convinced that with Jean Alesi and Pedro Diniz, we will
have the strong driver pairing in the coming season to reach our
ambitious goals.''
	   Diniz said the team has the technical potential and the people
to make an important step forward next season.
	   He will take the place of British driver Johnny Herbert, who is
moving from Sauber to Stewart-Ford.

Police say drunk Dutchman caused death of British woman on jet ski

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Dutch tourist was drunk when he caused
the death of a British woman by ramming his jet ski into hers,
police told a court Wednesday.
	   The Dutchman, Alfred Theodorus Post, 31, from Bolsward,
Netherlands, was remanded in custody for three days by the court,
pending completion of police investigations.
	   Police prosecutor Ioannis Kapnoulas said Post may be charged
with causing death by an unthoughtful or dangerous act, as well as
for driving a speedboat under the influence of alcohol.
	   Post stood silent in the dock with head bowed as Kapnoulas
related details of Tuesday's collision that resulted in the death
of Karen White, 32, a British tourist from Bitterne in southeastern
England.
	   He said White was riding behind her husband, Greg, 25, on a jet
ski some 600-800 meters (yards) off the beach in the tourist resort
of Ayia Napa when they stopped so that Greg could wipe spray off
his glasses.
	   ``The Briton suddenly saw the Dutchman coming toward them at
speed on another jet ski. He tried to attract attention by waving
his arms, but Post did not notice and fell upon the stationary jet
ski with the result that Mrs. White was killed instantly,''
Kapnoulas said.
	   He said White's death was confirmed when she and the two men,
who were unhurt, were picked up and brought ashore by other craft
that rushed to the accident spot.
	   Ayia Napa, on the southeast coast of Cyprus, draws thousands of
foreign tourists every year. The hiring of jet skis to tourists has
developed into a booming local business.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav authorities have been
barring U.N. war crimes tribunal staff from investigating
allegations of atrocities in Kosovo, a tribunal official said
Wednesday.
	   Deputy prosecutor Graham Blewitt said Belgrade officials last
week suddenly began claiming the tribunal has no jurisdiction to
conduct investigations in Kosovo. Until recently, tribunal staff
were allowed to carry out investigations in the region.
	   Although staff are still allowed to travel in the troubled
Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence, they are forbidden to conduct investigations, Blewitt
said.

NATO military strikes akin to war, Russian defense minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo, Russia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A NATO military strike against Yugoslavia
would be akin to war that could lead to even more bloodshed in
Kosovo, Russia's defense minister said Wednesday.
	   Sergeyev's comments displayed Moscow's unwavering opposition to
military action in the southern Serbian province, where government
forces have battled ethnic Albanian separatists for more than six
months.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Marshal Igor Sergeyev
said after meeting with his Greek counterpart.
	   Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes in the province, where ethnic Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the population.
	   ``So we believe diplomatic efforts must continue, and in these
efforts the whole of the European community must be involved,''
said Sergeyev, who is on a five-day visit to Greece. He added that
non-NATO nations such as China and Belarus must also be included in
discussions over the crisis.
	   NATO, meanwhile, is building up forces at a base in southern
Italy for possible airstrikes. Russia has threatened to use its
veto in the U.N. Security Council to stop such an attack.
	   Although not as adamant as Russia, Greece also objects to the
military option. Both Russia and Greece have religious ties to the
Orthodox Serbs.
	   ``In Kosovo, there is no military solution. The solution in
Kosovo can be and will be only political,'' said Greek Defense
Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos.
	   Like other Balkan countries, Greece fears any escalation of
violence in Kosovo could lead to the conflict spilling over the
borders of Yugoslavia into neighboring countries.
	   His comments also revealed that even the European Union is not
united in full support of the NATO airstrikes.
	   ``Greece insists on the need to exhaust all political and
diplomatic efforts in order to avoid a development in Kosovo with
the intervention of NATO military forces,'' Tsochadzopoulos said.
	   Sergeyev echoed the calls for further diplomatic attempts at
defusing the crisis.
	   ``There is a folk saying that every war eventually leads to
peace,'' he said. ``But this is a question of whether it is worth
it for a war to begin.''

Sudan pressing south to send more recruits for civil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Amid increased fighting in the south, the
government has demanded southern provinces send more men to fight
rebel forces and ordered southern officials in Khartoum to go home
to mobilize support, news reports said Wednesday.
	   The move comes amid bitter fighting in southern East Equatoria
state, where the government has said it expects a major battle with
rebels for the provincial capital of Juba.
	   An announcement read on state radio Wednesday said the
government would limit the number of southern officials working in
Khartoum, a move aimed at some officials who have not been back in
their home states in almost a year.
	   Government media also reported that President Lt. Gen. Omar
el-Bashir on Tuesday ordered the governors of the 10 southern
states to ``immediately preposition themselves in their states ...
and head the public mobilization.''
	   A southern source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government also approved a plan to round up and send to the front
youths in Khartoum who are members of former rebel groups that have
now allied with the government.
	   The main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, has
not joined in peace pacts signed with the government. Rebels have
been waging a military campaign against the Islamic-led Sudanese
government since 1983 for more autonomy for the southern provinces.
	   The rebels opened a new offensive on Sept. 14 in East Equatoria
and have announced advances around Juba in recent weeks. The town
is 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of Khartoum.
	   In late September, Sudan declared a general mobilization and
called up retired army officers.
	   Mobilizations generally have been unpopular and draft evasion is
common.
	   In late September, however, hundreds of southerners could be
been training at military camps in the south. Food and supplies
donated by southern states were also seen in the camps.
	   More than 1,000 fighters from government-allied southern
militias are taking part in the fighting, said James Mabor,
minister for humanitarian affairs in the south.
	   Army spokesman Gen. Abdel-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said two officers
and several other soldiers were killed in fighting southeast of
Juba on Monday.
	   It was the first time the army said that officers were killed in
the fighting in Equatoria. Sirul-Khatim did not say how many
non-commissioned soldiers were killed.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed since the start of the
fighting and in resulting famines.

Senior military officer buried following death in mysterious plane

crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A senior military officer, brother of the
acting chief of staff of the Ugandan army, was buried Wednesday
following his death in a mysterious plane crash near the Congolese
border.
	   Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze, who served with President Yoweri Museveni
when he launched his five-year rebellion to oust Milton Obote in
1981, was among three people killed in the crash in the foothills
of the Rwenzori Mountains late last month.
	   Military spokesman have contradicted each other on the
destination of the flight that left Entebbe airport Sept. 25 and
the number and indentities of the passengers on board.
	   Circumstances of the crash are not clear, but one report said it
happened after the pilot had put the twin-engine Islander aircraft
on automatic pilot.
	   The Ugandan pilot also perished in the crash. The other victim
was identified as a German named Andrew Gore. The German Embassy in
Kampala said it knew nothing about the crash.
	   News reports said five survivors, including Israeli businessman
Zeev Shiv and Indian businessman Arif Mulfi, were rescued after an
intensive search on the densely forested mountain slopes.
	   Military authorities have said the plane was heading for Kasese,
390 kilometers (245 miles) west of Kampala.
	   But Chief of Staff James Kazini was quoted in the
government-owned New Vision Tuesday saying his brother was on his
way to visit him at his operations headquarters in northeastern
Congo.
	   With the apparent consent of Congolese authorities, Uganda
earlier this year sent troops into northeastern Congo to flush out
Alliance of Democratic Forces rebels who have been attacking
western Uganda.
	   Now Congolese President Laurent Kabila claims the troops are
fighting alongside rebels trying to overthrow him.
	   Museveni, who did not attend the burial because of prior
commitments, denies Kabila's claims.
	   But in a statement, the Ugandan leader called Mwebaze ``a
gallant soldier and brave freedom fighter.''
	   Mwebaze was buried at the site reserved for rebellion heros in
Kapeeka, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Kampala in Luwero region
where Obote's troops killed up to 400,000 unarmed villagers during
the 1981-86 insurgency.

Report: Russia supplied Serbs with missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian denial of report grafs 2, 6

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russia has supplied the Serbs with advanced
surface-to-air missile equipment that will threaten NATO aircraft
if the go-ahead is given for airstrikes in the province of Kosovo,
The Times of London reported Wednesday.
	   Quoting unnamed senior defense officials in London, The Times
said the Serbs had acquired new air defense systems that ``had to
be taken very seriously.'' Russian officials denied the report.
	   The threat was discussed Tuesday at a meeting of the chiefs of
staff at the Ministry of Defense, the newspaper said.
	   The Serbs have been supplied with new warheads, fuses and
sensors for their mobile SAM 6 missiles, and the upgrade of the old
Russian surface-to-air missile has made it faster and given it an
extended range, the report said.
	   It was not clear whether the arms had been acquired through
official Russian channels or via unofficial Russian suppliers, The
Times said.
	   In Moscow Valery Nesterushkin, a Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said that the Defense Ministry has refuted the newspaper
report. A duty officer in the Defense Ministry press office said he
had no official information on it.
	   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council called for ``full and
sustained compliance'' with a two-week-old resolution demanding
that Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end its attacks
on civilians in the separatist province.

Sukarno's widow levels serious charge against Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Sukarno, Suharto and Dewi all used only one name &QL;

 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ For the first time since President
Sukarno died 29 years ago, his widow has returned to Indonesia and
publicly accused former President Suharto of plotting a coup
attempt against her husband and eventually killing him.
	   Dewi, Sukarno's fourth and last wife, left Indonesia after her
husband was replaced by Suharto in 1966. She never publicly made
such a charge against Suharto in her own country during his
authoritarian rule. If she had, many people believe that Dewi
probably would have been arrested and imprisoned.
	   But the 52-year-old Dewi, who now lives in New York, showed no
signs of fear or reluctance at a news conference Wednesday in a
private home in southern Jakarta.
	   At one point, she accused Suharto of giving the deposed Sukarno
``sleeping pills'' or lethal ``injections'' that led to his death
at the military hospital in June 1969.
	   Historians have long argued about what exactly happened during
the violence that drove Sukarno out of power. But no one has ever
proven that Suharto, then Indonesia's military leader, played a
pivotal rule in planning Sukarno's demise.
	   Five months ago, Suharto resigned after 32 years in power in the
face of a violent, widespread pro-democracy movement in Indonesia.
Since then, his successor, President B.J. Habibie, has tolerated
far more open criticism from the opposition.
	   In fact, as Dewi made her allegations against Suharto, an
opposition group was planning a massive rally on the resort island
of Bali on Thursday, during which Sukarno's eldest daughter,
Megawati Sukarnoputri, was expected to launch her bid for the
presidency in an election to be held next year.
	   Sukarno had ruled with an iron fist, but toward the end of his
21 years in power he faced growing opposition from the military
because of his close ties with the Indonesian Communist Party.
	   In 1965, presidential guards suddenly abducted and killed six
army generals in an apparent coup attempt. Suharto, who then led
the military, blamed it on the communists.
	   When Sukarno ordered Maj. Gen. Suharto to restore order in
Indonesia, Suharto banned the Communist Party and led a military
crackdown that killed an estimated half a million people.
	   In 1966, Suharto put Sukarno under house arrest and took over as
Indonesia's leader. Sukarno died in the military hospital in 1969.
	   Historians disagree about what role, if any, Suharto played in
the apparent coup attempt that led him to power, and whether
Sukarno actually died of natural causes.
	   But on Wednesday, Dewi said she is sure that Suharto plotted the
deadly attack on the six generals to topple her husband and falsely
blame it on the communists.
	   ``Why was Suharto's name not on the hit list'' of the
assassinated generals, Dewi asked in one of several pointed
rhetorical questions at her news conference. ``Why did he do
nothing to prevent the killings?''
	   Dewi, who returned to Indonesia on a visit last week, also
accused the United States and Japan of helping to topple her
husband in 1965. She said the two countries financed student
protests against Sukarno after the generals were killed.

Opposition calls for withdrawal of intervention troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Opposition parties on Wednesday called
for the immediate withdrawal of Southern African Development
Community troops, even as South Africa beefed up its military
presence in the strife-torn kingdom.
	   South Africa, which sent 600 of its troops across the border on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and end other unrest, deployed 750
more soldiers to the Belgium-sized country, said Lt. Col. Laverne
Machine.
	   The soldiers will look for weapons caches in northern Lesotho,
where there are reports that armed youths are ``running around,''
Machine said.
	   The deployment brings to 3,500 the total number of SADC forces _
including about 450 from Botswana _ who are part of the Lesotho
task force, Machine said. She added that 1,700 are foot soldiers
and the rest are support troops, many of whom are stationed on the
South African side of the border.
	   Lesotho's nine opposition parties called for the immediate
withdrawal of SADC forces, the South African Press Association
reported.
	   The opposition parties also suggested that a government of
national unity run Lesotho until new elections are held. Under a
tentative agreement mediated by South Africa on Friday, the
elections are to be held in 15 to 18 months.
	   Opposition groups last week rejected South Africa's proposal
that the Lesotho Congress for Democracy continue to rule until the
next elections. The opposition claims the LCD stole last May's
general elections.
	   The SADC has proposed the formation of a transitional structure
to prepare for new elections. The body, which would consist of one
or two members from each political party, would ensure fair
treatment of all parties by state-owned media and would decide all
electoral matters, including the role of law-enforcement
authorities in the election process.
	   Both sides were considering the proposal.
	   Opposition alliance spokeswoman Mamello Morrison said that even
if such a body was created, it would not preclude that a new
government of national unity also be formed to rule until the next
elections, the South African news agency reported.

Fair official says travel ban on Turkish publisher lifted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a reversal, Turkey has decided to
allow a controversial publisher to go to Germany to pick up a
``Freedom to Publish'' award at the Frankfurt Book Fair, organizers
said Wednesday.
	   Ayse Nur Zarakolu, who had been trying for five years to get her
passport back from Turkish government officials, got it
unexpectedly on Wednesday. She is expected at the world's largest
book fair on Thursday, said Gerhard Kurtze, president of the German
Book Publishers' Association.
	   He said organizers had protested the travel ban through
government and U.N. channels.
	   The 42-year-old publisher was named to receive the book fair's
first ``Freedom to Publish Award,'' worth 10,000 marks (dlrs
6,000). It was presented to her son Sinan on Wednesday in
Zarakolu's absence.
	   In Ankara, friends of Zarakolu confirmed in a telephone call
with The Associated Press that the publisher had gotten her
passport back and had gone to the Germany Embassy to obtain a visa.
	   Ayse Nur Zarakolu has been a publisher with Belge Publishing
House based in Istanbul for 20 years. She has served a total of
almost 16 months in prison for releasing books raising the issues
of the Kurdish war and human rights violations in Turkey.
	   Other court cases are still pending against her. The latest is
about a book on executions by military coup leaders in 1980, which
went on sale early last year.
	   Ragip Zarakolu, the publisher's husband, who was also in
Frankfurt, complained that freedom of speech in Turkey has been
limited, and publishers were also being held responsible for the
contents of books they published.

West Bank settlement gets city status
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face
of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Ariel.
	   Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move
Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18
miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the ceremony was
scheduled a long time ago, was not intended to send a political
message ``and was certainly not timed to coincide with Mrs.
Albright's visit here.''
	   Bar-Illan said Ariel was a town like any inside Israel.

Poland disappointed with Yugoslavia offer to allow OSCE mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Polish foreign minister's comments;

 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's foreign minister, the current
chairman of the European security alliance, expressed
disappointment Wednesday with Yugoslavia's offer to allow an
alliance delegation to visit Kosovo province.
	   ``The letter was a disappointment'' Bronislaw Geremek told a
news conference in announcing the Yugoslav offer to allow the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to send a
mission to Kosovo. ``It is hard for me to see any goodwill in this
proposal.''
	   Poland this year holds the rotating chairmanship of the OSCE, an
alliance of European countries that oversees diplomatic missions to
regional trouble spots.
	   The OSCE suspended Yugoslavia's membership in 1992 for allegedly
fomenting ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav republics of
Croatia and Bosnia. It said Yugoslavia must accept a permanent OSCE
mission before it can regain its membership in the alliance.
	   But Geremek, who represents Poland in the OSCE leadership, said
the letter received Tuesday night from Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic fell short of the OSCE requirement.
	   He said the letter offered to allow a ``brief, improvised''
mission to Kosovo, which he described as different from what the
OSCE wanted. But Geremek stopped short of rejecting the offer
outright, calling it a new one that required study.
	   Geremek also expressed support for U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke's talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo aimed at preventing a NATO attack
on Yugoslav targets.
	   The Polish official noted that Russia, an ally of Yugoslavia
that opposes a NATO attack, intervened to convince Milosevic's
government to make the latest offer.
	   Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes.
	   U.N. resolutions demand, among other things, that Milosevic pull
out forces from Kosovo or face possible punitive attack from NATO
forces. Holbrooke said Tuesday that Milosevic had so far failed to
comply with the resolutions.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.

French sailor leads as solo racers skirt Tropical Storm Lisa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Thiercelin increasing lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marc Thiercelin of France slipped past two
big-name competitors to grab the lead in the first leg of the
43,450-kilometer (27,000-mile) Around Alone sailing race.
	   Thiercelin, navigating his 18-meter (60-foot) boat Somewhere,
made his move Tuesday, taking advantage of the fact that fellow
Frenchwoman Isabelle Autissier was having equipment problems. By
early Wednesday, he had established a 56-kilomter (35-mile) lead
over Autissier and a 89-kilometer (54-mile) lead over Josh Hall of
Britain.
	   Autissier reported breaking the main forestay on her boat, PRB,
which left her unable to use her largest genoa sail. To improvise a
substitute, the 41-year-old sailor had to climb up to the top of
her 26-meter (85-foot) mast.
	   Autissier, the only woman in the race, is still one of the
favorites, along with Thiercelin and Hall, to win its Class I
division, for boats up to 18 meters (60 feet).
	   In Class II, for boats up to 15 meters (50 feet), J.P. Mouligne
of France had a 31-kilometer (19-mile) lead over Mike Garside of
Britain today.
	   After 10 days at sea, the racers were keeping a wary eye out
today for their first big storm _ Tropical Storm Lisa, which had 72
kph (45 mph) winds and gusts past 80 kph (50 mph). Forecasters said
the solo sailors should be OK if they keep west of the storm.
	   The 14-boat fleet left Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 27,
heading across the Atlantic to Cape Town, South Africa, on the
first leg of a four-leg competition. The racers will also stop at
Auckland, New Zealand, and Punta del Este, Uruguay, before
returning to Charleston next spring.
	   The approximately nine-month race, held once every four years,
began in 1982 and used to be called The BOC Challenge.
	   In the 1994-95 race, both Autissier and Hall had to be rescued
at sea after their boats became disabled and sank. Their
experiences prompted boat designers to increase ballast systems and
other safety features so the huge, sleek racing machines can stay
afloat even in the worst weather.

Russia deports 12 Chinese for illegally entering country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has deported 12 Chinese so far this month
for illegally entering the country, the Federal Border Service said
Wednesday.
	   Five Chinese tried to cross the border in the Russian Far East
on Tuesday alone, the service said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. Three were poaching fish in the Razdolnaya River, it said.
	   The border service said 300 Chinese were sent home in September,
but the number is expected to be lower in October when the poaching
season ends.

Iranian spiritual leader urges critics to end misuse of free
</HEADLINE>
speech &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Wednesday criticized what he described as conspirators
misusing freedom of expression and said their actions amounted to
treason, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the judiciary have shut down
six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested six
journalists for allegedly printing lies. The crackdown is stymieing
efforts by moderate President Mohammad Khatami to give more freedom
to the press.
	   ``Critique and criticism of the government's policies are not
bad, but, when someone attempts to undermine the foundations of the
government, it is a treason and not freedom of expression... The
enemy's hands are seen in such practices,'' the agency quoted
Khamenei as saying.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Khamenei has in the past called on the judiciary to deal with
what he described as ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   ``We have said time and again that expressing views on every
issue is free and those having objections to the government's plans
are entitled to publish their objections and no one will stop them.
But there exists a fundamental difference between objection and
sabotage,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying Wednesday.
	   ``If anyone today undermines the economy and the work of this
government _ this government which is the servant of the people _
he is our enemy. We must confront him,'' he said.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Opening an official visit, Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said his country wants to help
Mozambique develop. A newspaper reported Portugal will reschedule
part of Mozambique's debt.
	   Guterres, on his first day of a five-day official visit to this
former Portuguese colony, held talks Tuesday with President Joaquim
Chissano, who had his own ideas about where any assistance would be
best spent.
	   ``There is still a lot to do to eliminate poverty, hunger and
problems of education and health,'' Chissano said in his speech to
Guterres, who was accompanied by several Cabinet ministers and a
group of businessmen.
	   Portugal is second only to South Africa as the source of foreign
investment in Mozambique. Current Portuguese investments are
estimated at 123 million dollars, in 198 projects.
	   The Maputo daily Noticias, citing an unnamed Mozambican
government source, said about 7 million dollars of Mozambique's 465
million-dollars debt to Portugal is to be rescheduled during
Guterres' visit.
	   The two countries are also expected to sign agreements during
Guterres' visit, one for support to the Mozambican budget, and the
other granting 2.5 million dollars to be used in completing the
rehabilitation of the northern railway between the port of Nacala
and the Malawian border.
	   --
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo
have signed an agreement regulating the participation of Chadian
troops in the Congo government's fight to put down a rebellion.
	   The accords signed Tuesday were proof that ``Africans can solve
their own
	   problems,'' Congo's Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene told
reporters.
	   Chadian Defense Minister Omar Kadjalamine Boukhar said the
deployment of his country's troops in Congo was in line with a
decision taken at a meeting of west and central African heads of
states last month in Gabon.
	   As many as 1,000 troops from Chad are believed to be already in
Congo.
	   Chad joins a coalition of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian
troops fighting in support of Congolese President Laurent Kabila
who is battling a rebel army of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and political opponents.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Demonstrators opposed to the allocation of
parts of a forest for a housing project set three bulldozers ablaze
on Wednesday.
	   The demonstration was organized by the Green Belt Movement,
which plants trees countrywide, and the private Kenya Human Rights
Commission.
	   There has been public outcry over the decision to build on parts
of Karura Forest, next to U.N. Environment Program offices. The
forest is the source of three small rivers.
	   The demonstrators, mostly women and young men, broke the gate
before setting ablaze the bulldozers. They also planted trees on
land cleared for street construction.

Armstrong gets wet weather; Dutch woman wins time trial

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ American Lance Armstrong was
prepared for rainy weather but not cold, rainy weather as he looks
for a chance in Thursday's elite men's time trial at the World
Cycling Championship in his comeback from cancer.
	   Leontien van Moorsel won the elite women's time trial Wednesday
giving the Netherlands a home victory.
	   The Dutch rider was making a comeback after winning the road
championship twice and the track pursuit title back in 1990.
	   She was timed in 31 minutes, 51.14 seconds over the 23-kilometer
(14.3-mile).
	   Olympic champion Zoulfia Zabirova of Russia was second, just .38
seconds behind with Hanka Huffernagel of Germany third, less than
three seconds back.
	   Jeannie Longo of France who had won the three previous world
time trials and was seeking her 13th overall title, was fifth, more
than 24 seconds behind. Lithuanian Diana Ziliute was fourth
	   While the women have finished their time trial, the men
concentrate for their event Thursday with cool weather again
predicted.
	   Armstrong arrived from Nice, France Tuesday and immediately went
out and sought some protection against the cold, buying some
all-weather gloves and jacket in a local shop.
	   With temperatures about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F), Armstrong
wanted some extra protection against the cold after overnight rains
in southern Netherlands.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong, who announced he had testicular
cancer just before the world championships two years ago, returns
to the event as one of the favorites. He won the road title in
1993.
	   The Austin, Texas rider's return hasn't been easy after taking
the 1997 season off to battle his cancer with chemotheraphy and
operations. His cancer is in remission now.
	   He came back this year but dropped out of the Paris-Nice race in
France this past March and questioned whethere he wanted to
continue racing.
	   Returning to the United States, Armstrong didn't look at his
bicycle for four weeks, then headed for a training camp in rainy
North Carolina.
	   ``I really had to decide there if I loved the bike and whether
or not I loved doing six hours a day in the pouring rain,'' he
said. ``I left there knowing that I really enjoy what I do.''
	   He wants to become a source of inspiration to many others who
have to battle cancer.
	   ``I would like to be an example for ... all cancer patients, not
just young men with testicular cancer, and their families,''
Armstrong said. ``I realized how lonely I was and how hard it was.
I promised myself that I would do whatever I could in the future to
make it easier for the next person.''
	   Since returning to Europe, he has had a series of top results.
He won the four-day Tour of Luxembourg and a German tour,
Rheinland-Pfalz.
	   He also was fourth in the Tour of the Netherlands.
	   Then his fourth place finish in the Tour of Spain propelled him
back to the top level of cyclists present at the World
Championships.
	   With those successes behind him, he comes to the worlds in top
form with the added encouragement that a number of top riders are
missing from the lineup.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- and France's two world champions of last
year, time trial winner Laurent Jalabert and road champion Laurent
Brochard are out.
	   That leave's Armstrong, Spain's Abraham Olano and another
comeback rider, Chris Boardman, as the top contenders in Thursday's
43.5-kilometer (27-mile) time trial.
	   Olano took the time trial in the Tour of Spain where Armstrong
was just eight seconds behind.
	   Boardman, the 1994 world time trial champion, is still searchimg
his form after crashing out in the Tour de France's second stage.
	   Armstrong is scheduled to start ninth from the last in
Thursday's race with Boardman, Olano and Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine
the final three.
	   Armstrong is also a contender for Sunday's men's road race. The
course is 15 laps through the Dutch coutnryside, a total of 258
kilometers (162 miles).
	   ``It is very much a classic course,'' Armstrong said. ``Very
difficult, long and (with) short, steep climbs. ''
	   In the junior men's time trial, 17-year old Fabian Cancellara of
Switzerland won, covering the 23-kilometer (14.3-mile) course in 29
minutes, 39.15 seconds.
	   Torsten Hiekmann of Germany was second, 2.46 seconds behind,
with Italy's Fillippo Pozzato third.

Trading in Amsterdam briefly suspended after 5 percent drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Trading on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange was suspended Wednesday afternoon for 15 minutes after the
market fell by more than 5 percent from its opening.
	   The rule, designed to trigger a ``cooling off'' period among
jittery traders, takes effect whenever the AEX benchmark index
rises or drops 5 percent from the opening.
	   At the time of the midafternoon suspension, the AEX was at
846.10 points, down 32.08 points or 2.7 percent. The AEX rose in
the early hours of the trading day, reaching a high of 902.92
points, and closed at 857.11 points, down 2.4 percent.
	   The U.S. dollar was one of the main reasons for the hectic
trade, with the currency going up and down all day. The Dutch stock
market is highly dollar-sensitive as a number of index companies
derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
	   Dutch investors have taken a roller-coaster ride in recent days
as the market swings widely amid the economic crises in Asia,
Russia and Latin America.
	   At Tuesday's close, the Amsterdam exchange rebounded with a
nearly 6 percent gain, a day after its sharpest plunge in a year
and a half. Over the past month, the AEX has lost more than 20
percent of its value.

Group charges Thailand, U.N. fail to protect Myanmar refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thai reaction, grafs 7-10; edits 11th graf to
conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand and the United Nations' main
agency for refugees have failed to provide adequate protection for
more than 100,000 people who have fled Myanmar, a human rights
lobbying group charged Wednesday.
	   A report from the New York-based group Human Rights Watch says
that for more than a decade, protection for Myanmar refugees in
Thailand has been inconsistent and often non-existent, due largely
to the policies of the Thai government and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Many of the refugees fled persecution that resulted from their
political beliefs or ethnic background, but the policies have
failed to accord them the protection due under international law,
it says.
	   ``In almost no way can Thai policy be said to comply with
international refugee norms and standards, and in many respects
UNHCR's policies in Thailand do not even comply with its own
guidelines and policies,'' the group charges.
	   The Thai government's actions can be explained by strategic and
economic interests, its experience with refugees from Indochina,
and the lack of an adequate legal framework, says the report.
	   While the UNHCR must act diplomatically to maintain a working
relationship with its Thai hosts, it says, the agency has been
``unnecessarily weak in its efforts to challenge Thai policies that
undermine refugee protection.''
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry, in a statement Wednesday evening,
said Thailand had provided the best protection it could for the
refugees.
	   ``Thailand believes the best way out for the refugees is to send
them back home when peace is restored ...,'' the ministry said.
	   It said Thailand could not allow the victims of human rights
violations to settle in Thailand as refugees because they would
become ``a magnet'' luring more refugees.
	   `` Thailand would have to take them on as an economic and social
burden, a mission for which Thailand is not ready,'' it said.
	   The Human Rights Watch report charges that over the past 10
years, the Thai government has repeatedly violated the obligation
not to send refugees back to any country where they are likely to
face persecution, an assertion denied by the Foreign Ministry..
	   It expresses concern that the pressures of the continuing
economic crisis in Thailand place refugees and asylum-seekers in
even greater danger as the Thai government seeks to expel all
undocumented migrants and often makes little distinction between
migrants and refugees.
	   The refugees who have suffered worst, says Human Rights Watch,
are members of the ethnic minorities. UNHCR had no presence in and
only limited access to their camps, which since 1994 have been
vulnerable to cross-border attacks by troops from Myanmar _ also
called Burma _ or breakaway factions of rebel groups.
	   The Thai government also took the position that as Myanmar's
military regime signed cease-fires with various ethnic armies and
the level of fighting decreased, ``ethnic minority refugees had
nothing to fear by returning home,'' says the report. ``They
ignored the pattern of systematic human rights violations,
including forced labor, that had led many of the refugees to flee
in the first place.''
	   It says the camps are becoming increasingly closed, and many
will not permit any new refugees to enter.
	   A new Thai government that took office last November has made
commitments to human rights, which could lead to an improvement in
the treatment of refugees, it says.
	   However, the UNHCR has failed to negotiate a new role for itself
that would allow it to give adequate protection to the refugees,
the report adds.

Maturana completes deal to coach Costa Rica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Colombian Francisco Maturana has
signed a 3 1-2-year contract to coach Costa Rica's national soccer
team and taken on the mission of trying to qualify the squad for
the 2002 World Cup.
	   ``There were other options, but Costa Rica was the option that
most seduced me,'' Maturana told reporters after closing the deal
Tuesday.
	   Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Local media reports
have estimated the deal was worth between dlrs 300,000 and dlrs
420,000 a year.
	   Costa Rica has only made it to the World Cup once, in 1990.
	   Costa Rica is the third national team Maturana will direct. As
coach of Colombia, he qualified the team for the 1990 and 1994
World Cups. He was unable to do the same with Ecuador in 1998.
	   ``I want to go to Japan,'' Maturana said, referring to 2002
quadrennial championship in Japan and South Korea. ``I have the
suspicion that in Costa Rica, I will have success.''
	   He will take control of the Costa Rican team later this month.
	   As part of the contract, Maturana agreed to work with Costa
Rican coaching assistants. They have yet to be named.

West Bank settlement gets city status

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu spokesman. Pick up 5th

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face
of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to attend a Wednesday ceremony to confer city status on the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Ariel.
	   Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move
Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (20
miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the ceremony was
scheduled a long time ago, was not intended to send a political
message ``and was certainly not timed to coincide with Mrs.
Albright's visit here.''
	   Bar-Illan said Ariel was a town like any inside Israel.

German chancellor-elect gets cigars from Spanish fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder prefers Cuban cigars, but
he didn't turn up his nose at Spanish smokes of the kind once
enjoyed by Winston Churchill.
	   Two boxes of the hand-made cigars, sent by two fans in the
Canary Islands, were presented to the German chancellor-elect
Wednesday.
	   Schroeder, thrust into the role of world statesman after
Germany's Sept. 27 election, can now emulate Churchill, Britain's
World War II prime minister, in puffing Puros made in the city of
Palma.
	   The election victory gift was the idea of two fellow Social
Democrats: Raul Rodriguez Pages, mayor of the town of El Paso, and
Onesimo Garcia Camacho, a Canary Islands legislator.
	   Schroeder was a leftist radical in the 1970s, but nowadays he's
more likely to be seen nursing a cigar during talks with business
titans.
	   Schroeder was handed the gift by Rolf Henkel, a German reporter
who acted as a middleman, before talks with the Greens party
Wednesday on forming a new government.

Iran says it's losing patience with Taliban militia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran wants a peaceful settlement in its
dispute with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, but it's running out of
patience, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday.
	   Iran has been locked in a dispute with the Taliban after the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted its
fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban over the killings
and wants the culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators'' and accusing Iran of arming and financing its
northern-based opposition.
	   ``Iran wants a peaceful settlement to the Afghanistan issue, but
patience has a limit,'' Kharrazi told reporters at a news
conference. He did not elaborate.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises over the past few weeks.
	   ``Iran's stands are in full conformity with those of the
international community and the Taliban has no other alternative
than submitting to the international will,'' Kharrazi said.
	   ``Iran is cooperating with the United Nations in the hope that
through such a cooperation the Taliban will be forced to surrender
to the international will,'' he said.

complaints &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ To end complaints by some countries
they pay too much for their membership, the EU head office proposed
reforms Wednesday in how the European Union is financed by its 15
member states.
	   The European Commission's biggest-ever budget review seeks to
put EU financing on a fairer footing to satisfy Germany, Austria,
the Netherlands and Sweden who say they pay far more into the EU
than they get back in benefits.
	   The commission's report _ running into hundreds of pages of
texts and tables _ acknowledged shortcomings in current budget
rules.
	   It proposed these changes without issuing a preference to avoid
the money debate now beginning in EU capitals:
	   _ let the EU pay 75 percent of subsidies for EU farmers and let
governments pay the rest from their own budgets. If they choose not
to, they can reduce their membership dues by dlrs 8 billion next
year.
	   _ make membership dues reflect a country's prosperity better by
basing them ``more, or even totally'' on its gross national
product. GNP-based payments ``may render the system more
intelligible and cost-effective,'' the report said.
	   _ reimburse all countries now paying more into the EU than they
get back in benefits. Since 1984, Britain has enjoyed a `rebate'
which this year totals dlrs 4.8 billion. The Commission suggested
Britain cede its rebate for it is not as poor anymore and should
contribute more to the cost of running the union.
	   It said with Cyprus and five East European neighbors joining in
the years ahead, now would be a good moment for a new start in
budget keeping.
	   The level of prosperity of the newcomers is ``below that of the
current members'' which will only worsen the budget positions of
the latter, it said.
	   The EU now has four sources of income from each member: levies
on agricultural imports from outside the EU; customs duties; a
charge of 1.4 percent of value added taxes and one of not exceeding
1.27 percent of their gross national product.
	   True to its tradition, the Commission declined to say how much
each EU state pays into the EU.
	   ``The costs and benefits of membership must not be reduced to a
mathematical calculation,'' Santer told the European Parliament in
Strasbourg.
	   He said that since subsidies guaranteeing EU farmers an income
have long been a cause of financial woe ``we could foresee reducing
the EU contribution'' to farmers. Despite past reforms, farm
spending still consumes half of the EU's 1998 budget of dlrs 100
billion.
	   The suggestion to divert farm spending to national capitals will
not get a warm welcome in France, Ireland, Spain and other
countries which benefit greatly from the farm support program.

Police investigate sex abuse of minor in Ivory Coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A former government minister and
Lebanon's ambassador to the Ivory Coast have been implicated in a
scandal involving allegations of forced sexual encounters with a
14-year-old boy.
	   Ministry of Security officials speaking on condition of
anonymity confirmed on Wednesday said they were investigating the
charges, but refused to disclose details of the case.
	   The French-language daily Le Jour, however, reported that at
least six people had been arrested in connection with the alleged
abduction, drugging and repeated sexual assault of the 14-year-old.
	   An official at Lebanon's embassy in Abidjan denied allegations
that Ambassador Mohammed Daher was linked to the case.
	   ``It's a set-up,'' an embassy consular officer said, refusing to
give his name.
	   A press conference with Daher was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon, the officer said.
	   Le Jour reported that Daher and an unnamed former government
minister had sexually abused the boy for more than six months.
	   The newspaper said several prominent Lebanese business leaders
in Abidjan had also been implicated in the case.
	   The embassy consular officer, however, said the stories and the
charges were fabricated to defame the Lebanese community in the
Ivory Coast. As in much of West Africa, expatriate Lebanese
businessmen control vast portions of the commercial industry in the
Ivory Coast, often evoking resentment in the local community.
	   A police official working at Abidjan's central Prefecture
dealing with complaints involving minors confirmed the arrest of a
number of individuals last week in connection with the case.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity he said the parents of an
Ivorian minor from the town of Dabou, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) east of the commercial capital of Abidjan, had filed
complaints against several people.
	   The police official refused to give further information except
to say that case was ``delicate'' and needed special authorization
from the Ministry of Security to discuss with journalists.
	   The case has been transferred to the Attorney-General's office,
he said.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Attorney-General's
office.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to promote a new partnership between long
edgy neighbors, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Wednesday
his nation and Japan must work together to bring Asia out of its
economic quagmire.
	   Kim's four-day visit, his first here as president, is viewed as
a first step toward a more cordial relationship between South Korea
and Japan.
	   Although the two Asian neighbors share deep economic and
cultural ties, deep resentment remains among many Koreans because
of Japan's brutal 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.
	   Kim's speech at a gala banquet at the Imperial Palace was upbeat
and made no mention of historical suffering, a clear departure from
speeches by past Korean presidents visiting Japan.
	   ``As a world economic power, Japan is urged to share the pain
with the rest of Asia and take an active role in tackling the
crisis,'' Kim said. ``If our two nations are to succeed in
cooperative efforts, we must first respect each other and open our
hearts.''
	   Kim noted the two nations will be working together as co-hosts
of the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   ``The World Cup will be an occasion for us to demonstrate our
forward-looking partnership and win praise for our friendship from
the world,'' he said.
	   During Kim's visit, which ends Saturday, Japanese leaders want
to offer a formal apology that is sincere enough to appease Korean
feelings without offending conservatives in Japan. The issue has
come up during each of the nine previous visits by Korean
presidents since the war.
	   In his speech at the banquet, Akihito reiterated the apology he
has made previously, acknowledging that ``Japan brought great
suffering on the people of the Korean Peninsula.''
	   ``The deep sorrow which I feel over this never leaves my
memory,'' he added, reading from a text.
	   Kim and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will endorse
guidelines for a ``new partnership'' that will include a strong
apology by Tokyo for Japan's colonial rule, Japanese media reports
say.
	   The guidelines are also expected to include a promise by Kim to
lift restrictions on Japanese culture in South Korea, where
Japanese movies are still banned.
	   Obuchi is expected to offer Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to
help South Korea overcome its severe economic downturn.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Also on the agenda is last month's rocket launch by North Korea.
The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the North has
considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   On Thursday, Kim and Obuchi are expected to sign a number of
agreements, including one promising the new loans by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to help small businesses in South
Korea.
	   Seoul is struggling to restructure its economy under a dlrs 58
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Kim attended the official outdoor welcoming
ceremony at the state guesthouse under overcast skies, riding in a
black limousine with Akihito amid tight security. Some 16,000
police officers were mobilized in the Tokyo area for the visit.
	   Later, Kim traveled to the Imperial Palace with Akihito. The two
men, accompanied by their wives, entered the palace's main building
as a marching band played the South Korean national anthem.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A fresh assault on a suburban train driver gave new
impetus to some metro, train and bus drivers on strike for a second
day Wednesday to protest increasing violence on France's public
transport system.
	   Train traffic between Paris and southern suburbs served by the C
and D line that enters the Montparnasse station was totally
paralyzed by drivers who walked off the job.
	   Trains to Chartres, Versailles and Rambouillet -- three tourist
destinations -- also stayed in their stations.
	   The train authority predicted ``serious disturbances'' in the
afternoon and evening.
	   However, service on Paris buses imrproved during the day,
running at 65 percent of full service by late afternoon.

Myanmar government arrests 54, accuses Vatican of inciting unrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Amnesty International statement in last 3 grafs,
minor editing in grafs 2, 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government said
Wednesday it had arrested 54 people for staging anti-government
demonstrations and accused groups funded by the Vatican, the U.S.
government and financier George Soros of inciting unrest.
	   Of the 54 arrested, 23 were members of the National League for
Democracy, the political party of opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, it said. They included one elected member of parliament.
	   ``In July and August of this year, the NLD has stepped up its
confrontational activities and attempted to create unrest and
upheaval,'' Col. Thein Swe, a high-ranking military intelligence
officer, said at a news conference. It wasn't clear when the
arrests took place.
	   The United Nations' top human rights official called the arrests
``very worrying.''
	   They indicate that ``the government continues to ignore basic
human rights standards and the concern of the international
community,'' Mary Robinson said in a statement from her Geneva
headquarters.
	   On Tuesday, Robinson _ the U.N. high commissioner for human
rights _ had said she had been ``following with increasing concern
the intensification of repression against Myanmar's political
opposition over the last few weeks.'' She urged its government to
release political detainees.
	   The 54 people were arrested for participating in brief
``hit-and-run'' street demonstrations calling for an end to
military rule in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   More than 1,000 people joined in the first, near Yangon
University on Aug. 24. The second erupted near the Sule Pagoda in
downtown Yangon on Sept. 22.
	   Thein Swe said the dissidents instigated unrest in collaboration
with exiled Myanmar students in Thailand who are backed financially
by the Vatican-based Jesuit Refugee Services, the U.S.
government-funded National Endowment for Democracy, and the Open
Society Institute of billionaire George Soros.
	   The 54 were not among the 967 members of the opposition detained
by the government since May to prevent the NLD from convening the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly, but
the military has refused to allow it to meet. The 1991 Nobel Peace
Prize winner was under six years of house arrest at the time of the
election.
	   Gen. Kyaw Win, the deputy chief of intelligence, told the news
conference that the 967 were not in fact detained, but had been
invited to government guest houses for discussions.
	   Asked when they would be invited to return home, he said it
depended upon the activities of the NLD.
	   Kyaw Win, who was a student activist in the 1960s, answers
directly to intelligence chief Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the military
government's most powerful leaders. He insisted the military had
dealt gently with the NLD by not sending its members to prison or
outlawing the party.
	   ``You remove a thorn with a needle, not an ax,'' he said.
``However, if the NLD accelerates its confrontational tactics to a
certain extent, the government will have to act in the interest of
the people and the country.''
	   Kyaw Win dismissed condemnations heaped upon the military by
many Western governments for the mass detentions of opposition
members and other human rights abuses.
	   ``We are a military government trying for the establishment of a
democratic country,'' he said. ``You cannot judge us by the
standards of fully developed democratic countries.''
	   The human rights group Amnesty International described the
arrests as ``outrageous.''
	   It said the government's 15-page statement detailing the alleged
offenses showed no evidence that the people named were engaged in
anything other than peaceful civil disobedience.
	   It called on the government ``to release these people
immediately unless they are tried fairly for recognizable criminal
offenses.'' The London, England-based group also expressed concern
that those arrested were at risk of torture, which it said ``is
common in Myanmar's detention centers.''

What's new? Plenty, as league opens 82nd season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Ice Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In an era of change in North America's National
Hockey League, the Detroit Red Wings are striving for consistency.
	   Not since the New York Islanders' four championships from
1980-83 has a team won the Stanley Cup as many as three straight
times. The Red Wings have a chance to do just that as the NHL's
82nd season opens Friday with a new team, a new six-division setup
and new rules intended to increase scoring.
	   The changes don't stop there.
	   Seven teams have new coaches, three teams open in new arenas,
several big-name free agents signed with new teams, and there's
even a new director of ice hockey operations. The NHL also signed a
new five-year, dlrs 600 million TV contract with Disney.
	   New stars should get more TV air time with the retirement of
longtime headliners Mike Gartner, Jari Kurri, Pat LaFontaine and
Viacheslav Fetisov. But first, some established players will try to
help the Red Wings win yet another title.
	   Repeat champions haven't been trendy in the NHL since the
Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991-92. Detroit, however, has a
mini-dynasty going with two straight sweeps in the finals and
another appearance there in the last four seasons.
	   As soon as they defeated the Washington Capitals last spring,
the Red Wings started talking about a three-peat. It would be hard
to bet against the defending champions, who basically have the same
team as last season along with the addition of free-agent
defenseman Uwe Krupp.
	   ``We feel confident in our team,'' right wing Darren McCarty
said. ``You look at the forwards, the same guys are back. ...
There's no reason why we can't'' repeat.
	   Not that the Red Wings are a sure thing. Contending teams such
as Dallas and Philadelphia improved themselves with free agents _
forward Brett Hull, among others, with the Stars and goaltender
John Vanbiesbrouck with the Flyers. Defenseman Steve Duchesne
signed with the Los Angeles Kings, one of many improved teams in a
well-balanced league.
	   There are now 27 teams in the NHL with the addition of the
Nashville Predators, one of four new clubs joining the league by
the year 2000. Over the next two seasons, Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio;
and Minneapolis-St.Paul will enter the NHL to bring its total to
30.
	   The league for the first time will feature a two-conference,
six-division setup: Atlantic, Northeast and Southeast in the
Eastern Conference and the Central, Northwest and Pacific in the
West. The Predators will play in the Central Division along with
Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis.
	   The ice is also getting a new look.
	   The goal line has been moved from 11 to 13 feet (3.35 to 3.97
meters) from the end boards, giving players more space behind the
net. There will be less room in the neutral zone, more room in the
offensive zones and the goal crease will be smaller with hopes of
cutting down on disallowed goals for skate-in-the-crease
infractions.
	   The rules changes are part of the NHL's plan for more goals,
which have been decreasing in the '90s. League officials believe
that the increased space behind the net will help create more
offense, a la Wayne Gretzky.
	   ``It's harder to defend against. There's a lot more room to get
away from checkers,'' Vancouver's Mark Messier says. ``It's a lot
further for defensemen to chase you back there.''
	   The NHL, meanwhile, will continue to crack down on interference,
such as hooking and holding. The league began enforcing those rules
more in the second half of last season in hopes of opening up the
ice for skill players.
	   And all players better watch their step this season. For the
first time, the NHL will use a two-referee, two-linesmen system in
selected games.
	   League officials hope to cut down on infractions and injuries,
especially concussions, which last season sidelined stars such as
Anaheim's Paul Kariya, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and the New York
Rangers' LaFontaine.
	   With former Rangers coach Colin Campbell replacing Brian Burke
as the NHL's director of ice hockey operations, the league has
promised to deal severely with players who cause head injuries with
their elbows or sticks.
	   ``Anybody in hockey will cringe when something like that
happens, and I think that we all look forward to discipline,''
Campbell said.
	   Along with the Predators opening Oct. 10 against Florida at the
Nashville Arena, two other teams will move into new arenas this
season: the Panthers will open their new National Car Rental Center
in Broward County and the Toronto Maple Leafs will debut in their
Air Canada Centre later in the season after 67 years in Maple Leaf
Gardens. Sixteen new arenas have opened in the '90s.
	   The Maple Leafs will also make another significant move, going
back in the same division (Northeast) with longtime rival Montreal
after 24 years apart.
	   Toronto, another team that signed free agents in goaltender
Chris Joseph and forward Steve Thomas, also added a new coach in
Pat Quinn.
	   The other new coaches are: Craig Hartsburg in Anaheim; Dirk
Graham in Chicago; Bob Hartley in Colorado; Terry Murray in
Florida; Robbie Ftorek in New Jersey; and Barry Trotz in Nashville.
	   The free agents also include players such as Ron Francis with
Carolina, Doug Gilmour with Chicago, Gary Suter with San Jose and
John MacLean with the Rangers.
	   With the retirement of Gartner, Kurri and LaFontaine, the NHL
lost three of its greats. The three combined for 1,777 goals,
including 708 by Gartner, fifth all time.
	   Fetisov's career extended from Russia, where he helped the
Soviets win Olympic gold medals, to the NHL, where he helped the
Red Wings win Stanley Cups.
	   Three other well-known veterans retired this year: defenseman
Kevin Lowe and goaltenders Andy Moog and Kelly Hrudey.

Lake meets Isaias, no comments made
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ President Clinton's special envoy to the
Horn of Africa met Wednesday with President Isaias Afwerki and
other officials to discuss how to achieve a peaceful solution to
the five-month simmering border conflict between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.
	   Neither former U.S. national security adviser nor Isaias made
any public comment on the meetings.
	   The State Department said Tuesday the United States had
``important national interests in the Horn of Africa which would be
seriously affected by a war between Eritrea and Ethiopia.''
	   Asmeron Kidane, dean of Asmara University's College of Arts and
Sciences, said the academic community was optimistic that Lake's
visit would bring positive results.
	   ``We have a feeling that the Americans might realize a mistake
was made in the original peace plan,'' he said.
	   Diplomatic sources said it would be useful for mediators to
obtain a clearer understanding of the facts on the ground.
	   Asmeron pointed to Ethiopia's effective propaganda campaign
early in the conflict that became public May 12 after Ethiopians
shot several Eritrean soldiers they said were occupying Ethiopian
territory.
	   ``Eritrea was not good at propaganda. As the facts became
exposed, opinions began to change,'' he said.
	   Isaias has said that the stumbling block in a previous peace
plan proposed by the United States and Rwanda was the stipulation
that Eritrea withdraw its forces from the contested Badme area,
while Ethiopian forces would be allowed to return.
	   Eritrea insists on bilateral demilitarization and technical
demarcation under an international observer force.
	   ``Outside help may speed up or may create the proper atmosphere,
but the solution can come only if the two sides agree on
demarcating the border on the ground,'' Isaias said in a September
television interview.
	   Ethiopia, where Lake is scheduled to travel Thursday with his
five-member team, has been sending mixed signals on the prospects
for peace.
	   On Tuesday, Ethiopia said it welcomed the peace talks and
appreciates the active role play by the United States.
	   But both Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and President Negaso Gidada
have hinted that a resumption of fighting may be the only solution
if the mediation comes to naught.
	   There is speculation in Asmara that the warming of relations
between Ethiopia and Sudan may have caused the United States to
take another look at its position on the conflict and make another
attempt at mediation.
	   Washington had been touting both Meles and Isaias as examples of
the new breed of African leaders when the conflict erupted and has
supported both as bulwarks against the Islamic government in Sudan.
	   Eritrea, a former Italian colony, became independent from
Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war for independence.

Visas now required for incoming Slovaks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Slovak Republic nationals traveling to Britain
will require visas beginning Thursday as part of the British
government's effort to stem the tide of Gypsies seeking political
asylum.
	   The new arrangements, which take effect at midnight Wednesday,
also require transit visas of Slovak nationals passing through
Britain on their way to other destinations.
	   ``We are imposing this visa regime because of the abuse of the
visa-free arrangements by some passengers from the Slovak
Republic,'' Home Secretary Jack Straw said. ``We must act to ensure
the integrity of our asylum system. We will be bringing forward
legislation to strengthen the immigration control.''
	   Recent figures show that the number of Slovak nationals seeking
asylum has increased dramatically in recent months. There were as
many applications in August as in all of last year, with the
majority being rejected, Straw said.
	   Other measures being taken include quadrupling to 20 the number
of airline liaison officers posted abroad to reduce the number of
inadequately documented passengers arriving in the United Kingdom;
developing an intelligence network to target those trying to evade
immigration controls; and investing an extra 120 million pounds
(dlrs 200 million) over the next three years to speed up the
handling of asylum cases.
	   Britain became a popular destination for Slovaks seeking a
better life after the British government granted asylum to six
Gypsies earlier this year.
	   Gypsies settled in eastern Europe in the 13th century. They are
nomadic people with a distinct language and ancient folklore, found
mostly in Spain, Hungary, Slovakia and the Balkans.

Iran says it's losing patience with Taliban militia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran wants a peaceful settlement in its
dispute with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, but it's running out of
patience, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday.
	   Iran has been locked in a dispute with the Taliban since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted its
fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan.
	   ``Iran wants a peaceful settlement to the Afghanistan issue, but
patience has a limit,'' Kharrazi told reporters at a news
conference. He did not elaborate.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban over the August
killings and wants the culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators'' and accusing Iran of arming and financing its
northern-based opposition.
	   ``Iran's stands are in full conformity with those of the
international community and the Taliban has no other alternative
than submitting to the international will,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises over the past few weeks.

Italy's premier takes case to save government to Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. RECASTS; UPDATES with Cossutta saying his group should
support Prodi &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A breakaway faction of Italy's Communist party on
Wednesday indicated it would take up Premier Romano Prodi's appeal
for support, boosting the chances that the center-left government
could survive a confidence vote.
	   The Communist Refoundation party, led by Fausto Bertinotti,
decided over the weekend to withdraw support for Prodi, saying the
proposed 1999 budget did not do enough to stimulate jobs,
particularly in Italy's lesser developed south where the jobless
rate runs about double the national average of 12.5 percent.
	   Prodi, who has relied on the Communists' votes in the lower
Chamber of Deputies throughout his 2 1/2 year term for a majority,
was forced to call the confidence vote, expected Friday, to
determine whether his coalition still commands a majority.
	   Arguing that Italy needs political stability to maintain its
place within Europe and the European Monetary Union, Prodi went
before Parliament earlier Wednesday and appealed to his frayed
majority to reunite.
	   ``I don't think that any of the forces in the majority can hold
back their support,'' Prodi told lawmakers. ``I think that even
you, Bertinotti, must be feeling the same weight and the same
responsibilities that we feel.''
	   Hours after Prodi spoke, the Communists' No. 2, Armando
Cossutta, told hundreds of his followers that it was time to
``disobey'' the party's hard-line stance and support Prodi despite
unhappiness over the budget.
	   On Monday, Cossutta resigned as party president, calling
Bertinotti's tactics ``wrong and dangerous.''
	   Communist leaders in Parliament said Tuesday afternoon they
would heed Cossutta's appeal to prevent the government from
falling, but it was still unclear how each deputy would vote.
	   With votes from Cossutta's faction, Prodi would be just shy of a
majority in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies, but a few abstentions
and some stray votes from centrist lawmakers in the opposition
could be enough to win the confidence vote.
	   Prodi told legislators that approval of the budget was ``key to
proving Italy's credibility.''
	   He said that political stability had allowed Italy to qualify
for participation in Europe's common currency.
	   ``We cannot and must not return to being seen by other European
Union countries as the weak link, as an immature democracy and as a
country of constant instability,'' Prodi said.
	   The premier said he will quit if he loses a vote of confidence.
That would leave President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the choice of
asking him or someone else to try to form a new government or
calling early elections.
	   The center-right opposition led by ex-Premier and media mogul
Silvio Berlusconi is pushing for early elections.
	   Prodi has outlasted all postwar premiers except Socialist
Bettino Craxi, who was premier from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.

Thai bank recapitalization proceeding slowly, says Standard and
</HEADLINE>
Poors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A massive recapitalization of
Thailand's banking industry is proceeding at a slower pace than
anticipated, the international credit rating agency Standard and
Poor's said Wednesday.
	   It said successful recapitalization was critical to provide the
banks with financial resources necessary to absorb expected loan
losses, resume lending and ``restore underlying banking
businesses.''
	   Thailand's financial structure partially collapsed last year
when an economic downturn triggered a series of loan defaults. More
than half the country's finance companies and several banks were
forced to cease operations after becoming insolvent.
	   The credit agency announced Wednesday it had lowered its ratings
on the long-term debt of three Thai commercial banks.
	   Asset quality, profitability and capital pressures will remain
sensitive to the performance of the Thai economy, it said,
suggesting further negative rating adjustments if the
recapitalization of the sector does not proceed as envisioned under
a 300 billion baht (dlrs 7.7 billion) government assistance
program.
	   ``Further rating changes cannot be discounted if banks are
unable to replenish diminishing capital stocks or if Thailand is
affected by fresh economic or financial shocks,'' S and P said.
	   The amount needed to recapitalize the Thai commercial banking
system is clearly far higher than the support offered by the
government, it added.
	   S and P said its downgrade of Bangkok Bank, the country's
largest commercial bank, reflected mounting non-performing loans,
declining collateral values and depressed profitability as the Thai
economy struggles through a severe recession.
	   These factors have diluted the superiority of the bank's market
and financial position, the statement said.
	   ``A higher level of foreign ownership will significantly
increase the competition faced by Bangkok Bank and other locally
owned financial institutions,'' it added.
	   Both Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank _ the third-largest
commercial bank and the second-largest private bank _ may need to
source additional capital in the future, the agency said.
	   The two banks are the only Thai institutions to have
successfully raised significant capital in the open market without
surrendering control to a strategic partner.
	   S and P said it would keep Bank of Asia, in which the Dutch
ABN-AMRO Bank took a majority interest, on a watch list pending a
review of the takeover.
	   Several Thai banks have failed in recapitalization bids because
the availability of local funds is limited, and foreign investors
have been reluctant to invest due to uncertainty about eventual
non-performing loan levels.
	   ``To successfully attract foreign capital, Thailand's commercial
banks may need to either relinquish control or aggressively price
new equity issues,'' S and P said.
	   Rating downgrades given Siam Commercial Bank and Bank of Ayudhya
reflect the weaker profitability of these medium-size banks and
their significant recapitalization requirements, especially
relative to the top banks.
	   The two banks' recapitalization will be difficult to complete,
particularly at a time when significant capital is being sought by
a number of other Thai banks, said S and P.
	   ``(The two banks') aspirations not to relinquish controlling
interest to any new shareholder group may impede successful
recapitalization in a timely manner,'' it said.

Federation president takes stand against protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Luciano Nizzola, the head of Italy's highest soccer
authority, on Wednesday called ``senseless'' a threatened strike of
Serie A players over a expanding inquiry into illegal drug use.
	   The association of professional players might decide at a Milan
meeting Monday whether to strike, a move which would halt the
Italian first division whose next round of matches is scheduled for
Oct. 18.
	   ``I understand the bitterness of players faced with allegations
and violation to their privacy,'' said Nizzola, who heads the
Italian soccer federation.
	   ``However, a strike against doping allegations is senseless. ...
There are other means than a strike to express the players
protest,'' the federation president added.
	   Some leading players, such as Juventus' stars Filippo Inzaghi
and Alesandro Del Piero, have strongly backed the idea of a strike.
	   Nizzola also expressed federation support for plans to test
players' blood and urine samples to discourage use of illegal
substances.
	   ``The players support controls intended to protect their
health,'' Nizzola said as the so-called ``doping scandal'' kept
raging in Italian media.
	   Prosecutors in Bologna and Turin have been carrying out
investigations since AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman suggested this
summer that several Serie A players may have used
performance-enhancing substances. So far, player has been found to
be using illegal substances.
	   The fallout from investigations, allegations and threatened
lawsuits have prompted the resignation of Mario Pescante, the
president of Italy's Olympic commitee (CONI) and of the chief of
CONI's drug testing laboratory.

Grenada appoints Czech financier honorary ambassador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ A Czech millionaire who gave
Grenada dlrs 500,000 to promote tourism and lent a corporate jet to
government officials on several occasions has been appointed an
honorary ambassador at large.
	   Viktor Kozeny, who used Czechoslovakia's privatization program
to build a multimillion-dollar business, was given the title on
Monday.
	   Kozeny bought a marina just outside St. George's last year with
plans to develop it into a first-class resort. Work has yet to
begin, but Kozeny presented a dlrs 500,000 check to the government
on Friday to promote tourism to Grenada. He promised to raise at
least dlrs 500,000 more.
	   Kozeny also recently provided a jet to Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell so Mitchell could travel to Europe to lobby for
preferential import treatment of bananas, a key Grenada product.
	   The opposition National Democratic Congress questioned the
propriety of Kozeny's appointment as an honorary ambassador, given
his close ties to the prime minister.
	   Mitchell on Friday described Kozeny and his business associates
as ``serious investors'' in Grenada's development.
	   ``I must say that getting in contact with people like Mr. Kozeny
is certainly paying dividends for this country,'' Mitchell said.

Expectations high for Hasek after amazing season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLYN THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ The Dominator won't need pre-recorded
cheers on his home ice this season. He makes his own noise by
stopping just about everything that comes his way.
	   Dominik Hasek has done it all in his extraordinary career except
win a North American National Hockey League championship. And
despite his accomplishments, the world's best goaltender seems more
concerned with what he hasn't got.
	   ``The whole season was great, but if you don't win the last game
of the season, you're not going to be happy,'' he said.
	   So, Hasek returns for another season in Buffalo to try to add to
his trophy case. There might not be any room, though.
	   He led his Czech Republic team to Olympic gold. He took the
Sabres to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since
1980. He became the first goalie to win the Hart Trophy (the NHL's
most valuable player award) and Vezina Trophy (top goalie) two
years in a row. And he picked up the Pearson Trophy, an MVP award
based on voting from fellow players.
	   He also led the league with 13 shutouts and a 93.2 save
percentage and had an impeccable 2.09 goals-against average.
	   ``Having him back, you're almost assured of a playoff spot right
away,'' Buffalo right wing Matthew Barnaby said. ``He's so good by
himself.''
	   While Hasek didn't take the Sabres to the Stanley Cup finals,
there were rewards he couldn't have imagined at the season's start,
when he struggled amid the jeers of fans angry over his supposed
part in the departure of popular coach Ted Nolan.
	   The jeers got so loud at Marine Midland Arena at the beginning
of the season that the Sabres mixed in tapes of cheering fans to
drown out the hecklers.
	   Hasek remembers those ugly fan greetings, which stopped soon
after he and the team started winning.
	   ``I'm excited after a win, of course, but it doesn't change
me,'' he says. ``I know if I lose and play terribly people will boo
me.''
	   There was no booing in his homeland.
	   After the Czech Republic won gold at the Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan, countrymen raised banners declaring Hasek ``a god.''
More than 150,000 people showed up for a team rally in Prague's Old
Town Square. Czech astronomers named an asteroid Dominik.
	   When a 5-meter (16-foot) replica of Hasek's Sabres jersey was
inflated above the Sabres' ice during the playoffs, it seemed
particularly fitting for his larger-than-life image.
	   The celebrity continued after Buffalo ended its playoff run two
games from the Stanley Cup finals, when Hasek returned to the Czech
Republic for the summer.
	   He managed to get his fill of his beloved soccer, tennis, squash
and in-line hockey with friends in Pardubice, but outings with his
wife, 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter often ended with a
hasty retreat home to escape the flash of fans' cameras.
	   Now back with the Sabres, the Dominator is well aware Buffalo is
looking for an encore.
	   ``Last season was a very good season for me, but it's already
behind me,'' Hasek said. ``And now there's a new season and I know
it won't be an easy season at all. There are more expectations.''
	   But he approaches the season without any ``to-do'' list.
	   ``I usually don't set goals for myself,'' he said. ``The goal is
always to play well and to win as many games as I can.
	   ``My job is to stop the puck and help my teammates win the
game.''
	   He does that job using a self-taught style _ a combination of
reaching, stretching and flopping his body, from the top of his
head to the blades of his skates. He'll drop his stick to grab the
puck and roll from one side of the net to the other because
standing up takes too much time.
	   ``He's almost redefined goaltending,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff
said. ``You see a lot of younger goaltenders emulating his style.
Some have said it's not real conventional but there's a method to
his madness. You see him in practice, he rehearses each move.''
	   At 33, Hasek is more experienced than many of his younger
teammates, but ``teacher'' is not a role for which he'll volunteer.
	   ``No one taught me to play hockey. I never had a goalie coach
when I was young,'' he said. ``I was just learning from other
people, watching them. I think it's better than to say `You have to
do this' and `you have to do that.'
	   ``Everyone has to find his own style, whether it's hockey or
anything else.''
	   But just his presence on the ice does wonders for his teammates.
	   ``It supplies a lot of confidence for the whole team when the
MVP of the league is your goaltender,'' Ruff said.
	   And when you've got the MVP, there's certainly no need for taped
cheers.

U.S. negotiators walk out of air talks with Britain By SUE LEEMAN

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. transport officials walked out of talks
Wednesday aimed at forging an ``open skies'' agreement on
trans-Atlantic air travel, saying their British counterparts were
not willing to negotiate.
	   Britain insisted it was ready to resume discussions, and the
British airline Virgin Atlantic accused the Americans of trying to
protect their own domestic routes.
	   It was not immediately clear when the two sides will meet again.
Talks resumed Monday after a break of nearly two years on a deal
that would allow an unlimited number of carriers to serve any U.S.
or British airport.
	   ``We're quite disappointed. We had believed that after 20 months
of a hiatus, and a pre-meeting in September, that the British were
ready to move,'' said Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary
for aviation and international affairs at the Department of
Transportation in Washington.
	   ``We don't see that,'' he said.
	   In a statement, British Transport Minister John Reid said he
regretted the American walkout ``after 2 1/2 days of substantive
discussions,'' but added that it was ``no surprise that our first
formal negotiations in 1 1/2 years have not been easy.''
	   ``The United Kingdom stands ready to resume talks,'' he said.
	   One issue complicating the talks is a lucrative proposed deal
between British Airways and American Airlines, the world's largest
airline alliance.
	   Britain has said an ``open skies'' deal depends on the U.S.
government approving the British Airways-American deal. But
officials in Washington say there will be no approval until Britain
signs off on the ``open skies'' proposal.
	   Murphy said this week's talks had ``failed to move forward on
any significant issue,'' including route rights and access to
London's Heathrow Airport, fare pricing and the settlement of
disputes.
	   Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Moore said the walkout came after
a disagreement Wednesday morning over ``sum of sector pricing,''
which holds U.S. airlines to certain minimum fares on domestic
routes.
	   Britain says that if this is scrapped, as the Americans want,
U.S. airlines would be able to undercut foreign airlines coming
into the domestic market under any ``open skies'' agreement.
	   ``That is pure protectionism,'' Moore said. ``The Americans
clearly have not been willing to negotiate across the board and
have walked out at the first hurdle.''
	   The United States has signed ``open skies'' deals with 31
nations, but Britain has resisted such an arrangement.
	   Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two
U.S. carriers _ American and United Airlines _ are allowed to fly
into Heathrow, which offers the most connections to international
points.
	   U.S. officials say that as a result, Americans face limited
flights, and far less competition, on flights to England.
	   Britain has said that any ``open skies'' deal must include
``competition safeguards'' that let authorities deal with two
common problems in the United States _ predatory pricing and
airlines dumping extra seats onto competitive markets to kill off
rivals.
	   British negotiators also pushed for a relaxation of U.S. rules
preventing non-American companies from owning more than 25 percent
of a U.S. airline.
	   U.S. negotiators want an undertaking that once Heathrow is
opened up to all carriers, other U.S. airlines will be guaranteed
runway slots free of charge. They also want so-called ``fifth
freedom'' rights allowing U.S. carriers to fly between Britain and
other countries.
	   Murphy, the U.S. official, said U.S. negotiators refused a
British request to set a date for another meeting.
	   ``We won't until we are convinced we can make progress on some
of these core issues,'' he said.
	   British Airways and American Airlines propose to merge their
operations, but not their corporations, in a deal that would let
them set prices and share revenues on some of the world's most
lucrative routes.
	   Their competitors, which include United and Britain's Virgin
Atlantic, complain that the deal would allow them to control 60
percent of the American-British market.

Fair official says travel ban on Turkish publisher lifted

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a reversal, Turkey has decided to
allow a controversial publisher to go to Germany to pick up a
``Freedom to Publish'' award at the Frankfurt Book Fair, organizers
said Wednesday.
	   Ayse Nur Zarakolu, who had been trying for five years to get her
passport back from Turkish government officials, got it
unexpectedly on Wednesday. She is expected at the world's largest
book fair on Thursday, said Gerhard Kurtze, president of the German
Book Publishers' Association.
	   He said organizers had protested the travel ban through
government and U.N. channels.
	   The 52-year-old publisher was named to receive the book fair's
first ``Freedom to Publish Award,'' worth 10,000 marks (dlrs
6,000). It was presented to her son Sinan on Wednesday in
Zarakolu's absence.

Future government chief announces rethinking on nuclear power in
</HEADLINE>
Slovakia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The man who likely will head
Slovakia's future government suggested Wednesday that Slovakia will
be rethinking the use of nuclear energy, less than two months after
a controversial atomic power plant went fully on line.
	   The 440-megawatt nuclear reactor at Mochovce, just 120
kilometers (72 miles) east of the Austrian border, has been
criticized as unsafe by the Vienna government but has the blessing
of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   Austria has campaigned strongly against its activation, arguing
that certain features of the heavy-water pressure reactor, a
Soviet-designed plant equipped with Western technology, make it
unsafe.
	   In an interview published in Thursday's edition of the Vienna
weekly magazine News but released Wednesday, Mikulas Dzurinda, the
chairman of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said, ``I realize that
the question of nuclear power plants cannot be an internal question
of Slovakia.''
	   He said Mochovce would be ``the last atomic power station'' of
Slovakia, but even there the last word had not yet been spoken.
	   ``The current Slovak government was not open enough for a
bilateral discussion between Slovakia and Austria,'' Dzurinda was
quoted as saying. ``We want to relaunch this nuclear dilaogue and
will open all doors: to Austria and international experts.''
	   In last month's parliamentary elections, Dzurinda's five-party
alliance as well as two other potential partners in a future
government coalition, garnered a comfortable majority in parliament
warranting changes in the constitution.
	   Dzurinda also voiced optimism for Slovakia to join the European
Union alongside other designated candidates for EU membership from
which Slovakia was barred under outgoing autocratic Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar.
	   ``We will do everything to catch up with the Czech Republic,
Poland, Hungary and other countries of the first round of
negotiations with the EU,'' he said. ``I am convinced that we will
become member of the European family together with our neighbors.''

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa offered no new
proposals Wednesday to rescue Hong Kong from recession, but
promised in a policy address that the government is committed to
maintaining a free market economy and protecting the currency peg.
	   Tung painted a gloomy picture in his second annual address,
saying Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into
1999.''
	   He said the budget deficit may far exceed the June estimate of
20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.56 billion) due to the
economic downturn, and the deficit may retard growth in government
expenditure in the next few years.
	   Hong Kong's economic recovery hinges on ``an improvement in the
external economic environment, a steadying of interest rates,
stability in property market and the restoration of public
confidence,'' he said.
	   The government's priority now is to stabilize property prices,
which have fallen 50 percent since last October, he added.
	   He announced the suspension of a subsidized middle-class housing
program in an attempt to boost the private market, but stopped
short of scrapping a housing construction target set last year,
which has been widely blamed for the property slump.
	   He also declined to disclose the government's plan when a
nine-month freeze on land sales expires next March.
	   Week's after Tung's inaugural policy address last year, Hong
Kong was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming
economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   Analysts, economists and politicians gave his latest address a
lukewarm response. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which closed the
day 2.4 percent higher mainly on good news from Japan, rose only a
few points after his address, which hadn't finished when the market
closed.
	   ``There's nothing substantial,'' said Vanessa Yeung, head of
research at G.K. Goh Securities (HK) Ltd. ``These kinds of policies
will not help the economy in the short term.''
	   Political analyst Ivan Choy of City University said the address
would further hurt citizens' confidence in Tung, which has plunged
substantially with the economy.
	   Radio Television Hong Kong said that in a phone-in poll it
conducted after Tung's speech, 56 percent of the more than 3,700
respondents reported feeling less confident in Hong Kong's future,
while 31 percent said their confidence had increased.
	   ``He's so out of touch with the citizens' concern,'' Choy said,
referring to growing unemployment and pay cuts. To most people's
surprise, Tung largely ignored those issues in his speech.
	   ``He wasn't honest with the people when he diagnosed Hong Kong's
problems,'' Choy added.
	   Lawmaker Martin Lee, leader of the opposition Democratic Party,
Hong Kong's largest, said Tung ``lacks leadership, and his speech
lacked direction.''
	   Before his speech, a small group of protesters slipped a
petition into his car, and waved a banner saying, ``Failure. Out of
Control. Unemployment. Disappointment.''
	   In his speech, Tung urged Hong Kong to strengthen ties with the
rest of China for faster economic recovery, and urged international
cooperation to monitor global fund movements and stop economic
crises from spreading.
	   He also reiterated that ``the linked exchange rate is to stay,''
and ``no foreign exchange control shall be applied.''
	   The Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar has been under
serious attack by speculators betting the Hong Kong dollar will
sink. To defend the currency link, the government has to keep
interest rates high.
	   Tung also defended the much-criticized government market
intervention in late August, when it spent an estimated 15 percent
of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves to buy stocks and futures
to keep share prices at levels that would punish speculators
betting on a decline.
	   The government later imposed more stringent trading regulations
to make illegal trading and speculation more difficult.
	   He said it was ``not our intention to interfere with market
forces,'' and that the aim was ``to consolidate Hong Kong's ability
to manage its monetary affairs.''

Protesters seize Shell Oil facilities in Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Angry youths protesting against the
government have taken control of nine Shell Oil relay stations in
southern Nigeria, company authorities confirmed Wednesday.
	   The flow of crude oil through a number of pipeline relay
facilities has been shut down, halting the transfer of about
250,000 barrels a day.
	   The relay stations are an important link in Nigeria's oil export
industry and are used to pump oil into holding tanks, where they
then are shipped out for exports.
	   The facilities were seized in several areas over the past few
days by groups of demonstrators angry at government election
preparations, Shell Nigeria Managing Director Ron Van Den Berg was
quoted as saying in the Lagos-based Tribune newspaper.
	   Voter registration for next year's presidential elections began
this week throughout Nigeria and youth groups in the oil-rich Niger
River delta region have been using the occasion to protest what
they say is their exclusion from the country's political process.
	   Communities in Nigeria's southern states say their interests are
not represented in federal politics, which is dominated by
northerners. Although rich in oil, the Niger River delta states are
among the poorest and most neglected in Nigeria.
	   Basic infrastructure in towns and villages is often provided by
foreign oil companies operating in the area, because the government
has failed to provide paved roads, electricity and clean water.
	   Shell officials in Nembe district in southern Nigeria's Delta
state said a group of demonstrators over the weekend attacked four
flow stations and forced the evacuation of company employees from
the area.
	   On Saturday, another group of protesters forced the closure of
Shell flow station facilities in the Odeama Creek area. Three
company boats were also seized along with 12 crew members, a
company official said by telephone.
	   Further west in the same state, members of the Ijaw ethnic group
threatened to attack several Shell facilities, forcing the
precautionary withdrawal of staff workers and the shutdown of at
least four other flow stations.
	   Shell's Nigerian joint venture, the Shell Petroleum Development
Corporation, has appealed to the the country's military government
to settle the dispute with the protesters to allow the company to
resume normal operations.
	   Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, is heavily dependent on
the petroleum industry. Shell and other foreign oil firms are often
targeted for protests as a way of drawing government attention to
their causes.

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A former government minister and
Lebanon's ambassador to the Ivory Coast have been implicated in a
scandal involving allegations of forced sexual encounters with a
14-year-old boy.
	   Ministry of Security officials speaking on condition of
anonymity confirmed the arrest of six people including four
Lebanese nationals in connection with the case, which was still
under investigation.
	   They gave no other details except to say that the boy in
question is seriously ill. The victim was reportedly abducted,
drugged and repeatedly sodomized.
	   Earlier this week the French-language daily Le Jour reported
that several prominent Lebanese business leaders in Abidjan and the
town of Dabou had sexually abused the boy for more than six months.
	   This is the first time in the Ivory Coast that arrests have been
made based on charges of this nature, the officials said.
	   Lebanon's Ambassador Mohammed Daher and former Ivorian Economic
Infrastructure Minister Ezan Akele were implicated in at least one
of the encounters, the newspaper said.
	   An official at Lebanon's embassy in Abidjan denied allegations
that Daher was linked to the case.
	   ``It's a set-up,'' an embassy consular officer said, refusing to
give his name.
	   A press conference with Daher was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon.
	   The embassy consular officer said the stories and the charges
were fabricated to defame the Lebanese community in the Ivory
Coast.
	   As in much of West Africa, expatriate Lebanese businessmen
control vast portions of the commercial sector in the Ivory Coast,
often evoking resentment in the local community.
	   A police official working at Abidjan's central Prefecture
dealing with complaints involving minors confirmed that the parents
of an Ivorian minor from Dabou, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of the commercial capital of Abidjan, had filed complaints
against several people.
	   The official who also spoke on condition of anonymity refused to
give further information except to say that the case was
``delicate'' and had been transferred to the Attorney-General's
office.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Attorney-General's
office.
	   Hearings on the case are expected to begin in a Dabou court next
week.

French court agrees to extradite Gelli: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday approved Italy's
request to extradite fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli, French
radio reported.
	   The Court of Appeals in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence
accepted the request to send the 79-year-old former head of the
powerful and shadowy Masonic lodge P-2 back to Italy, France Info
radio said.
	   Gelli fled in May just as his 12-year prison sentence for bank
fraud was to begin.
	   Police caught up with him earlier this month on the French
Riviera. He has been hospitalized with heart trouble since his
arrest.
	   His lawyer, Michele Gentiloni, said last month that Gelli would
not fight extradition, in part because of his poor health. If he
contested the request, it could have prolonged his stay in France
for months.
	   Gelli was once one of Italy's biggest influence peddlers and he
headed P-2, which stood for Propaganda 2. The lodge was exposed in
the 1980s and accused of plotting to install a right-wing
dictatorship in Italy.
	   Gelli was convicted in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
then Italy's largest bank. The collapse touched off a huge
financial scandal for the Vatican because the Vatican Bank owned
part of Ambrosiano.

Turkish Premier says Syria waging indirect war on Turkey

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday
accused Damascus of waging an indirect war against Turkey by
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels and said the ``time has come to
end the dark games of Syria.''
	   Syria denies sheltering rebels, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   ``We are not trying to spark a war,'' Yilmaz told Parliament.
``But we (the government) are determined if necessary to ask the
Parliament's consent'' for possible use of force.''
	   Yilmaz said the Cabinet decided earlier in the day to take all
necessary dissuasive measures against Syria if it maintains its
support to Kurdish rebels, fighting autonomy within Turkey.
	   ``Through its support to the terrorists, Syria is waging an
indirect war against Turkey,'' he said.
	   Yilmaz's address to the Parliament came a day after Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak held talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel in Ankara to seek a peaceful solution.
	   ``Mubarak has inspired us to give a last chance to diplomacy,''
Yilmaz said. ``The steps which Syria will be taking carry great
importance in ending the tension.''
	   Yilmaz said Ankara was demanding the extradition of the rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey, and an end to Syria's financial
and logistics support.
	   Turkey also contends the rebels run training camps in the Syrian
controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.
	   Mubarak, who was given a dossier containing documents allegedly
verifying Syria's backing for the rebels, flew directly to Damascus
from Ankara on Tuesday and met with Syrian President Hafez Assad
for a second time in a week.
	   Reports in Egypt on Tuesday said Mubarak was trying to work out
a mechanism for the two sides to meet and resolve the dispute.
	   The United States and Russia, along with most countries of the
Middle East, have urged the two countries to reach a peaceful
settlement.
	   Yilmaz did not rule out direct talks with Damascus but said
``even if there will be a diplomatic dialogue it must be limited to
(discussing) the rebel activities alone.''
	   Turkey and Syria are also at loggerheads over an ambitious
Turkish irrigation project in southeastern Turkey, which Damascus
fears would reduce the water flow of Euphrates River crossing into
Syria, and on the Turkish border province of Hatay which Ankara
accuses Syria of having designs on.
	   Syria is also uneasy about the growing ties between Israel and
Turkey.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Wednesday that a war with
Syria would last only one day. Daily Yeniyuzyil said Turkey would
stage pinpoint air raids on rebel camps if Syria does not change
its attitude.
	   The Anatolia news agency reported Wednesday that some tanks and
armed personnel carriers were transferred to the province of
Sanliurfa bordering Syria.

Uganda coffee exporters want to sell coffee in Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ Ugandan coffee exporters have approached
Coffee Board of Kenya with a view to using Kenya's auction
facilities, the Kenya Coffee Auction spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Tony Valentine said Bunsuna Coffee Exporters are seeking
admission to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange to sell Ugandan robusta
coffee.
	   Valentine could not confirm whether the request came just from
Bunsuna or the Ugandan coffee industry as a whole.
	   ``We don't know how much coffee is involved yet, but the
organization wishes to use our market, and they are quite impatient
to get moving,'' he said.
	   Following the complete liberalization of the Ugandan and
Tanzanian coffee industries that did away with central auctions and
official grading, farmers and exporters in Kenya's two East African
neighbors are having a hard time selling their coffee.
	   There are reports that farmers in Tanzania are uprooting
thousands of plants.
	   Last week, Tanzanian government officials and coffee industry
specialists visited the Coffee Board of Kenya to study the Kenyan
experience and learn how to revive their industry.
	   CBK spokesman Paul Kivila said the board will decide in two
weeks whether Bunsuna will be able to enter the auction.
	   Uganda produces mainly robusta coffee, and if the proposal is
accepted, it would mean that robusta would be sold together with
Kenyan arabica, a new development for the auction, Valentine said.
	   ``But we should wait until something happens before we get
excited about it,'' he said.
	   Uganda's coffee export forecast for this season has been
announced as 2.6 million bags from 4.237 million bags exported last
season, a decline attributed to a fall in production due to bad
weather.
	   The figures were given by the state-run Uganda Coffee
Development Authority.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy began further talks Wednesday
with Slobodan Milosevic after failing to persuade the Yugoslav
president to pull out more forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Milosevic has remained defiant through two meetings, during
which Richard Holbrooke sought to convince him that Washington is
equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N. resolutions or
face military action.
	   Reflecting a grim mood, Holbrooke had only terse public comments
ahead of the latest talks that started at mid-afternoon Wednesday.
``The situation's extremely serious,'' he said.
	   Despite a U.N. Security Council declaration Tuesday that the
combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with resolutions
demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special Serb police
units, a U.S. spokesman said Wednesday there was still no consensus
for military action.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   A decision is possible by the weekend, after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets Thursday with NATO officials and
Holbrooke in Brussels.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people
have been driven from their homes in the southern province in
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule for the province,
which was autonomous until 1989.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Preparations for military intervention continued Wednesday.
Britain, France and Germany all recommended that their nationals
leave Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   NATO ambassadors also met in Brussels. NATO chief Javier Solana
reiterated that the alliance can go ahead with a decision on
intervention regardless of the U.N. stance.
	   After a Tuesday night meeting between Milosevic and Holbrooke in
Belgrade, diplomatic sources said Milosevic was still refusing to
accept international demands to withdraw all security forces from
Kosovo. The Yugoslav leader repeatedly claimed there has been no
military activity in the province for eight days _ something the
ethnic Albanians dispute.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting Wednesday
indicated that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed his call for Milosevic to
halt the crackdown.
	   ``If he does that, he completely complies, he doesn't have to
worry about military force,'' Clinton said, reiterating the
demands: a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, humanitarian access to
refugees, and a resumption of negotiations.
	   Intent on showing it is working to settle the conflict,
Milosevic invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to send a ``brief'' mission to Kosovo, officials said.
	   The Serbs claim all police actions have ceased in Kosovo and all
special police units, in the forefront of strikes against Kosovo
Albanian militants, have been pulled out. But international
observers dispute that.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be identified said Wednesday
that an estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _
down from 36,000 10 days earlier _ in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   Ethnic Albanian villagers in the Malisevo region, southwest of
the provincial capital Pristina, told journalists Wednesday that
Serbs have shelled their homes for the last four days. Residents of
Dragobe, which has largely been evacuated, pointed to new holes in
their houses they said were from Serb shells.
	   The Serbs have said they are being fired upon by ethnic Albanian
rebels.
	   Russia was making a last-ditch effort Wednesday to persuade
Milosevic to comply, according to a ranking Russian diplomat in
Serbia who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Daly faces Westwood on course for big hitters

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ With the finest single malt
whiskeys within easy reach, the temptation for John Daly to slide
back into another alcoholic haze appears huge.
	   Yet maybe he couldn't have come to a better place to continue
his rehab.
	   Daly and the Old Course at St. Andrews are made for each other.
	   ``It's a golf course that I don't want to get off,'' Daly said
Wednesday on the eve of the 1 million pound (dlrs 1.67 million)
Dunhill Cup.
	   ``I'm excited to be here again. There is always something
special about St. Andrews, I can hit my driver pretty well and the
course makes it fun for me.''
	   He also gets results.
	   Daly won the 1995 British Open at the home of golf two years
after helping the American team win the Dunhill Cup on his only
other appearance in the competition when he won four of his five
matches. This time he also has Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara as
team-mates.
	   ``I'm honored to be here on the team with these guys,'' he said.
``Tiger is No. 1 in the world, Mark is No. 4 and I'm in the
hundreds I guess.''
	   Daly's form is hampered by his ongoing battle to kick
alcoholism. It was jolted by an attack of the shakes during a round
of the Greater Vancouver Open two months ago.
	   He admits his body changes almost day to day because of his
efforts to avoid the drinking, gambling and sometimes violent
lifestyle that has plagued his career.
	   At St. Andrews, however, he feels relaxed and at ease with his
game although he was surprised that team captain O'Meara had chosen
him to face England's top player, Lee Westwood, in Thursday Group 1
match.
	   ``Mark picked me up there against their No. 1 guy,'' Daly said.
``I was not quite expecting that but he's the captain. I'll go out
and do my best.''
	   O'Meara, winner of this year's Masters and British Open titles
and a member of the American Dunhill Cup winning team two years
ago, explained that it was Daly's past performances at the home of
golf that persuaded the team to put him up against England's
leading player.
	   ``His record has shown he can play really well here. I know Lee
is playing some extremely good golf and I felt it would be a nice
matchup to play John and Lee up front.''
	   That means that Woods goes against David Carter and O'Meara
faces Peter Baker.
	   In the other Group 1 match, Sweden, which has Per-Ulrik
Johansson on the lineup, faces Japan.
	   Host Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie, faces debutant China
and Spain, which has Jose Maria Olazabal on the lineup, meets
Ireland.
	   Defending titlist South Africa, with Ernie Els on the lineup,
meets France in Group 3 and Zimbabwe, led by Nick Price, faces
Germany.
	   ``None of us have played all that well this year but we will be
ready,'' said Els, who parters David Frost and Retief Goosen.
``When we go out there will get the memories flooding back from
last year and play some decent golf.''
	   Australia, seeded two behind the Americans and with former PGA
champion Steve Elkington on the lineup, faces Argentina in Group 4
while New Zealand, runner up in 1996 and semifinalist last year,
meets South Korea.
	   ``It's sort of like the world is playing,'' Daly said. ``You
have the Presidents Cup without Europe, and the Ryder Cup where the
rest of the world is out. This is the only time the whole world is
playing.''
	   Woods has played St. Andrews as an amateur and a pro but never
in a team competition. He also has a fondness and a respect for the
Old Course.
	   ``It was build in the 1400s or something and has stood the test
of time. The best players in the world still have a difficult time
here. It suits my game too because I can hit my drives but you have
to be very creative and decide whether to bump and run, fly it in
the air, spin it, do whatever you have to do.''
	   The 16 teams play three round-robin matches on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday and the winners of each group advance to the semifinal
which is played on Sunday along with the final.
	   Each member of the winning team collects 100,000 pounds (dlrs
167,000).

Report: French tests confirm nerve gas components on Iraqi

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ France has detected traces of nerve gas on Iraqi
warheads, The New York Times reported Wednesday, four months after
the United States reached the same conclusion and accused Iraq of
lying about its chemical weapons program.
	   Testing on samples taken from the weapons reportedly show
evidence of chemicals linked to VX, a drop of which on the skin, or
inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes.
	   Iraq, which has had to endure seven years of United Nations
weapons inspections, has admitted it tried to make VX but has
denied it was ever able to make enough of it or stabilize it
sufficiently to load into weapons.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify Iraq has destroyed its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range missiles to
deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift crippling
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the
Gulf War.
	   Swiss tests on warheads turned up negative.
	   But a U.S. army laboratory, in tests whose results were
disclosed in June, concluded that missile fragments contained
traces of the gas.
	   Weapons experts told the Times that the French findings would
confirm the American tests. They showed the presence of components
found in decomposed VX in missile warheads destroyed by Iraq and
dug up by U.N. inspectors.
	   Diplomats said the French were delaying the release of final
tests because they didn't want to undermine Iraq's push at the
United Nations this week to lift the sanctions, the Times said.
	   France, which has major commercial interests in Iraq, has urged
the United Nations to move faster to ease the sanctions imposed
after the Gulf War.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday that the
Security Council has a ``legal'' and ``moral'' obligation to lift
economic sanctions imposed against the nation after the Gulf War.
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it was not aware that
French experts found traces of VX on samples examined here.
However, ``I suppose that, if this were the case, we would already
know about it or we would soon be officially informed by the
Special Commission, which informs members of the Security
Council,'' said ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   To the question of whether French experts delayed communicating
results, she said: ``The French laboratory was chosen by the
Special Commission. French authorities did not intervene at all in
their work.''

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch rider Leontien van Moorsel
capped her comeback with a victory Wednesday in the elite women's
time trial with Lance Armstrong looking for a chance for his.
	   Van Moorsel won the top women's time trial by less than half a
second over Russian Olympic champion Zoulfia Zabirova.
	   Van Moorsel was timed in 31 minutes, 51.14 seconds over the
23-kilometer (14.3-mile), just .38 second ahead of Zabirova.
	   Hanka Huffernagel of Germany was third, less than three seconds
back.
	   Jeannie Longo of France who had won the three previous world
time trials and was seeking her 13th overall title, was fifth, more
than 24 seconds behind. Lithuanian Diana Ziliute was fourth
	   Van Moorsel was making a comeback after winning the road
championship in 1991 and 1993 and the track pursuit title back in
1990.
	   She had weight problems and had to attend a clinic and took 1994
and 1995 off before coming back without top results in 1996.
	   ``After stopping and returning like this is really special
because now I know the value of this (title) and it's very
different from the others,'' van Moorsel said. ``I had a
competition with myself to prove I was back at the top level
again.''
	   She said the home crowd helped her, especially on the final
climb near the finish where the roadside fans were beating the
banners to encourage her.
	   ``They were all there for me and it was really a big help for
me,'' van Moorsel said.
	   Zabirova accepted the close defeat with an eye for the future.
	   ``Last year I was second by a second. Now it is less than half a
second,'' Zabirova said. ``Maybe next year''
	   While the women have finished their time trial, the men
concentrate for their event Thursday with cool weather again
predicted.
	   Armstrong is looking for a comeback after cancer forced him to
miss the last two world championships.
	   The 27-year old Armstrong, who announced he had testicular
cancer just before the world championships two years ago, returns
to the event as one of the favorites. He won the road title in
1993.
	   Armstrong arrived from Nice, France Tuesday and immediately went
out and sought some protection against the cold, buying some
all-weather gloves and jacket in a local shop.
	   With temperatures about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F), Armstrong
wanted some extra protection against the cold after overnight rains
in southern Netherlands.
	   The Austin, Texas rider's return hasn't been easy after taking
the 1997 season off to battle his cancer with chemotheraphy and
operations. His cancer is in remission now.
	   He came back this year but dropped out of the Paris-Nice race in
France this past March and questioned whethere he wanted to
continue racing.
	   Returning to the United States, Armstrong didn't look at his
bicycle for four weeks, then headed for a training camp in rainy
North Carolina.
	   ``I really had to decide there if I loved the bike and whether
or not I loved doing six hours a day in the pouring rain,'' he
said. ``I left there knowing that I really enjoy what I do.''
	   He wants to become a source of inspiration to many others who
have to battle cancer.
	   ``I would like to be an example for ... all cancer patients, not
just young men with testicular cancer, and their families,''
Armstrong said. ``I realized how lonely I was and how hard it was.
I promised myself that I would do whatever I could in the future to
make it easier for the next person.''
	   Since returning to Europe, he has had a series of top results.
He won the four-day Tour of Luxembourg and a German tour,
Rheinland-Pfalz.
	   He also was fourth in the Tour of the Netherlands.
	   Then his fourth place finish in the Tour of Spain propelled him
back to the top level of cyclists present at the World
Championships.
	   With those successes behind him, he comes to the worlds in top
form with the added encouragement that a number of top riders are
missing from the lineup.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis -- and France's two world champions of last
year, time trial winner Laurent Jalabert and road champion Laurent
Brochard are out.
	   That leave's Armstrong, Spain's Abraham Olano and another
comeback rider, Chris Boardman, as the top contenders in Thursday's
43.5-kilometer (27-mile) time trial.
	   Olano took the time trial in the Tour of Spain where Armstrong
was just eight seconds behind.
	   Boardman, the 1994 world time trial champion, is still searchimg
his form after crashing out in the Tour de France's second stage.
	   Armstrong is scheduled to start ninth from the last in
Thursday's race with Boardman, Olano and Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine
the final three.
	   Armstrong is also a contender for Sunday's men's road race. The
course is 15 laps through the Dutch coutnryside, a total of 258
kilometers (162 miles).
	   ``It is very much a classic course,'' Armstrong said. ``Very
difficult, long and (with) short, steep climbs. ''
	   In the junior men's time trial, 17-year old Fabian Cancellara of
Switzerland won, covering the 23-kilometer (14.3-mile) course in 29
minutes, 39.15 seconds.
	   Torsten Hiekmann of Germany was second, 2.46 seconds behind,
with Italy's Fillippo Pozzato third.

Albright says Arafat, Netanyahu to hold Washington summit Oct. 15
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton remarks &QL;

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ After lengthy talks with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced on Wednesday an Oct. 15 summit would be held in
Washington to try to work out agreement on a West Bank accord.
	   ``We made significant progress,'' she said after meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   In fact, Albright told reporters, ``We are in a far better
position to finalize all the issues'' needed to conclude an
agreement on the West Bank.
	   Albright's meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu followed up on
discussion the two leaders had with President bill Clinton last
month. At the time, Clinton invited them back to Washington to try
to finalize a West Bank accord.
	   ``The president is going to be very much involved in a lot of
the detailed work,'' Albright said. ``He has a very special and
uncanny ability to work with people who have difficult problems
like these. He puts himself in their shoes.''
	   In an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday,
Clinton said he was eager for the talks to start.
	   ``It may take more than a day, yes,'' he said. ``I asked them to
black out a couple of days to come back because I think it's very
important that we try to get over these last humps and get into the
last stage of negotiations.
	   ``I'm prepared to invest as much time as it takes,'' he said,
adding that he would stay closely involved. ``I will be involved
constantly throughout the process, yes,'' he said.
	   ``I'm encouraged by the attitude and the sense of openness I
felt from Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat the last time
they were here,'' Clinton said. ``And if they can come back here
with that spirit, we're close enough now that we can get this done.
And I just hope and pray that that will happen when they come
back.''

Solana says no U.N backing needed for airstrikes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
stressed Wednesday the alliance does not need U.N. backing to
launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying ``We are ready to
act.''
	   ``NATO will take a decision of their own,'' said Solana when
asked whether the alliance could act without the full backing of
the U.N. Security Council.
	   Solana will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in Brussels on Thursday before hearing a report from the U.S.
special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke.
	   Despite Russian concern over a military action and Moscow's
likely veto of any U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force
against Yugoslavia, NATO officials reiterated that the alliance
already had all the legal backing it needed.
	   NATO will hold a special joint council with Russia here Friday
to push that point and stress that they share the ultimate
objective of bringing peace and humanitarian relief to the Yugoslav
province.
	   ``We are ready to act. That is clear enough,'' Solana said.
	   Despite the lack of a clear U.N. resolution, the NATO allies are
coming closer to agreeing on the joint legal basis that will hold
up in international law, a NATO official said Wednesday.
	   ``We all agree that before we act, we will have a common
understanding of what the appropriate legal basis is,'' said a NATO
official, who demanded anonymity.
	   The official stressed military action would be able to withstand
any legal challenge.
	   ``If 16 democratic countries can come to the collective
agreement on a solid legal basis, it will hold up in international
law,'' the official said.
	   Meanwhile, the NATO member states are busy meeting
constitutional conditions in their individual countries to allow
for their participation in a joint NATO action over the coming
days.
	   Germany is currently going through a governmental transition
with the outgoing coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
remaining in a caretaker capacity.
	   In other nations, too, governments have to consult with
parliament and go through other procedures before an airstrike can
be officially approved. The NATO official said this was not going
to take more than a few days.

U.S., Venezuelan agents capture Trinidad drug fugitive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ U.S. drug agents and
Venezuelan police captured a Trinidadian fugitive who had been
serving a life prison sentence for cocaine trafficking.
	   Deochand Ramdhanie, 32, was captured in Tucupita, Venezuela,
about 120 miles (190 kilometers) south of Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.
He was deported from Venezuela on Tuesday.
	   Ramdhanie escaped Sept. 17 from a holding pen at Princess Town
Court in Trinidad.
	   Trinidadian police said they were investigating whether prison
guards, police officers and inmates helped Ramdhanie to escape.
	   ``The recapture and the speed of the recapture vindicates all
that my government has been doing to protect its borders,
territorial waters, streets and institutions from the drug trade,''
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday said Tuesday.

Police investigate sex abuse of minor in Ivory Coast

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A former government minister and
Lebanon's ambassador to the Ivory Coast have been implicated in a
scandal involving allegations of forced sexual encounters with a
14-year-old boy.
	   Ministry of Security officials speaking on condition of
anonymity confirmed the arrest of six people including four
Lebanese nationals in connection with the case, which was still
under investigation.
	   They gave no other details except to say that the boy in
question is seriously ill. The victim was reportedly abducted,
drugged and repeatedly sodomized.
	   Earlier this week the French-language daily Le Jour reported
that several prominent Lebanese business leaders in Abidjan and the
town of Dabou had sexually abused the boy for more than six months.
	   This is the first time in the Ivory Coast that arrests have been
made based on charges of this nature, the officials said.
	   Lebanon's Ambassador Mohammed Daher and former Ivorian Economic
Infrastructure Minister Ezan Akele were implicated in at least one
of the encounters, the newspaper said.
	   An official at Lebanon's embassy in Abidjan denied allegations
that Daher was linked to the case.
	   ``It's a set-up,'' an embassy consular officer said, refusing to
give his name.
	   A press conference with Daher was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon.
	   The embassy consular officer said the stories and the charges
were fabricated to defame the Lebanese community in the Ivory
Coast.
	   As in much of West Africa, expatriate Lebanese businessmen
control vast portions of the commercial sector in the Ivory Coast,
often evoking resentment in the local community.
	   A police official working at Abidjan's central Prefecture
dealing with complaints involving minors confirmed that the parents
of an Ivorian minor from Dabou, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of the commercial capital of Abidjan, had filed complaints
against several people.
	   The official who also spoke on condition of anonymity refused to
give further information except to say that the case was
``delicate'' and had been transferred to the Attorney-General's
office.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Attorney-General's
office.
	   Hearings on the case are expected to begin in a Dabou court next
week.

UN envoy declines trip to Kabul, Taliban hesitant about coming here
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious militia is
demanding United Nations recognition, but on Wednesday it still was
uncertain whether the hardline Islamic army would send a
representative to meet the U.N.'s special envoy.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi, who is currently in Iran before coming to
Pakistan on Thursday, turned down a Taliban invitation to visit
Kabul citing security reasons, says James Ngobi, a senior U.N.
official in Pakistan.
	   The United Nations pulled all its international staff out of
Afghanistan on Aug. 21, the day after U.S. missiles slammed into
suspected terrorist training camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   In apparent retaliation for the missile assault, Afghan gunmen
shot and killed an expatriate U.N. worker in the capital of Kabul
on Aug. 21 and wounded a second worker.
	   ``I can confirm that he was invited to go to Kabul, but he has
informed the Taliban that unfortunately he cannot for security
reasons,'' Ngobi told the Associated Press in an interview. ``There
is a standing directive from the U.N. headquarters for for all U.N.
international personnel not to go to Afghanistan.''
	   Instead Brahimi invited the Taliban to Pakistan. Ngobi said so
far the Taliban haven't replied.
	   However, Mullah Mohammed Omar, the reclusive Taliban leader has
been issuing almost daily statements from his headquarters in
southern Kandahar, slamming the U.N., demanding recognition for his
movement and warning Iran against a military confrontation with
Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi's first order of business is to soothe tempers between
Iran and Afghanistan, says Ngobi.
	   Iran has amassed an estimated 270,000 troops on its eastern
borders with Afghanistan and is to hold a major military exercise
later this month.
	   Tensions between the two countries have increased since Taliban
troops killed eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist in
nrothern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran wants an apology from the Taliban and the culprits handed
over for trial in Tehran. Omar has refused both demands calling the
diplomats ``conspirators'' and accusing Iran of arming and
financing its northern-based opposition.
	   In recent days Omar has criticized the U.N. for recognizing the
former government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, which barely controls 10
percent of the country, while the Taliban rule the remaining 90
percent.
	   As well Omar has offered to totally eradicate poppy cultivation
from Afghanistan if his Taliban army is given official recognition.
	   Afghanistan is considered one of the world's biggest opium
producers, which is derived from poppies and used to make heroin.
Most of the poppies are grown in Taliban-ruled areas.
	   But thus far the U.N. has refused, in part say some U.N.
officials, who don't want to be quoted, because of pressure from
the United States.
	   Washington is demanding the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden,
the man accused of masterminding the August bomb attacks on U.S.
Embassies in east Africa.
	   Bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire, has been living in
Afghanistan for more than five years and was given asylum there
when Rabbani ruled Afghanistan.
	   Ngobi said Brahimi will meet with senior Pakistani officials
during his one-week visit. Pakistan is believed to be one of the
major backers of the Taliban army, while Iran and Russia are
considered big supporters of the anti-Taliban alliance.
	   Should a Taliban representative be sent to Pakistan, Brahimi
will discuss the U.N.'s security concerns and conditions under
which the U.N. will return to Afghanistan, he said.
	   Ngobi refused to say what Brahimi hoped to achieve while in
Pakistan.
	   ``I think that's better asked of him at the end of his visit,''
he said.

Leicester still rejecting Leeds poaching raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Martin O'Neill's future as manager of
either Leicester or Leeds is no clearer Wednesday as the Premier
League clubs continue to battle for his services.
	   Leeds has made a formal request to Leicester to approach O'Neill
in its bid to secure a replacement for George Graham but Leicester
has refused to give permission for negotiations to proceed.
	   Graham left Leeds for Tottenham last week and his replacement
was expected to be announced Wednesday, with O'Neill the main
candidate. However, Leeds has been forced to stall its appointment.
	   While Leicester refuses to let Leeds hold talks with O'Neill,
the Premier League Managers' Association is urging O'Neill to abide
by its code of conduct and stay with the Foxes.
	   Leicester chairman Sir Rodney Walker said the club had warned
Leeds not to approach O'Neill last week but, despite that, an
approach had been received and had been ``emphatically refused.''
	   Walker said Leicester had come to an agreement with O'Neill in
the off-season after an unofficial approach from another club and,
on that basis, several players had signed new contracts with the
club.
	   ``The one thing I know about (O'Neill) is that he is an
honourable man and that he will think very carefully about his
commitment to Leicester,'' he said.
	   O'Neill said Wednesday he was flattered by the approach from
Leeds and was continuing to discuss his situation with Leicester
officials.

Hingis overcomes scare against Kournikova
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Martina Hingis survived a scare
against Anna Kournikova at the Porsche Grand Prix on Wednesday and
held on to her No. 1 ranking _ at least temporarily.
	   Hingis, who has held the top ranking for 80 weeks, rallied to
win 1-6, 6-2, 6-2, benefiting from Kournikova's 13 double-faults.
	   ``I jammed my ankle in jogging this morning and for the first
three games I couldn't see anything because I forgot to put in my
contact lenses,'' Hingis said.
	   ``But after I warmed up the ankle got better, I got the lenses
and I got into the match,'' the 18-year-old Swiss said.
	   Hingis, winner of the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament the last
two years, could clinch her third title in a row and still lose the
top ranking to Lindsay Davenport, the U.S. Open champion.
	   Davenport trails Hingis by 26 points and whether she can claim
the No. 1 spot will depend on how many bonus points she can earn by
beating high-ranked players.
	   Kournikova, the 13-ranked, 17-year-old Russian who had beaten
Hingis in the final of the German Open in May, cruised through the
first set.
	   But she lost confidence in her serve and hit an incredulous
serve into the ground way before the net to double-fault on set
point.
	   Although she broke Hingis' serve twice in the final set, she
could not hold her own and folded in 78 minutes.
	   ``You can say she gave me a belated birthday present,'' said
Hingis, who turned 18 last week. ``I don't know what happened,
normally she has a very solid serve.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
stressed Wednesday that the alliance does not need U.N. backing to
launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying ``We are ready to
act.''
	   Despite Russian concern over a military action and Moscow's
likely veto of any U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force
against Yugoslavia, NATO officials reiterated that the alliance
already had all the legal backing it needed.
	   ``NATO will take a decision of their own,'' said Solana when
asked whether the alliance could act without the full backing of
the U.N. Security Council.
	   NATO will hold a special joint council with Russia on Friday to
push that point and stress that they share the ultimate objective
of bringing peace and humanitarian relief to the Yugoslav province.
	   ``We are ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   Solana will meet Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Brussels before hearing a report from the U.S. special
envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke.
	   Despite the lack of a clear U.N. resolution, the NATO allies are
coming closer to agreeing on the joint legal basis that will hold
up in international law, a NATO official said Wednesday.
	   ``We all agree that before we act, we will have a common
understanding of what the appropriate legal basis is,'' said a NATO
official, who demanded anonymity.
	   The official stressed military action would be able to withstand
any legal challenge.
	   ``If 16 democratic countries can come to the collective
agreement on a solid legal basis, it will hold up in international
law,'' the official said.
	   Meanwhile, the NATO member states are busy meeting
constitutional conditions in their individual countries to allow
participation in a joint NATO action.
	   Germany is currently going through a governmental transition
with the outgoing coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
remaining in a caretaker capacity.
	   In other nations, too, governments have to consult with
parliament and go through other procedures before an airstrike can
be officially approved. The NATO official said this was not going
to take more than a few days.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The 13-year-old boy sat watching
wide-eyed in the glare of television cameras, a mixture of shyness,
nerves and curiosity on his face. He was the youngest of 18
children allegedly recruited by Tamil Tiger guerrillas who
surrendered to government troops last week during a furious battle
in northern Sri Lanka that killed nearly 1,200 fighters.
	   On Wednesday, the military displayed 14 captured children _ four
of them girls _ to diplomats and journalists to support the
contention that guerrillas were deploying children in the war,
despite denials to the United Nations.
	   Dressed in bright sarongs and shirts, the girls in skirts and
blouses, they looked like normal children, except some suffered
light wounds from gunshots and shrapnel. They were the youngest
prisoners ever captured. The oldest was 17.
	   A few said they had fired guns at government troops during the
battle, but weren't sure if they had hit anyone.
	   ``The Tigers came to my school in March and took me and three of
my friends,'' said the boy from the northeastern town of
Mullaittivu. ``I cried later when they told me that I could not see
my family again.'' The military insisted the children not be
identified for fear of reprisals against relatives.
	   After two months' training, he was commissioned a fighter, given
a serial number, and assigned to a supply unit. Like most young
boys, he wanted to have his own gun, but the rebels said he was too
small to carry one.
	   He was also given a vial of cyanide to wear around his neck and
told to bite into to avoid capture. But when government troops
surrounded their unit near the town of Mankulam last week, the
youngsters gave themselves up rather than take the poison.
	   In May, Olara Ottunu, the U.N. Secretary General's Special
Representative on Children, won promises from the guerrillas and
from the government they would not use children. Human rights
groups have accused the Tigers for more than a decade of deploying
children in battle. The military is not known to have soldiers
under 18.
	   Some of the children said they had enlisted voluntarily to
escape the harsh life in rebel-controlled territory. One
14-year-old girl said she joined after listening to rebel
propaganda last December. She had been living in refugee camps
since 1995.
	   ``I can't go back now, because they (the rebels) will punish me.
I'd like to go to school in Colombo, and be a doctor someday,'' she
said.
	   Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon, the military's spokesman, said the
children will be put into rehabilitation programs, ``depending on
each child's individual needs,''
	   The military captured Mankulam on Sept. 29, two days after the
guerrillas took the nearby town of Kilinochchi, about 275
kilometers (170 miles) from Colombo, in some of the heaviest
fighting of the 15-year war.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military. More than 55,000 people have been
killed since 1983.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Import duties on several key foods will be dropped
and those on other foods and medicines may be lowered in an effort
to restock Russian store shelves emptied by the latest financial
crisis, the government said Wednesday.
	   As the ruble plunged and prices soared in recent weeks, Russians
rushed both to spend their money before it lost more value and to
stock up on non-perishable food and other consumer goods.
	   Almost half of all consumer goods sold in Russia are imported,
and their supplies have not yet returned to normal.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went on national television
Tuesday to assure Russians there would be no food shortages this
winter.
	   To accomplish this, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov
said Wednesday the government would soon lift import duties on five
basic foods, which he did not identify.
	   The government was discussing ``considerably reducing'' import
duties on other foods and medicines, the Interfax news agency
quoted his spokesman, Anton Surikov, as saying. Extra food will
also be bought from Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, he said.
	   Maslyukov said the new Russian government, in office for almost
a month, would present its proposals to revive the economy by the
end of October. Russian media have widely reported the proposals
will include Soviet-era economic controls such as nationalization
and currency controls, which the government denies.
	   Maslyukov said Russia plans broad cuts in taxes on businesses by
the end of the year in an effort to lure back foreign investors. He
told foreign business people the government would also review the
personal income tax scheme. The government's chronic inability to
collect taxes is one of the main reasons it lacks money.
	   Maslyukov said the government may have to resort to printing
more money, however, if the International Monetary Fund does not
release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that was
approved in July, a month before the economy crashed.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chief Viktor
Gerashchenko are in Washington this week meeting with IMF
officials.
	   ``So far, prospects for our cooperation with the international
financial organizations remain unclear, and that's why the
government hasn't made a decision yet on which financial and
economic plan it would implement to stabilize the situation,''
Maslyukov said at a meeting with western bankers, according to the
Russian news agencies.
	   The next installment of the loan would ``create conditions to
stop any talk about printing money,'' he said.
	   Also Wednesday, Maslyukov was given broad control over the
economy when he was put in charge of the economic and trade
ministries and various other bodies, including the committee for
state property management that oversees privatization.
	   Maslyukov, a Communist who was the last chairman of the Soviet
central planning agency, will also be acting prime minister
whenever Primakov is absent and will oversee talks with the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international
lenders, Russian media reported.
	   Primakov said he will retain personal control over the finance,
foreign, defense and interior ministries, as well as the tax
service and customs committee and several other agencies, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   Cabinet ministers will still be appointed to those ministries,
but their policies will be subject to final approval by Primakov,
and ultimately by President Boris Yeltsin.

Government considering giving out dlrs 8 billion in merchandise

coupons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Finance Ministry is looking into a proposal to
distribute more than 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.1 billion) in tax
rebates in the form of merchandise coupons to help Japan spend its
way out of recession.
	   ``Common steps cannot revive the economy. We should consider
what is uncommon,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a
parliamentary committee Wednesday.
	   He said he has directed his ministry to look into the proposal
by the Komei Party to stimulate personal spending, which accounts
for about 60 percent of gross domestic product, the nation's total
output of goods and services.
	   The coupons would amount to more than 10,000 yen (dlrs 81) for
each Japanese.
	   Miyazawa said the government is considering allowing local
governments to issue the coupons, with costs to be shouldered by
the central government.
	   He said the government also is considering plans to prevent
forgery of coupons. Finance Ministry bureaucrats had opposed such a
coupon plan, citing clerical difficulties.
	   The coupon plan could be incorporated into the government's
proposed economic rescue package of 10 trillion yen (dlrs 81
billion) in public spending and 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion) in
tax cuts.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa offered no new
proposals Wednesday to rescue Hong Kong from recession, but
promised in a policy address that the government is committed to
maintaining a free market economy and protecting the currency peg.
	   Tung painted a gloomy picture in his second annual address,
saying Hong Kong's ``difficult situation will continue well into
1999.''
	   He said the budget deficit may far exceed the June estimate of
20 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.56 billion) due to the
economic downturn, and the deficit may retard growth in government
expenditure in the next few years.
	   Hong Kong's economic recovery hinges on ``an improvement in the
external economic environment, a steadying of interest rates,
stability in property market and the restoration of public
confidence,'' he said.
	   The government's priority now is to stabilize property prices,
which have fallen 50 percent since last October, he added.
	   He announced the suspension of a subsidized middle-class housing
program in an attempt to boost the private market, but stopped
short of scrapping a housing construction target set last year,
which has been widely blamed for the property slump.
	   He also declined to disclose the government's plan when a
nine-month freeze on land sales expires next March.
	   Week's after Tung's inaugural policy address last year, Hong
Kong was swept into Asia's financial turmoil. The once-booming
economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   Analysts, economists and politicians gave his latest address a
lukewarm response. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which closed the
day 2.4 percent higher mainly on good news from Japan, rose only a
few points after his address, which hadn't finished when the market
closed.
	   ``There's nothing substantial,'' said Vanessa Yeung, head of
research at G.K. Goh Securities (HK) Ltd. ``These kinds of policies
will not help the economy in the short term.''
	   Political analyst Ivan Choy of City University said the address
would further hurt citizens' confidence in Tung, which has plunged
substantially with the economy.
	   Radio Television Hong Kong said that in a phone-in poll it
conducted after Tung's speech, 56 percent of the more than 3,700
respondents reported feeling less confident in Hong Kong's future,
while 31 percent said their confidence had increased.
	   ``He's so out of touch with the citizens' concern,'' Choy said,
referring to growing unemployment and pay cuts. To most people's
surprise, Tung largely ignored those issues in his speech.
	   ``He wasn't honest with the people when he diagnosed Hong Kong's
problems,'' Choy added.
	   Lawmaker Martin Lee, leader of the opposition Democratic Party,
Hong Kong's largest, said Tung ``lacks leadership, and his speech
lacked direction.'' About 30 members staged an overnight sit-in in
front of the legislature to protest Tung's policy blueprint.

Rwandan, Ugandan leaders meet on Congo, condemn Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Ugandan and Rwandan leaders have condemned
the alleged participation of Sudanese troops in the two-month
Congolese war and called for direct talks between the Congolese
rebels and President Laurent Kabila, according to a statement
released Wednesday.
	   After a day-long meeting Tuesday in southern Uganda, Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan vice president and minister
of defense Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said only direct negotiations
between Kabila and the rebels fighting to oust him could bring an
end to the conflict.
	   Kabila has accused both countries of sponsoring the rebellion
and has ruled out talks with the rebels.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have sent troops to back
Kabila. The rebels say more than 1,000 Sudanese troops are in the
fight on the government side as well; Sudan denies the claim.
	   ``Uganda and Rwanda strongly condemn the involvement of the
terrorist regime of the Sudan in the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and question the wisdom of any continued support
for the Kabila-Sudan alliance,'' Museveni and Kagame said in a
joint statement.
	   Uganda broke relations with Sudan several years ago over Ugandan
accusations that Sudan supports rebel groups fighting to topple
Museveni.
	   Sudan now claims Ugandan troops are fighting with the Sudan
People's Liberation Army in southern Sudan.
	   The two leaders met at Museveni's farm at Rwakitura, about 60
kilometers (37 miles) north of the Rwandan border.
	   Kagame once served in Museveni's rebel National Resistance Army
before joining the Rwandan Patriotic Front with other Rwandan Tutsi
refugees living in Uganda.
	   In October 1991, with Ugandan backing, the RPF invaded Rwanda.
Four years later, after the extremist Hutu government had
slaughtered half a million minority Tutsis, the RPF gained power
and stopped the genocide.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militiamen, fearing reprisals for the
genocide, escaped to Congo _ then Zaire. Rwandan-backed Congolese
rebels dislodged them from refugee camps in eastern Zaire in late
1996 and installed Kabila in power in May 1997.
	   Since then, relations between Kabila and Rwanda and Uganda have
been slowly deteriorating. Both countries accuse Kabila of failing
to prevent the remaining Hutu rebels as well as Ugandan rebels from
using eastern Congo as their rear base.
	   ``Rwanda continues to face insecurity caused by former Rwandan
Armed Forces and Interahamwe militia based in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and supported by the Kabila goverment,'' the
statement said. ``Rwanda reiterated its resolve to deal with the
above concerns using all appropriate means.''
	   Rwanda has repeatedly threatened to intervene openly in Congo
and accuses Kabila of training 10,000 Hutu militiamen to fight the
rebels trying to oust him.
	   Uganda said it will keep at least two batallions inside Congo to
protect its borders.
	   ``The military presence of Uganda in the Democratic Republic of
Congo is based on genuine and legitimate security interests and on
its determination to prevent genocide,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday heeded a request by a
conservative Catholic priest and banned an art book with the
picture of a topless woman on a crucifix on the cover.
	   The latest book to be banned in France, ``INRI,'' was ordered
off the shelves of three bookstores in Bordeaux, and the court
threatened a 500-franc (dlrs 90) fine for each infraction.
	   The book by Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly, which re-examines
iconography depicting the life of Jesus, angered Catholic priest
Philippe Laguerie, who requested the ban.
	   The decision by presiding Judge Louis Montamat, said the book's
cover, ``strongly shocks religious sentiment.''
	   French courts have banned a number of books in recent years,
most recently going so far as to block an author from even writing
an unauthorized biography of actor Alain Delon.
	   Courts have also barred the sale of a book by a former doctor of
the late President Francois Mitterrand that said the president lied
about his cancer condition while in office.

defeating Singapore by 121 runs Wednesday in 10-nation Asian
Cricket Council (ACC) trophy tournament being held in the Nepalese
capital.
	   Batting first, Bangladesh scored 279 for eight wickets. The
match started late because of poor light and it was reduced to 47
overs instead of 50 overs.
	   Bangladesh then bowled out Singapore for 158 runs.Zubin Shroff's
unbeaten knock of 73 propped up Singapore's innings. Aminul Islam
claimed three Singapore wickets for 23 runs.

than mere 18 they had scored against Hong Kong on Monday.
	   Chasing the United Arab Emirates' formidable total of 273 off
44.1 overs, Japan replied with 70 runs. Shahzad Altaf captured six
Japanese wickets for 13 runs.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Kuwait &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will need more than dlrs 6 billion to
boosts its oil production capacity to its pre-Gulf War level of 3.5
million barrels per day, a senior Iraqi oil official said.
	   Any such large-scale renovations would take at least six years
to complete, the official said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   He said, however, that it would cost about dlrs 1 billion to
raise Iraq's output from its current 2.5 million barrels per day to
3 million barrels per day.
	   He said the U.N-approved dlrs 300 million for repairs is barely
enough to sustain current production levels.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions against Iraq
following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has launched a dlrs 100 million
Eurobond issue which was quickly over-subscribed, newspapers
reported Wednesday.
	   The issue launched Tuesday in London brought the total value of
sovereign Eurobonds in a month to dlrs 450 million after a dlrs 350
million issue on Sept. 10.
	   Tuesday's issue, like the September issue, has an interest rate
of 8.75 percent with a seven-year maturity. Both were managed by
the U.S. investment firm Merril Lynch International.
	   The Daily Star newspaper Wednesday quoted State Minister for
Finance Fuad Saniora as saying 42 percent of the buyers Tuesday
were non-Lebanese.
	   The remaining Eurobonds were bought by Lebanese banks, the
English-language daily said.
	   The issues are part of a plan approved by Parliament to borrow
dlrs 2 billion to restructure part of the dlrs 14 billion national
debt.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co.
has hiked its production by 16.6 percent to 14,000 tons a day due
to increased local demand for fuel, the firm's acting
director-general said Wednesday.
	   Mohammad Khalifeh also said new equipment and production units
were acquired at a cost of dlrs 7 million to meet the increased
domestic demand for fuel oil.
	   He said further expansion is planned as demand is expected to
double by the year 2010.
	   Jordan uses 11,500 tons of oil each day during the summer.
Demand increases by 2,500 tons during the winter.
	   The kingdom has no known oil reserves. It imports all its crude
oil and some fuel oil from neighboring Iraq under a special deal
with the United Nations, which slapped crippling sanctions on
Baghdad following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The public sector is responsible for 70 percent of
Kuwait's gross domestic product, the governor of the Central Bank
of Kuwait said Wednesday.
	   The private sector contributes only 30 percent of gross domestic
product, The Kuwait News Agency quoted Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz
al-Sabah as saying.
	   ``It is supposed to be the other way round,'' he said.
	   Kuwait depends on crude oil sales for most of its revenues, and
all oil operations are managed and owned by the government.
	   Low oil prices are fueling a government drive for privatization.
	   Sheik Salem also said that Kuwait spends more than it earns, and
96 percent of its national work force is employed by the
government.
	   Kuwait's gross domestic product in 1997 was 9.2 billion dinars
(dlrs 29.47 billion), down 1 percent from the year before.
	   The oil-rich country estimates a net shortfall of 1.92 billion
dinars (dlrs 6.27 billion) in the current fiscal year that started
July 1.

Armenian foreign minister calls again for talks on
</HEADLINE>
Nagorno-Karabakh &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Armenia'a foreign minister called
Wednesday for new talks with Azerbaijan on the disputed Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, suggesting ``unconventional ways'' be
found to determine the region's status.
	   ``The beginning of negotiations depends primarily on the good
will of the participating parties,'' Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanian told reporters after talks with Austria's deputy foreign
minister, Albert Rohan. ``We must find a balance between the
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the rights of the Armenians
for self-determination.''
	   To that end, he said ``unconventional'' formulas must be found
and not the ``conventional slogans like autonomy or independence.''
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   In July, Armenia said it wanted a peace settlement in the
region, adding that both sides must understand ``the realities that
have emerged as the result of the war imposed on us by
Azerbaijan.''

Gov't reduces U.N. radio-broadcasting time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan government cut the United
Nations' broadcasting space on national radio Wednesday from three
hours to two, increasing tension between the peace monitors and the
ruling MPLA party.
	   Citing ``the country's highest interests'', RNA state radio
authorities axed the U.N.'s one-hour morning program ``The Paths of
Peace'' but allowed it to keep the afternoon and nighttime
editions.
	   The government was reportedly annoyed when the show recently
aired an interview with U.N. regional commander Bernard Gendre, who
criticized the conduct of the Angolan Armed Forces.
	   The U.N.'s special envoy to Angola Issa Diallo was reported to
be seeking to clarify the government's decision.
	   Diallo, who arrived in Angola late August, has been trying to
meet with Jonas Savimbi, leader of former rebel group UNITA, in one
of his highland strongholds where he retreated after 1992
elections.
	   The government has prevented the U.N. diplomat from traveling to
Andulo or Bailundo, some 480 kilometers (300 miles) east of the
capital, allegedly for security reasons.
	   The government halted contact with Savimbi a month ago and asked
the U.N. to follow suit.
	   But the U.N. Security Council called on the ruling MPLA party to
reverse its decision, reportedly angering President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos.
	   The U.N. has a peacekeeping force in Angola and a mediating
group which oversees implementation of the 1994 Lusaka protocol
that ended a two-decade civil war between UNITA and the government.
	   Four years on, the deal remains to be fully implemented and
hostility between the former foes is rising, edging the peace
process towards collapse.
	   The government estimates the number of people displaced because
of recent developments at nearly 800,000.

Prestigious prize hinges on an unclear word
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions
establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear
word and scratched out a few letters. Questions about the prize
have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since.
	   A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the
Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most
prestigious prize for writers.
	   The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital
and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question: Why
does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful
of people in a quiet and remote country? Does the Nobel Prize
really recognize the best?
	   When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary
Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look at the list of prizewinners!''
	   The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. On one hand, the
Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers such as Isaac
Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to light, such as
Wislawa Szymborska.
	   But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre, heaping
attention on those who would have been more fairly served by
obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901,
Sully Prudhomme.
	   That choice was denounced by Sweden's leading literary light,
August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo
Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not choosing him.
	   Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, considering
the instructions they were given. Nobel's will says the prize
should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal** is unclear and the
Academy's choices have reflected the confusion. The Academy has
chosen to interpret the word to apply to works ranging from the
good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crushing
hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writings.
	   When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk** _
he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one. Allen
was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a
forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were.
	   The expert succeeded _ to a point. He found that the first word
Nobel wrote was ``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist.
	   Despite the inclarity around the edges, Allen said he is
confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that
``literature would be the basis for some kind of progress.''
	   About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the
Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret.
	   But observers love to speculate on who might win, even who's on
the shortlist for the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor
(about dlrs 974,000).
	   Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S.
Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery,
and Jose Saramago of Portugal.

Rafter crashes out, defending champion Rusedski advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Rafter match, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 2 Patrick Rafter crashed out
in the first round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors on
Wednesday, toppled in straight sets by Czech Daniel Vacek.
	   The two-time U.S. Open champion surrendered 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to
Vacek, ranked 44, after an hour and a half of play.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' said Rafter, currently leading the race for
berths at the ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover next month.
``But that's often the case in indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No.1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces ...
quickly.''
	   Rafter, the winner of six titles this season, narrowly lost the
first set to Vacek, before taking a medical time-out so his
therapist could massage his left hip.
	   Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to
struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the
talent which led him to six titles this season.
	   Trailing 15-40 at 4-5 on his own serve, Rafter suddenly lit up,
rallying to score four consecutive points to save two match points.
	   Though Vacek failed to convert those first break points of the
match, he didn't waste a second opportunity.
	   The Czech held his own serve to go up 6-5, then blasted four
return winners to clinch the match on a love game.
	   ``Daniel kept serving as hard as possible,'' said Rafter, who
will next play in Vienna, Lyon, Stuttgart and Paris. ``I served
pretty well but I need to put more pressure on my opponents and
construct points better indoors.''
	   The 28-year-old Vacek, a doubles specialist still looking for
his first singles title, will face France's Fabrice Santoro in the
second round.
	   In other first round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defence of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier
Axel Pretzsch.
	   ``Hopefully I'll be successful here,'' said Rusedski, the losing
finalist in Toulouse last weekend. ``I like it here and I have a
record of nine wins and only one loss here.''
	   Ranked 14 in the world, Rusedski needed just 52 minutes to
steamroll past Pretzsch, who defeated veterans Niklas Kulti of
Sweden and Czech Martin Damm to qualify.
	   Holder of the fastest serve on the Tour, Rusedski used that
strength to stun the world number 311, blasting three consecutive
aces past Pretzsch in his opening serve.
	   Rusedski's return proved just as effective against the young,
shellshocked German, playing in his first career ATP Tour event.
	   While Pretzsch managed to hold his opening serve of the match,
the Briton easily broke him twice in each set on way to the second
round.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I played,'' said Rusedski,
returning to form after spending two months nursing his left ankle
after tearing ligaments at Queens in June. ``Everything is coming
together nicely.''
	   Rusedski will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil,
in the second round.
	   Later, world No. 1 Pete Sampras will play 1994 champion Wayne
Ferreira, and wildcard Boris Becker takes on Sweden's Thomas
Johansson.

German president's reportedly ready to step down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ President Roman Herzog has reportedly given
up seeking a second term next year after Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who nominated him for the job, lost the German election.
	   Herzog's retirement would clear the way for parliament to elect
a Social Democrat, Johannes Rau, to the mainly ceremonial post in
May, the Bonner Rundschau newspaper said Wednesday, citing
``reliable sources.''
	   The president's office refused comment on the report.
	   With the Social Democrats' victory in Sept. 27 elections, the
presidency is among the posts now within their power to decide.
	   Some Social Democrats say it's time for Germany's first female
president. They have suggested Jutta Limbach, chief justice of
Germany's supreme court. Others are proposing a candidate from
former communist East Germany, religion professor and former Social
Democrat lawmaker Richard Schroeder.
	   But Rau, 67, is considered the top contender. He governed
North-Rhine Westphalia, the nation's most populous state, for two
decades until making way for a younger successor last spring. The
way the Social Democrats eased him out fed speculation of a party
deal to put him in line for the presidency.
	   Herzog, a moderate conservative, was elected to a five-year term
in 1994 when Rau was also a contender. He had indicated he would
not seek re-election, but appeared to back off when Kohl's
Christian Democrats sought to benefit from his popularity during
this year's election campaign.
	   Nominally above politics, the German president is considered the
nation's conscience. He is elected by a session of both houses of
parliament.

Seven people killed in latest Algerian violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed assailants killed seven people and
wounded five others Wednesday in southwest Algeria in an attack
that radio reports described as a roadside ambush.
	   The killings, near Chlef, 220 kilometers (135 miles) southwest
of Algiers, were announced in a statement by the security forces.
But no details were given.
	   The radio reports cited locals as saying it was an ambush by
Islamic militants disguised as police officers. The reports said
the army had launched a hunt in the area for the killers.
	   The massacre came a day after army troops killed seven suspected
Islamic militants in the capital and western Algeria. Also Tuesday,
seven civilians were slain in the western town of Mascara.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the six-year insurgency
that flared after Algeria's military-backed government canceled
1992 parliamentary elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front
was on the verge of winning.

	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Being the Masters and British Open
champion, Mark O'Meara appeared the ideal player to partner
golf-loving Prince Andrew in the pro-am before the Dunhill Cup.
	   He had one problem. What to call his highness.
	   ``When I first met him I said: ``Hello, Prince Andrew, I'm Mark
O'Meara. I called him Andrew the rest of the day. I don't know if
that's right or wrong,'' O'Meara said after their round at the Old
Course, St. Andrews.
	   ``No? It was wrong? I'm sorry,'' the slightly embarrassed golf
star said. ``No disrespect intended. He didn't have a problem with
it. I call him Prince a few times so that makes up for it.''
	   John Daly, who teams up with O'Meara and Tiger Woods on a United
States team in the 16-nation championship at the home of golf, said
he wasn't flustered when he played golf with President Bush.
	   ``When I met George Bush or the first time, I said `Hi, George,
how ya doin?''' Daly said.
	   According to O'Meara, Prince Andrew, who bears a remarkable
likeness to former British Open champion Justin Leonard,
occasionally played like him too.
	   ``He played extremely well. I think he shot four over par,
playing off seven. That's what he told me. He was fun to play with.
It was quite an honor,'' O'Meara said.
	   ``I gave him my phone number in Orlando and said that if he
wanted to come and play at our development with Tiger and Payne
Stewart he can. If he comes to Florida we'd love to have a game
with him.
	   ``He said he's only played for six or seven years and he just
needs to work on his short game,'' O'Meara said. ``He has a good
back swing and down swing. He hits it long enough and he hit some
nice putts today. The short game is the thing.
	   ``One of our other other partners made 10 pars and two birdies.
I asked him what he was doing this week. He could take my spot on
the team.''

Switzerland protests verdict in Guatemala drug case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has made a protest to the
Guatemalan foreign minister over the conviction last month of three
Swiss men for drug trafficking, an official said Wednesday.
	   At a court in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, the three, along with a
German and a Guatemalan, were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison
in the so-called ``German connection'' case.
	   The case involved dlrs 100 million in shipments of cocaine sent
from Guatemala to Europe hidden in containers and ornamental
plants.
	   Swiss authorities have concluded that parts of the proceedings
``didn't meet legal requirements'' and are calling for information
on them, Armin Ritz of the Swiss foreign ministry said.
	   ``That means, in other words, that we don't agree with the
verdict,'' Ritz told a news conference.
	   A visit to Guatemala this month by a Swiss trade representative
has also been put on hold, he said.
	   Ritz said Guatemala's foreign minister, Eduardo Stein Barrillas,
received the Swiss representation on Tuesday and promised to answer
it as soon as possible.
	   Switzerland stressed that it fully supports Guatemala in
fighting drug trafficking, he added.
	   The Puerto Barrios court sentenced Swiss citizen and former
Nestle executive Andreas Haenggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison
and a fine of dlrs 77,000.
	   Nicholas Haenggi Chalandrian, 22, Andreas Haenggi's son, was
sentenced to 20 years and a dlrs 155,000 fine, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.
	   The following day, the Swiss foreign ministry called the
sentences ``extremely hard and disproportionate.''
	   The ``German connection'' scheme was uncovered in November 1996
when police in Duesseldorf, Germany, found 170 kilograms (375
pounds) of cocaine hidden in plastic bags in a shipment of
Guatemalan hammocks.
	   The defendants said they had been unwitting accomplices to the
scheme. Defense lawyers said they would appeal the verdict.
	   Nestle, which has always supported Haenggi since his arrest, has
said it will continue to provide support to Haenggi and his family
during the appeal process.
	   Last week, a defense lawyer in Guatemala for the three Swiss men
accused the judge handling the case of sexually harassing her and
threatening her with death.

crumbling economy. He warned the politicians against

Radio Free Iraq gets green light but may have to move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech government allowed Radio
Free Europe broadcasts into Iraq on Wednesday, but insisted the
station's location should change to avoid security risks.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. government-funded radio station,
which operates out of Prague, announced plans to expand its
broadcasts into Iran and Iraq.
	   The move met with concerns by the Czech Cabinet, which protested
the station's location in a densely populated residential area in
northern Prague.
	   ``The government agrees with the RFE broadcasts (into Iraq) on
condition that due to security risks involved the station's
location be reviewed with the respective Czech authorities,'' vice
premier Vladimir Spidla said Wednesday.
	   He said consultations about a new location were already underway
but offered no details.
	   ``We think the present location is not a suitable one,'' Spidla
said.
	   The Farsi-language service into Iran was already approved by the
Czech government, but it wasn't clear wheter the two stations would
move together or separately.
	   ``Broadcasting into Iran was not on the agenda today,'' said
Spidla.
	   During the Cold War, RFE was popular among Czechs and others in
the Soviet bloc as an alternative to the Communist propaganda of
their own media. Now, however, many ordinary Czechs are nervous
that their country may end up being drawn into the conflict if the
Iranian and Iraqi programs go on the air.
	   RFE began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading
uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron
Curtain during the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following the
collapse of communism six years earlier and began broadcasting out
of a prominent downtown building that once served as Parliament of
federal Czechoslovakia.
	   The Iraq and Iran broadcasts were planned out of a residential
area in northern Prague in close proximity to a nursery school and
several embassies.

Hingis overcomes scare against Kournikova, Davenport wins too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Davenport beating Pierce &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Martina Hingis survived a scare
against Anna Kournikova at the Porsche Grand Prix on Wednesday and
held on to her No. 1 ranking _ at least temporarily.
	   But Lindsay Davenport, who trails Hingis by 26 points, stayed in
hot pursuit by dismissing Mary Pierce 6-1, 6-3 in another
second-round match.
	   Hingis, who has held the top ranking for 80 weeks, rallied to
win 1-6, 6-2, 6-2, benefiting from Kournikova's 13 double-faults.
	   ``I jammed my ankle in jogging this morning and for the first
three games I couldn't see anything because I forgot to put in my
contact lenses,'' Hingis said.
	   ``But after I warmed up the ankle got better, I got the lenses
and I got into the match,'' the 18-year-old Swiss said.
	   Hingis, winner of the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament the last
two years, could clinch her third title in a row and still lose the
top ranking to Davenport, the U.S. Open champion.
	   Whether Davenport can claim the No. 1 spot will depend on how
many bonus points she can earn by beating high-ranked players.
	   Had she lost to Kournikova, Hingis would have lost the No. 1
ranking.
	   Kournikova, the 13-ranked, 17-year-old Russian who had beaten
Hingis in the fin set, she
could not hold her own and folded in 78 minutes.
	   ``You can say she gave me a belated birthday present,'' said
Hingis, who turned 18 last week. ``I don't know what happened,
normally she has a very solid serve.''
	   If she loses the No. 1 ranking this week, Hingis could regain it
next week in Zurich.
	   Davenport cruised against Pierce, who was treated for blisters
on her left foot after the third game. The American needed only 61
minutes for her victory.

Russia fears airstrikes could lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with conflicting reports about contact
group meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia pushed Wednesday for a meeting of the
six-country Contact Group on Yugoslavia, and warned that NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia would only lead to more bloodshed in
Kosovo province.
	   The Interfax news agency said Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov made
an ``emergency departure'' to London for a meeting of the Contact
Group of Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France and
Italy.
	   But the British Foreign Office said no meeting had been
scheduled for this week, and the Russian Foreign Ministry said no
decision had been made on Ivanov's plans.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO airstrikes
against Serbia, the main component of Yugoslavia, would be like a
declaration of war.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Sergeyev said in Athens
after meeting with his Greek counterpart.
	   ``We believe diplomatic efforts must continue, and in these
efforts the whole of the European community must be involved,'' he
said.
	   Russia objects to the violent methods Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used to crack down on separatist Kosovo, but
it opposes NATO airstrikes. Russia and Serbia are long-time allies,
sharing a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has been trying to drum up support in
phone calls this week to other world leaders. On Wednesday he spoke
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is visiting China.
	   Yeltsin told Blair that airstrikes ``would be disastrous for
global peace and drastically change the situation'' in the region,
a Kremlin statement said.
	   Also Wednesday, leaders of the State Duma, Russia's lower house
of parliament, said they wanted to meet with Moscow-based
ambassadors of NATO countries to discuss Kosovo.

Alistair Cooke given language accolade by radio listeners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alistair Cooke, whose ``Letter from America''
began airing on British radio more than a half-century ago, has
been honored for his perfect use of language.
	   Cooke was overwhelmingly voted Best Living Speaker of the
English Language by listeners of BBC Radio 4's ``Word of Mouth''
program.
	   ``I love broadcasting and try to write a form of English which
can be, as the Bible says, `understanded of the people,' meaning
truckdrivers, professors, bishops, nurses, people everywhere,''
Cooke said.
	   ``The greatest compliment I can be paid is when people say `You
sound exactly the way you sound over the radio,' '' he said.
	   Cooke, 89, has presented his weekly window on life in the United
States since 1947.
	   Asked how his years living in the United States have affected
his speech, he said: ``My wife always says that I don't speak
British English. I don't speak American English _ I speak like a
child sent at an early age to school in Switzerland.''
	   Cooke's linguistic pet peeve _ people's ``refusal to speak the
most frequently spoken vowel in the English language, `uh' '' _ as
in the ``a'' in ``ago.''
	   ``Americans have got into the habit of saying `ay,' '' he said.
``That drives me nuts, and I write to them when I hear it.''

Dollar down, gold up

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late rates, expands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against most other
major currencies in late European trading Wednesday as dealers
began to regain faith in the Japanese yen, analysts said. Gold
prices rose.
	   ``There has been talk of new fiscal measures in Japan, as well
as a feeling that the Japanese may be able to pass new banking
reform laws. Those two things combined to encourage a large buyback
of yen,'' said Jonathan Griggs, a currency analyst for Barings Plc
in London.
	   ``That resulted in dragging the dollar down not only against the
yen but against all currencies,'' he said.
	   Analysts said the dollar also suffered against the German mark
and other European currencies as expectations fell for interest
rate cuts across Europe. Lower interest rates can weaken a currency
by making it less attractive to investors.
	   Dollar rates compared with late Tuesday:
	   _1.6168 German marks, down from 1.6419.
	   _124.25 Japanese yen, down from 132.58.
	   _1.3220 Swiss francs, down from 1.3520.
	   _5.4213 French francs, down from 5.5061.
	   _1.8227 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8515.
	   _1,597.90 Italian lire, down from 1,623.
	   _1.5290 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5470.
	   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.6926, up from dlrs
1.6843.
	   Gold closed in London at dlrs 298.50 bid per troy ounce, up from
the closing price of dlrs 295.40 bid Tuesday.
	   In Zurich gold traded at dlrs 298.50, up from dlrs 294.70.
	   Gold fell dlrs 0.70 in Hong Kong to dlrs 298.35.
	   Silver closed in London at dlrs 5.10 bid per troy ounce, up from
dlrs 5.09 bid Tuesday.

Vieira charged with misconduct after Wednesday clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was charged with
misconduct Wednesday after the Football Association reviewed a
clash between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on
Sept. 26.
	   The match was marred by a brawl between players which led to
Wednesday's Italian striker Paolo Di Canio pushing referee Paul
Alcock to the ground.
	   Di Canio pushed Alcock after he was given a red card for his
part in the brawl but later accused the referee of taking a dive.
	   The Italian striker was immediately suspended by Sheffield
Wednesday and returned to Italy pending the Football Association
investigation.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also red-carded by Alcock after the
incident but won an appeal Wednesday and had a three match ban
lifted.
	   The Football Association accepted Keown's claim that his
intention was to act as a peacemaker in the incident when Di Canio
confronted Vieira.
	   An F.A. statement released Wednesday said the sending off would
stand but Keown would not be punished further.
	   Vieira, however, was charged with inciting Sheffield Wednesday
supporters by making gestures as he left the field after the match
and of pushing a police officer at the entrance of the players'
tunnel.
	   Vieira, who has the full backing of Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger,
has 14 days to request a hearing.
	   ``I was right behind Patrick in the tunnel and I saw what
happened _ nothing at all,'' Wenger was quoted saying last week.

Court bans art book with topless woman on crucifix

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday slapped the country's
latest book ban on an art publication with the picture of a topless
woman on a crucifix on the cover, co-produced by a photographer for
President Jacques Chirac.
	   Heeding a request by a conservative Catholic priest, the court
ordered the book ``INRI'' was ordered off the shelves of three
bookstores in Bordeaux, and the court threatened a 500-franc (dlrs
90) fine for each infraction.
	   The book by Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly re-examines
iconography depicting the life of Jesus. Rheims, a popular
shock-art photographer and celebrity portrait artist, shot the
official picture of Chirac that hangs in government buildings
across France.
	   But Catholic priest Philippe Laguerie found the book's cover
iconoclastic, and Presiding Judge Louis Montamat agreed, ruling
that the cover, ``strongly shocks religious sentiment.''
	   French courts have banned a number of books in recent years,
most recently going so far as to block an author from even writing
an unauthorized biography of actor Alain Delon.
	   The director of the FNAC department store in Bordeaux, Jean
Benoit Cazenave, said the 390-franc (dlr 70) book published by
Albin-Michel benefitted from the media coverage since it went on
sale Friday and was already sold out.
	   ``FNAC hopes to get the decision suspended,'' he said in a
telephone interview. The company, he said, allows any book that
doesn't include racial hatred, violence or pornography. ``This book
doesn't belong to any of those categories.''
	   Courts have also barred the sale of a book by a former doctor of
the late President Francois Mitterrand that said the president lied
about his cancer condition while in office.
	   The order was circumvented when the book was placed on the
Internet.
	   Rheims, a former model, has become one of France's biggest
contemporary photographers. Her work includes portraits of
Elizabeth Hurley, Mickey Rourke, Johnny Depp and Liv Tyler as well
as transexuals and strip tease artists. She's also produced TV ads,
movie posters and music videos.

Russians finally speak out in protest against economy, Yeltsin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Empty pockets and anger over the failure of Boris
Yeltsin's government to end years of economic malaise drove
hundreds of thousands of Russians to nationwide protests Wednesday,
but disillusionment and pragmatism kept many more away.
	   Miners, monarchists, students and business people took to the
streets from Moscow to Vladivostok in the first major public
protest since an economic crisis hit in August, but the peaceful
demonstrations fell far short of organizers' predictions they would
be the biggest anti-Yeltsin protest ever.
	   Many Russians eschew politics for reasons ranging from apathy
after decades of Soviet authoritarianism to a traditional Russian
fatalism that people have to make the best of things. Others
shunned the protests because of fear of violence or their
association with the Communists, who have the support of about 20
percent of the population.
	   ``We've got to work, to make money. I don't have time for
this,'' said Natasha Krasikova, a salesclerk in the GUM department
store adjacent to Red Square, where tens of thousands of Muscovites
rallied.
	   ``The only people who go to these protests are the ones who
don't have anything to do with themselves.''
	   The peaceful protests, organized by trade unions and the
powerful Communist Party, appeared to create little momentum for
serious change in the world's largest country.
	   ``These sorts of protests are not the road to revolution,'' said
Sergei Tuchin, 49, an unemployed writer in Moscow who did not take
part because he doubted they would make a difference.
	   While the demonstrations were spurred by the latest crisis,
which has seen the ruble plummet, the markets collapse and
inflation soar, most marchers were protesting over months,
sometimes years, of unpaid salaries and pensions.
	   ``We will not allow Yeltsin to destroy us,'' national trade
union leader Mikhail Shmakov said in Moscow. ``We want a president
who solves the concrete problems of the country and doesn't make
empty promises.''
	   The Communists often wildly overestimate turnout predictions for
such actions. They forecast as many as 40 million of Russia's 148
million people would take part, while the government said just
615,000 people showed up in demonstrations in 494 cities.
	   That was less than a third of the last big nationwide protest,
which drew about 2 million in March 1997.
	   At Moscow's rally, organizers claimed some 400,000 people
marched in a nippy but sunny fall day, but the motley crowd
appeared closer to 30,000. Among the marchers were hard-line
Stalinist and fascist groups, non-political trade unions _
including the stock exchange dealers union _ and bands of young
people making fun of old Communist protesters. Riot police looked
on.
	   Many of the marchers were elderly, with few young people taking
part.
	   Organizers said they were pleased with the response, noting that
the protest was not limited to public rallies, but also included
union meetings, work stoppages and strikes throughout the country.
	   There were no reports of significant disruption to public
services.
	   The protesters were united in their frustration but differed
widely in their specific remedies. Some carried photos of Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin, while others hoisted flags from Russia's
czarist era.
	   The unions focused on the economy. Millions of workers get paid
months late, and inflation for the year is forecast at 200 percent.
	   The Communists, meanwhile, have been calling for Yeltsin's
resignation and see the protests as a way to further weaken the
president, who still has two years left in his term.
	   Some trade unions did not want to be linked to the Communists.
Aides to Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, said the unions blocked
him from addressing the Moscow protest.
	   Yeltsin said he was pleased that the protests were peaceful, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Fear kept some people home Wednesday, because the Communists'
rhetorical buildup to the protest had many expecting violence. Some
Western companies closed early, and traffic was light on Moscow's
usually clogged streets.
	   Thousands of police and security troops were mobilized.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ John Whitaker on chestnut Virtual Village Heyman won
the first test of the individual show-jumping event at the World
Equestrian Games Wednesday and led Britain atop the team
competition provisional standings.
	   Simon Hugo of Austria was second on E.T. and Brazilian Nelson
Pessoa on Gandini Baloubet du Rouet finished third.
	   Whitaker's time was 83.11 seconds, compared to Hugo's 84.69 and
Pessoa's 87.61.
	   The speed test is the show-jumping first competition, and its
results count in both the individual and team standings. It is a
time trial where fences and obstacles knocked down are converted
into time and added to a rider's round.
	   The U.S. best rider was Nona Garson, on chestnut Loro Piana
Rhythmical, who placed 11th with 91.44 seconds. Fellow American
Anne Kursinski, riding chestnut Eros, finished 12th, with 92.64.
	   The individual show-jumping ends Sunday, with a spectacular
final test where four finalists engage in a direct confrontation
mounting each other's horses.
	   On the teams' side, Britain's, with 10.82 penalties, heads the
standings going into Thursday's team finals, followed by France,
with 14.61 penalties, and United States, which totaled 16.41.
	   The powerful German team, which aimed for gold after its
victories at both the 1994 World Games in The Hague and 1996
Atlanta Olympics, finished fourth ahead of Brazil.
	   The show-jumping event was held at the refurbished Flaminio
stadium downtown the capital.

Closing of Oslo's Fornebu Airport brings mixed emotions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAERUM, Norway (AP) _ Airports don't usually inspire affection,
but Oslo's Fornebu international airport wasn't like most. When it
closed Wednesday, some people mourned the loss of an old friend.
	   ``Our beloved Fornebu. Just 59 years old, and torn away from us.
You will be deeply missed,'' read the ribbon on a mourning wreath
placed in the departure hall.
	   ``I just had to come say good-bye to Fornebu. This is so sad,''
said 66-year-old Synnoeve Haavig, who worked at a nearby hotel for
25 years. ``Fornebu meant so much to me,'' she said as she knelt to
take a photo of the wreath.
	   Fornebu's charms included its setting, with a view over the Oslo
Fjord; its location just a 15-minute cab ride from the center of
the Norwegian capital; and its size _ cozy in comparison to the
multi-terminal behemoths that bewilder passengers' brains and
exhaust their legs.
	   But its small size couldn't keep pace with the growing needs of
the region, so a new airport was built at Gardermoen, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) north of Oslo.
	   The mourning wasn't unanimous. Many people were gleeful that jet
airliners would finally stop thundering over their backyards and
the idyllic islands that dot the fjord.
	   Knut Christiansen, 81, has lived on an island near the end of
the one runway since 1950, so close he can see passengers waving at
him from the planes. On Wednesday, after 48 years of deafening
takeoffs, he was celebrating the silence by ``just listening.''
	   Other nearby residents were holding outdoor celebrations, at
last able to hear the noise of their own parties.
	   Airports have stirred intense emotions in Norway for almost half
a century. It took more than 30 years of heated debate, decisions,
and reversals over a building site before Parliament finally picked
Gardermoen on Oct. 8, 1992.
	   Few question that Fornebu, already pressed to handle its 11
million passengers a year, was too small to handle air traffic that
has tripled in 28 years. Gardermoen is designed for 17 million
passengers annually, and can handle the jumbo jets that were too
big for Fornebu.
	   Fornebu opened in June 1939, tragically convenient for Nazi
troops arriving to occupy Norway less than a year later in World
War II. After nearly six decades of expansion, makeshift
modifications and wear, it is cramped, complicated and a little
shabby.
	   But some say it had charm, and the airport in the suburb of
Baerum was convenient, just 15 minutes by cab from downtown Oslo.
The trip to Gardermoen will be much longer, by car over congested
roads or by a high-speed train.
	   At 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), the last airliner was to take off from
Fornebu, a packed SAS flight to Bergen. Afterwards, in a final
salute to Fornebu, air traffic controllers would turn runway lights
up to their brightest setting, and then slowly dim them until they
vanish.
	   That would also mark the start of a hectic, all-night dash by
hundreds of trucks moving everything from Fornebu to Gardermoren,
which is to open 12 hours later.
	   The closing operations, including sales by airport shops, were
complicated because Braathens airline, Norway's major domestic
carrier, being grounded by a pilots strike over terms of their move
to Gardermoen.
	   In its final hours, the old airport was a whirlwind of confused
passengers seeking alternative flights, moving crews carting
equipment, shop clerks packing, shoppers seeking bargains,
well-wishers bidding farewell and a few sad employees.
	   ``I started work here in 1963, so my whole life has been here at
Fornebu,'' Sissel Mustand, of SAS, was quoted as telling the
Norwegian news agency NTB. ``One of my colleagues summed up what
many of us feel today in one word: sorrow.''

Canadian players Stephane Morin dies at rink side

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Canadian ice hockey player Stephane
Morin collapsed during a German league game and died, apparently of
a heart problem, his club Berlin Capitals said Wednesday.
	   Morin, 29, left the ice early in the second period complaining
that he was feeling ill late Tuesday. Shortly afterward, the
forward collapsed unconscious in the team's box, apparently from a
heart attack, Berlin Capitals spokesman Peter Harbig said.
	   Doctors on the scene tried to revive Morin but were
unsuccessful. He was taken to a hospital where doctors pronounced
him dead.
	   The Berlin team's physician, Thorsten Dolla, said Morin had been
examined two months ago and was pronounced healthy. Later, it was
discovered that Morin periodically suffered from asthma symptoms,
although he had no acute problems, Dolla said.
	   Dolla said doctors would perform an autopsy. A police spokesman
in Oberhausen, the town where Morin died, said his death could have
been the consequence of a heart attack that went undetected a few
years earlier. Morin also suffered from chronic bronchitis, he
said.
	   Morin had scored the final of three goals for the Capitals in
the first period of their game at Revier Lions in Oberhausen, in
the Ruhr Valley.
	   The game was stopped after Morin's collapse.
	   Morin, who had played for Quebec Nordiques and Vancouver Canucks
in the NHL, was born in Montreal. He also had played in the AHL and
IHL.
	   He is survived by his wife Karen and son Frederick, 2.
	   The club will turn all television earnings for the fatal game to
Morin's widow, and will also play a charity game to raise money for
the family.
	   Morin is the second Canadian ice hockey player to die in Germany
this year.
	   Mark Teevens died in April of a long embolism while watching his
Bad Neuheim team play a game.
	   Three German athletes also have died suddenly this year _
bobsled driver Lars Bolte, soccer player Axel Jueptner and shot
putter Ralf Reichenbach.

Turkish Premier says Syria waging indirect war on Turkey

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday
accused Damascus of waging an indirect war against Turkey by
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels and said the ``time has come to
end the dark games of Syria.''
	   Syria denies sheltering rebels, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has
raised fears of a regional conflict.
	   ``We are not trying to spark a war,'' Yilmaz told Parliament.
``But we (the government) are determined if necessary to ask the
Parliament's consent'' for possible use of force.''
	   Yilmaz said the Cabinet decided earlier in the day to take all
necessary dissuasive measures against Syria if it maintains its
support to Kurdish rebels, fighting autonomy within Turkey.
	   ``Through its support to the terrorists, Syria is waging an
indirect war against Turkey,'' he said.
	   Yilmaz's address to the Parliament came a day after Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak held talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel in Ankara to seek a peaceful solution.
	   ``Mubarak has inspired us to give a last chance to diplomacy,''
Yilmaz said. ``The steps which Syria will be taking carry great
importance in ending the tension.''
	   Yilmaz said Ankara was demanding the extradition of the rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey, and an end to Syria's financial
and logistics support.
	   Turkey also contends the rebels run training camps in the Syrian
controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.
	   Mubarak, who was given a dossier containing documents allegedly
verifying Syria's backing for the rebels, flew directly to Damascus
from Ankara on Tuesday and met with Syrian President Hafez Assad
for a second time in a week.
	   ``We are pursuing quiet diplomacy and hope that (official)
statements would not be sharp but would try to ease tension,''
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters on Wednesday.
``Goodwill must prevail in the relations between the two
countries.''

150 stowaways caught in Israeli port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli port authorities caught 150 stowaways
Wednesday, mostly from Moldova, who had traveled to Israel aboard a
cruise ship in search of jobs, police said.
	   Police spokesman Moshe Nisson said authorities at the northern
Mediterranean port city of Haifa became suspicious after the names
of 150 passengers were listed as having disembarked in Cyprus.
Authorities searched the vessel and found the group hiding in a
dining room below the ship's engine room.
	   Nisson said most of the 150 were from the former Soviet republic
of Moldova and were hoping to work illegally in Israel. The ship's
captain was questioned by police.
	   The cruise ship, named the Dimitri Chestakovch, departed from
the Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine and stopped in Greece and
Cyprus before reaching Haifa.
	   Usually about 10 to 15 passengers on each voyage try to remain
in Israel after their tourist visas expire, Nisson said. However,
stowaways are rare and never have so many tried to sneak in at one
time, he said.
	   The group was not allowed to leave the ship and will remain on
board until it departs again Thursday.

Iraq says responding to U.S. bid to topple Saddam is treason
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Taking part in a U.S. bid to overthrow the
Baghdad regime is tantamount to ``high treason,'' the Iraqi
Parliament says.
	   The National Assembly, or Parliament, urged Iraqi dissidents,
including Kurdish rebels in the north of the country, not to help
the United States in its efforts to topple the government of
President Saddam Hussein.
	   The Parliament statement was carried by the official al-Iraq
newspaper on Wednesday.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives voted Monday to direct the
Pentagon to channel up to dlrs 97 million in overt military aid to
Iraqi rebel groups that seek to bring down the government.
	   ``Any cooperation with this conspiracy... cannot be but high
treason against the homeland, the people and (the country's) safety
and territorial integrity,'' the Iraqi Parliament said.
	   ``The assembly wishes that no Iraqi will fall in the abyss of
treason,'' it added.
	   The U.S. bill, if approved by President Bill Clinton, will
signal, for the first time, direct involvement by the United States
in actions aimed at overthrowing Saddam.
	   Iraq's opposition groups abroad are in disarray and many would
not like to be seen as backed by the United States.
	   A top Iraqi opposition leader, Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir
al-Hakim, has dismissed the U.S. bid to topple the Baghdad regime.
	   Hakim said Tuesday that he would not commit his group, the
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, to any
U.S.-backed plans to oust the Iraqi leader.

Airport employees arrested in thefts from international mail

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police have arrested 11 employees of
Sofia airport who are suspected of regularly stealing valuables
from international mail, the Ministry of Interior announced
Wednesday.
	   The arrests were made Tuesday, a ministry statement said.
	   A private TV station on Wednesday showed footage of the
detainees lying on the ground with hands cuffed on their backs as
well as part of the stolen commodities, including money, jewels,
watches, video-cameras and hi-fi equipment.
	   The suspects allegedly unsealed letters and parcels destined to
Sofia or other airports, the statement said.
	   ``Until mid-1998, 2,500 valuable shipments, more than 10,000
ordinary shipments and more than 6,000 parcels have been robbed in
the international mail service of Sofia airport ,'' it said.
	   Police searching suspects' homes reportedly found unspecified
amount of foreign currency, valuables and mail destined for other
recipients.
	   Crime has risen sharply in Bulgaria after the end of communism
in 1989.

Germany's incoming government warns of looming budget deficit

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said
Wednesday he plans no major tax increases despite a huge budget gap
he says he is inheriting from the outgoing government.
	   ``We're not talking about tax hikes in this economic
situation,'' he said following talks with his intended coalition
partner, the Greens. ``We're saying that we especially want tax
relief for workers _ and will do it.''
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats went into Wednesday's talks arguing
with the Greens over which taxes to cut and which to raise to
combat unemployment _ which they declared their No. 1 goal.
	   The environmentalist Greens say across-the-board increases in
energy taxes would not only encourage conservation, but also spur
the economy through ``ecological innovation'' and help pay for
other job creation measures.
	   Schroeder, though, has ruled out any big jump in gasoline taxes,
which he says would hurt the country's powerful auto industry. His
party favors closing tax loopholes and other measures aimed more at
the rich.
	   Both sides said after the talks that they agreed on programs for
fighting unemployment, but put debate over how to pay for them off
until Thursday's session.
	   ``Tomorrow will be more difficult, when we expand on the
framework we agreed on today,'' Greens leader Joschka Fischer said.
	   Although Schroeder needs the 47 Green lawmakers to form a
majority in the 669-seat parliament, he indicated he would not bend
over backwards to accommodate their energy tax demands.
	   ``Each side knows the other's central points,'' he said. ``But
the different strengths of the two parties will also influence the
extent of what they can expect to accomplish.''
	   Budget experts from both parties on Tuesday said their review of
accounts found revenues next year will be 20 billion marks (dlrs 12
billion) less than calculated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government.
	   Another 20 billion marks is at risk in the coming years due to
over-generous economic growth forecasts, they added.
	   Kohl's government denied there was any gap in the 1999 budget
presented by Finance Minister Theo Waigel last month and accused
the incoming coalition of trying to deceive voters.
	   ``This is an invention of the future `red-green' coalition to
conceal their policies of planned tax hikes and to divert attention
from frivolous campaign promises,'' said Adolf Roth, Kohl's budget
spokesman in parliament.
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end.
	   Schroeder and Fischer, considered the front-runner to become his
foreign minister, leave Thursday for a two-day visit to Washington,
where they will lunch with President Bill Clinton and meet with the
head of the World Bank.

Plants can remove gold from ore, might be useful for mining

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have found a way to make plants soak
up gold from ore, suggesting a new way of mining the precious
metal.
	   This approach, called phytomining, has been demonstrated before
for recovering nickel. Scientists have also studied plants for
removing pollutants like lead from soil; just last month,
researchers said hybrid poplar trees might be useful for soaking up
mercury.
	   Some plants naturally soak up very tiny amounts of gold. The new
work was aimed at getting higher, commercially useful yields.
	   Indian mustard plants that grew in pots of ore for a week were
harvested and dried, and analysis showed they contained gold at up
to about 20 parts per million by weight. The yield was higher when
they grew in sand mixed with gold. Other plants, including chicory,
also soaked up gold.
	   The key was using a chemical called ammonium thiocyanate to make
the metal soluble in the soil, said Christopher W.N. Anderson,
Robert R. Brooks and colleagues at Massey University in Palmerston
North, New Zealand. They reported their findings in Thursday's
issue of the journal Nature.
	   The approach suggests that fields of crops could be used to
extract gold from ore or mine waste.
	   However, David E. Salt of Northern Arizona University, who has
studied the use of plants to remove lead from soil, said his
informal calculations suggest the approach would not make economic
sense unless the plants soaked up much more gold.
	   ``I think it's premature to talk about making money out of it,''
Salt said.
	   John Turney, manager for metallurgy at the Homestake Mining Co.
in San Francisco, agreed that the idea doesn't appear economically
viable now. He also said companies are prohibited from spreading
ammonium thiocyanate on the ground because of the potential
environmental harm.

Ukraine's central bank closes down six commercial banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank decided to close six
small commercial banks and to limit the operations of four others,
a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The National Bank ordered the Krym-Yurt, Ukrkharchoprombank,
Servis, Zorya, Krymkredit and Zavodbank banks closed and said
commissions would start working on wrapping up their business on
Thursday, Interfax said.
	   The central bank said that Krym-Yurt, Ukrkharchoprombank and
Servis have not implemented the required measures to stabilize
their financial situation, while Krymkredit and Zorya lacked the
necessary capital.
	   The National Bank also put Zakhidinvestbank, Donuglekombank,
Azov-Bank and Interkontbank onto a special ``financial
rehabilitation regime'' that limits their operations.
	   Some 219 commercial banks are registered in Ukraine, of which
185 remain operational, Interfax said.

Ethnic Albanian rival leaders meet, pledge unity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Politicians from rival Kosovo ethnic
Albanian camps met Wednesday in an apparent attempt to form a
united front in their struggle to achieve independence from Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, a leading politician among the pacifists, and Adem
Demaci, the political representative of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, both called for a NATO intervention in Kosovo.
	   ``Military strikes against the military-police machinery of the
criminal Serb regime is necessary,'' the two said in a statement.
Agani is a close aide to Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader
advocating a peaceful struggle for independence.
	   Demaci represents the militants, who have been fighting Serb-led
Yugoslav security forces for eight months and are also demanding
that Kosovo break away from Serbia and Yugoslavia, which also
includes Montenegro.
	   ``Agani and Demaci agreed that there are many more common points
uniting them than differences that exist between them,'' said a
statement by the two. They pledged unity.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway was mobilizing jet fighters for a
possible NATO strikes in Kosovo on Wednesday, while the foreign
ministery urged the country's nationals to get out of Yugoslavia.
	   The Norwegian Supreme Defense Command ordered the air force's
338th Squadron to call all personnel necessary to fly and maintain
the eight F-16 fighters the small NATO country has pledged to the
alliance by Oct. 18.
	   NATO has yet to decide whether the launch a military strike
against Serb positions in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to
prevent further massacres of ethnic Albanians. NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana on Wednesday said the alliance was
ready to act, even without U.N. Security Council backing.
	   Arvid Loevbukten, commander of the Oerland Air Base where the
338th is stationed, said the 230-member squadron would be ready by
Oct. 18, as promised.
	   ``The force would be used to monitor a no-fly zone down there,''
he said. ``But it would be up to whoever was in charge down there
to decide what to use the planes for.''

Scientists find why cranberries prevent urinary infections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT. (2100 GMT) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists believe they have figured out why
cranberry juice helps prevent urinary infections.
	   The secret, it seems, is concentrated tannins in the juice, also
known as proanthocyanidins.
	   Urinary infections are a common problem, especially among women,
and research has shown that drinking cranberry juice regularly can
help prevent them.
	   Amy B. Howell and others from Rutgers University conducted
experiments to understand exactly what in cranberry juice does
this. The study was financed by Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and
published as a letter in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   The test tube studies found that the concentrated tannins from
cranberry juice prevent E. coli bacteria, the main culprit in
urinary infections, from adhering to the cells that line the
urinary tract.
	   The scientists believe that the substance blocks the growth of
the part of the bacteria that is necessary for them to stick to the
walls of the bladder and kidney, a crucial step in infection.
	   Blueberries also contain the concentrated tannins. But many
other foods tested, including lemons, oranges, applies, bananas and
carrots, do not.

Official: Ukraine's energy sector desperately lacks cash to survive
</HEADLINE>
winter &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's power plants, owed tremendous
sums by consumers, are desperately short of cash to buy enough fuel
to provide electricity for the approaching winter, a top government
official said Wednesday.
	   ``Our financial situation has worsened drastically, and we will
have to fight for survival every day if nothing is changed,''
Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov said.
	   He said consumer debts to power plants and energy companies for
electricity has been rising steadily for months. The total grew by
200 million hryvna (dlrs 59 million) in September alone and reached
3.85 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) on Oct. 1.
	   Many Ukrainian companies are strapped for cash as a result of
the economic decline that followed the 1991 Soviet collapse, and
have all but stopped paying for electricity and heat.
	   The unpaid bills continue to mount despite the government's
efforts to cut off non-paying consumers and the introduction of
complicated barter schemes to replace cash payments, Sheberstov
said at a news conference.
	   Energy producers have tried to suspend supplies. But the
government objects to cutting electricity to such places as coal
mines and villages, so they ``consume energy virtually for free,''
Sheberstov said.
	   At the same time, energy producers can't pay their own bills for
coal and other fuel they use. Many have either stopped buying oil,
gas and coal for the winter or else their supplies have been cut
off.
	   Energy producers currently owe 5.7 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.7
billion) to fuel suppliers, the Energy Ministry said. The bill grew
by more than 300 million hryvna (dlrs 88 million) from Sept. 1
alone.
	   The state gas supplier, Ukrgazprom, suspended gas supplies to 12
large energy companies this week. Most energy companies already
have started to use coal and oil they had stored for winter,
Sheberstov said.
	   ``We'll have to find money to buy fuel,'' he added, ``otherwise
it will be a very difficult winter.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Washington sought to build a
consensus in NATO for air attacks on Yugoslavia, a U.S. envoy gave
President Slobodan Milosevic one more chance Wednesday to bow to
international demands and avoid airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met for several hours with Milosevic on
Wednesday. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the talks ended Wednesday evening and that the envoy was
preparing to leave for Brussels, Belgium.
	   The sources gave no indication if Holbrooke had managed to make
progress in the latest talks, his third this week with the Yugoslav
leader.
	   In the two previous sessions Monday and Tuesday, Holbrooke
failed to persuade Milosevic to pull out more forces from Kosovo
province and enter negotiations with ethnic Albanians on the future
of the province.

Prestigious prize hinges on an unclear word
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sweden-Alternative Nobels &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions
establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear
word and scratched out a few letters. Questions about the guidance
he intended to provide have engaged and piqued the literary world
ever since.
	   A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the
Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most
prestigious prize for writers.
	   The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital
and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question: Why
does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful
of people in a quiet and remote country? Does the Nobel Prize
really recognize the best?
	   When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary
Sture Allen smiled and said, ``Look at the list of prizewinners!''
	   The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. On one hand, the
Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers like Isaac
Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to light, such as
Wislawa Szymborska.
	   But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre, heaping
attention on those who would have been more fairly served by
obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901,
Sully Prudhomme.
	   That choice was denounced by Sweden's leading literary light,
August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo
Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not choosing him.
	   Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, considering
the instructions they were given. Nobel's will says the prize
should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal'' is unclear, and the
Academy's choices have reflected the confusion. The Academy has
chosen to interpret the word to apply to works ranging from the
good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crushing
hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writings.
	   When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk'' _
he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous ones.
Allen was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged
a forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were.
	   The expert succeeded _ to a point. He found that the first word
Nobel wrote was ``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist.
	   Despite the lack of clarity around the edges, Allen said he is
confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that
``literature would be the basis for some kind of progress.''
	   About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: The
Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret.
	   But observers love to speculate on who might win, even who is on
the shortlist for the prize, this year worth dlrs 974,000.
	   Names that frequently come up in the guessing include V.S.
Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery,
and Jose Saramago of Portugal.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations failed to
reach an agreement on resuming spot searches of suspected weapons
sites after 10 days of talks, officials said Wednesday.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after his
fourth and final meeting with the U.N. chief that he would take the
U.N. proposals back to Baghdad for consultations and would report
back to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We are going to weigh the situation in its entirety in
Baghdad,'' Aziz said. He planned to leave New York later Wednesday.
	   But neither side announced any breakthrough in the impasse that
has prevented arms experts from looking for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction for over two months.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi Parliament condemned Wednesday
what it called Turkish threats against Syria and urged Arabs to
rally to Syria's support, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   ``Turkish threats against Syria are part of the policy of power
and disregard for the principles of international law pursued by
the Turkish government toward Arab countries,'' INA quoted a source
at the Iraqi Parliament as saying.
	   ``Any harm that would be done to any Arab country is targeted
against the Arab nation and the Turkish people at the same time, as
well as against good neighborly ties and joint interests between
Turkey and the Arab nation,'' INA said. The report was monitored by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Baghdad on Sunday called on Turkey to withdraw the 10,000 troops
it sent into northern Iraq to battle Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey carry out cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and
Syria.
	   Turkey has accused Syria of aiding the rebels and has indicated
that it is prepared to take military action to eradicate guerrilla
bases in Syria. Syria denies the charge.
	   Northern Iraq is controlled by Iraqi Kurds who oppose the
Baghdad regime.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's army chief resigned
Wednesday, two days after calling for the establishment of a
National Security Council that would have given the army a direct
role in policy decisions.
	   The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said Gen. Jehangir
Karamat ``applied for retirement'' and was distressed by the
``unnecessary debate'' his call for a National Security Council
prompted.
	   Karamat was not immediately available for comment, but it is the
first time in Pakistan's history that an army chief of staff has
resigned his post. Rather previous army chiefs of staff have
imposed martial law, rather than resign.
	   The state-run Pakistan Television news alert gave a terse
statement saying Karamat submitted his resignation to Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was to be replaced by Gen. Pervaiz
Mushraf, who will also be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
	   An army spokesman said: ``we have also heard this on television.
We have no details. We are waiting for our orders.''
	   On Monday, Karamat issued a strong condemnation of the
performance of Sharif's government and of Pakistan's political
leadership when he called for the establishment of a National
Security Council.
	   The council would have been dominated by army officials,
although the president and prime minister also would have been
members.
	   He said Pakistan was facing difficult times and a crumbling
economy. He warned the politicians against ``polarization,
vendettas and insecurity-driven'' policies.
	   His call for a National Security Council was seen by the
opposition as a final warning to Sharif's government and a
harbinger of possible military rule.
	   In Pakistan, the army has ruled for 25 of the past 51 years.

	   A statement issued by Annan's office said simply that ``Both
sides agreed that the process of dialogue would continue.''
	   The talks were intended to persuade Iraq to reverse its decision
Aug. 5 to stop cooperating with inspectors in return for a review
conducted by the Security Council of Iraq's efforts to disarm
itself.
	   The review could force the 15-member council to acknowledge
Iraq's progress over seven years of intrusive inspections while
building support for an easing of sanctions that have crippled
Iraq's economy.
	   Over four meetings, Annan briefed Aziz on his ideas of how the
so-called ``comprehensive review'' might be carried out.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thousands of Ukrainian workers and
hard-liners demonstrated Wednesday to show support for protesters
in neighboring Russia and to demand the resignation of President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   ``Down with the criminal regime! Down with Kuchma!'' shouted
hundreds of mostly elderly demonstrators who gathered at Kiev's
central Europe Square, which was cordoned off by a handful of
police officers.
	   The crowd waved an assortment of red Soviet banners, while some
people held portraits of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin and dictator
Josef Stalin as they listened to speakers condemning Kuchma's
government and calling for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
	   Earlier in the day, up to 2,000 elderly hard-liners and some
trade union activists marched to parliament and the government
headquarters in downtown Kiev to protest against Ukraine's economic
downfall.
	   About 6,000 demonstrators rallied in the coal-producing city of
Donetsk and 1,000 took part in a demonstration in the northeastern
industrial town of Kharkiv, protest organizers said. Scattered
demonstrations were held elsewhere in Ukraine.
	   The Independent Trade Union Federation issued a letter to
Yeltsin and Russian labor activists saying Ukrainians have been hit
hard by the Russian economic crisis and could understand the
demands of Russian protesters.
	   In Ukraine, the crisis has sharply cut the value of the hryvna
currency and exports to Russia, the former Soviet republic's key
trading partner.
	   It has worsened the country's existing problems which included
the government's inability to collect budget revenues and to pay
wages and pensions.
	   In Crimea, a mostly ethnic Russian Black Sea peninsula, several
hundred people demonstrated in the capital, Simferopol, the
Interfax news agency reported. The protesters said they supported

Prestigious prize hinges on an unclear word
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS garble in grafs 9 and 10 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions
establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear
word and scratched out a few letters. Questions about the prize
have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since.
	   A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the
Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most
prestigious prize for writers.
	   The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital
and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question: Why
does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful
of people in a quiet and remote country? Does the Nobel Prize
really recognize the best?
	   When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary
Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look at the list of prizewinners!''
	   The answer obscures as much as it clarifies. On one hand, the
Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers such as Isaac
Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to light, such as
Wislawa Szymborska.
	   But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre, heaping
attention on those who would have been more fairly served by
obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901,
Sully Prudhomme.
	   That choice was denounced by Sweden's leading literary light,
August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo
Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not choosing him.
	   Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, considering
the instructions they were given. Nobel's will says the prize
should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal'' is unclear and the
Academy's choices have reflected the confusion. The Academy has
chosen to interpret the word to apply to works ranging from the
good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crushing
hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writings.
	   When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk'' _
he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one. Allen
was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a
forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were.
	   The expert succeeded _ to a point. He found that the first word
Nobel wrote was ``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist.
	   Despite the inclarity around the edges, Allen said he is
confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that
``literature would be the basis for some kind of progress.''
	   About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the
Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret.
	   But observers love to speculate on who might win, even who's on
the shortlist for the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor
(about dlrs 974,000).
	   Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S.
Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery,
and Jose Saramago of Portugal.

OSCE envoy discuss Chechen hostages with British, New Zealand

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the OSCE mission in Chechnya was
holding consultations with senior diplomats in Moscow about the
kidnapping of three Britons and a New Zealander in Chechnya,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Leon Waszczynski, mission chief for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, met with first secretary of the
New Zealand Embassy, Graeme McGuire, on Wednesday, said Polish
Embassy spokesman Jacek Niedzielski.
	   The two men discussed ``the circumstances of the abduction and
exchanged information that could possibly help trace'' the
hostages, Niedzielski said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Waszczynski was also planning talks with Russian government
officials and British diplomats, but no details were disclosed ``to
avoid harming the kidnapped people and not to hinder their speedy
release,'' Niedzielski was quoted as saying.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped over the
weekend. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone
company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Hostage-takings, usually motivated by ransoms, have become
common in Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996.

Court bans art book with topless woman on crucifix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS priest's lawyer reax, background
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Wednesday slapped the country's
latest book ban on an art publication with the picture of a topless
woman on a crucifix on the cover, co-produced by a photographer for
President Jacques Chirac.
	   Heeding a request by a conservative Catholic priest, the court
ordered the book ``INRI'' -- the inscription above Christ's cross
-- off the shelves of three bookstores in Bordeaux, and the court
threatened a 500-franc (dlrs 90) fine for each copy sold.
	   The book by Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly re-examines
iconography depicting the life of Jesus. Rheims, a popular
shock-art photographer and celebrity portrait artist, shot the
official picture of Chirac that hangs in government buildings
across France.
	   But Catholic priest Philippe Laguerie found the book's cover
iconoclastic, and Presiding Judge Louis Montamat agreed, ruling
that the cover, ``strongly shocks religious sentiment.''
	   Laguerie's lawyer, Dominique Remy, said the priest ``was happy
that it was a decision of principle.
	   ``To show a woman half-naked on the cross has a deliberate,
blasphemous effect on the principle of Catholic redemption,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
	   Asked about whether the ruling infringed on free expression,
Remy said: ``There is no freedom of expression in France! Try to
write something libelous about me, and see what happens.''
	   While the ruling initially affects only the three bookshops,
Remy said Lagerie would encourage other priests around France to
use the ruling to get the book banned across France.
	   The director of the FNAC department store in Bordeaux, Jean
Benoit Cazenave, said the 390-franc (dlr 70) book published by
Albin-Michel benefitted from the media coverage since it went on
sale Friday and was already sold out.
	   ``FNAC hopes to get the decision suspended,'' he said in a
telephone interview. The company, he said, allows any book that
doesn't include racial hatred, violence or pornography. ``This book
doesn't belong to any of those categories.''
	   French courts have banned a number of books in recent years,
most recently going so far as to block an author from even writing
an unauthorized biography of actor Alain Delon in August.
	   Courts have also barred the sale of a book by a former doctor of
the late President Francois Mitterrand that said the president lied
about his cancer condition while in office.
	   The order was circumvented when the book was placed on the
Internet.
	   Rheims, a former model, has become one of France's biggest
contemporary photographers. Her work includes portraits of
Elizabeth Hurley, Mickey Rourke, Johnny Depp and Liv Tyler as well
as transexuals and strip tease artists. She's also produced TV ads,
movie posters and music videos.

Turkish Parliament allows former speaker's prosecution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday agreed to allow
its former speaker to be prosecuted for alleged corruption.
	   Prosecutors want to formally accuse Mustafa Kalemli, a deputy
from Premier Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland party, for allegedly
receiving two luxury apartments from a construction company in
return for a dlrs 38 million contract to refurbish Parliament's
grand hall.
	   Kalemli, 55, denies the charges and asked Parliament to let him
prove his innocence. Premier Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland party agreed
to lift their deputy's immunity.
	   Parliament's decision came a day after it voted to investigate
allegations that Yilmaz illegally allocated state land to a private
firm. Two other corruption investigations launched against Yilmaz
over the past six months are still in progress.

Study shows little benefit to chiropractic treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT. (2100 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Visiting a chiropractor may be little better than
reading a dlr 1 pamphlet about back pain and is worthless against
childhood asthma, two studies conclude.
	   Asthma is one of many ills outside the traditional realm of
aches and pains that some chiropractors attempt to treat.
Allergies, high blood pressure, headaches, ear infections, colic
and menstrual pain are also on the list.
	   However, by far the most common complaint seen by chiropractors
is back pain.
	   Several studies have found that their treatment can speed
recovery from a sore back, but a report in Thursday's issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine concludes their effect is
surprisingly modest.
	   The back-pain study was conducted on 321 people by Dr. Daniel C.
Cherkin and others from the University of Washington in Seattle. It
compared chiropractic manipulation with a form of physical therapy
called the McKenzie method for people with low back pain. This type
of physical therapy emphasizes teaching people posture and
exercises to minimize their pain.
	   The study found these people did only marginally better than
those who received a dlr 1 booklet about backaches.
	   ``Physical therapy and chiropractic care appear to be equally
effective,'' said Dr. Richard A. Deyo, one of the researchers.
``Both offer some benefit above and beyond the usual care given by
a family doctor, but probably a fairly small benefit on average.''
	   The asthma study, also published in Thursday's journal, was
conducted on 80 children with mild to moderate symptoms.
Chiropractors believe that some diseases, including asthma, result
from lack of proper nerve function, and can be corrected by
manipulating the spine.
	   The children were seen by 11 chiropractors, who gave them either
standard chiropractic treatments or sham manipulations that were
intended to feel like the real thing.
	   All of the children got four months of treatment. While both
groups got slightly better, there was no difference between them.
Dr. Jeffrey Balon of Toronto, who directed the study, said he had
hoped that chiropractic care would make a difference.
	   Nevertheless, he said the experiment shows that ``the
chiropractic profession is maturing. We are capable of carrying on
multi-discipline research at a high level and are not afraid to
publish the results.''
	   Balon was a practicing chiropractor from 1982 to 1989 and then
returned to college to become a physician. His study was financed
by four chiropractic groups.
	   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Paul G. Shekelle of the West
Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center called Balon and his
researchers ``courageous'' for putting this kind of chiropractic
care to the test.
	   Regardless of the findings of both studies, some chiropractors
say that perhaps the most notable fact is that the research was
conducted at all.
	   New drugs and some medical procedures are subjected to rigorous
testing before they become routinely available. However, this has
been rare with other types of therapy, such as chiropractic or
acupuncture.
	   Jerome McAndrews, a chiropractor and spokesman for the American
Chiropractic Association, said that while disappointed with the
studies' results, ``we are pleased at the attention that is being
given to chiropractic's role in the health industry.''

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German runner Uta Pippig, a three-time
Boston marathon winner, has been suspended by the German Athletics
Federation for abnormally high levels of testosterone, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Pippig was tested during training in Boulder, Colorado, on April
23, said Theo Rous, vice president of the German Athletics
Federation (DLV) and its chief anti-doing official.
	   ``We have a suspicion. Until now, Ms. Pippig has not banned, no
guilt has been proven,'' Rous said.
	   But if DLV legal committee rules that Pippig is guilty of doping
she will be banned for two years, Rous said.
	   Pippig, who lives in Boulder, told German television she had
been ill in April and May.
	   ``I can't explain the results of these tests, except that they
are somehow connected to my illness,'' she told ZDF television.
	   Both test samples revealed abnormally high levels of
testosterone, a male sex hormone used by athletes to enhance
performance illegally, said Klaus Mueller, chief of the Kreischa
lab that examined Pippig's samples.
	   Pippig told the lab she took some medicine to battle a viral
infection, but Mueller ruled out that it could have led to such
results.
	   ``Such a connection does not exist,'' he told InfoRadio Berlin.
Mueller would not speculate on what else could have caused
abnormally high levels of testosterone.
	   Pippig's coach and partner Dieter Hogen said she suffered
hormonal disturbances after started taking the anti-pregnancy pill
again.
	   ``I've been tested 50 or 60 times in my career and nothing was
ever found,'' Pippig told the SID sports news agency.
	   Pippig was born in Leipzig, former East Germany, and moved to
West Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
	   A popular figure in Germany where she often works as a
television commentator, Pippig won the Boston Marathon three years
in a row, between 1994 and 1996, and the New York Marathon in 1993.
She has also won the Berlin Marathon three times.
	   After her third victory in Boston, she jogged with President
Clinton.

	   But there are disagreements within the council about how the
review would be conducted, with the United States and Britain
demanding that Iraq first reverse its Aug. 5 decision and allow
inspectors to do all their work before beginning serious
discussions on a comprehensive review.
	   Aziz said he had received assurances from British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock, the council president, that there would be no
``artificial delays'' on starting the review. But he said he was
still disturbed by the views of one council member for attaching
``unacceptable conditions'' to the proposals. He was referring to
the United States.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off
the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by
Iraqis.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Warning that the ``decisive moment''
is approaching, a senior U.S. envoy held more talks Wednesday with
President Slobodan Milosevic in hopes of persuading him to withdraw
additional forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met with Milosevic for several hours.
Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
talks ended this evening and that the envoy left for Brussels,
Belgium where NATO has its headquarters.
	   The sources gave no indication if Holbrooke had managed to make
progress in the talks, his third this week with the Yugoslav
leader.
	   In meetings Monday and Tuesday, Holbrooke failed to persuade
Milosevic to pull out more forces from Kosovo and enter
negotiations with ethnic Albanians on the future of the Serb
province.
	   At U.N. headquarters Tuesday, the Security Council declared that
the combatants in Kosovo had not yet fully complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of special
Serb police units from the province.
	   While the U.N. action carries no legal weight, NATO officials
say they are prepared to launch airstrikes swiftly after a final
decision is made. A decision is possible by the weekend, after NATO
ambassadors meet Thursday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday renewed his call for
Milosevic to halt the crackdown in the southern province in Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   ``If he does that, he completely complies. He doesn't have to
worry about military force,'' Clinton said.
	   Milosevic's 7-month crackdown on the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army has killed hundreds and driven more than 270,000 civilians
from their homes.
	   International concern over Kosovo increased last week after
reports that Serb police massacred dozens of ethnic Albanian
civilians. Police deny responsibility.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo, and most favor self-rule.
	   Ethnic Albanian villagers in the Malisevo region, southwest of
the Kosovo capital Pristina, told journalists Wednesday that Serbs
have shelled their homes for the last four days. Residents of
Dragobe, which has largely been evacuated, said new holes in their
houses were from Serb shells. The Serbs have said they are being
fired upon by ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
Serb authorities also claimed all special police units, in the
forefront of strikes against Kosovo Albanian militants, have been
pulled out.
	   A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said today
that an estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo,
down from 36,000 10 days earlier, in addition to 11,000 military
police, half the total in all of Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter in Kosovo.
	   The NATO alliance will hold a special joint council Friday with
Russia in Brussels to brief the Russians on NATO's possible actions
in Kosovo. Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the
Security Council to stop NATO airstrikes.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, in Israel with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said Wednesday that Albright
plans to fly to Brussels for a meeting Thursday with NATO officials
and a briefing by Holbrooke.
	   Rubin said there is no consensus for military action against the
Serbs. ``We are continuing to push for early action,'' he said.
``NATO is not there yet.''
	   However, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday during
a visit to Beijing: ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take
action to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.''
	   Serbia sent Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic to Kosovo for
discussions Wednesday with the Serbian-installed interim
government, which the ethnic Albanians do not recognize. It also
invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
send a mission to Kosovo, officials said.
	   ``I believe everything will be settled peacefully, but if they
strike, we will defend ourselves,'' Marjanovic said.
	   Holbrooke met with Milosevic on Tuesday after talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders in Kosovo, where he said Serb forces maintained a
strong presence despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw.
	   ``Right now, we are in the countdown to a decisive moment in the
history of the Balkans,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Milosevic accepted a peace agreement Holbrooke negotiated in
1995 to end the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer a decision on whether
Kosovo would separate from Serbia for two or three years. But the
ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   Britain, France and Germany advised their citizens in Yugoslavia
to leave, and Canada has evacuated all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families. Americans were told earlier not to travel
to Yugoslavia, and U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy
employees would soon be evacuated.

	   The failed talks came amid reports that a French laboratory had

	   Also complicating talks was a major six-month report issued

Six year old murder case solved in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Berlin police said Wednesday that they
have solved a six-year-old murder case in which a real estate agent
allegedly paid to have a woman tenant killed so that he could rent
her apartment out as a brothel.
	   Police commissioner Klaus Rackschnat said that with the
government move to Berlin and the ensuing property boom, real
estate agent Eberhard H. realized he could charge much more for an
apartment he owned.
	   When 54-year-old Doris Kirche refused to move out of the
apartment, the suspect hired two Greek men to kill her, police
said. The two allegedly barged into a Berlin car dealership where
Kirche worked as a secretary and shot her to death on Feb. 22,
1993.
	   Police could not say how much the two Greeks were paid.
	   After Kirche was killed, a brothel moved into her five-room, 180
square meter (1,937 square foot) apartment, paying much more per
month than the 800 marks (dlrs 482) that she had paid.
	   One of the two Greek men is still being sought under an
international arrest warrant, Rackschnat said. The real estate
agent and other Greek suspect were arrested in June and remain in
investigative custody pending formal charges.

Turkish Premier says Syria waging indirect war on Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS, UPDATES with Parliament issuing ultimatum, ADDS
background on military makeup &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament Wednesday issued an ultimatum
to Syria, demanding Damascus eject Turkish Kurdish rebels from its
territory or ``face the consequences.''
	   ``Our wish is that the Syrian administration understands the
seriousness of the situation, takes necessary measures and ends the
presence of terror hideouts. If this is not done, it will
unavoidably have to face the consequences,'' the 550-member
Parliament said in an announcement signed by all its nine parties.
	   Although it did not say what the consequences would be, the
announcement raised the stakes in Turkey's face-off with Syria.
	   Earlier Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz accused Damascus of waging
an indirect war against Turkey by supporting the rebels and told
Parliament the ``time has come to end the dark games of Syria.''
	   Syria denies sheltering rebels, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has
triggered fears of a regional conflict.
	   ``We are not trying to spark a war,'' Yilmaz told Parliament.
``But we (the government) are determined if necessary to ask the
Parliament's consent for possible use of force.''
	   Turkey has the second largest army in NATO after the United
States. One of the most modern and best-equipped in the alliance,
the battle-hardened 750,000-strong active duty force is double the
size of Syria's.
	   Yilmaz said the Cabinet decided earlier in the day to take all
necessary dissuasive measures against Syria if it maintains its
support to Kurdish rebels, fighting autonomy within Turkey.
	   ``Through its support to the terrorists, Syria is waging an
indirect war against Turkey,'' he said.
	   Yilmaz's address to Parliament came a day after Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak held talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel in Ankara to seek a peaceful solution.
	   ``Mubarak has inspired us to give a last chance to diplomacy,''
Yilmaz said. ``The steps which Syria will be taking carry great
importance in ending the tension.''
	   Yilmaz said Ankara was demanding the extradition of the rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey and an end to Syria's financial
and logistics support.
	   Turkey also contends the rebels run training camps in the Syrian
controlled-Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.
	   Mubarak, who was given a dossier containing documents allegedly
verifying Syria's backing for the rebels, flew directly to Damascus
from Ankara on Tuesday and met with Syrian President Hafez Assad
for a second time in a week.
	   ``We are pursuing quiet diplomacy and hope that (official)
statements would not be sharp but would try to ease tension,''
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters on Wednesday.
``Goodwill must prevail in the relations between the two
countries.''
	   Reports in Egypt on Tuesday said Mubarak was trying to work out
a mechanism for the two sides to meet and resolve the dispute.
	   The United States and Russia, along with most countries of the
Middle East, have urged the two countries to reach a peaceful
settlement.
	   Yilmaz did not rule out direct talks with Damascus but said
``even if there will be a diplomatic dialogue it must be limited to
(discussing) the rebel activities alone.''
	   Turkey and Syria are also at loggerheads over an ambitious
Turkish irrigation project in southeastern Turkey, which Damascus
fears would reduce the water flow of Euphrates River crossing into
Syria, and on the Turkish border province of Hatay which Ankara
accuses Syria of having designs on.
	   Syria is also uneasy about the growing ties between Israel and
Turkey.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Wednesday that a war with
Syria would last only one day. Daily Yeniyuzyil said Turkey would
stage pinpoint air raids on rebel camps if Syria does not change
its attitude.
	   The Anatolia news agency reported Wednesday that some tanks and
armed personnel carriers were transferred to the province of
Sanliurfa bordering Syria.

New general manager seeking manager flies to Dominican Republic to
</HEADLINE>
talk to Felipe Alou &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Moving fast and far to talk with Felipe Alou
about becoming manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, new general
manager Kevin Malone is scheduled to meet with the Montreal Expos'
field boss Thursday in the Dominican Republic.
	   ``Yes, I'm going down there to sit down with Felipe and see if
we can get something accomplished, but I wouldn't say anything is
close to being completed,'' Malone told the Los Angeles Times.
	   The newspaper said in today's editions that the Dodgers would
offer Alou a multi-year contract and team officials hope to
introduce him as the team's manager early next week.
	   While in the Dominican Republic Malone and Dodger President Bob
Graziano also are to tour the team's training facility, damaged
last month by Hurrican Georges.
	   ``We have a lot of work to do, and bringing (Alou) on board
would complete another big piece of the puzzle,'' Malone said. ``I
hope that Felipe will view this as a good fit, because I certainly
believe it would be.''
	   The Dodgers were given permission by the Expos Monday to talk to
Alou about the managerial job, vacant since it was announced last
week that Glenn Hoffman would return to the Dodgers next season as
a member of the coaching staff, not as manager.
	   Malone was hired Sept. 11 to become the Dodgers' third general
manager in a six month period. Alou, Montreal's manager since May
22, 1992, has one year remaining on his contract with the Expos.
Malone was general manager of the Expos during the 1994 and 1995
seasons, before moving to Baltimore as assistant general manager.
	   Alou, 63, has had success in Montreal despite the team's low
payroll, blamed for departure of many key players through trades or
free agency.
	   Star players who have left Montreal include Alou's son, Moises,
along with Larry Walker, John Wetteland, Pedro Martinez, Andres
Galarraga, Marquis Grissom, and Mike Lansing.
	   During the strike-shortened 1994 season the Expos had a 74-40
record _ the best in baseball, and Alou was named Associated Press
Baseball Manager of the Year and NL Manager of the Year by the
Baseball Writers Association of America.
	   The Expos were 94-68 in 1993, and 88-74 in 1996.

Vieira charged with misconduct after Wednesday clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds detail, clarifies

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was charged Wednesday
with misconduct by the Football Association after it reviewed
police reports of incidents in a Premier League match on Sept. 26.
	   The match between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday at
Hillsborough was marred by a brawl between players which led to
Wednesday's Paolo Di Canio pushing referee Paul Alcock to the
ground.
	   Di Canio pushed Alcock after he was given a red card for his
part in the brawl but he later accused the referee of taking a
dive.
	   The Italian striker was immediately suspended by Sheffield
Wednesday and returned to Italy. The Football Association has
charged him with gross misconduct, which carries a penalty ranging
from a six-month to a life ban.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also red-carded by Alcock after the
incident but won an appeal Wednesday and had a three match ban
lifted.
	   The Football Association accepted Keown's claim that his
intention was to act as a peacemaker in the incident when Di Canio
moved to confront Vieira, who was involved in an altercation with
Wim Jonk.
	   An F.A. statement released Wednesday said the sending off would
stand but Keown would not be punished further.
	   Vieira, however, was charged with inciting Sheffield Wednesday
supporters by making gestures as he left the field after the match
and of pushing a police officer at the entrance of the players'
tunnel.
	   Vieira, who has the full backing of Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger,
has 14 days to request an F.A. disciplinary committee hearing.
	   ``I was right behind Patrick in the tunnel and I saw what
happened _ nothing at all,'' Wenger was quoted saying last week.

Struggling regional African airline faces debt deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Air Afrique, the regional airline
serving 11 states in West and Central Africa, said it has until
November to sort out its debt problems.
	   Creditors, led by France's Credit Lyonnais, seized four of Air
Afrique's airbus A-310s two months ago after the airline failed to
pay back debt arrears totaling dlrs 57 million.
	   In a statement published Wednesday, the airline said it agreed
with the French government on a new end of November deadline ``to
gather together the funds necessary to pay off the debt.''
	   The agreement follows a visit to Paris by an Air Afrique
delegation led by airline Director General Harry Tirvengadum and
transport ministers from the Ivory Coast and Niger.
	   Air Afrique has been earmarked for privatization by the year
2000.

Iraq: no agreement on ending standoff over arms inspections
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; TRIMS to tighten, SUBS penultimate graf to
correct to `resolutions' sted `inspections.' &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations failed to
reach an agreement on resuming spot searches of suspected weapons
sites after 10 days of discussions, officials said Wednesday.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after his
fourth and final meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan that he
would take the U.N. proposals back to Baghdad for consultations and
would report back to the U.N. chief.
	   ``We are going to weigh the situation in its entirety in
Baghdad,'' Aziz said. He planned to leave New York later Wednesday.
	   But neither side announced any breakthrough in the impasse that
has prevented arms experts from looking for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction for over two months.
	   A statement issued by Annan's office said simply that ``Both
sides agreed that the process of dialogue would continue.''
	   The talks were intended to persuade Iraq to reverse its decision
Aug. 5 to stop cooperating with inspectors in return for a review
conducted by the Security Council of its efforts to disarm itself.
	   The review could force the 15-member council to acknowledge
Baghdad's progress over seven years of intrusive inspections while
building support for an easing of sanctions that have crippled
Iraq's economy.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by
Iraqis.
	   Over four meetings during the Iraqi's visit, Annan briefed Aziz
on his ideas of how the so-called ``comprehensive review'' might be
carried out.
	   But there are disagreements within the council about how the
review would be conducted, with the United States and Britain
demanding that Iraq first reverse its Aug. 5 decision and allow
inspectors to do all their work before beginning serious
discussions on a comprehensive review.
	   Aziz said he had received assurances from British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock, the council president, that there would be no
``artificial delays'' on starting the review. But he said he was
still disturbed by the views of one council member for attaching
``unacceptable conditions'' to the proposals. He was referring to
the United States.
	   The failed talks came amid reports that a French laboratory had
corroborated U.S. findings that some Iraqi missile warheads had
traces of ingredients used to make the deadly VX nerve gas.
	   Diplomats here have hinted of such positive results, and have
suggested that France _ which generally takes a sympathetic view
towards Iraq _ was withholding the results so as to not undermine
the delicate negotiations between Annan and Aziz. The French
Foreign Ministry denied pressuring the lab.
	   Also complicating talks was a major six-month report issued
Monday by Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, which carries out inspections in Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler disagreed with part of the U.N. chief's
proposal to end the impasse. Annan has proposed making inspectors
responsible for proving that Iraq still has weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In the report, Butler said the proposal, which Iraq has long
demanded, would reverse the burden of disclosure that was placed on
Baghdad by the Security Council in its original resolutions.
	   Both the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, and Greenstock,
the British ambassador, stressed that the review would be carried
out according to previous U.N. resolutions.
	   ``The council is united on proceeding to the review under the
terms of the resolution,'' Greenstock told reporters. ``We will
make our own decisions on what that review will contain.''

State workers strike for higher wages, more public spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of state employees
went on strike Wednesday, trying to force President Andres Pastrana
to ease an austerity program that cuts government spending and
limits salary increases.
	   Union leaders claimed 90 percent of 650,000 state workers were
taking part in the indefinite strike, while Labor Minister Hernando
Yepes Arcila said participation was ``far less than 50 percent.''
	   The strikers included public school teachers, judicial and
hospital workers. School was canceled for some 7 million students,
courts were closed and state-run hospitals were only treating
emergencies. Workers at the state oil company, Ecopetrol, reduced
pipeline pumping by 50 percent to 20,000 gallons a day, said union
president Hernando Hernandez.
	   Public employees unions said the walkout would continue until
the government reaches agreement with them on demands for salary
increases, in line with inflation of at least 18 percent, an
increase in public spending and a suspension of privatizations. The
government has said it would limit wage increases to 14 percent.
	   The Finance Ministry says the union demands would cost dlrs 2.5
billion and double the government deficit when authorities can
ill-afford such spending.
	   Hernandez said that if agreement was not reached quickly with
the government, Ecopetrol workers would completely shut down oil
production ``and at the moment there are only gasoline reserves for
five or six days.''
	   The strike was the second in the public employee sector since
Pastrana took office Aug. 7. The workers staged a 48-hour strike
two weeks ago.

FDA: Security systems sometimes interfere with pacemakers, other
</HEADLINE>
devices &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Metal detectors and antitheft systems in
stores and airports may occasionally interfere with the function of
pacemakers and other implanted medical devices, the Food and Drug
Administration said Wednesday.
	   The government stressed that patients shouldn't be alarmed _
more than 1 million Americans have the devices, yet the FDA has
reports of just 44 reactions over the last 10 years.
	   But the agency wrote cardiologists and neurologists Wednesday to
alert them in case patients report symptoms. It said it is working
with both the medical device and security systems industries to
make the devices more compatible.
	   On hearing the news, ``patients could get anxious and we don't
want that to happen,'' said Elizabeth Jacobson, FDA's scientific
director of medical devices. ``We don't see this as a big public
health problem. Lots and lots of people go through these systems
every day, and we have very few reports'' of interactions.
	   The FDA is pushing both industries to study the problem now,
because more and more people are getting implanted with the medical
devices, and antitheft systems and metal detectors are located just
about everywhere. Better engineering, the agency believes, could
cut any risk of interference.
	   The issue of medical device interference arose several years ago
with cellular telephones, when some pacemaker patients reported
problems. Studies ultimately found that pacemaker patients could
safely use the phones as long as they didn't hold them right over
the chest or carry them in a breast pocket, Jacobson said.
	   Now the focus is on antitheft devices _ those surveillance
systems that sound an alarm in stores and libraries _ and metal
detectors. They produce electromagnetic fields that, if strong
enough, occasionally cause electronic medical devices such as
pacemakers, defibrillators and spinal cord stimulators to act up,
the FDA said.
	   Since 1988, the FDA has received:
	   _Eighteen reports of pacemaker interference, causing such
problems as the pacemaker's mode being reset. One case was
potentially serious, involving a pacemaker that had been recalled
for other reasons. The others were mild and transient reactions.
Some 1 million Americans have pacemakers.
	   _Nine reports of interference with defibrillators, which deliver
electric shocks to 100,000 patients' hearts to make them beat
properly. Two patients were inappropriately shocked, one while
leaning against a store's antitheft system and another while a
hand-held metal detector scanned the patient's chest. Interference
caused defibrillators in other patients to be reset to
``monitor-only'' mode.
	   _Seventeen reports of interference with spinal-cord stimulators,
which 15,000 Americans have to help control intractable pain.
Patients reported pain or shocks; one fell and was injured.
Jacobson said the FDA may have to study this device more carefully
because of the higher proportion of reported problems.
	   The FDA gave doctors some advice just ``to be on the safe
side'': Device-dependent patients could be warned not to lean
against antitheft systems or metal detectors, not to stay near them
longer than necessary, and to tell security personnel not to use
hand-held metal detectors near the implanted device for long.
	   The FDA brought both industries together last month to discuss
the problem with scientific experts. The antitheft industry now is
considering sponsoring studies on how to minimize or avoid
electromagnetic interference, Jacobson said.

Angola reduces U.N. radio-broadcasting time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's government on Wednesday cut the
United Nations' amount of radio broadcasting space from three hours
to two, increasing tension between the peace monitors and the
ruling party.
	   The government was reportedly annoyed when the show recently
aired an interview with U.N. regional commander Bernard Gendre, who
criticized the conduct of the Angolan Armed Forces.
	   Citing ``the country's highest interests'', RNA state radio
authorities axed the United Nation's one-hour morning program,
``The Paths of Peace,'' but allowed it to keep the afternoon and
nighttime editions.
	   The U.N.'s special envoy to Angola Issa Diallo, who arrived in
Angola late August, has been trying to meet with Jonas Savimbi,
leader of former rebel group UNITA, in one of his highland
strongholds where he retreated after 1992 elections.
	   The government has prevented the U.N. diplomat from traveling to
Andulo or Bailundo, some 480 kilometers (300 miles) east of the
capital, allegedly for security reasons.
	   The government halted contact with Savimbi a month ago and asked
the U.N. to follow suit.
	   But the U.N. Security Council called on the ruling MPLA party to
reverse its decision, reportedly angering President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos.
	   A U.N. peacekeeping force and mediating group are overseeing
implementation of the 1994 Lusaka protocol that ended a two-decade
civil war between UNITA and the government.
	   Four years on, the deal remains to be fully implemented and
hostility between the former foes is rising, edging the peace
process towards collapse.
	   The government estimates the number of people displaced because
of recent developments at nearly 800,000.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ World No.1 Pete Sampras and world No.2
Patrick Rafter both crashed out in the first round of the dlrs 1
million Swiss Indoors on Wednesday.
	   Sampras, winner of three titles this season including Wimbledon,
was toppled by long-time nemesis Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3
only hours after Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech
Daniel Vacek.
	   Sampras, playing for the first time since he was eliminated in
the semifinal of the U.S. Open last month by eventual champion
Rafter, got off to a strong start but slowly began to crumble under
Ferreira's persistant assualt.
	   Sampras' and Rafter's defeats mark the departure of the
tournament's biggest draws and its three Grand Slam champions this
year. Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion, went out in the
first round on Tuesday after losing 6-2, 6-4 to Germany's Nicolas
Kiefer.

U.S. envoy meets Milosevic as Washington seeks consensus for NATO

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES; UPDATES with Milosevic statement; TRIMS outdated

 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Washington sought to build a
consensus in NATO for air attacks on Yugoslavia, a U.S. envoy gave
President Slobodan Milosevic another chance Wednesday to bow to
international demands and avoid airstrikes.
	   But Milosevic remained defiant. Following the president's
meeting with envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's office said
``attempts were made to overcome the differences'' over the crisis
in Kosovo province.
	   Referring to the possibility of NATO airstrikes, the Yugoslav
statement said ``the threats which are delivered to our country
jeopardize the continuation of the political process.''
	   It accused foreign governments of waging ``a media campaign
against our country'' through ``one-sided and fabricated reports.''
	   U.S. officials refused comment on the talks, and Holbrooke left
for Brussels, Belgium to meet Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
on Thursday.
	   Before the talks ended, U.S. President Bill Clinton reiterated
that Milosevic has to end his crackdown in Kosovo, pull out his
special police force and resume negotiations. Kosovo is a province
of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people
have been driven from their homes.
	   Despite mounting evidence of Milosevic's non-compliance and a
U.N. declaration confirming it, Washington seemed to lack the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into compliance.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   U.S. officials also face strong opposition from Russia, whose
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday the move could lead
to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Marshal Sergeyev said in
Athens, Greece.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on those divisions, not
only between the Russians and NATO but within the Western Alliance
itself.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position, of letting tens of thousands
of people to starve or freeze to death this winter...'' Clinton
said.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said
``NATO will take a decision of their own.'' That implied the
alliance would not insist on the U.N. approval, some U.S. allies
and Russia believe necessary.
	   Preparations for intervention continued in Yugoslavia and
abroad.
	   Britain, France and Germany all recommended that their citizens
leave Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   In Belgrade the city government said it was making preparations
for possible strikes. Warning sirens blared in some Serbian towns.
Some opposition parties said mobilization of air defense reservists
was underway.
	   Meanwhile, Milosevic tried to show that he was working to settle
Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic to
the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika daily carried a front-page
headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased in Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international diplomatic observers have disputed Serb claims.
	   Poland's foreign minister, the current chairman of OSCE
expressed disappointment with Yugoslavia's offer, saying it allowed
for a ``brief, improvised'' mission to Kosovo, which he described
as different from what the OSCE wanted.
	   The minister, Bronislaw Geremek, still stopped short of
rejecting the offer outright, calling it a new one that required
study.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   Western leaders say all moves to end the conflict must be
verifiable and irreversible.

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had
made ``significant progress'' toward a West Bank accord and hope to
conclude it at a Washington summit next week.
	   ``Basically, we have a lot to do,'' Albright said in Jerusalem,
as she prepared to fly to Brussels, Belgium, and then to London to
grapple with the unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The
summit opens Oct. 15 and could last more than one day.
	   ``I am very realistic about their having to make the hard
decisions,'' Albright said of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who will be
negotiating with the direct participation of President Bill Clinton
at an undisclosed site in the Washington area.
	   ``Their body language has been fairly positive,'' she said.
``But you can't get away from the fact they do have to make the
hard choices.''
	   There were both symbolic and solid signs of progress after
nearly two years of deadlock.
	   Arafat invited Netanyahu to a lamb and fish lunch he hosted for
Albright at a Palestinian guest house after the three-way talks.
Netanyahu smoked a cigar after the meal, and later told Israelis
the food Arafat served was kosher.
	   A senior U.S. official said, meanwhile, that the two sides
agreed on the establishment of an industrial zone in Gaza in
December and the formation of an anti-incitement committee that
would include educators and journalists. The aim is to deter
provocative statements on both sides.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said CIA
Director George Tenet met Tuesday with Israeli and Palestinian
security officials. No details were provided, but the CIA for years
has been assisting in the coordination of information about
terrorism.
	   At a news conference, Albright said: ``We are in a far better
position to finalize all the issues'' needed to conclude an
agreement on the West Bank.
	   ``The president is going to be very much involved in a lot of
the detailed work,'' Albright said. ``He has a very special and
uncanny ability to work with people who have difficult problems
like these. He puts himself in their shoes.''
	   ``I can say we climbed the foothills. We still have a very large
mountain to scale in Washington,'' Netanyahu told reporters after
returning to Jerusalem. If the Washington summit is successful, he
said, he won't rule out beginning negotiations with Arafat at the
summit on an overall settlement.
	   This would mean dealing with even more difficult issues than an
Israeli pullback on the West Bank. The Palestinians are insisting
on a state and placing its capital in Jerusalem.
	   ``Are the Palestinians ready to fulfill their commitments, to
revoke the PLO charter, to fight terror, to fulfill completely
their part of the agreement under the principle of reciprocity?''
Netanyahu asked. ``If the answer is yes, there will be an
agreement. Period.''
	   Said Arafat, ``Until now, the Israeli side did not give any sign
of approval for the American initiative, but in spite of that we
are continuing our negotiations today.''
	   In an exchange with reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office,
Clinton said he was eager for the talks to start.
	   ``It may take more than a day, yes,'' he said. ``I asked them to
black out a couple of days to come back because I think it's very
important that we try to get over these last humps and get into the
last stage of negotiations.''
	   ``I'm prepared to invest as much time as it takes,'' he said,
adding that he would stay closely involved. ``I will be involved
constantly throughout the process, yes,'' he said.
	   ``I'm encouraged by the attitude and the sense of openness I
felt from Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat the last time
they were here,'' Clinton said. ``And if they can come back here
with that spirit, we're close enough now that we can get this done.
And I just hope and pray that that will happen when they come
back.''
	   Albright praised the cooperation of Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   ``This new spirit was very helpful and I hope very much that it
will be carried on to Washington,'' she said. ``I am very realistic
that there are still hard decisions to be made.''
	   Albright noted this was the first time that Netanyahu had
ventured into Palestinian-held territory. ``These two leaders here
are putting their shoulders to the wheel,'' she said.

Ukrainian prosecutor says corruption probe near completion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Investigators could soon complete a
corruption probe against a top Ukrainian opposition leader and ask
parliament to revoke his immunity from prosecution, a news agency
said Wednesday.
	   The investigation into Pavlo Lazarenko could be finished within
three months if some necessary information arrives from abroad,
said prosecutor general Mykhailo Potebenko.
	   ``We have a case in which everything is linked to foreign
countries, to the banks of other countries, which have their own
laws,'' Potebenko told Ukrainian journalists, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``I might say today that we've worked very actively. We have
enough data to start criminal proceedings'' against some people in
the case, Potebenko added.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain when he was Ukrainian prime minister from
1996-97, and of reaping huge profits from gas imports.
	   Lazarenko, who heads the centrist opposition Hromada movement,
allegedly gave preferential status in the country's gas market to
the Unified Energy Systems, headed at the time by fellow Hromada
leader Julia Timoshenko.
	   Potebenko's investigation resulted in a major scandal last month
when authorities charged a former government official and Hromada
activist with abusing his position and embezzlement.
	   Mykola Syvulskiy, former deputy finance minister and deputy
Central Bank chief, was charged with illegally transferring more
than dlrs 5 million from the state gas company Ukrgazprom to UES.
	   Timoshenko has protested against the investigation, saying the
case was politically motivated and organized by President Leonid
Kuchma and his close supporters.
	   Syvulskiy holds a senior position in Hromada and has been trying
to organize a referendum on Kuchma's resignation.
	   Potebenko has dismissed any suggestions of politics in the case
and vowed to completed his Hromada-linked probe. On Wednesday, he
said he signed an order releasing Syvulskiy from jail for health
reasons.
	   In another twist in the case, Potebenko's office asked
parliament to lift the immunity of lawmaker Mykola Agafonov, who is
suspected of the theft of state property and other offenses,

Rafter crashes out; Rusedski advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Rafter match. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Second-ranked Patrick Rafter crashed
out in the first round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors on
Wednesday, toppled in straight sets by Czech Daniel Vacek.
	   The two-time U.S. Open champion surrendered 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to
Vacek after an hour and a half of play.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' Rafter said. ``But that's often the case in
indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No. 1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces ...
quickly.''
	   Rafter narrowly lost the first set to Vacek, before taking a
medical time-out so his therapist could massage his left hip.
	   Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to
struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the
form which won him six titles this season.
	   Trailing 15-40 at 4-5, Rafter suddenly rallied, saving two match
points and winning four consecutive points to stay alive.
	   But Vacek converted his next chance.
	   The Czech held his own serve and then blasted four return
winners to clinch the match at love.
	   ``Daniel kept serving as hard as possible,'' said Rafter, who
will next play in Vienna, Lyon, Stuttgart and Paris. ``I served
pretty well but I need to put more pressure on my opponents and
construct points better indoors.''
	   The 28-year-old Vacek, a doubles specialist still looking for
his first singles title, will face France's Fabrice Santoro in the
second round.
	   In other first-round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defense of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier
Axel Pretzsch.
	   ``Hopefully I'll be successful here,'' said Rusedski, the losing
finalist in Toulouse last weekend. ``I like it here and I have a
record of nine wins and only one loss here.''
	   Ranked 14th on the tour, Rusedski needed just 52 minutes to rout
Pretzsch, who defeated veterans Niklas Kulti of Sweden and Czech
Martin Damm to qualify.
	   Rusedski used his dominant serve to get three consecutive aces
and take the firt game against Pretzsch easily.
	   Rusedski's return proved just as effective against the young
German, playing in his first career ATP Tour event.
	   While Pretzsch managed to hold his opening serve of the match,
the Briton easily broke him twice in each set on way to the second
round.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I played,'' said Rusedski,
returning to form after spending two months nursing his left ankle
after tearing ligaments at Queens in June. ``Everything is coming
together nicely.''
	   Rusedski will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil,
in the second round.
	   Later, world No. 1 Pete Sampras was to play 1994 champion Wayne
Ferreira, while wildcard Boris Becker faced Sweden's Thomas
Johansson.

Ford stuns, Armani reassures on Milan runways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Amazing. That was Tom Ford's favorite
hyperbole at a breakfast chitchat with reporters to interpret his
Spring-Summer 1999 collection.
	   And the young Texan designer, who in just a few years has turned
the staid and of late decaying Gucci firm into a glamour power
house was right on.
	   From the moccasin lace-up boots to the beaded grunge jeans to
the rubberized cream colored skirts lined in luscious silk, the
latest Gucci collection presented Tuesday evening was a non-stop
series of ``amazing'' pieces.' .
	   Definitely Las Vegas, clearly L.A., the collection never lost
its sense of limit which has made Ford a favorite son among the
glitterati looking for a contemporary way to be glamourous.
	   Ford, who has just opened a high-tech boutique on Milan's
fashionable Via Monte Napoleone, described his collection as
``eclectic and eccentric,'' with inspirations ranging from Native
Americans to Hawaiian, from hippie to biker girl.
	   From the American Indians he gleaned the fringing and beading as
well as feathered embroidery, such as the back pockets on his
rhinestone-studded jeans with beaded cuffs. Definitely up-scale
hippie was the denim skirt plastered with purple sequined roses.
	   His palette for both solids and prints jumped off a Hawaiian
shirt of the 1960's. From turquoise to lemon, lime and fuchsia,
these bright shades were used for hipster pants, demure slip
dresses and plasticized bikinis alike.
	   This collection was all about flash, not flesh, with just a
little bit of skin showing between the beaded apron tops and
low-waisted skirts and pants.
	   The staple Gucci shoe came in a colorful mid-heel sling back
with a few amazing feather flip-flops and fringed knee high boots.
	   There are few belts for the new season, but rather a biker
inspired elasticized leather waistband. Far from the saddle brown
bags of the past, the classic Gucci bag shines in bright crayon
colors.
	   The collection drew stadium hoots and whistles from the
amazingly lively fashion crowd, which usually limits appreciation
to polite clapping.
	   Shortly before the Gucci show, applause went to another Milan
fashion giant, Giorgio Armani.
	   After the Parisian disaster, when last March the French police
blocked his mega Emporio event at the last minute, and the
subsequent rerun of the collection during the New York
presentations, Armani brought his second-line Emporio back to where
it belongs: the quiet runway of his downtown Milan palazzo.
	   Tuesday's presentation was reassuringly Armani from the
ultra-soft suits, to the delicately puffed skirts, to the sheer,
but never transparent evening pants.
	   Emporio, aimed at the younger set and styled by the designer's
niece Silvana, highlights casual elegance. Thus a waistband is
elasticized, but adorned with an obi sash belt, while footwear
ranges from gold- and silver-colored running shoes to leather
espadrilles.
	   Evening at Emporio is made up of small tops under long chiffon
cardigans, paired with unfussy see-through trousers, and delicate
slip dresses with sequined straps.
	   The Emporio color scheme has a base of pearl gray, blended with
rainbow pastels and an occasional rich pink.
	   Early Wednesday, Moschino presented its fashion follies for next
year's warmer weather. The house has maintained the late designer's
tongue in cheek style, offering handbags shaped like a tool box,
milk carton or sand pail. Hats in stuffed silk ranged in shape from
red hearts to a black hand raised in an insulting gesture.
	   Between the cracks the collection offered a sensible wardrobe,
from chic trench coat, to pastel-colored diaphanous evening wear.

Defense ministry asks Israeli arms industry to merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Acknowledging that the world financial
crisis has plagued its defense industry, Israel Wednesday asked
local arms manufacturers to merge into one company in order to
remain competitive.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Ilan Biran, director-general of
Israel's defense ministry, called upon private Israeli and foreign
companies to cooperate in joint ventures to avoid costly
duplication in research and development and overseas sales.
	   Biran acknowledged that convincing Israel's traditionally
competitive arms manufacturers to cooperate or even merge would be
difficult, but said that the move was necessary since the global
recession has lowered demand for their products.
	   ``Will it happen tomorrow? No. Is there recognition,
understanding, that this is necessary? Yes,'' Biran said. Revenues
for Israel's defense industry are expected to plunge from dlrs 2.5
billion in 1997 to a projected dlrs 1.5 billion in 1998, Biran
said.
	   The defense ministry will push its plan at a conference later
this month where Israeli and foreign weapons manufacturers,
including American giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are
expected to discuss joint ventures projects.

Russia fears airstrikes could lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to UPDATE with Britain trying to arrange
meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia pushed Wednesday for a meeting of the
six-country Contact Group on Yugoslavia, and warned that NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia would only lead to more bloodshed in
Kosovo province.
	   The Interfax news agency said Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov made
an ``emergency departure'' to London for a meeting of the Contact
Group of Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France and
Italy.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry could not confirm his plans, but
the British Foreign Office said it was trying to arrange a meeting
for Thursday evening.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO airstrikes
against Serbia, the main component of Yugoslavia, would be like a
declaration of war.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Sergeyev said in Athens
after meeting with his Greek counterpart.
	   ``We believe diplomatic efforts must continue, and in these
efforts the whole of the European community must be involved,'' he
said.
	   Russia objects to the violent methods Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used to crack down on separatist Kosovo, but
it opposes NATO airstrikes. Russia and Serbia are long-time allies,
sharing a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has been trying to drum up support in
phone calls this week to other world leaders. On Wednesday he spoke
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is visiting China.
	   Yeltsin told Blair that airstrikes ``would be disastrous for
global peace and drastically change the situation'' in the region,
a Kremlin statement said.
	   Also Wednesday, leaders of the State Duma, Russia's lower house
of parliament, said they wanted to meet with Moscow-based
ambassadors of NATO countries to discuss Kosovo.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Top seeds Pete Sampras and Patrick
Rafter both crashed out in the first round of the dlrs 1 million
Swiss Indoors on Wednesday.
	   Sampras, winner of three titles this season including Wimbledon,
was toppled by South AFrican Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3
only hours after Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech
Daniel Vacek.
	   Sampras, playing for the first time since he was eliminated in
the semifinals of the U.S. Open last month by Rafter, got off to a
strong start but slowly began to crumble.
	   Sampras' and Rafter's defeats mark the departure of the
tournament's biggest draws and its three Grand Slam champions this
year. Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion, was eliminated in
the first round on Tuesday, losing 6-2, 6-4 to Germany's Nicolas
Kiefer.
	   Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion surrendered 7-6 (9-7),
7-5 to Vacek after an hour and a half of play.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' Rafter said. ``But that's often the case in
indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No. 1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces ...
quickly.''
	   Rafter narrowly lost the first set to Vacek, before taking a
medical time-out so his therapist could massage his left hip.
	   Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to
struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the
form which won him six titles this season.
	   Trailing 15-40 at 4-5, Rafter suddenly rallied, saving two match
points and winning four consecutive points to stay alive.
	   But Vacek converted his next chance.
	   The Czech held his own serve and then blasted four return
winners to clinch the match at love.
	   ``Daniel kept serving as hard as possible,'' said Rafter, who
will next play in Vienna, Lyon, Stuttgart and Paris. ``I served
pretty well but I need to put more pressure on my opponents and
construct points better indoors.''
	   The 28-year-old Vacek, a doubles specialist still looking for
his first singles title, will face France's Fabrice Santoro in the
second round.
	   In other first-round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defense of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier
Axel Pretzsch.
	   ``Hopefully I'll be successful here,'' said Rusedski, the losing
finalist in Toulouse last weekend. ``I like it here and I have a
record of nine wins and only one loss here.''
	   Ranked 14th on the tour, Rusedski needed just 52 minutes to rout
Pretzsch, who defeated veterans Niklas Kulti of Sweden and Czech
Martin Damm to qualify.
	   Rusedski used his dominant serve to get three consecutive aces
and take the firt game against Pretzsch easily.
	   Rusedski's return proved just as effective against the young
German, playing in his first career ATP Tour event.
	   While Pretzsch managed to hold his opening serve of the match,
the Briton easily broke him twice in each set on way to the second
round.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I played,'' said Rusedski,
returning to form after spending two months nursing his left ankle
after tearing ligaments at Queens in June. ``Everything is coming
together nicely.''
	   Rusedski will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil,
in the second round.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' Rafter said. ``But that's often the case in
indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No. 1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces ...
quickly.''
	   Rafter narrowly lost the first set to Vacek, before taking a

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Waterskiing will be one of two new sports
proposed for the 2004 Olympics, the Greek Olympic Committee said
Wednesday.
	   Each host city can propose two new sports for inclusion as
exhibition events in the Games. Athens' second proposal is expected
to be decided at the committee's meeting Oct. 23.
	   ``Waterskiing was chosen because it has worldwide acclaim, broad
development in Greece and it is certain that it will attract many
Greek and foreign fans,'' said the announcement from the committee.

Mexican steel company accuse Russia, Ukraine of dumping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's two largest steel companies
asked the Department of Commerce on Wednesday to apply punitive
tariffs against hot-rolled steel from Russia and Ukraine.
	   Altos Hornos de Mexico SA and Hylsamex SA said they have jointly
filed a dumping complaint, claiming Russian and Ukrainian
steelmakers are flooding the country with hot-rolled steel at
prices below the cost of production.
	   The two companies said in a news release that during the first
half of 1998, imports of hot-rolled steel from Russia and Ukraine
increased 404 percent compared with the year-earlier period.
	   Hot-rolled steel is a basic commodity used in a wide variety of
manufactured goods.
	   Hylsamex and Altos Hornos said hot-rolled steel from the Ukraine
and Russia is priced in Mexico around 30 percent lower than the
same product from other nations.
	   The Mexican steelmakers said the dumping margins were 23 percent
to 45 percent for the steel from Russia and between 50 percent and
138 percent from Ukrainian exporters.
	   Altos Hornos and Hylsamex called on the Department of Commerce
to impose ``definitive'' tariffs against steel from those
countries.
	   The companies are also seeking rapid action, fearing the U.S.
and Canada will impose penalties on steel from the two nations,
resulting in an even greater amount arriving in Mexico.

Gazprom says it's close to deal to fund pipeline to Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly said Wednesday it
was close to obtaining a loan from a consortium of Italian banks to
build a pipeline from southern Russia to Turkey.
	   The loan for building the pipeline, which would stretch across
the Black Sea, would be underwritten by Italy's export
credit-insurance agency SACE, said Yuri Komarov, head of Gazprom's
export arm, Gazexport.
	   Gazprom officials refused to say how big the loan would be, or
which Italian banks are involved.
	   SACE officials said the agency has received no request for
credit to build the pipeline although there have been technical
discussions on the issue.
	   The 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline will stretch from the
southern Russian town of Zhubga to the Turkish port of Samsun.
Running up to 2,150 meters (7,050 feet) under the Black Sea, it
would be by far the deepest underwater pipeline in the world, said
Yuri Goryainov, a Gazprom board member.
	   Goryainov said the Russian part of the project is estimated at
dlrs 8 billion, and is expected to be completed in 2000. It would
initially carry 3 billion cubic meters (106 billion cubic feet) of
Russian natural gas to Turkey, whose energy demand is growing
rapidly. By 2010, the volume is expected to increase to 16 billion
cubic meters (565 billion cubic feet).

Court confirms 34-year sentence of German doctor who killed
</HEADLINE>
children &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A court has rejected
an appeal by a German doctor who was sentenced to 34 years for
murdering his two young children while vacationing on the Spanish
resort island of Mallorca two years ago, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   The Balearic Islands Superior Court upheld the prison sentence
handed down by a lower court in June when Ruedeger Oyntzen was
convicted and sentenced after he admitted having injected his
8-year-old daughter Katherina and 6-year-old son Mathias with a
lethal mix of drugs back in September, 1996.
	   Oyntzen, who was arrested shortly after the killings, was also
ordered by the lower court to pay his estranged wife and mother of
the dead children 25 million pesetas (dlrs 170,000).
	   Oyntzen had taken his children for a two-week vacation to the
Mediterranean island off the eastern Spanish coast in the aftermath
of losing a custody battle in Germany.
	   After his arrest, the 40-year-old radiologist from Breisach,
Germany, said the loss of custody had prompted him to kill his
children.

Chechen opposition joins forces to dismiss president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thirty-five opposition groups set up an agency
Wednesday to coordinate their efforts to oust Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The groups accuse Maskhadov of violating Chechnya's constitution
and laws. Interfax gave no details of the allegations.
	   Opposition leader Shamil Basayev, who had has led a weeklong
demonstration against Maskhadov in Chechnya's capital Grozny,
indicated there were no plans to use force to get rid of Maskhadov.
	   ``We are being accused of plotting to overthrow the president,
while we demand that he should become a law-abiding citizens,''
Basayev was quoted as saying.
	   Maskhadov planned to meet with parliamentary deputies on
Thursday to discuss the calls for his resignation.
	   Chechnya insists it is an independent state and has been running
its own affairs since the end of the 1994-96 independence war
against Moscow. But no country, including Russia, has recognized
Chechnya's sovereignty.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday issued a
fresh warning over Kosovo to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
as the Foreign Office told Britons to leave the Balkan state.
	   Britain also began preparations for a hastily called meeting of
the so-called Contact Group in London on Thursday to discuss the
crisis. That group includes the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Russia.
	   ``President Milosevic may think the international community will
not act. But in the end it will act, and we're at the end now, and
he must listen to our warnings or face the consequences,'' Blair
said in a speech to British business representatives in Beijing
during a visit to China.
	   In London, the Foreign Office said they were calling the Contact
Group meeting at the United State's urging. Americans were expected
to brief the group about senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's
efforts to persuade Milosevic to pull his forces out of Kosovo,
said a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity.
She said ''no big decisions'' would be made at the meeting.
	   Meanwhile, the Foreign Office was also contacting on Wednesday
all 117 Britons registered as living in Yugoslavia, and advising
them to leave ``in view of the increasingly volatile situation,''
said a spokesman, speaking on the customary terms anonymity.
	   ``We advise against travel to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and we also advise British nationals in the FRY to leave
immediately,'' a statement from the Foreign Office said. The
warning was transmitted on British Broadcasting Corp. World Service
radio, and posted on the Foreign Office's Internet website.
	   Earlier Prime Minister Blair, who has spoken to both Russian and
United States presidents in the past 24 hours, said military action
was drawing closer, and that NATO is ready to use military force to
halt the bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``There's no doubt at all that we have to take action to prevent
a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo,'' Blair said in a BBC radio
interview from Beijing. ``People like myself have been saying for a
long period of time now if we don't act, or threaten to act, then
President Milosevic will simply take no notice of us.''
	   His comments came on the heels of United Nations Security
Council members calling Tuesday for ``full and sustained
compliance'' with the two-week-old resolution demanding that
Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo and end its attacks on
civilians.
	   Serbian military police still maintain a strong presence in
Kosovo despite repeated international demands for them to ease
their crackdown on separatists.
	   ``We have to make sure now that (Milosevic) is complying with
the UN resolutions,'' Blair said. ``We have to make sure he is
withdrawing from a position where he is able to commit these
atrocities, these acts of barbarism in Kosovo.''
	   Asked when attacks might take place, Blair said: ``We have to
judge the timing, but it's pretty clear that this issue is coming
to a point of urgency.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ A new anti-doping cycling funded
by national federations, cycling teams and riders, met Wednesday
and looked to continue the battle to clean up its sport.
	   The group, which includes representatives of the UCI, riders and
professional teams, considered ways of fighting the acknowledged
widespread drug abuse among cyclists.
	   The new Council for the Fight Against Doping (CFAD) said its
initial budget of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4 million) will be
used to be used for increased anti-doping and blood tests, medical
coverage and contributions to research.
	   Cycling has been rocked in recent months by the doping scandal
during the Tour de France.
	   Denmark's Bjarne Riis, winner of the 1996 Tour de France, and
1988 World Champion Maurizio Fondriest of Italy represented riders
on the UCI group.
	   Roger Legeay, who once headed three-time Tour de France winner
Greg LeMond's cycling team in France, and Daniel Baal, the
president of the French Cycling Federation, were also part of the
group that is led by International Cycling Union president Hein
Verbruggen.
	   The CFAD also agreed to have a doctor act as a medical
controller when the UCI starts creating medical dossiers on each of
its member cyclists starting Jan. 1, 1999.
	   It also said it will emphasize research of EPO detection.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Lebanon's ambassador to the Ivory
Coast on Wednesday denied any role in a scandal involving
allegations of forced sexual encounters with a 14-year old Ivorian
boy.
	   ``I don't know if there's another Lebanese ambassador in the
Ivory Coast but I was not even in the country at the time of the
alleged encounter,'' Daher said during a press conference.
	   A French-language newspaper, Le Jour, reported earlier this week
that Daher had been involved in sexually abusing the teen-ager.
	   The teen-ager, who was not named, was allegedly abducted,
drugged and then sexually assault over the course of six months, Le
Jour reported. The newspaper claimed Daher was involved in at least
one encounter with the victim.
	   Former Ivorian government minister Ezan Akele was also
implicated in the case and several Lebanese businessmen have
already been arrested.
	   ``I represent a country which has given lots of economic and
social support to the Ivory Coast,'' Daher said. ``I am profoundly
distressed.''
	   Security Ministry officials speaking on condition of anonymity
confirmed the arrest of six people including four Lebanese
nationals in connection with the case, which was still under
investigation.
	   They gave no other details except to say that the boy in
question is seriously ill.
	   This is the first time in the Ivory Coast that arrests have been
made based on charges of this nature, the officials said.
	   An official at Lebanon's embassy in Abidjan denied allegations
that Daher was linked to the case.
	   ``It's a set-up,'' the consular officer said, refusing to give
his name.

	   EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had
made ``significant progress'' toward a West Bank accord and hope to
conclude it at a summit with President Bill Clinton next week.
	   ``Basically, we have a lot to do,'' Albright said in Jerusalem,
as she prepared to fly to Brussels, Belgium, and then to London to
grapple with the unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The
summit opens Oct. 15 and could last more than one day.
	   ``I am very realistic about their having to make the hard
decisions,'' Albright said of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who will be

Observers seeking the truth of claims, counter-claims in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's decision on whether to
launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia will be based partly on
reports from guys in the field _ guys like Ron Capps, a U.S.
diplomatic monitor who spends his days driving around Kosovo
province to see how bad things really are.
	   His first stop Wednesday was a sprawling refugee camp in the
rocky hills outside Kisna Reka village, where about 3,000 ethnic
Albanians are living in boxy huts made of plastic sheeting.
	   Capps has been here before, and people are glad to see him. A
spiral notebook tucked in his back pocket, he strides from hut to
hut, shaking hands and asking questions.
	   What supplies do people need? Are they getting enough aid from
humanitarian groups? And _ most important _ when will they feel
safe enough to go home? Are Serb forces still surrounding the area?
	   ``We appreciate very much all you are doing,'' says a camp
leader, who gave only his initials, H.N. ``But we are besieged from
all directions, and it's very difficult to get food.''
	   Out comes the notebook, and Capps jots down the answers, his
brow creased with worry: People need clothes, shoes, flour and
food. And there's been no reduction in Serb forces, despite the
government's claims to the contrary.
	   Capps' notes are for the daily report of Kosovo's diplomatic
observers, about 50 in all, from the United States, Canada, the
European Union and Russia. Since July, they have been recording the
results of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's brutal military
offensive against the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians who
make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   NATO officials have threatened military strikes unless Milosevic
complies with U.N. demands including a cease-fire, a withdrawal of
Serb troops, and the return of refugees to their villages.
	   Capps, 40, a native of Virginia Beach, Virginia, has a system:
He and his partner, Rob Jennings, check in with the same refugees
regularly to see if conditions have improved and if people are
ready to go home. The U.N. refugee agency estimates there are
50,000 people living in camps or out in the woods in Kosovo, driven
from villages burned down by Serb troops.
	   Capps stops outside a sturdy hut made of wood and mud, and
covered in plastic. Blankets and thin mattresses cover the floor
where two brothers, both farmers, have been living with their
families for months, since Serbs burned their houses and their
wheat fields in Kisna Reka, just a few kilometers (miles) away.
	   ``This is quite a construction you've got here,'' Capps tells
the brothers. ``How long you planning to stay?''
	   ``We'll stay until they move out the troops,'' says one brother.
``Because it's not safe in the village.''
	   ``We just hope we won't reach the winter, that diplomacy will
work,'' says the other brother. Neither man would give his name,
out of fear of retribution from Serb police.
	   Capps and his partner get back in their armored four-wheel drive
vehicle, decorated with U.S. flag decals, and drive toward their
next destination: a village of 7,000 people that has taken in 4,000
refugees. Capps shares information about what refugees need with
aid agencies, and he wants to make sure the village school got the
textbooks he requested.
	   Along the way, the team passes through the town of Malisevo, a
former stronghold for rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army that
Serb forces burned this summer. Serb police are still in the area,
villagers claim Serbs are still shelling, and police units are
living in bombed out or burned houses in nearly every village along
the main road.
	   Serb police at a roadblock stop the team, advising them to take
a different route to avoid land mines. At last, after about an
hour, the observers reach the village, where they learn the
textbooks have not arrived. Capps promises to remind UNICEF.
	   He asks one more question: What will the villagers do if NATO
strikes? One villager, who works for the Mother Theresa charity,
says the ethnic Albanians fear attack from the 1,500 Serbs who live
in the village. He claims the Serbs are armed.
	   He also says he will urge the Albanians to ``keep quiet. Maybe
the Albanians will become emotional, and think they are strong and
seek revenge,'' he says.
	   Capps makes a note in his book.

Red Brigades founder leaves Rome prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After serving 24 years of a 30-year sentence for
terrorism, the founder of the Red Brigades is now free.
	   Italian news reports said Wednesday that a Rome court had
granted Renato Curcio freedom, although for some time he will be
under the surveillance of justice officials. If after a period,
they judge his behavior satisfactory, he will be unconditionally
free.
	   Five years ago the idealogue of Italy's most feared terrorist
gang in the 1970s and 1980s was allowed to leave prison during
daytime hours on a work-release program to work at a small
publishing firm.
	   Curcio was the last key figure from the leftist gang to gain
freedom after the so-called ''Years of Lead'' when the gang was
responsible for hundreds of attacks.
	   He was already in jail when the Red Brigades carried out their
most notorious attack, the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former
Premier Aldo Moro.
	   Another convicted terrorist was given freedom, although limited
to a four-day pass home. During his first pass after serving 17
years, Valerio Fioravanti had dinner with his family and his wife,
who, like him, is serving several life terms for terrorist attacks
blamed on right-wing groups.
	   Mambro, whom he married in prison, was also out on a temporary
pass issued for good behavior.

Report: Three children contract AIDS virus at Moscow hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three children were infected with the AIDS virus
after receiving tainted blood at a Moscow hospital, the Interfax
news agency said Wednesday.
	   The children all received transfusions of blood in September
that had tested positive for HIV in May but not been discarded,
Interfax said, quoting the Moscow Sanitation Inspection Center.
	   One of the children, who had been suffering from leukemia, died,
Interfax said.
	   The Sanitation Inspection Center said it sent a report to Moscow
police and prosecutors who will decide whether to open a criminal
investigation.

Shelters cleaned, sirens tuned as Serbs brace for NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Bomb shelters were cleaned, air raid
sirens were repaired and foodstuffs were stashed as Yugoslavs
braced Wednesday for possible NATO airstrikes.
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   ``In case of air raid alarm, shut down water and gas supply,
close all the windows and shutters, take a prepared bag with only
necessary clothes and head for your shelter,'' said the
instruction, widely read by Belgraders who have, slowly but
gradually, been overcome by the sense of panic.
	   ``At first, I never thought they would bomb us. This is Europe
after all. But now, I'm starting to panic,'' said Emilija Kacanac,
22-year-old university student, as her hands trembled.
	   U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke left Belgrade on Wednesday
after three meetings in which he tried to convince Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with U.N. orders and halt
the crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo
province.
	   But with no sign Milosevic is willing to comply, the prospect of
NATO airstrikes grew by the hour.
	   Most of the Belgrade shelters, not used since the Yugoslav
capital was bombed by Germans and Americans in World War II, were
filled with piles of old garbage.
	   Some of the shelters have been turned into discos and cafes. It
was estimated that only a third of Belgrade's 2 million people
could pack into the existing ones.
	   Despite an earlier announcement, air raid sirens in most of
Yugoslav cities could not be tested Wednesday because they are too
old and don't work.
	   ``The situation is quite messy, and we have to make quick
preparations,'' said Belgrade's city council head Spasoje Krunic.
``But I appeal on all citizens not to panic as everything will be
ready.''
	   Ignoring official appeals, people went on panic shopping causing
shortages of flour, sugar, cooking oil and other staples. Last
week, a shortage of fuel created lines at gas stations due to a
sudden increase in demand. Plane tickets for Western destinations
have been booked for a long while as the minority who could afford
it prepared to flee the country.
	   Many military aged men, fearing callup, don't open doors to
strangers or simply don't sleep at home. Some hospitals in Serbia
released patients who are not seriously ill, anticipating many
victims of the possible bombardment.
	   NATO said airstrikes, which could come within days if Western
leaders remain unconvinced Milosevic has halted his Kosovo
campaign, would ostensibly target Yugoslav military facilities.
	   But most of Yugoslavs remain unconvinced with the NATO claims,
and have prepared for the worst.
	   ``I prepared a towel, biscuits and a bottle of water,'' said
Marija Stanisavljevic, 77. ``Only, don't know how my neighbors will
react when I bring my cat into the shelter. I go nowhere without
her.''

Italy's premier takes case to save government to Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported name of party; color &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A breakaway faction of Italy's Communist party on
Wednesday indicated it would take up Premier Romano Prodi's appeal
for support, boosting the chances that the center-left government
could survive a confidence vote.
	   The leadership of the Communist Refoundation party, prodded by
its No. 1, party secretary Fausto Bertinotti, had decided over the
weekend to withdraw support for Prodi, saying the proposed 1999
budget did not do enough to stimulate job creation.
	   Prodi, who has relied on the Communists' votes in the lower
Chamber of Deputies for a majority throughout his 2 1/2 year term,
was forced to call the confidence vote, expected Friday, to
determine whether his coalition is still viable.
	   Arguing that Italy needs political stability to maintain its
place within Europe and the European Monetary Union, Prodi went
before Parliament earlier Wednesday and appealed to his frayed
majority to reunite.
	   ``I don't think that any of the forces in the majority can hold
back their support,'' Prodi told lawmakers. ``I think that even
you, Bertinotti, must be feeling the same weight and the same
responsibilities that we feel.''
	   Hours after Prodi spoke, the Communists' No. 2, Armando
Cossutta, told hundreds of his followers that it was time to
``disobey'' the party's hard-line stance and support Prodi despite
unhappiness over the budget.
	   In a gesture symbolizing a party schism, Cossutta reached over
the head of a seated, glum Bertinotti to shake hands with backers
who supported the No. 2's choice to buck Bertinotti's line and
stick with Prodi.
	   Italian news reports said Cossutta's followers would form a new
party known as Italian Communists.

Jamaica on way to defeat of U.S.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica were well on their way to
beating the United States Wednesday in their Red Stripe Bowl
cricket match at Chedwin Park with a lunchtime score of 61 for the
loss of one wicket.
	   Raymond Ferguson was the man out for an aggressive 28. Robert
Samuels was unbeaten on 31.
	   The Americans, who lost by 242 runs to defending champions
Leeward Islands in their opening match Tuesday, again looked out of
their depth and were dismissed for another modest 107 runs in 43.1
overs.
	   Only middle-order batsmen David Hoilette and captain Richard
Staple looked at home against the Jamaican attack headed by West
Indian fastbowler Franklyn Rose. Rose made early inroads in the USA
batting by dismissing the first two batsmen and was the best of the
Jamaican attack with three wickets.
	   Hoilette, a former Jamaica player, topscored with 31 and was the
last man out. Staple, also a one-time Jamaica player, played
steadily for a patient 24 before he was run out in the 28th over.
Of the other batsmen, only Desmond Richards with 14 reached double
figures.

French court refuses to free ex-spy facing extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An appeals court on Wednesday turned down a request
by a renegade British former spy to be freed until France rules on
whether he should be extradited to face charges at home.
	   David Shayler, who sold information on Britain's MI5
intelligence agency to a London newspaper, failed to persuade the
court he should be freed pending the extradition ruling.
	   A French prosecutor argued that releasing the former MI5 agent
could endanger other agents. Shayler had reportedly considered
releasing more information on the Internet.
	   A court on Oct. 21 is to examine arguments presented by British
authorities pressing for his extradition. If sent back to Britain,
he faces being charged under the Official Secrets Act.
	   The 32-year-old Shayler worked for MI5 from 1994 until 1997. He
fled to France last year after selling stories about the agency's
operations to a British newspaper.
	   He maintains, among other things, that Britain plotted the
assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation the
government denies.
	   Libya also has asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Shayler was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1 after living with his
girlfriend in a remote part of rural France. He is being held in La
Sante prison without charge.

Government to ban airing of foreign media programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian government officials ordered
independent media Wednesday to stop broadcasting foreign media
programs and said an official ban will follow.
	   Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic and Deputy Premier Milovan
Bojic met editors of Serbian non-government radio and television
stations to convey the order. The meeting came after a written
warning sent to the media earlier this week.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior'' accordingly, said Bojic,
referring to possible NATO air strikes against Serbia. ``This is
not an appeal. This is an order,'' he said according to the Beta
news ageny.
	   ``We must defend the sovereignty of our country,'' Vucic
declared.
	   According to the two government officials, transmitting of
Serbian-language programs by BBC, Voice of America, Deuche Welle
and Radio Free Europe, while Yugoslavia is threatened with NATO air
strikes, spreads ``panic and defeatism.''
	   They said the move was a temporary measure which would last
while the country faces the danger of a military intervention.
Vucic announced the government will issue an official decree.
	   Analysts in Belgrade believe that the autocratic government,
loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, would use the
concern over NATO threats to silence his pro-western opponents at
home.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia accuse foreign media and local
independent media of fabricating reports about Kosovo in order to
provoke NATO action. In a statement Wednesday,Milosevic also
mentioned a ``media campaign against our country.''
	   An association of independent media has warned the next move
could be closure of many radio and TV stations in Serbia. It was
not clear whether the media would obey the government order.

Ambassador: US fears Kosovo crisis spillover into Macedonia,
</HEADLINE>
Albania &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The United States fears a continuation of
the Kosovo crisis could spill over into neighboring countries and
destabilize the Balkan region, the U.S. ambassador to Athens said
in an interview broadcast Wednesday.
	   ``We are concerned that if the Kosovo crisis ... does not end,
it may have a profoundly negative effect on both the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and on Albania,'' Nicholas Burns,
the former State Department spokesman, told the private Mega
television channel.
	   ``Unfortunately I think we're very close to a military
intervention,'' he said. ``The only language that (Yugoslav
President Slobodan) Milosevic seems to understand is a language of
force.''
	   Hundreds have been killed and more than 250,000 people have been
driven from their homes in the predominantly Albanian-populated
Serb province, where government forces have battled ethnic Albanian
separatists for more than six months.
	   Both NATO and the U.S. are prepared ``to make sure that the poor
people of Kosovo who get victimized by ... brutal policies can be
protected,'' Burns said.
	   ``We would prefer not to use force,'' he told Mega. ``We would
prefer to see Mr. Milosevic retreat, pull his army out and allow
the international community, ... to come in and take care of these
poor people who have been devastated.''
	   But if this does not occur, military force will be ``seriously
considered,'' he added.
	   ``We've given Mr. Milosevic every opportunity for well over a
year to do the right thing in Kosovo,'' Burns noted. ``He's failed
to do it.''

Thousands to be granted amnesty in Turkmenistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 8,000 prisoners and people under
investigation will be granted an amnesty in the Central Asian
country of Turkmenistan, the Interfax news agency said Wednesday.
	   President Saparmurad Niyazov ordered the amnesties on Tuesday,
the 50th anniversary of a powerful earthquake that killed 160,000
people in the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat.
	   The amnesty applies to women, children, invalids, patients with
cancer or active tuberculosis, minors, veterans and men over 50,
said prosecutor general Kurbanbibi Atadzhanova.
	   It also applies to prisoners sentenced to less than 10 years for
non-premeditated crimes and less than five years for premeditated
crimes, and to anyone with less than six months to serve regardless
of their crime, Interfax said.
	   An earlier amnesty this year saw the release of 11,000 people.
	   Interfax did not say how many prisoners there were in the former
Soviet republic of 5 million people.

	   ARIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Despite requests by the United States to
halt Jewish settlement construction, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu conferred city status Wednesday to Ariel, a
large West Bank settlement slated for expansion.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Ariel came just hours after U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright departed the region after conducting
talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders aimed at agreement over
a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   ``We are building and will continue to build,'' Netanyahu said
to cheering crowds of settlers in Ariel.
	   ``When we declare Ariel as a city, as we do today, we thus
announce that this is a permanent place. This place will be part of
Israel in any final status agreement in the future,'' Netanyahu
said, indicating Ariel would remain under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Ariel, established in 1977, is in the middle of the West Bank,
30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv. Ariel's mayor, Ron
Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase
the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000
new housing units.
	   In addition, Netanyahu said a new cultural center would be built
and Ariel's community college would be expanded into a university.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's ceremony was
scheduled a long time ago, was not intended to send a political
message ``and was certainly not timed to coincide with Mrs.
Albright's visit here.''
	   Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy
accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a
message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
	   For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles
to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians denounce
the settlements as illegal incursions on land Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and where they hope to establish a
state.
	   Netanyahu said the new homes do not violate peace accords with
the Palestinians. ``We are not building new settlements, but we are
enabling the natural growth of the existing settlements to go on,''
Netanyahu said.
	   ``I would like to see Ariel double in size. We will continue at
this pace and build up this city more and more and more,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready for occupancy in
April. He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional
units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the
work has not begun.
	   Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when
Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on
construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to
cancel the freeze.
	   Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with
the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel
while the ceremony is in progress.
	   A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in
Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
	   Meanwhile, in the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron,
Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom laid a cornerstone
for future construction at the Tel Romeida Jewish settlement. One
month ago, a rabbi from the community was stabbed to death in his
trailer home there and the government agreed to build permanent
homes for several families who live there.
	   ``I hope there will be a permanent neighborhood here, one with
dozens of homes,'' Yahalom said at the ceremony.

 &UR; Festina's Stephens quits cycling

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - Australian cyclist Neil Stephens,
a member of the Festina team which was thrown out of this summer's
Tour de France, said he was retiring from the sport Wednesday.
	   Stephens, 35, said the doping scandal, which rocked the sport
and earned three of his teammates seven-month bans, had nothing to
due with his decision to quit after 14 years in professional
cycling, which he announced from his home in Spain.
	   The Festina team was excluded from the Tour de France after its
sporting director, Bruno Roussel, said there was an organized
policy of using banned substances on the team to improve
performances under medical care.
	   Stephens was one of the riders who constantly denied wrongdoing
although his Swiss teammates, Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin
Meier admitted using banned drugs.
	   Earlier this week the International Cycling Union (UCI) cut a
month from the original eight-month suspensions handed to the Swiss
riders by their national federation.
	   The UCI also requested the files of the remaining Festina riders
-- five French cyclists and Stephens -- be handled but these riders
have not yet been disciplined by their national federations.
	   Stephens was one of four Festina riders who won stages in the
1997 Tour de France in addition to Laurent Brochard taking the
world road title.
	   Stephens had been with Festina for two years

Russia fears airstrikes could lead to more bloodshed in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov comment on need for contact group
meeting, Duma deputy speaker saying airstrikes would hamper START
II ratification. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia pushed Wednesday for a meeting of the
six-country Contact Group on Yugoslavia, and warned that NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia would only lead to more bloodshed in
Kosovo province.
	   The Interfax news agency said Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov made
an ``emergency departure'' to London for a meeting of the Contact
Group of Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France and
Italy.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry could not confirm his plans, but
the British Foreign Office said it was trying to arrange a meeting
for Thursday evening.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO airstrikes
against Serbia, the main component of Yugoslavia, would be like a
declaration of war.
	   ``We evaluate that this is not a penalty or punishment of an
isolated country but almost a real war,'' Sergeyev said in Athens
after meeting with his Greek counterpart.
	   ``We believe diplomatic efforts must continue, and in these
efforts the whole of the European community must be involved,'' he
said.
	   Russia objects to the violent methods Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used to crack down on separatist Kosovo, but
it opposes NATO airstrikes. Russia and Serbia are long-time allies,
sharing a Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has been trying to drum up support in
phone calls this week to other world leaders. On Wednesday he spoke
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is visiting China.
	   Yeltsin told Blair that airstrikes ``would be disastrous for
global peace and drastically change the situation'' in the region,
a Kremlin statement said.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov joined in the telephone
diplomacy, calling Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi for the
second time in two days, Interfax reported.
	   Primakov stressed that an immediate meeting of the Contact Group
was becoming especially pressing, Interfax said.
	   Also Wednesday, leaders of the State Duma, Russia's lower house
of parliament, said they wanted to meet with Moscow-based
ambassadors of NATO countries to discuss Kosovo.
	   The deputy speaker of the Duma said airstrikes would make it
more difficult for Russian lawmakers to ratify the START II nuclear
arms reduction treaty.
	   ``Pushing the world to the brink of war is not the most
reasonable thing (U.S.) politicians are doing,'' said Sergei
Baburin.

Blair looks to promote ties with China, as dissident detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair speech; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police took a prominent dissident from his home
Wednesday, an awkward development for visiting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who later raised the case with Chinese
officials.
	   Police questioning of veteran democracy activist Xu Wenli
distracted from British and Chinese efforts to use Blair's visit,
the first by a British premier in seven years, to highlight
improving ties.
	   Xu, imprisoned for 12 years after the 1979 Democracy Wall
movement, is one of China's most outspoken and active dissidents.
Police went to his Beijing home Wednesday morning as he was eating
breakfast, around the time Blair was presiding over the signing of
contracts and plans for British business investments worth more
than dlrs 830 million.
	   Informed of Xu's case, Blair raised his concerns with China's
ambassador to London and with President Jiang Zemin, according to
British and Chinese officials.
	   Police allowed Xu home after quizzing him for about six hours on
efforts by other dissidents to set up an opposition party and
register as candidates for local elections. In an interview, Xu
said he believed Blair's intervention ``helped me get home a couple
of hours early.''
	   Blair's five-day visit is his first since the smooth handover of
Hong Kong to Chinese rule last year warmed ties after years of
rancor over the former British colony.
	   In a speech Wednesday to British business representatives in
Beijing, Blair said relations were entering ``a new era'' with
strong personal ties between the two sides' leaders and a growing
commercial relationship.
	   On human rights, Blair said Britain still had ``serious concerns
and differences'' about China's restrictions on political and
religious freedoms and its administration of Tibet. He called on
Chinese leaders to allow greater freedoms and dissent.
	   But at the same time, he defended the less public, less
confrontational stance that Britain, along with other European
nations and the United States, has taken on the issue.
	   This new ``spirit of cooperation'' is helpful in discussions of
human rights, he said.
	   ``When incidents like the questioning of a dissident this
morning do occur, there is at least a process of dialogue in which
they can be addressed and resolved,'' he said.
	   Blair did not raise any cases of human rights abuses or
religious repression in Tibet during his meeting Wednesday with
President Jiang, although he did mention Xu's case, said Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
	   Tang said Blair ``listened with interest'' to a lengthy lecture
Jiang gave about China's policy on Tibet, its role in ending
Tibetan serfdom and its economic aid.
	   The two leaders also discussed Asia's financial crisis, China's
economic reforms and its recovery from massively destructive
flooding this summer, Tang said.
	   Blair will champion British business interests Thursday in
Shanghai, China's financial capital. He will tour the stock
exchange, lunch with the mayor and open a factory and an insurance
office.
	   With distrust over Hong Kong behind them, Britain has become
China's No. 1 investor and second largest trading partner among
European Union nations. Trade for the first seven months of the
year totaled dlrs 3.48 billion, an increase of more than 18 percent
over the same period in 1997, according to Chinese officials.
	   He heads to Hong Kong Friday, his first visit since attending
the handover 15 months ago.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The annual international Book Fair in
Frankfurt was founded to boost the publishing business, but has
also become a powerful human rights forum pushing for freedom of
expression around the world.
	   Book fair sponsors used this year's event to initiate a prize
Wednesday called ``The Right to Publish Award'' to commemorate the
50th year of the Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Right in the middle of the award ceremony worth 10,000 marks
(dlrs 6,000) for embattled publisher Ayse Nur Zarakolu, who was
banned by Turkish officials until Wednesday from traveling to
Germany, a cry for help from Bangladesh arrived.
	   Taslima Nasrin, the author who enraged her countrymen in 1994
for allegedly saying the Koran should be rewritten, has gone into
hiding as Islamic extremists seek her death and offer 200,000 takas
(dlrs 5,000) for anyone who kills her.
	   Nasrin's appeal for help from the international community was
read by Gerhard Kurtze, who said the Association of International
Publishers would lodge a protest to the Bangladesh government
immediately.
	   A petition was circulated at the fair, where some 300,000
visitors are expected, to add weight to the protest.
	   Nasrin returned to Bangladesh last month after a self-imposed
four year exile in Europe and the United States to attend her
mother who has colon cancer.
	   Another persecuted writer, British author Salman Rushdie made a
surprise appearance at the fair's opening ceremony on Tuesday and
visited his German publishers exhibition on Wednesday.
	   With Iran's government recently distancing itself from a dlrs
2.5 million bounty placed on the head of Rushdie by a semi-official
Iranian foundation in 1989, a seemingly relaxed Rushdie, who has
largely been in hiding, appeared unannounced at the fair.
	   ``We knew he was coming but couldn't announce it. We are taking
no chances,'' a spokeswoman for Droemer publishers said.
	   Rushdie said he was glad to have his life back. He said he felt
he has been living in a tunnel or underground for the last 10
years.
	   Oppressed writers, artists, and journalists have recently gained
another safe haven in this city on the Main River.
	   Frankfurt's Multicultural Affairs office started a so-called
``City of Refuge Program,'' intended to get persecuted writers back
on their feet.
	   The first person taken into the program was Iranian dissident
author, Faraj Sarkuhi. He arrived in Frankfurt in May after
spending a year in prison for signing a petition to his government
asking for more freedom of expression.
	   Sarkuhi said he was tortured during his prison stay while his
wife and two children in Berlin were fed stories of his death from
official Iranian sources.
	   At the Zarakolu's award presentation that was accepted by her
son Sinan, former French minister of culture, Jack Lang, criticized
how democratic states waffle on human rights.
	   ``Im not sure democratic countries do all they could do to
protect human rights. For example, we, the French government,
entered an agreement with Turkey three years ago although we were
well aware of the suppression in the country.''
	   Lang said this year there were 700 authors arrested around the
world, 31 were murdered, 20 disappeared and 30 expelled from their
homelands.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Touching down Wednesday on an
airfield scattered with junked planes, a Fine Air cargo jet packed
with diapers, infant formula, rice and other supplies brought help
for those slammed by Hurricane Georges last month.
	   Groups of plane watchers, a popular activity here, were there to
see the precious cargo arrive from Miami. Some of the goods were
unloaded at the small airport before the DC-8 took off again for
stops in the neighboring Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
	   In all, about 28,000 kg (62,000 pounds) of supplies donated by
Citibank and Texaco were shipped to the Caribbean. Another 8,000 kg
(18,000 pounds) had to be left behind because it would not fit on
the plane.
	   ``We felt the effect of Andrew; we know what it's like,'' said
Patrick Kelly, president and CEO of Citibank in Miami.
	   Tons of Infamil, Pampers, canned meat and fish, blankets and
cots were loaded onto the plane in Miami. Staples such as rice,
beans, milk and flour, were packaged in pallets weighing as much as
4,500 kg (10,000 pounds).
	   ``The intent is to provide immediate relief for people who are
displaced,'' said Louis Varela of the Pan American Development
Foundation, which organized the shipment. ``It's not designed to
sustain them for an indefinite amount of time.''
	   Caribbean leaders contacted the Washington, D.C.-based
organization, which assists in Latin American and Caribbean
countries. The organization then solicited corporations for help.
	   ``It's corporate charity at its best when people do good things
for people,'' Varela said.
	   Citibank, which has previously worked with the foundation,
already had dlrs 20,000-worth of emergency supplies in a Miami
warehouse. The corporation also purchased an additional dlrs 50,000
in supplies.
	   Texaco contributed about dlrs 100,000 in supplies for
Wednesday's shipment.
	   Haiti was to receive more than 10,500 kg (23,000 pounds) of
supplies, about 11,500 kg (25,000 pounds) was to go to the
Dominican Republic and almost 6,500 kg (14,000 pounds) were
destined for Puerto Rico.
	   More than 400 people were killed in Georges' rampage through the
Caribbean, including at least 267 in the Dominican Republic. Scores
more are missing and tens of thousands were left homeless.

Moscow mayor calls for meeting of Russian lenders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov proposed Wednesday an
international conference of finance ministers from countries
seeking to collect debts from Russia.
	   ``This should be a joint decision aimed at restoring confidence
in Russia as a partner and as a debtor,'' Luzhkov told a news
conference, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``If we do not cooperate with the economic civilized world, we
will have complications.''
	   Luzhkov said he does not think Russia can find the money to pay
its international debts now.
	   The majority of the money Russia owes is to private companies
and banks rather than to governments, although some governments
such as Germany guaranteed the bank loans.

Scientists find why cranberries prevent urinary infections

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists believe they have figured out why
cranberry juice helps prevent urinary infections.
	   The secret, it seems, is concentrated tannins in the juice, also
known as proanthocyanidins.
	   Urinary infections are a common problem, especially among women,
and research has shown that drinking cranberry juice regularly can
help prevent them.
	   Amy B. Howell and others from Rutgers University conducted
experiments to understand exactly what in cranberry juice does
this. The study was financed by Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and
published as a letter in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   The test tube studies found that the concentrated tannins from
cranberry juice prevent E. coli bacteria, the main culprit in
urinary infections, from adhering to the cells that line the
urinary tract.
	   The scientists believe that the substance blocks the growth of
the part of the bacteria that is necessary for them to stick to the
walls of the bladder and kidney, a crucial step in infection.
	   Blueberries also contain the concentrated tannins. But many
other foods tested, including lemons, oranges, apples, bananas and
carrots, do not.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from right-wing religious leader in graf 6.
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's army chief resigned
Wednesday, two days after calling for the establishment of a
National Security Council that would have given the army a direct
role in policy decisions.
	   The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said Gen. Jehangir
Karamat ``applied for retirement'' and was distressed by the
``unnecessary debate'' his call for a National Security Council had
prompted.
	   Karamat was not immediately available for comment, but it is the
first time in Pakistan's history that an army chief of staff has
resigned his post. Previous army chiefs of staff have imposed
martial law, rather than resign.
	   The state-run Pakistan Television news alert gave a terse
statement saying Karamat submitted his resignation to Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif. He was to be replaced by Gen. Pervaiz
Mushraf, who will also be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
	   An army spokesman said: ``we have also heard this on television.
We have no details. We are waiting for our orders.''
	   Pakistan's right-wing religious leader, Qasi Hussein Ahmed, said
the resignation ``will further deepen the crisis'' engulfing the
nation.

IMF official indicates no decision likely soon on key U.S.
</HEADLINE>
proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A proposal President Bill Clinton put forward
to calm turbulent financial markets caught officials at the
International Monetary Fund off guard and will need further
refinement, a top IMF official said Wednesday.
	   Jack Boorman, IMF's policy director, called the U.S.
recommendation to speed IMF loans to countries threatened with
investor flight a ``distant'' part of the global architecture
officials are struggling to create to cope with the current crisis
and prevent future crises.
	   ``I want to make sure that efforts on this front are not
discussions that take away from the first order of business _
dealing with the crisis,'' Boorman told a small group of reporters
during an interview.
	   Calling it more a ``concept'' than a thought-through proposal,
Boorman said the idea merited further consideration. However, he
said, a number of potential problems would have to be resolved,
including how to involve rich countries and the private sector
along with the IMF in supplying emergency loans.
	   The feeling is that all three groups need to be involved to
offer enough resources to persuade frightened investors to leave
their money in a particular country.
	   Boorman said Clinton's proposal caught the IMF off guard because
it had not been raised by the U.S. representative to the
organization during preparations for the annual meeting or in
discussions by a separate group of 22 nations convened by the
United States to explore reforms to the global financial system.
	   The IMF learned of the proposal only a few days before Clinton
made it public last Friday in brief remarks on the South Lawn of
the White House, he said.
	   Clinton, who has given increasing attention to the financial
crisis in recent weeks, has been involved in a series of
brainstorming sessions at the White House with his top economic
advisers, searching for bolder proposals to contain what he has
called the biggest threat to the global economy in 50 years.
	   Boorman, an Australian, made his remarks as the annual meetings
of the 182-nation IMF and World Bank were heading to their closing
sessions Thursday.
	   He said it was ``naive'' to expect that this year's annual
meetings will produce a grand strategy for combatting the economic
crisis. But he said the IMF's 24-member executive board, which runs
the agency on a day-to-day basis, now has a plan to pursue in
coming months.
	   ``The idea that we can come here and have a set of meetings like
this that involve 182 countries and come out of it with something
neat and clean just doesn't work,'' Boorman said.
	   But that sentiment did not stop finance officials from
expressing their frustration about the current turmoil.
	   ``The brute fact is that after five days of intense discussion
and debate, we are still at a loss as to why contagion has
continued to spread,'' India's finance minister, Yashwant Sinha,
said in an address at Wednesday's session.

Doctor helped patient on flight and now wants airline to pay his
</HEADLINE>
bill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British doctor came to the aid of a fellow
passenger who collapsed on an American Airlines transatlantic
flight _ and now he wants the airline to pay him for his services.
	   Dr. John Stevens went to court on Wednesday to force American
Airlines to pay a 540 pounds (dlrs 900) medical bill. He charged
the airline 120 pounds (dlrs 200) an hour for his help.
	   ``The crunch issue is that I was asked by a rich, ruthless
commercial organization to undertake a service as a professional. I
did that service. I did it well. I deserve to be paid,'' said
Stevens, who has pledged to donate the money to charity.
	   Stevens, a psychiatrist at a southwest London hospital, answered
a cabin crew call for any doctors on board when Audrey Stevens, of
Ireland, became ill on the June 22 flight from Los Angeles to
Heathrow Airport. The two are not related.
	   He diagnosed a blood clot and told the pilot to divert to
Chicago, where Audrey Stevens had emergency surgery. She has now
recovered.
	   American Airlines said they thanked the doctor with a bottle of
champagne and a flight voucher, which he declined. But Stevens
argued that if something had gone wrong, he would have been
vulnerable to a lawsuit and so deserved to be paid for putting
himself at risk.
	   American Airlines said in a statement, ``Our position is that we
don't pay doctors, it's a matter between the doctor and the patient
and the fact that it took place on our airline is incidental.''
	   The case before London's Small Claims Court is pending. The
court gave no indication when a judgment could be expected.
	   After the hearing, Stevens said if asked to help a fellow
passenger again, he would ''think long and hard about it.''

Sampras, Rafter, Becker crash out in first round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, detail, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ World No.1 Pete Sampras and world No.2
Patrick Rafter both crashed out in the first round of the dlrs 1
million Swiss Indoors on Wednesday.
	   Sampras, winner of three titles this season including Wimbledon,
was toppled by long-time nemesis Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3
only hours after Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech
Daniel Vacek.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Sampras, who accepted a wildcard
in Basel in an effort to finish as world No. 1 in the rankings this
year. ``It can't get much worse than this.
	   ``I'm sitting here trying to regroup and wondering hey, what
happened?'' said Sampras. ``I only arrived two days ago, and now
I'm going home tomorrow.''
	   Playing for the first time since he was knocked out in the
semifinal of the U.S. Open last month by eventual champion Rafter,
Sampras got off to a strong start but slowly began to crumble under
Ferreira's persistant assault.
	   ``I was a set up and then all of sudden it was the tie-break and
I lost,'' said Sampras, the winner of 11 Grand Slams. ``Then I just
lost a couple of key points. I don't really know how it happened.''
	   Ferreira, in contrast, seemed to know exactly the cause of
Sampras' downfall.
	   ``He started off strong and was playing well,'' said Ferreira,
who's won the last four times the two have met. ``But when I broke
him in the second set I could see him getting down on himself.
	   ``If you can start strong and answer his serves, he puts more in
his serve and it goes a little off,'' explained Ferreira. ``The key
is to keep your serve so you have a chance to get ahead by
returning his.''
	   Sampras' last win over Ferreira dates back to 1995 when he
defeated the South African in the quarterfinals in Hamburg.
	   Since then, Ferreira has remained a thorn in the American's
side, and leads their head-to-head record with five wins and four
defeats.
	   ``I like the way he plays,'' said Ferreira. ``I've heard he
hates playing me so I'm sure that doesn't help him.
	   ``Maybe I should play him every week.''
	   Ferreira will play Marc Rosset in the second round, while
Sampras boards the plane to return home to prepare for tournaments
in Lyon, Stuttgart, Paris and the ATP Tour World Championship in
Hannover.
	   In the day's other shocker, two-time U.S. Open champion Rafter
surrendered 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to Vacek, ranked 44.
	   Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to
struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the
talent which led him to six titles this season.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' said Rafter, currently leading the race for
berths in Hannover next month. ``But that's often the case in
indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No.1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces.''
	   Sampras' and Rafter's elimination marks the departure of the
tournament's biggest draws and all three Grand Slam champions
present this year. Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion, went
out in the first round on Tuesday after losing 6-2, 6-4 to
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer.
	   Always a top attraction, wildcard Boris Becker also made an
early exit, losing 6-3, 6-2 to Sweden's Thomas Johansson on
Wednesday.
	   In other first round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defence of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier
Axel Pretzsch, ranked 311.
	   Returning to form after a two-month absence to nurse ankle
ligaments he tore at Queens in June, Rusedski needed just 52
minutes to steamroll past Pretzsch.
	   Ranked 14, Rusedski, who has only lost one match in 10 in Basel,
will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil, in the
second round.

Chilean, American, Croatians get `alternative Nobels'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS style on river to Bio Bio sted Biobio &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A Chilean activist fighting to save the
Bio Bio River and an American cancer-prevention specialist were
named Wednesday as among the winners of the Right Livelihood
Awards, commonly called the ``alternative Nobels.''
	   The four awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 58,500), went
to Juan Pablo Orrego of Chile; Samuel Epstein of the University of
Illinois-Chicago; the London-based International Baby Food Action
Netowrk; and Croatian peace activists Katarina Kruhonja and Vesna
Terselic.
	   The recipients all ``are engaged in the global struggle to put
limits on corporate power,'' awards founder Jakob von Uexkull said
at a news conference.
	   Orrego helped found the Grupo de Accion por el Bio Bio in 1991,
to work against plans by the Chilean energy company ENDESA to build
a series of six dams on the spectacular river.
	   ``The campaign work has, in a rlatively short time, been
remarkably successful, enabling GABB to make the previously secret
plans for dam construction a hot issue of environment, human rights
and to question the present development model in Chile,'' the
awards foundation said.
	   Epstein, a prefessor of occupational and enviromental medicine,
is chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, which works to
prevent exposure to carcinogens in air, water, food and the
workplace. The award also noted CPC's research indicating that milk
and meat from cattle treated with synthetic hormones can cause
cancer.
	   IBFAN ``brought together non-governmental organizations which
were addressing infant feeding ... in a common aim: improving
breastfeeding rates, reducing dependence on industrial artificial
milk products, and protecting families' freedom of choice,'' the
foundation said.
	   Terselic, found of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign, and Kruhonja,
director of the Center for Peace, Non-violence and Human Rights in
the city of Osijek, are both working to heal the post-war tensions
in Croatia.
	   Von Uexkull sold an extensive stamp collection to provide seed
money for the awards, which are aimed at recognizing work that he
and the Right Livelihood Foundation believe gets ignored by the
more-famous Nobel Prizes.
	   ``We are a complement to the Nobel Prizes _ and a compliment''
because establishing the Right Livelihood Awards was a recognition
of the Nobels' prestige, von Uexkull said.
	   The awards began in 1980 and have acquired a substantial amount
of prestige. The winners will receive the prizes in a ceremony in
the Swedish Parliament on Dec. 9, the day before the Nobel Prizes
are presented in Stockholm.
	   The jury for this year's prize included von Uexkull, Richard
Jolly of the United Nations Development Program and Sweden's
ambassador to Zambia Kristina Svensson.

Iranian leader calls for stopping misuse of freedom of expression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds'' UPDATES in grafs 4-11 with report by Human Rights Watch,
background on newspapers. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Wednesday criticized what he described as conspirators
misusing freedom of expression and said their actions amounted to
treason, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Critique and criticism of the government's policies are not
bad, but, when someone attempts to undermine the foundations of the
government, it is a treason and not freedom of expression... The
enemy's hands are seen in such practices,'' the agency quoted
Khamenei as saying.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the judiciary have shut down
six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested six
journalists for allegedly printing lies.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said it feared that four
detained journalists working for the banned Tous daily were being
``ill-treated in order to pressure them to sign false
confessions.''
	   It said the four men _ Mahmoud Shamsol-va-Ezine, Hamid-Reza
Jalaipur, Mohammad Javadi-Hessar and Ebrahim Nabavi _ have been
held incommunicado since their arrest Sept. 16 with no access to
their lawyers and their families.
	   The watch group said in an open-letter to Mohammad Yazdi, the
head of Iran's judiciary, that the arrests appeared to be in
``direct violation'' of Iran's Constitution which states that any
offenses relating to the press should be brought before a
designated press court. It said the Iranian press law stipulates
that such courts should hold their proceedings in public and in the
presence of a jury.
	   The group said it was concerned that ``the prosecution of the
four journalists is part of a campaign of repression and violence
targeting independent media.''
	   Tous, a popular independent daily, was shut down for allegedly
publishing articles ``detrimental to national interests.''
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance by calling for
a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes in the conflict
with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan.
	   It also angered hard-liners by questioning Khamenei's authority
as the spiritual leader.
	   In addition to Tous, five other publications have been shut
down, including Gozaresh-e Rouz, Khaneh, Rah-e Nou, Tavana,
Jameah-e Salem and Asr-e Ma.
	   The crackdown is stymying efforts by moderate President Mohammad
Khatami to give more freedom to the press.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under increasing attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Khamenei has in the past called on the judiciary to deal with
what he described as ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   ``We have said time and again that expressing views on every
issue is free and those having objections to the government's plans
are entitled to publish their objections and no one will stop them.
But there exists a fundamental difference between objection and
sabotage,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying Wednesday.
	   ``If anyone today undermines the economy and the work of this
government _ this government which is the servant of the people _
he is our enemy. We must confront him,'' he said.

year ago.
	   On Thursday, he returns as one of the biggest names in the game,
a three-time winner on the PGA Tour for the second consecutive
season and the tour's leading money-winner with more than dlrs 2.1
million in 1998.
	   And it all started at Kingsmill, where his 10-foot birdie putt
on the first hole of a three-way playoff earned him his first tour
victory a year ago.
	   ``It was my first win, and I'll always be able to go back with
confidence and some great memories,'' Duval said of the 6,797-yard
(6,185-meter) River Course, which served as the springboard to his
remarkable 1997 finish.
	   Duval followed his breakthrough victory with another the
following week at Walt Disney World, then became the first player
in history to post his first three victories in succession by
winning the Tour Championship.
	   The streak vaulted him into second place on the season's final
money list, right behind Tiger Woods. Apparently, it was only the
beginning.
	   He's the only three-time winner on tour this season, finished in
a tie for second in the Masters and was seventh in the U.S. Open.
	   With more than dlrs 4 million in earnings the last two years,
the major thing still missing from Duval's resume is just that _ a
victory in a major.
	   ``You look at my record and that's the obvious next step for
me,'' he said. ``I've got to give myself more than one chance a
year.''
	   The versatility of his game seems to suggest it's just a matter
of time.
	   Duval ranks first in putting average, second in scoring average
and seventh in greens hit in regulation _ taking care of the
finesse part of the game. He's also sixth in average driving
distance.
	   The field this weekend also includes Duffy Waldorf and Grant
Waite, who lost in the playoff last year; Scott Hoch, the
wire-to-wire winner in 1996, and a host of players who already have
won major championships.
	   That group includes Justin Leonard, who last year missed the
cut; Payne Stewart, Lee Janzen, Jeff Sluman, host Curtis Strange
and Tom Lehman.
	   Lehman hasn't played here since 1992, when he finished fifth.
He's hoping to regain his form after separating a shoulder in July.
	   ``I planned on playing here all year,'' Lehman said. ``I expect
to come here quite often if it's held this time of year.''
	   Until last year, the tournament was held in July, when the
weather made it one of the hottest stops on the tour. It also fell
the week before the British Open, and many top players skipped it
and headed for Europe early.

Sampras, Rafter, Becker crash out in first round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, detail, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Top seeds Pete Sampras and Patrick
Rafter both crashed out in the first round of the dlrs 1 million
Swiss Indoors on Wednesday.
	   Sampras, winner of three titles this season including Wimbledon,
was toppled by long-time nemesis Wayne Ferreira 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3
only hours after Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech
Daniel Vacek.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Sampras, who accepted a wildcard
in Basel in an effort to finish as world No. 1 in the rankings this
year. ``It can't get much worse than this.
	   ``I'm sitting here trying to regroup and wondering hey, what
happened?'' said Sampras. ``I only arrived two days ago, and now
I'm going home tomorrow.''
	   Playing for the first time since he was knocked out in the
semifinal of the U.S. Open last month by eventual champion Rafter,
Sampras got off to a strong start but slowly began to crumble under
Ferreira's persistant assault.
	   ``I was a set up and then all of sudden it was the tie-break and
I lost,'' said Sampras, the winner of 11 Grand Slams. ``Then I just
lost a couple of key points. I don't really know how it happened.''
	   Ferreira, in contrast, seemed to know exactly the cause of
Sampras' downfall.
	   ``He started off strong and was playing well,'' said Ferreira,
who's won the last four times the two have met. ``But when I broke
him in the second set I could see him getting down on himself.
	   ``If you can start strong and answer his serves, he puts more in
his serve and it goes a little off,'' explained Ferreira. ``The key
is to keep your serve so you have a chance to get ahead by
returning his.''
	   Sampras' last win over Ferreira dates back to 1995 when he
defeated the South African in the quarterfinals in Hamburg.
	   Since then, Ferreira has remained a thorn in the American's
side, and leads their head-to-head record with five wins and four
defeats.
	   ``I like the way he plays,'' said Ferreira. ``I've heard he
hates playing me so I'm sure that doesn't help him.
	   ``Maybe I should play him every week.''
	   Ferreira will play Marc Rosset in the second round, while
Sampras boards the plane to return home to prepare for tournaments
in Lyon, Stuttgart, Paris and the ATP Tour World Championship in
Hannover.
	   In the day's other shocker, two-time U.S. Open champion Rafter
surrendered 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to Vacek, ranked 44.
	   Serving well but laboring in his return game, Rafter seemed to
struggle on the indoor carpet. Playing in only his first tournament
since successfully defending his title at Flushing Meadows a month
ago, the 25-year-old Australian showed only brief glimpses of the
talent which led him to six titles this season.
	   ``There were only one or two key points in the match and they
didn't go my way,'' said Rafter, currently leading the race for
berths in Hannover next month. ``But that's often the case in
indoors.
	   ``My game is more suited to hard court, and if I want to become
world No.1 I'll have to learn how to play on all surfaces.''
	   Sampras' and Rafter's elimination marks the departure of the
tournament's biggest draws and all three Grand Slam champions
present this year. Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion, went
out in the first round on Tuesday after losing 6-2, 6-4 to
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer.
	   Always a top attraction, wildcard Boris Becker also made an
early exit, losing 6-3, 6-2 to Sweden's Thomas Johansson on
Wednesday.
	   In other first round play, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski began the
defence of his crown with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over German qualifier
Axel Pretzsch, ranked 311.
	   Returning to form after a two-month absence to nurse ankle
ligaments he tore at Queens in June, Rusedski needed just 52
minutes to steamroll past Pretzsch.
	   Ranked 14, Rusedski, who has only lost one match in 10 in Basel,
will take on another German qualifier, David Prinosil, in the
second round.

Top Milosevic's aide voices outrage at possible NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic blasted NATO threats of military intervention on
Wednesday as a ``criminal act, inconceivable in international
law.''
	   Dragan Tomic, chairman of the Serbian parliament, speaking at a
meeting of a Belgrade branch of his and Milosevic's ruling
Socialist party, said the party fully supports the federal
president's stand that in case of attack the country would ``defend
with all means.''
	   The official Tanjug news agency quoted Tomic as saying the NATO
threats are ``based on fabricated disinformation, causing revolt
among Serbian people and at the same time bringing unprecedented
unity, expressed in complete consent of all relevant political
parties'' in protesting against the threats.
	   Commenting on Russia's opposition to the looming intervention,
Tomic said: ``Russia has recognized (in the NATO threats) what
might happen to it one day if this experiment, this pilot project,
with us, succeeds.''
	   A top Russian delegation visited Belgrade this weekend in an
apparent effort to offset the NATO threats of strikes which may
happen unless Milosevic pulls out his troops from Serbia's Kosovo
province where his forces are battling ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   ``Numerous states in Russia that are rich in oil and natural
resources have ethnically diverse populations and are targets of
plans by new imperialists headed by the United States of America,''
Tomic said.

Iranian leader calls for stopping misuse of freedom of expression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-11 with report by Human Rights Watch,
background on newspapers. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Wednesday criticized what he described as conspirators
misusing freedom of expression and said their actions amounted to
treason, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Critique and criticism of the government's policies are not
bad, but, when someone attempts to undermine the foundations of the
government, it is a treason and not freedom of expression... The
enemy's hands are seen in such practices,'' the agency quoted
Khamenei as saying.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the judiciary have shut down
six publications, including two on Monday, and arrested six
journalists for allegedly printing lies.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said it feared that four
detained journalists working for the banned Tous daily were being
``ill-treated in order to pressure them to sign false
confessions.''
	   It said the four men _ Mahmoud Shamsol-va-Ezine, Hamid-Reza
Jalaipur, Mohammad Javadi-Hessar and Ebrahim Nabavi _ have been
held incommunicado since their arrest Sept. 16 with no access to
their lawyers and their families.
	   The watch group said in an open-letter to Mohammad Yazdi, the
head of Iran's judiciary, that the arrests appeared to be in
``direct violation'' of Iran's Constitution which states that any
offenses relating to the press should be brought before a
designated press court. It said the Iranian press law stipulates
that such courts should hold their proceedings in public and in the
presence of a jury.
	   The group said it was concerned that ``the prosecution of the
four journalists is part of a campaign of repression and violence
targeting independent media.''
	   Tous, a popular independent daily, was shut down for allegedly
publishing articles ``detrimental to national interests.''
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance by calling for
a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes in the conflict
with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan.
	   It also angered hard-liners by questioning Khamenei's authority
as the spiritual leader.
	   In addition to Tous, five other publications have been shut
down, including Gozaresh-e Rouz, Khaneh, Rah-e Nou, Tavana,
Jameah-e Salem and Asr-e Ma.
	   The crackdown is stymying efforts by moderate President Mohammad
Khatami to give more freedom to the press.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under increasing attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Khamenei has in the past called on the judiciary to deal with
what he described as ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   ``We have said time and again that expressing views on every
issue is free and those having objections to the government's plans
are entitled to publish their objections and no one will stop them.
But there exists a fundamental difference between objection and
sabotage,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying Wednesday.
	   ``If anyone today undermines the economy and the work of this
government _ this government which is the servant of the people _
he is our enemy. We must confront him,'' he said.

Co-coaches say things going OK in Bowman's absence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ As Scotty Bowman recuperates from knee surgery,
interim co-coaches Dave Lewis and Barry Smith are winning rave
reviews from the Red Wings' front office.
	   Things are going well, says general manager Ken Holland.
	   ``It's worked out thus far, and it'll continue to work
smoothly,'' Holland said. ``They've done a wonderful job of
handling training camp. I expect it to continue into the regular
season.''
	   Players agree.
	   ``Barry and Dave have the respect of everyone on this team,''
Kris Draper said. ``They've done this before.''
	   During training camp, Lewis and Smith did things the way they
always do. Lewis worked the defensemen and Smith the forwards, and
then shared the bench during the games.
	   The only difference was, Bowman was nowhere near the camp. In
the past four years, he was somewhere in the arena analyzing the
exhibition games.
	   The Wings will start the National Hockey League regular season
Saturday at Toronto without Bowman.
	   ``It's like having two head coaches behind the bench,'' Holland
told The Detroit News. ``They work extremely well together.''
	   Lewis and Smith will consult with Bowman and Holland to
formulate lineups before games. Lewis and Smith then will design a
pregame strategy, setting forward lines and defensive pairings.
	   Smith is responsible for sending the forwards out, Lewis the
defensemen. Decisions such as pulling a goalie or who will take a
key faceoff will be shared.
	   But there will be much discussion and preparation before the
game to make sure every option is considered.
	   ``We know what these guys can do,'' Lewis said. ``It's our job
to put them into situations where they can do their best.''
	   Holland agreed.
	   ``The important thing is have the correct personnel on the
ice,'' he said. ``There's quick decisions that need to be made,
quick adjustments to make. They have to be on the same page.''

Court acquits Swiss couple charged with helping bankrupt building
</HEADLINE>
tycoon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A Frankfurt state court on Wednesday
acquitted a Swiss couple of obstruction of justice charges for
their part in helping a bankrupt German building tycoon flee
Germany to Miami in 1994.
	   Mostafa und Myrta El Kastaui, accepted payment from construction
tycoon Juergen Schneider to arrange his trip and hideout in the
United States, but the couple did not realize they were breaking
any laws by working for Schneider, the court ruled.
	   Prosecutors insisted the couple intentionally tried to conceal
Schneider's whereabouts, and said they would appeal the verdict.
	   Schneider and his wife, Claudia, fled Germany in April 1994,
when his company was forced into bankruptcy. They were arrested in
Miami in May 1995 and extradited to Germany in February 1996.
	   Schneider, 64, was convicted on five counts of serious fraud for
falsifying documents to convince banks his properties were worth
much more than their true value to obtain huge loans. He was
sentenced to six years and nine months in prison by a Frankfurt
court in December.
	   Schneider's concern collapsed with 5 billion marks (dlrs 2.8
billion) in debt, nearly one-third of it with Deutsche Bank, his
main creditor.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ American peacekeepers in
Bosnia take ``very seriously'' threats of retaliation in the event
NATO launches airstrikes against neighboring Yugoslavia, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Gen. Kevin P. Byrnes, who assumed command of the American-run
northern sector of Bosnia on Wednesday, said his soldiers are well
prepared to defend themselves and react in case of hostile actions.
	   Protecting the hundreds or thousands of American civilians in
Bosnia could be more difficult.
	   The contingent of 8,500 U.S. troops stands out as a likely
target if Serb hardliners carry through on threats to fight back
following any bombing attack by the American-led alliance, which is
trying to halt Serbia's crackdown on secessionist Kosovo province.
	   Hardliners in both Yugoslavia and Bosnia, who share the goal of
a Greater Serbia, have pledged to respond to air raids with their
own, unspecified attacks.
	   Porous borders and the lack of a professional local police force
mean retaliatory action against Americans could have a bigger
impact in Bosnia than in Yugoslavia.
	   ``We have heard, through reports, about these threats and we
take them very seriously,'' said Maj. Jim Jones, a spokesman for
the American peacekeeping contingent.
	   While intelligence-gathering is almost certain to have been
stepped up as a result, American officers and soldiers remained mum
on the subject Wednesday.
	   Jones said there were no plans to increase security _ which in
any event is ``our first priority at any time,'' he stressed.
	   Daily activities appeared to be as usual around this northern
Bosnian town. Humvees and trucks painted in camouflage colors
roared down Bosnian roads while foot patrols kept watch as usual
despite rainy weather.
	   Caution is already built into their routine.
	   Located up a narrow, winding road about 16 kilometers (10 miles)
southeast of Tuzla, the site of Eagle Base itself signals a
wariness of potential attacks. In addition, strict security rules
require Americans to move in patrols of no fewer than six when
outside the base.
	   NATO officials do not expect the soldiers to be targeted because
of their numbers and firepower. More at risk are so-called liaison
officers, who live in communities alongside Bosnians in order to
instill confidence and monitor any problems.
	   Even more vulnerable are the American civilians in Bosnia who
work mostly for aid agencies, reconstruction organizations or the
U.S. government.
	   Last weekend, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo issued a travel
advisory warning American citizens of possible Serb retaliation.
Due to the ``potential increased danger,'' the advisory urged all
Americans in Bosnia to consider leaving the Serb-held half of the
country, or at least to try to avoid traveling through it.
	   This has already caused some inconvenience for some U.S.
employees based in the other half of Bosnia _ the Muslim-Croat
Federation. By heeding the advisory, they often must travel for
several additional hours in order to skirt areas dominated by
Serbs.
	   In the Bosnian Serb republic itself, officials for the U.S.
Agency for International Development denied reports it had pulled
out American stafff but said some other American contractors may
have left.

	   ARIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Despite requests by the United States to
halt Jewish settlement construction, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu conferred city status Wednesday to Ariel, a
large West Bank settlement slated for expansion.
	   Netanyahu's visit to Ariel came just hours after U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright left the region after talks with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders over a long-delayed Israeli
pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   ``We are building and will continue to build,'' Netanyahu said
to cheering crowds of settlers in Ariel.
	   ``When we declare Ariel as a city, as we do today, we thus
announce that this is a permanent place. This place will be part of
Israel in any final status agreement in the future,'' Netanyahu
said, indicating Ariel would remain under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Ariel, established in 1977, is in the middle of the West Bank,
30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv. Ariel's mayor, Ron
Nachman, told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase
the population from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing
units.
	   In addition, Netanyahu said a new cultural center would be built
and Ariel's community college would be expanded into a university.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Wednesday's ceremony was
scheduled long ago, ``and was certainly not timed to coincide with
Mrs. Albright's visit here.''
	   Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy
accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a
message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
	   For more than two decades, U.S. governments have said Israeli
settlements in the West Bank are illegal and obstacles to peace.
Palestinians say the settlements are illegal incursions on land
Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and where they
hope to establish a state.
	   Netanyahu said the new homes do not violate peace accords with
the Palestinians. ``We are not building new settlements, but we are
enabling the natural growth of the existing settlements to go on,''
Netanyahu said.
	   ``I would like to see Ariel double in size. We will continue at
this pace and build up this city more and more and more,'' he said.
	   Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready in April. He said
Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that
because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
	   Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when
Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on
construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to
cancel the freeze.
	   Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with
the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel
while the ceremony is in progress.
	   A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in
Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
	   Meanwhile, in the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron,
Israeli Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom laid a cornerstone
for future construction at the Tel Romeida Jewish settlement. One
month ago, a rabbi from the community was stabbed to death in his
trailer home there and the government agreed to build permanent
homes for several families who live there.
	   ``I hope there will be a permanent neighborhood here, one with
dozens of homes,'' Yahalom said at the ceremony.

Lipinski figures she made right choice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIMSBURY, Connecticut (AP) _ Tara Lipinski never expected the
backlash, and all the questions about why a 15-year-old Olympic
champion would abandon competitive figure skating for show
business.
	   ``It hurt. It bothers you,'' says Lipinski, whose surge to the
top of the sport was capped by her gold-medal performance at the
Nagano Games last February. ``But you've got to be strong. It helps
me to be out there with the fans. I know that not everyone feels
that way, especially the fans.
	   ``I think the people who were criticizing me are not in the
position to understand how it works. They have not gone through 12
years of training and living away from their dad for five years.
	   ``The reasons for becoming a professional were obvious to me. It
was what's best for me and my family. I don't think I made any
really wrong decisions in my career before and there is nothing to
make me think this was wrong.''
	   Lipinski recently completed rehearsals for Discover Stars on
Ice, the touring show that also stars Scott Hamilton and Kristi
Yamaguchi. She and fellow Nagano gold medalist Ilia Kulik joined
the tour during the summer, along with three-time U.S. pairs
champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, two-time Olympic bronze
medalist Lu Chen of China, and England's Steven Cousins.
	   The first few days of rehearsals were agonizing. Lipinski was
bothered by an injured hip and sore thighs, causing a slight limp.
But it was idleness _ not injuries _ that troubled her most.
	   She was kept off the ice because the initial practices did not
involve her numbers and because tour organizers were cautious about
her health.
	   ``I was sitting up here watching them,'' she said from a lounge
while watching show choreographers Jayne Torvill and Christopher
Dean and producer Sandra Bezic work on a routine. ``It was like,
`When can I get on the ice with everybody?'
	   ``I couldn't wait to do the group numbers. I knew that would be
the most fun, to be out there with Scott and Kristi and Ilia and
everybody.''
	   Those group numbers, the highlight of Stars on Ice since
Hamilton started the tour 12 years ago, were a major reason
Lipinski joined the show. When she was much younger, Lipinski was a
roller skater and most enjoyed the ``family things'' and ensemble
performances that accompanied that sport.
	   ``I love to be an entertainer,'' said Lipinski, now 16 and in
possession of a driver's license _ she has three automobiles thanks
to endorsement contracts. ``What I'd wanted to do next was
interpret music and act and do so much more than I did before.''
	   She gets the opportunity in this year's show, appearing in a
clown routine in which she even is lifted up by another skater. And
she will be doing some acting for CBS, with which she has an
exclusive contract that includes skating shows and non-sanctioned
competitions.
	   But for all the tour's family atmosphere and focus on
entertainment, Lipinski still gets a competitive charge.
	   ``Performing every night on tour will satisfy my competitive
juices,'' she said. ``I won't miss anything.
	   ``Once you've accomplished what you set out to do, you don't
miss it. It's over. After I won worlds (in 1997), the ultimate goal
was the Olympics. I still had the drive within me to get the
Olympic medal and then that was fulfilled.
	   ``The Olympics changed my whole life. At the moment I won, it
was, `It's yours forever. You don't have to give it up.' When I
look at the medal, it's so awesome.''

29-nation conference seeks more security for global electronic
</HEADLINE>
commerce &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Electronic commerce is projected to mushroom into
a trillion-dollar global phenomenon by 2005, yet vital questions
about security and reliability trouble many businesses and
consumers.
	   In one of the most ambitious attempts yet to ease those doubts,
delegates from 29 of the world's wealthiest countries opened a
three-day conference on electronic commerce Wednesday.
	   Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the meeting is an unprecedented get-together of
government officials and private-sector executives seeking to
figure out who should regulate global electronic commerce _ and
how.
	   Rifts already have developed between countries favoring
government intervention in protecting consumer interests and those
who believe initiatives should be industry-led.
	   The European Union, Canada and much of Asia advocate regulation
to protect personal information on the Internet. The EU is
preparing to prohibit the transmission of sensitive data to
countries that do not adopt adequate privacy laws.
	   The United States, on the other hand, is campaigning for
voluntary private-sector codes of conduct.
	   ``It would be very bureaucratic for governments to try and set
up enforcement mechanisms and it would stifle the development of
electronic commerce,'' Ira Magaziner, an adviser to President Bill
Clinton, said in a pre-conference briefing.
	   ``We don't feel you can effectively protect privacy that way. We
think you're in a sense misleading your people because you're
saying: `Don't worry, we'll protect your privacy,' when in effect
you can't.''
	   The challenge of the conference will be to find common ground.
	   ``If each country works independently to establish its own
system, it could cripple the potential for international electronic
commerce,'' said Canada's industry minister, John Manley.
	   Top corporate executives will be trying to drive home the
importance of reaching an international agreement.
	   ``Unless you bring people together like this, it will be very
difficult to build consensus,'' said David Seibel, a managing
partner with Andersen Consulting Canada.
	   ``We see a cooperative regulatory environment as one of the
critical factors that's required to support the development of the
electronic economy.''
	   Ministers will be tackling other issues besides regulation,
including standards on encryption technology, agreement on
intellectual property protection and how to collect taxes on
electronic transactions.

Wounded British tourist not cleared to return home, Barbadian
</HEADLINE>
doctors say &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC NURSE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A British tourist shot during a
hotel robbery in Barbados last week has not been cleared to return
home, a hospital official said Wednesday.
	   In a written statement, Andrew Watson, director of Bridgetown's
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said a decision on whether to airlift
Paula Bridges of Suffolk, England, ``has yet to be determined by
the medical staff.''
	   Bridges was shot in the chest during a robbery Thursday in the
bar of the Palm Garden Hotel, where she was staying. The bullet
penetrated her heart, doctors said.
	   ``This was a potentially fatal condition which necessitated
emergency surgery,'' Watson said. ``Her condition has stabilized,
but she remains ill and is on (respiratory) support.''
	   Reports differed on whether the robbers shot toward bar patrons
to frighten them or if Bridges was hit by a ricocheting bullet.
	   Simon Baptiste, assistant police commissioner, denied reports
that Bridges was shot at point-blank range or singled out by the
assailants.
	   Albert Carter, a spokesman for police department, said the
robbers may be linked to several hold-ups in Barbados in recent
weeks. Investigators believe the hotel attackers robbed a gasoline
station after the latest shooting.
	   ``We are pursuing all leads and leaving no stone unturned,''
Carter said.
	   On Wednesday, the Barbados Advocate newspaper published a
statement by Bridges' common-law husband, John Martin, urging
residents to aid police.
	   ``Help them to apprehend the offenders before anyone else has to
go through the horrifying experience Paula and myself have,''
Martin said.
	   He said he was ``overwhelmed'' by expressions of sympathy from
Barbadian residents.
	   Officials in Barbados, a Caribbean island of 264,000 people, say
they are worried about an recent increase in gun use.
	   Between July 3 and mid-August there were 14 crimes involving
firearms, including three murders the night of Aug. 9. The
government increased the penalty for illegal possession of firearms
from two years in prison to 20 years.

Austrian promoter offers to buy men's Pilot Pen tourney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ An Austrian tennis promoter has
made an offer to buy the Pilot Pen International men's tennis
tournament, ending its eight-year run in the city as a warm-up for
the U.S. Open.
	   An offer is on the table to purchase the men's event from
Tournament Chairman Butch Buchholz, Mike Davies, chief executive
officer of the Pilot Pen International men's and women's
tournaments, told the New Haven Register.
	   The decision-making process is not complete, Davies said.
	   Davies last week told the aldermanic Tax Abatement Committee
that the tournament lost about dlrs 1 million in 1997 and another
dlrs 1.3 million after introducing the women's tournament this
year.
	   The committee tabled any decision on the tournament's request to
abate dlrs 417,000 in payments in lieu of taxes, apparently because
of the offer.
	   Mayor John DeStefano Jr., who is both a member of the
Connecticut Tennis Foundation board of directors and its first
executive director, said he does not expect the men's tournament to
return.
	   ``The event has lost money over the last three or four years _
it has lost a lot of money,'' DeStefano said. ``The fan support was
weak this year. And what also is evident, frankly, is that the
women have been a lot more popular in their appearances here in New
Haven.''
	   The women's tournament, which outdrew the men's tournament in
its initial run this past August, will remain in the Connecticut
Tennis Center, officials said.
	   The center, which was the third largest tennis stadium in the
world at the time of its completion in 1991, was built with dlrs 18
million in state funds specifically to house the tournament.
	   But DeStefano said there's nothing wrong with a stadium that's
only used one week a year.
	   ``It's a tennis stadium for professional tennis,'' he said.
``That's what it was built for. That's what it is. Show me a
professional tennis stadium that's used more often than this one.''
	   The tournament in Kitzbuhel, Austria is a clay court event. It
took place this year from July 27-Aug. 2.
	   Buying rights to the dlrs 870,000 Pilot Pen International
essentially would upgrade the dlrs 525,000 Kitzbuhel event.

	   ARIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Hours after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright asked Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral actions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday he would continue to build in Jewish settlements.
	   Netanyahu spoke in Ariel several hours after talks with Albright
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat over a long-delayed Israeli
pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   ``We are building and will continue to build,'' Netanyahu said
to cheering crowds of settlers in Ariel, where he conferred city
status on the large settlement slated for expansion.
	   ``When we declare Ariel as a city, as we do today, we thus
announce that this is a permanent place. This place will be part of
Israel in any final status agreement in the future,'' Netanyahu

Fluminense, favorite of Rio's elite, relegated to third division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Fluminense, once one of Rio's
premier teams and a favorite of the city's elite, suffered its
greatest humiliation falling into the third division after a 1-1
tie against ABC of Natal.
	   The team, which won the national championships in 1984 under the
command of coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, had fallen on hard times
recently after being relegated to the second division after last
year.
	   And with Tuesday night's tie the team finds itself in an even
deeper hole, because the third division only plays for a few months
out of the year, cutting down potential revenue. The team will now
likely have to lay off its better players.
	   Badly mismanaged and with many of their players unpaid since
May, the team was a ghost of what they were in their glory days
when players like Branco and Romerito played for the team.
	   Recently, the team had been appealing to friends to bring them
back from the brink _ at one point they even asked former-FIFA
president and Fluminense board member Joao Havelange to head the
team.
	   The drop to third division left the teams 2.4 million fans, one
of the biggest fan clubs in the city, in a state of despair.

Transit strike over violence widens, govt to announce new action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fresh assault on a suburban train driver gave new
impetus to subway, rail and bus drivers on strike for a second day
Wednesday to press the government to crack down on rising transit
violence.
	   Transit strikes against widening youth violence have multiplied
across France in recent weeks, and the latest walkouts that
stranded or delayed millions of Parisians further underlined the
urgency to act.
	   The walkout on Wednesday extended to suburban train lines around
Paris and continued on the Regional Express Network (RER) linked to
the city's subway lines, though Paris bus service was returning to
normal.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin held a 90-minute meeting with
transit officials and Cabinet ministers Wednesday afternoon. He was
to announce new plans to fight the violence when he appears on
state television France 2 on Thursday evening, officials said.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said they discussed ``the
question of human presence in places where the isolation of public
employees can cause fear, anxiety, or attacks.''
	   The strikes and violence caused the head of the state railroad
SNCF, Louis Gallois, to cut short a trip to the United States and
return to France on Wednesday night, a spokesman said.
	   By late Wednesday, suburban rail traffic was paralyzed at all
but two Parisian train stations that handle 5,000 trains a day.
Altogether, 850,000 Parisians were affected by Wednesday's train
stoppages.
	   The new walkouts were triggered by an attack Tuesday night on a
driver at Villeneuve-le-Roi on the RER C line.
	   The city's RATP transit system deployed two more companies of
CRS elite police on their bus lines Tuesday, prompting many drivers
to return to work. By Wednesday, about 65 percent of service was
restored, and only seven of 23 depots were on strike.
	   The Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that about 200 extra
national police would patrol subway, bus and commuter train lines.
	   With statistics showing urban violence having risen 400 percent
in the past six years, both transit workers and commuters were
clamoring for more protection. About 9 million people in the Paris
area depend on public transit daily.
	   Youths from immigrant families, hard hit by unemployment as high
as 50 percent in their neighborhoods, are often linked to the
violence.
	   Inability of the government to control the widening incidents
has played into the hands of the far-right, anti-immigrant National
Front, which has won votes by promising tougher security.

Jamaica on way to defeat of United States

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica were well on their way to
beating the United States Wednesday in their Red Stripe Bowl
cricket match at Chedwin Park with a lunchtime score of 61 for the
loss of one wicket.
	   Raymond Ferguson was the man out for an aggressive 28. Robert
Samuels was unbeaten on 31.
	   The Americans, who lost by 242 runs to defending champions
Leeward Islands in their opening match Tuesday, again looked out of
their depth and were dismissed for another modest 107 runs in 43.1
overs.
	   Only middle-order batsmen David Hoilette and captain Richard
Staple looked at home against the Jamaican attack headed by West
Indian fastbowler Franklyn Rose. Rose made early inroads in the USA
batting by dismissing the first two batsmen and was the best of the
Jamaican attack with three wickets.
	   Hoilette, a former Jamaica player, topscored with 31 and was the
last man out. Staple, also a one-time Jamaica player, played
steadily for a patient 24 before he was run out in the 28th over.
Of the other batsmen, only Desmond Richards with 14 reached double
figures.

U.S. envoy gives Milosevic another chance to avoid strike

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy gave Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic another chance Wednesday to bow to international
demands and avoid NATO airstrikes. But Milosevic remained defiant.
	   Following his meeting with envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office said ``attempts were made to overcome the differences'' over
the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Referring to the possibility of NATO airstrikes, the Yugoslav
statement said ``the threats which are delivered to our country
jeopardize the continuation of the political process.''
	   It accused foreign governments of waging ``a media campaign
against our country'' through ``one-sided and fabricated reports.''
	   U.S. officials refused comment on the talks, and Holbrooke left
for Brussels, Belgium, to meet Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Thursday.
	   Before the talks ended, President Clinton reiterated that
Milosevic has to end his crackdown in Kosovo, pull out his special
police force and resume negotiations. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people
have been driven from their homes.
	   Despite mounting evidence of Milosevic's non-compliance and a
U.N. declaration confirming it, Washington seemed to lack the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into compliance.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   U.S. officials also face strong opposition from Russia, whose
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday the move could lead
to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a penalty or punishment of an isolated country but
almost a real war,'' Marshal Sergeyev said in Athens, Greece.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on those divisions, not
only between the Russians and NATO but within the Western alliance
itself.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position, of letting tens of thousands
of people starve or freeze to death this winter,'' Clinton said.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said ``NATO
will take a decision of their own.'' That implied the alliance
would not insist on the U.N. approval some U.S. allies and Russia
believe necessary.
	   Preparations for intervention continued in Yugoslavia and
abroad.
	   Britain, France and Germany all recommended their citizens leave
Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   In Belgrade the city government said it was making preparations
for possible strikes. Warning sirens blared in some Serbian towns.
Some opposition parties said mobilization of air defense reservists
was underway.
	   Late Wednesday, Serbian government officials ordered independent
media to stop broadcasting foreign media proygrams and said an
official ban will follow.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors, according to the independent Beta news agency. ``This
is not an appeal. This is an order.''
	   Milosevic has tried to show that he was working to settle the
Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic to
the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's Politika newspaper, a state-run daily, carried a
front-page headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased
in Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international diplomatic observers have disputed Serb claims. In
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian villagers claimed Serb forces fired
automatic weapons at their homes Wednesday in the Malisevo area
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Reporters who visited the area later that day heard no firing.
But the villagers claimed Serb police wait until foreign observers
and journalists have left the areas before reappearing.
	   On Wednesday, officials in both Yugoslavia and Albania reported
an exchange of gunfire Tuesday along the border between Kosovo and
Albania. Each blamed the other for starting the incident. Each
reported no casualties.
	   Poland's foreign minister, the current chairman of OSCE,
expressed disappointment with Yugoslavia's offer to the OSCE,
saying it allowed for a ``brief, improvised'' mission to Kosovo,
which he described as different from what the OSCE wanted.
	   The minister, Bronislaw Geremek, still stopped short of
rejecting the offer outright, calling it a new one that required
study.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   Western leaders say all moves to end the conflict must be
verifiable and irreversible.

Solheim Cup behind Pepper, but not forgotten
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Dottie Pepper could end a two-year
victory drought at the LPGA Tournament of Champions this week, and
it wouldn't change a thing.
	   She could add another major or two to her resume and still
wouldn't be able to shed the label.
	   Her toe nails won't be painted blue, her hair won't be dyed red
and it won't matter one bit. Mention the words Dottie Pepper, and
the Solheim Cup will always come to mind.
	   ``I think that's great,'' Pepper said this week while driving to
the Grand National course in Opelika, Alabama for her first
tournament since infuriating some European players in the U.S.
victory at Muirfield Village three weeks ago.
	   ``People identify Seve Ballesteros that way,'' she said.
	   At age 33, Pepper was born too late to join Arnold Palmer's army
and Jack Nicklaus didn't show enough flair for her taste.
	   ``I've been a Seve fan since I started taking Spanish in junior
high school,'' she said. ``He's the kind of player that made an
impression on me because he was so emotional and passionate about
his job.
	   ``He's a Masters champion, but he'll always be identified as the
Ryder Cup player who got Europe back in the matches.''
	   Europe didn't get back in these matches because of Pepper. She
not only became the first player to go undefeated in a Solheim Cup,
she became the first player whose name was written on a punching
bag for Europe to take out their frustrations.
	   Europe _ Laura Davies in particular _ didn't like the way Pepper
gleefully picked up Juli Inkster's ball on the 18th green of an
alternate-shot match after the putt was conceded, then worked the
American crowd into a frenzy after Europe failed to make par.
	   Davies said it was unprofessional. European captain Pia Nilsson
said it was ``nothing I would encourage the players I coach.''
	   Pepper has spent the last couple of weeks working in her garden,
taking long walks with her Chow, Furman, and replaying her actions
at the Solheim Cup. And she still doesn't know what the fuss was
all about.
	   ``The thing I'm a little upset about is that not once have they
said, 'We were just outplayed,''' Pepper said. ``That's the bottom
line. We played better than they did.''
	   Judy Rankin, the U.S. captain, agreed.
	   ``Had it been another player on our team, I don't think there
would have been a single remark,'' Rankin said. ``But they look for
Dottie to do something, and Dottie is happy to oblige.''
	   Among those who have called to congratulate Pepper over the past
few weeks were South Carolina Gov. David Beasley and former Los
Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John, whose son plays on the Furman
golf team in Greenville, South Carolina.
	   She went to a Celine Dion concert in Charlotte, North Carolina
and says a scalper gave her tickets ``for what you did at the
Solheim Cup.''
	   How forgetful _ and forgiving _ the European players are is yet
to be seen. One of the interesting dynamics about the Solheim Cup
is that all but one of Europe's players are on the LPGA Tour.
	   At the top of Pepper's agenda this week was to meet with Davies
and hash out any differences. But Davies is a no-show, having
decided to take appearance money to play the Takara World
Invitational in Japan.
	   ``So that will have to wait,'' Pepper said.
	   Besides, there are other matters on her plate. Pepper has three
tournaments left to pick up a first-place check for the first time
since she won four events in 1996. Her scoring average is the
lowest it has ever been, and she has learned to be patient.
	   ``It's time for me to finish the project,'' she said.
	   As the poster child for the Solheim Cup, Pepper understands
there will be a price on her head, particularly if she finds
herself going head-to-head with a European player on the back nine.
	   But she remembers what former Solheim captain Kathy Whitworth
told the U.S. team in 1990 when it was heavily favored to beat
Europe and did just that, 11-4-1.
	   ``She said that everyone will raise the game being paired with
you. That's how she got our minds prepared,'' Pepper said. ``It was
great advice, and it may turn out to be great advice again.''

Iraq: no agreement on ending standoff over arms inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 19 with 3 grafs to UPDATE with US saying proposal to
make UNSCOM prove weapons turns procedures upside down; UN nuclear
report released &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations failed to
reach an agreement on resuming spot searches of suspected weapons
sites after 10 days of discussions, officials said Wednesday.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after his
fourth and final meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan that he
would take the U.N. proposals back to Baghdad for consultations and
would report back to the U.N. chief.
	   ``We are going to weigh the situation in its entirety in
Baghdad,'' Aziz said, adding that he needed clarifications on
certain elements of the proposal. He planned to leave New York
later Wednesday.
	   But neither side announced any breakthrough in the impasse that
has prevented arms experts from looking for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction for over two months.
	   A statement issued by Annan's office said simply that ``Both
sides agreed that the process of dialogue would continue.''
	   The talks were intended to persuade Iraq to reverse its decision
Aug. 5 to stop cooperating with inspectors in return for a review
conducted by the Security Council of its efforts to disarm itself.
	   The review could force the 15-member council to acknowledge
Baghdad's progress over seven years of intrusive inspections while
building support for an easing of sanctions that have crippled
Iraq's economy.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Over four meetings during the Iraqi's visit, Annan briefed Aziz
on his ideas of how the so-called ``comprehensive review'' might be
carried out.
	   But there are disagreements within the council about how the
review would be conducted, with the United States and Britain
demanding that Iraq first reverse its Aug. 5 decision and allow
inspectors to do all their work before beginning discussions on a
comprehensive review.
	   Aziz said he had received assurances from British Ambassador
Jeremy Greenstock, the council president, that there would be no
``artificial delays'' on starting the review. But he said he was
still disturbed by ``unacceptable conditions'' being attached to
the proposals by one member, a reference to the United States.
	   The failed talks came amid reports of ``strong evidence'' that a
French laboratory had corroborated U.S. findings that some Iraqi
missile warheads had traces of ingredients used to make the deadly
VX nerve gas.
	   Diplomats here have hinted of such positive results, and have
suggested that France _ which generally takes a sympathetic view
towards Iraq _ was withholding the results so as to not undermine
the delicate negotiations between Annan and Aziz.
	   Responding to the claims in Wednesday's New York Times, the
French Foreign Ministry said it was not aware that French experts
had found any traces of VX.
	   Also complicating talks was a major six-month report issued
Monday by Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, which carries out inspections in Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler disagreed with part of the U.N. chief's
proposal to end the impasse. Annan has proposed making inspectors
responsible for proving that Iraq still has weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Butler said the proposal, which Iraq has long demanded, would
reverse the burden of disclosure that was placed on Baghdad by the
Security Council in its original resolutions.
	   Both the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, and Greenstock,
the British ambassador, stressed that the review would be carried
out according to previous U.N. resolutions.
	   Burleigh said Iraq's desire to make inspectors prove allegations
about what weapons Baghdad still has ``is turning arms control
procedures on their head.''
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. nuclear agency _ the International Atomic
Energy Agency _ issued its six-month report on the status of
nuclear inspections. The report repeated the IAEA's belief that it
has found no evidence Iraq is trying to rebuild its nuclear weapons
program. As a result of Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperation,
however, the IAEA's assurances that Iraq isn't resuming banned
weapons activity is ``significantly reduced.''

Palestinian leader briefs Egyptian president on peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat briefed the
Egyptian president Wednesday on his talks with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak later attended a
celebration of the 25th anniversary of the 1973 Arab_Israeli war.
	   The Palestinian leader wept as an Egyptian singer sang an Arab
patriotic song calling for the return of occupied Arab lands.
	   The Palestinian leader held talks earlier Wednesday with
Albright and Netanyahu at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and
the Gaza Strip.
	   Albright told a news conference afterward that ``substantial
progress'' was made toward a West Bank pullback.
	   She added, however, that Arafat and Netanyahu still had to make
``the hard decisions'' to end a 19-month impasse in the peace
process. The two leaders will continue their talks in Washington
Oct. 15, Albright said.
	   ``The most important thing that she (Albright) had done is very
important push to protect the peace process,'' Arafat told
reporters at arrival in Cairo.
	   Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas said in Egypt that no
agreement was reached during the Erez meeting.
	   ``But a certain progress has been made on some issues,'' Abbas
said after the hour-long meeting between Arafat and Mubarak. He did
not elaborate.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Arafat briefed Mubarak
on ``the extent of progress achieved.''
	   Arafat is to leave for Moscow Thursday.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy gave Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic another chance Wednesday to bow to international
demands and avoid NATO airstrikes. But Milosevic remained defiant.
	   Following his meeting with envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office said ``attempts were made to overcome the differences'' over

	   Hours later, the government of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia, announced a series of measures bringing the country
nearer to a war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''

	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's decision on whether to
launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia will be based partly on
reports from the field _ from guys like Ron Capps, a U.S.
diplomatic monitor who spends his days driving around Kosovo
province to see how bad things really are.
	   His first stop Wednesday was a sprawling refugee camp in the
rocky hills outside Kisna Reka village, where about 3,000 ethnic
Albanians are living in boxy huts made of plastic sheeting.
	   Capps has been here before, and people are glad to see him. A
spiral notebook tucked in his back pocket, he strides from hut to
hut, shaking hands and, accompanied by English-speaking
interpreters, asking questions.
	   What supplies do people need? Are they getting enough aid from
humanitarian groups? And _ most important _ when will they feel
safe enough to go home? Are Serb forces still surrounding the area?
	   ``We appreciate very much all you are doing,'' says a camp
leader, who gave only his initials, H.N. ``But we are besieged from
all directions, and it's very difficult to get food.''
	   Out comes the notebook, and Capps jots down the answers, his
brow creased with worry: People need clothes, shoes, flour and
food. And there's been no reduction in Serb forces, despite the
government's claims to the contrary.
	   Capps' notes are for the daily report of Kosovo's diplomatic
observers, about 50 in all, from the United States, Canada, the
European Union and Russia. Since July, they have been recording the
results of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's brutal military
offensive against the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the Serbian province's population.
	   NATO officials have threatened military strikes unless Milosevic
complies with U.N. demands, including a cease-fire, a withdrawal of
Serb troops, and the return of refugees to their villages.
	   Capps, 40, a native of Virginia Beach, Virginia, has a system:
He and his partner, Rob Jennings, check in with the same refugees
regularly to see if conditions have improved and if people are
ready to go home. The U.N. refugee agency estimates there are
50,000 people living in camps or out in the woods in Kosovo, driven
from villages burned down by Serb troops.
	   Capps stops outside a sturdy hut made of wood and mud, and
covered in plastic. Blankets and thin mattresses cover the floor
where two brothers, both farmers, have been living with their
families for months, since Serbs burned their houses and their
wheat fields in Kisna Reka, just a few kilometers (miles) away.
	   ``This is quite a construction you've got here,'' Capps tells
the brothers. ``How long you planning to stay?''
	   ``We'll stay until they move out the troops,'' says one brother.
``Because it's not safe in the village.''
	   ``We just hope we won't reach the winter, that diplomacy will
work,'' says the other brother. Neither man would give his name,
fearing retribution from Serb police.
	   Capps and his partner get back in their armored four-wheel drive
vehicle, decorated with U.S. flag decals, and drive toward their
next destination: a village of 7,000 people that has taken in 4,000
refugees. Capps shares information about what refugees need with
aid agencies, and he wants to make sure the village school got the
textbooks he requested.
	   Along the way, the team passes through the town of Malisevo, a
former stronghold for rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army that
Serb forces burned this summer. Serb police are still in the area,
villagers claim Serbs are still shelling, and police units are
living in bombed out or burned houses in nearly every village along
the main road.
	   Serb police at a roadblock stop the team, advising them to take
a different route to avoid land mines. At last, after about an
hour, the observers reach the village, where they learn the
textbooks have not arrived. Capps promises to remind UNICEF.
	   He asks one more question: What will the villagers do if NATO
strikes? One villager, who works for the charitable order founded
by Mother Teresa, says the ethnic Albanians fear attack from the
1,500 Serbs who live in the village. He claims the Serbs are armed.
	   He also says he will urge the Albanians to ``keep quiet. Maybe
the Albanians will become emotional, and think they are strong and
seek revenge,'' he says.
	   Capps makes a note in his book.

U.S. envoy gives Milosevic another chance to avoid strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serbia moving closer to war footing.
UPDATES with media crackdown; Albanian villagers claims, report of
firing TUESDAY along Albanian border.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy gave Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic another chance Wednesday to bow to international
demands and avoid NATO airstrikes. But Milosevic remained defiant.
	   Following his meeting with envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office said ``attempts were made to overcome the differences'' over
the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Referring to the possibility of NATO airstrikes, the Yugoslav
statement said ``the threats which are delivered to our country
jeopardize the continuation of the political process.''
	   It accused foreign governments of waging ``a media campaign
against our country'' through ``one-sided and fabricated reports.''
	   Hours later, the government of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia, announced a series of measures bringing the country
nearer to a war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   U.S. officials refused comment on the talks, and Holbrooke left
for Brussels, Belgium, to meet Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Thursday.
	   Before the talks ended, President Clinton reiterated that
Milosevic has to end his crackdown in Kosovo, pull out his special
police force and resume negotiations. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people
have been driven from their homes.
	   Despite mounting evidence of Milosevic's non-compliance and a
U.N. declaration confirming it, Washington seemed to lack the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into compliance.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   U.S. officials also face strong opposition from Russia, whose
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday the move could lead
to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a penalty or punishment of an isolated country but
almost a real war,'' Marshal Sergeyev said in Athens, Greece.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on those divisions, not
only between the Russians and NATO but within the Western alliance
itself.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position, of letting tens of thousands
of people starve or freeze to death this winter,'' Clinton said.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said ``NATO
will take a decision of their own.'' That implied the alliance
would not insist on the U.N. approval some U.S. allies and Russia
believe necessary.
	   Preparations for intervention continued in Yugoslavia and
abroad.
	   Britain, France and Germany all recommended their citizens leave
Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated all nonessential
diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy, and
U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy employees would soon
be evacuated.
	   In Belgrade the city government said it was making preparations
for possible strikes. Warning sirens blared in some Serbian towns.
Some opposition parties said mobilization of air defense reservists
was underway.
	   Late Wednesday, Serbian government officials ordered independent
media to stop broadcasting foreign media programs and said an
official ban will follow.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors, according to the independent Beta news agency. ``This
is not an appeal. This is an order.''
	   Milosevic has tried to show that he was working to settle the
Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic to
the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's Politika newspaper, a state-run daily, carried a
front-page headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased
in Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international diplomatic observers have disputed Serb claims. In
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian villagers claimed Serb forces fired
automatic weapons at their homes Wednesday in the Malisevo area
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Reporters who visited the area later that day heard no firing.
But the villagers claimed Serb police wait until foreign observers
and journalists have left the areas before reappearing.
	   On Wednesday, officials in both Yugoslavia and Albania reported
an exchange of gunfire Tuesday along the border between Kosovo and
Albania. Each blamed the other for starting the incident. Each
reported no casualties.
	   Poland's foreign minister, the current chairman of OSCE,
expressed disappointment with Yugoslavia's offer to the OSCE,
saying it allowed for a ``brief, improvised'' mission to Kosovo,
which he described as different from what the OSCE wanted.
	   The minister, Bronislaw Geremek, still stopped short of
rejecting the offer outright, calling it a new one that required
study.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.
	   Western leaders say all moves to end the conflict must be
verifiable and irreversible.

Wright's wrong night could cost second start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jaret Wright might not get thrown to the Yankees
again.
	   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove hopes his team can make it to a
Game 5. And if the Indians do, he'll then have to decide on a
starting pitcher.
	   Hargrove said before Game 2 on Wednesday that he was keeping his
options open. One of them could be not using Wright.
	   Wright didn't get out of the first inning in Game 1 as the
Yankees tagged him for five runs and five hits. It was Wright's
second straight disastrous postseason start. He gave up a pair of
three-run homers in his Game 1 start against the Red Sox in the
division series.
	   ``I think I have in consideration the fact that Jaret's last two
postseason starts have not been what I think he expects of himself
or we would like to have seen,'' he said.
	   ``But I think we also have to realize that he has got tremendous
stuff, and I think we will make the decision as we get closer to
that. But I am looking at other options.''
	   Wright had a storybook October last year. He beat the Indians
twice in the opening round of the playoffs and became the second
youngest pitcher to start a deciding game of the World Series.
	   But his postseason in '98 has read more like a Stephen King
novel.
	   Hargrove said Wright's biggest problem this fall has been his
inability to get a breaking ball over for strikes. A power pitcher
who realizes on locating his fastball, if Wright can't get his
curve or slider over, he's in big trouble. And that's been just the
case.
	   ``Anytime he's struggled this year, it's been because he
couldn't get his breaking ball over,'' said Hargrove. ``I haven't
seen what his velocity was last night, (catcher) Sandy Alomar said
he was throwing the ball well.''
	   Wright went 12-10 during the regular season and struggled
through a period of ``dead arm'' trouble mostly because in his
first full season in the majors, Wright had never thrown as many
129 innings in a season. He pitched 192 2-3 innings this year.
	   Hargrove will start Bartolo Colon in Game 3 and anticipates
starting Dwight Gooden against his former Yankee teammates in Game
4. As long as Hargrove doesn't have to use Gooden or Dave Burba in
long relief before then, Hargrove could start Burba in Game 5 _
should the Indians get to one.
	   However, Burba was 0-3 vs. the Yankees this season with a 6.16
ERA, and gave up four home runs against them just two weeks ago in
a Sept. 22 start.
	   ``Stats can be a deciding factor if you're on the fence,''
Hargrove said.
	   And right now, that's where Wright is sitting.

Jamaica defeats US cricket team

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final result. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica defeated the United States by
eight wickets Wednesday in the Red Stripe Bowl cricket tournament
at Chedwin Park. The Jamaicans scored 108 for the loss of two
wickets to beat the Americans' 107 in just 20 overs.
	   The win gave Jamaica a first-place tie in Zone Two on three
points with defending champions the Leeward Islands. The Leewards
beat the United States by 242 runs Tuesday.
	   Aggressive strokeplay from openers Robert Samuels and Raymond
Ferguson powered Jamaica to victory. Samuels struck 47 while
Ferguson made 28 in an opening stand worth 62 runs.
	   Christopher Gayle, who struck the winning runs, was unbeaten on
22.
	   The United States again found the going tough after Jamaican
captain James Adams won the toss and sent them in to bat. They
never recovered from losing their first three wickets for 14 runs
and were dismissed for a meager total in 43.1 overs.
	   West Indies fastbowler Franklyn Rose, who started the rout, was
the pick of the Jamaican bowlers, capturing up three wickets for 17
runs in 6.1 overs.
	   Of the American batsmen, only middle-order batsmen David
Hoilette and captain Richard Staple looked at home against the
Jamaican attack.
	   Hoilette, a former Jamaica player, topscored with 31 and was the
last man out. Staple, also a one-time Jamaica player, played
steadily for a patient 24 before he was run out in the 28th over.
Of the other batsmen, only Desmond Richards with 14 reached double
figures.
	   The tournament continues Thursday with the Leewards playing
Barbados.

Spiritual leader of Ethiopian Jewish community dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the Ethiopian Jewish
community, Kes Menashe Zemro, died Thursday at the age of 92,
likely of natural causes, in his home in a southern Israeli town.
	   ``He was the chief rabbi of the Ethiopian Jewish community in
both Ethiopia and Israel,'' said Addisu Masala, a Israeli lawmaker
who immigrated from Ethiopia.``He was this generation's great
leader.''
	   Kes Menashe, as he was known to his followers, was one of 14,000
Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel during the 1991 Gulf War in
a dramatic airlift that brought the majority of the community to
Israel. In Ethiopia, a kes served as the community's religious
leader, much as a rabbi does in mainstream Judaism.
	   But when the Ethiopian Jewish community came to Israel, the
authority of the kes was not recognized by Israel's governing
religious body. Kes Menashe was not permitted to officiate at
religious ceremonies like weddings or funerals but continued to act
as a spiritual leader, encouraging community members to bear the
trials of immigration with patience and tolerance, Masala said.
	   Although there are around 70 Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders
living in Israel, most are elderly and no longer possess the
authority they had in Ethiopia. Masala said there is no one to take
Kes Menashe's place.
	   ``A person like him doesn't exist anymore,'' Masala said. ``It
looks like he was the last.''
	   Kes Menashe was to buried Thursday in Yavneh. He is survived by
several children and grandchildren, Masala said.

Golubitsky retains foil title, Obry wins epee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Ukraine's Sergei
Golubitsky successfully defended his foil crown Wednesday at the
world fencing championships, while France's Hugues Obry took the
men's epee title.
	   The Ukrainian, who failed to win any World Cup events this
season, just barely retained his crown, edging Cuba's Elvis Gregory
15-13.
	   Golubitsky, who has 15 career World cup wins and a silver medal
from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, had little difficulty reaching
the finals, however, defeating Poland's Piotr Kielpikowski 15-8 in
the semifinals.
	   Gregory, who dominated the World Cup scene this season with four
wins, settled for silver, while Kielpikowski shared bronze with
Italy's Salvatore Sanzo.
	   Sixth at last year's worlds, Obry clinched the epee title this
time around with a 15-13 victory over Peter Vanky of Sweden.
	   The reigning European champion advanced to the final with a 15-9
semifinal win over Cuba's Carlos Pedroso.
	   Vanky, 18th in the world rankings, took silver, while Pedroso
and Attila Fekete went home with bronze medals.
	   Two-time reigning world epee champion Eric Srecki of France, who
leads the World Cup standings, finished a disappointing 33rd place.
	   Competition continues Thursday with the finals of the women's
epee and the men's sabre.

Ali promotes plans for center to honor his career
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRUCE SCHREINER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ Muhammad Ali brought the torch he
used to light the Olympic flame at the Atlanta Games, and offered
it Wednesday to be exhibited at a museum proposed to honor him.
	   From schoolchildren to politicians, people flocked around the
three-time heavyweight champion whose life journey would be on
display at the Muhammad Ali Center.
	   Ali's wife, Lonnie, said their goal for the center is to inspire
people, especially children, to reach their potential and to show
tolerance and respect for others, no matter their skin color or
beliefs.
	   ``This center will not be about his fame. Muhammad does not want
that. It is about values rather than fame,'' his wife said.
	   Ali, afflicted with Parkinson's syndrome, made no formal
comments during the news conference near the downtown site for the
proposed building.
	   The Ali Center would include a museum, a research center, an
auditorium and a garden. It would be built downtown near the Ohio
River, where Ali is reputed to have thrown his 1960 Olympic gold
medal to protest racial injustice.
	   Organizers want to raise dlrs 80 million for the
long-anticipated project _ dlrs 60 million to design and build the
center, plus dlrs 20 million for an endowment to pay for its
operation. Organizers hope to open the center on Jan. 17, 2001,
Ali's 59th birthday.
	   The Alis plan to move back to Louisville from Berrien Springs,
Mich., to help oversee development and operation of the center,
Lonnie Ali said.
	   ``It's not just Ali's victories in the ring that will be
captured at this center,'' mayor Jerry Abramson said.
	   ``But it will be as much about the causes for which the champ
fought outside the ring _ equal rights, tolerance, peace in the
world, respect for other human beings _ that will be expounded upon
and taught at this center.''
	   Gov. Paul Patton pledged support to raise money _ both public
and private _ to build the museum. Patton said the center should be
built ``on a scale that is commensurate with Muhammad Ali's impact
on the world.''
	   Larry Townsend, who heads the Ali Center board, said afterwards
that construction wouldn't begin until all the money is raised.

Court asks foreign minister to testify in attempted coup trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar's Supreme Court decided Wednesday to
ask Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor al Thani to
testify in the trial of the 1996 coup plotters.
	   It did not say when Sheik Hamad is to appear in court.
	   The trial of 110 people accused of staging a failed coup in 1996
against Qatar's ruler Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa began late last year.
	   Forty of the defendants are being tried in absentia, including
the former interior minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani.
	   The Qatari ruler seized power from his father in 1995.
	   This is the first time that a Qatari court asks a Cabinet
minister to testify.

Chilean, American, Croatians get `alternative Nobels'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout; Stands as 3rd Ld-Writethru to some lines
to add comment from Chilean winner. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Focusing on people who challenge
conventional thinking, the ``alternative Nobels'' on Wednesday
recognized a Chilean fighting to save a spectacular river and an
American cancer-prevention specialist, among others.
	   This year's four Right Livelihood Awards, each worth dlrs
58,500, went to Juan Pablo Orrego of Chile; Samuel Epstein of the
University of Illinois-Chicago; the London-based International Baby
Food Action Network; and peace activists Katarina Kruhonja and
Vesna Terselic of Croatia.
	   The awards, first given in 1980, focus on people running
grass-roots campaigns and those who challenge corporations or
scientific and economic orthodoxies.
	   The recipients all ``are engaged in the global struggle to put
limits on corporate power,'' awards founder Jakob von Uexkull said
at a news conference, adding that he viewed this decade's troubles
in Croatia as stemming partly from economic pressures.
	   Orrego helped found the Action Group for the Bio Bio in 1991, to
work against plans by the Chilean energy company ENDESA to build a
series of six dams on the swift, powerful river that tumbles from
the Andes Mountains into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The group's work has made ``the previously secret plans for dam
construction a hot issue of environment, human rights and to
question the present development model in Chile,'' the awards
foundation said.
	   ``I think this is a very important and valuable backing for our
cause,'' Orrego told the Santiago afternoon newspaper La Hora. He
said the prize money would be divided between the Action Group,
members of the organization and the indigenous Pehuenches
population who will be displaced by dam construction.
	   Epstein, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine,
is chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, which works to
prevent exposure to carcinogens in air, water, food and the
workplace. The award also noted coalition research indicating that
milk and meat from cattle treated with synthetic hormones can cause
cancer.
	   The International Baby Food Action Network brought infant
feeding groups together to focus on ``improving breastfeeding
rates, reducing dependence on industrial artificial milk products
and protecting families' freedom of choice,'' the foundation said.
	   Terselic, found of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign, and Kruhonja,
director of the Center for Peace, Non-Violence and Human Rights in
the city of Osijek, are both working to heal the postwar tensions
in Croatia.
	   Von Uexkull sold an extensive stamp collection to provide seed
money for the awards, which are aimed at recognizing work that he
and the Right Livelihood Foundation believe gets ignored by the
more-famous Nobel Prizes.
	   The winners will receive the prizes in a ceremony in the Swedish
Parliament on Dec. 9, the day before the Nobel Prizes are presented
in Stockholm.
	   The jury for this year's prize included von Uexkull, Richard
Jolly of the United Nations Development Program and Sweden's
ambassador to Zambia, Kristina Svensson.

defeating Singapore by 121 runs Wednesday in 10-nation Asian
Cricket Council (ACC) trophy tournament being held in the Nepalese
capital.
	   Batting first, Bangladesh scored 279 for eight wickets. The
match started late because of poor light and it was reduced to 47
overs instead of 50 overs.
	   Bangladesh then bowled out Singapore for 158 runs.Zubin Shroff's
unbeaten knock of 73 propped up Singapore's innings. Aminul Islam
claimed three Singapore wickets for 23 runs.

than mere 18 they had scored against Hong Kong on Monday.
	   Chasing the United Arab Emirates' formidable total of 273 off
44.1 overs, Japan replied with 70 runs. Shahzad Altaf captured six
Japanese wickets for 13 runs.

the required runs in just 13.3 overs.
	   Malaysian scored 170 runs in 48 overs. Papua New Guinea batsmen
were shot out for 105 runs in 28.4 overs.

Spiritual leader of Ethiopian Jewish community dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the Ethiopian Jewish
community, Kes Menashe Zemro, died Wednesday at the age of 92,
likely of natural causes, in his home in a southern Israeli town.
	   ``He was the chief rabbi of the Ethiopian Jewish community in
both Ethiopia and Israel,'' said Addisu Masala, a Israeli lawmaker
who immigrated from Ethiopia.''He was this generation's great
leader.''
	   Kes Menashe, as he was known to his followers, was one of 14,000
Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel during the 1991 Gulf War in
a dramatic airlift that brought the majority of the community to
Israel. In Ethiopia, a kes served as the community's religious
leader, much as a rabbi does in mainstream Judaism.
	   But when the Ethiopian Jewish community came to Israel, the
authority of the kes was not recognized by Israel's governing
religious body. Kes Menashe was not permitted to officiate at
religious ceremonies like weddings or funerals but continued to act
as a spiritual leader, encouraging community members to bear the
trials of immigration with patience and tolerance, Masala said.
	   Although there are around 70 Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders
living in Israel, most are elderly and no longer possess the
authority they had in Ethiopia. Masala said there is no one to take
Kes Menashe's place.
	   ``A person like him doesn't exist anymore,'' Masala said. ``It
looks like he was the last.''
	   Kes Menashe was to buried Thursday in Yavneh. He is survived by
several children and grandchildren, Masala said.

Judge says voters can decide Yankee Stadium fate
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Invoking the vanished ballparks of the city's
past, a judge ruled Wednesday that New Yorkers should be allowed to
decide the fate of Yankee Stadium.
	   The decision was a defeat for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in his
fight to ban the November referendum from the ballot box.
	   ``I don't think it's a legal decision,'' Giuliani said. ``It's a
political decision.''
	   Unless the city wins on appeal, the ruling means voters will
decide next month if they want to spend an estimated dlrs 1 billion
to build a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West Side.
	   In his 15-page decision, state Supreme Court Justice Douglas
McKeon compared building the new stadium to a family buying a new
home, and said ``each voice in the family must be heard.''
	   ``The decision to abandon an athletic stadium involves emotional
and economic factors,'' McKeon said. ``Ebbets Field, the Polo
Grounds _ shouldn't the public have the right to say whether Yankee
Stadium meets that same fate?''
	   Both Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds were torn down and
replaced by housing projects.
	   Months of name-calling and political wrangling between Giuliani
and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who is running for governor
against Republican incumbent George Pataki, began after Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner began talking about moving the team from
the Bronx when his lease expires in 2002.
	   Giuliani, the city's self-described No. 1 Yankees fan, proposed
a new state-of-the-art, dlrs 1 billion stadium where warehouses and
rail yards now stand.
	   The push for a Manhattan stadium gained momentum in April after
a 500-pound (225-kg) steel joint fell at the 75-year-old Yankee
Stadium, forcing it to close temporarily.
	   The mayor may have liked the idea of moving the Yankees, but the
public apparently didn't. Vallone called for the November
referendum.
	   When Giuliani created a special charter commission to block the
referendum, Vallone sued.
	   The city's chief lawyer, Michael Hess, called McKeon's ruling
ridiculous and said the judge's interpretation opens the door for
the entire city to vote on anything it thinks is important.
	   The city hopes to have its appeal heard as early as next week.
	   Steinbrenner said through a publicist that the Yankees were too
busy playing the Cleveland Indians in the American League
championship series, ``trying to bring a World Series to the city,
and we will not get involved in politics.''

Angola rebels urged to contact government, talk peace not war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The three countries supervising Angola's
crumbling 1994 peace accord urged the leader of the former rebel
movement UNITA to immediately contact the government to work on
steps to avert a resumption of war.
	   In a letter released Tuesday, the foreign ministers of the
United States, Portugal and Russia warned that if Jonas Savimbi
failed to contact President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, ``we and
others will be left with no other conclusion than that you do not
want peace.''
	   The letter to Savimbi, dated Sept. 24, urged the UNITA leader to
refrain from trying to achieve his political goals through military
action, in violation of the 1994 peace accords, known as the Lusaka
Protocol.
	   ``After more than two decades of intermittent civil war, full,
immediate and unambiguous compliance with the Lusaka peace process
is the only viable option for UNITA's continued survival as a
political party,'' the ministers wrote.
	   The Angolan government has severed contact with Savimbi,
accusing him of reneging on the U.N.-brokered accord which ended
two decades of fighting but has since been jeopardized by a
resumption of fighting between the two sides.
	   The government has instead recognized a group of UNITA
dissidents who split with Savimbi as the legitimate UNITA
representatives in the peace process.
	   The Security Council has refused to recognize the new group and
has urged dos Santos to reconsider his decision.
	   The government and the United Nations have accused UNITA of
violating the peace accords by failing to relinquish control of its
four central highland strongholds and failing to disarm its troops.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA _ a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ to try to force it to comply with the
accord.

NBA bargaining to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Facing the possibility of the first shortened
season in National Basketball Association history, owners and
players resume labor talks Thursday with few expectations of
progress.
	   ``We're ready to sit there and talk all day and all night and
maybe someone will come up with something,'' NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Often that's how it happens, but I
have no reason to be optimistic.''
	   The bargaining session will be only the second between the sides
since the lockout was imposed July 1.
	   The owners and players have only a couple of days to come up
with a deal that will save an 82-game season, and such a
breakthrough seems unlikely with the sides far apart on the main
economic issues.
	   ``I hope it's going to be substantive,'' players union director
Billy Hunter said. ``I'm going to tell David (Stern, the
commissioner) what we don't like about their last proposal, and
then suggest that we really talk about something that's going to
create some movement on both sides.''
	   The last time owners and players were together in the same room
was Aug. 6, when the players made their most recent proposal, and
the owners responded by walking out of the room.
	   Two hour-long informal sessions have been held in the last two
weeks, with only Stern, Granik, Hunter and union president Patrick
Ewing attending.
	   Both sides now expect the work stoppage to force the
cancellation of games. The entire exhibition schedule has already
been canceled, and the regular season is due to begin Nov. 3.
	   ``We feel that the NBA is making a lot of money. Everybody, for
the most part, is doing financially OK,'' Ewing said. ``So we don't
see why they had to lock us out. If you asked David Stern, I don't
think he would say that the league as a whole is doing bad.''
	   But Stern and the owners claim as many as half of them are
losing money and the league as a whole is much less profitable than
it was just a few years ago.
	   The owners are seeking a system with cost certainty, looking to
gradually roll back the amount of revenue devoted to player
salaries from 57 percent to 48 percent.
	   The players have offered some concessions, but are unwilling to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap or give up the ``Larry Bird
exception'' that allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain
their own free agents.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a U.S. envoy left in silence
after three days of talks, a defiant President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced NATO threats to end his violent crackdown in Kosovo. His
government prepared people for possible NATO airstrikes, sweeping
out World War II-era bomb shelters.

Milosevic's office said ``attempts were made to overcome the
differences.''
	   The Yugoslav statement also said threats of NATO airstrikes
``jeopardize the continuation of the political process.''
	   U.S. officials refused comment on the substance of the talks,
and Holbrooke left for Brussels, Belgium, to meet Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday.
	   One senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the meetings as ``extremely serious and sober'' and that
Holbrooke had tried to learn what steps Milosevic was prepared to
take to end the crisis.
	   He said Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for
Selman Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which
13 other ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by
Serb police at point-blank range.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, the official said.
	   In wake of the talks, the government of Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia, announced a series of measures bringing the
country nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Ignoring official appeals, Yugoslavs went on panic shopping
sprees _ causing shortages of flour, sugar and other staples. Plane
tickets for Western destinations have been booked for a while, as
those who could afford it prepared to flee the country.
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   ``At first, I never thought they would bomb us. This is Europe
after all. But now I'm starting to panic,'' said Emilija Kacanac,
22-year-old university student, as her hands trembled.
	   Most of the Belgrade bomb shelters were filled with garbage, and
some have been turned into discos and cafes. It was estimated that
only one-third of Belgrade's 2 million people could pack into the
existing ones.
	   Some hospitals released patients who are not seriously ill,
anticipating victims of the possible airstrikes. Warning sirens
also blared in some towns, and some opposition parties said
mobilization of air defense reservists was under way.
	   Britain, France, Austria and Germany all recommended their
citizens leave Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated
nonessential diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade
embassy, and U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy
employees would soon be evacuated.
	   Before the talks ended, President Clinton reiterated that
Milosevic has to end his crackdown in Kosovo, pull out his special
police force and resume negotiations. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people
have been driven from their homes.
	   The U.S. official said foreign military observers have reported
no significant military activity for the past six days, and Serbia
claims it has removed significant forces.
	   ``I have not seen that,'' the U.S. official said. ``They are
making claims of additional withdrawals. I personally cannot
confirm it. They are moving in and out all the time.''
	   Despite mounting evidence of Milosevic's non-compliance and a
U.N. declaration, Washington seemed to lack the international
consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into compliance.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree to defer for two or three years on deciding
whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia. U.S. officials said
Holbrooke presented Milosevic with a modified version of the plan
and would show it to ethnic Albanian leaders Wednesday.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   U.S. officials also face strong opposition from Russia, whose
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday the move could lead
to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on divisions between
the Russians and NATO, and within NATO itself.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position, of letting tens of thousands
of people starve or freeze to death this winter,'' Clinton said.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said ``NATO
will take a decision of their own.''
	   Meanwhile, Milosevic tried to show that he was working to settle
the Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic
to the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika newspaper also carried a
front-page headline Wednesday saying police actions have ceased in
Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international observers have disputed Serb claims.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian villagers claimed Serb forces fired
automatic weapons at their homes Wednesday in the Malisevo area
about 25 miles southwest of Pristina. Reporters who visited the
area later heard no firing, but villagers claimed Serb police wait
until foreign observers leave the areas.
	   On Wednesday, officials in both Yugoslavia and Albania reported
an exchange of gunfire Tuesday along the Kosovo-Albania border that
they blamed each other for starting. There were no reported
casualties.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.

High-ranking British official visits Cuba to discuss trade
</HEADLINE>
relations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Foreign Office minister Baroness Symons of
Britain arrived in Cuba Wednesday for a two-day visit she hoped
would improve trade and relations between the two nations.
	   ``I'm delighted to be here,'' Symons told reporters upon
arriving at Havana's International airport Wednesday afternoon.
``It's a very special visit ... there are trade issues, human
rights issues.''
	   Symons is the first representative of Britain's new Labor
government to visit Cuba and possibly the highest ranking British
official to travel to the island since the triumph of Fidel
Castro's revolution nearly 40 years ago.
	   Symons was meeting Wednesday with Cuban Foreign Commerce
Minister Ricardo Cabrisas and was to visit Foreign Investment
Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz on Thursday, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
	   Another meeting was scheduled with Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina.
	   A highlight of the trip was to be the signing of an air
transport agreement which would allow British Airways to begin
flying commercial jets to Cuba.
	   Ties between Britain and Cuba have increased in recent months,
marked by a growing number of visits by British entrepreneurs
interested in doing business in the communist country.
	   Last month, Symons visited several of the last remaining British
colonies in the Caribbean, including the British Virgin Islands and
Turks and Caicos Islands.

Golubitsky retains foil title, Obry wins epee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Ukraine's Sergei
Golubitsky successfully defended his foil crown Wednesday at the
world fencing championships, while France's Hugues Obry took the
men's epee title.
	   The Ukrainian, who failed to win any World Cup events this
season, just barely retained his crown, edging Cuba's Elvis Gregory
15-13.
	   Golubitsky, who has 15 career World cup wins and a silver medal
from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, had little difficulty reaching
the finals, however, defeating Poland's Piotr Kielpikowski 15-8 in
the semifinals.
	   Gregory, who dominated the World Cup scene this season with four
wins, settled for silver, while Kielpikowski shared bronze with
Italy's Salvatore Sanzo.
	   Sixth at last year's worlds, Obry clinched the epee title this
time around with a 15-13 victory over Peter Vanky of Sweden.
	   The reigning European champion advanced to the final with a 15-9
semifinal win over Cuba's Carlos Pedroso.
	   Vanky, 18th in the world rankings, took silver, while Pedroso
and Attila Fekete went home with bronze medals.
	   Two-time reigning world epee champion Eric Srecki of France, who
leads the World Cup standings, finished a disappointing 33rd place.
	   Competition continues Thursday with the finals of the women's
epee and the men's sabre.

Study: Drug cuts hospitalization need in kids with asthma attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SONJA BARISIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NORFOLK, Virginia (AP) _ Adding another medicine to the
traditional two-drug treatment for severe childhood asthma attacks
substantially reduces the need to hospitalize sufferers, a study
found.
	   Researchers examined the effect of adding ipratropium bromide to
the standard emergency room therapy for asthma attacks, albuterol
and steroids.
	   The result was a 28 percent drop in the need for
hospitalization, according to the study in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
	   The combination therapy also was helpful in less severe cases,
but the benefits were less dramatic.
	   ``If we give the medication in a timely fashion, some of them
will be able to go home,'' said Dr. Faiqa Qureshi, a pediatric
emergency medicine specialist who led the study at Children's
Hospital of the King's Daughters and Eastern Virginia Medical
School.
	   Qureshi's 1996-97 study involved 434 children, ages 2 to 18, who
went to the hospital's emergency room with moderate to severe
asthma attacks. All were given three doses of albuterol, which
relaxes muscle spasms in the airways when it is inhaled, and
steroids, which reduce inflammation in the lungs.
	   Half of the children were randomly selected to get two doses of
ipratropium, too. Ipratropium helps open the airways by blocking
certain nervous system impulses.
	   In children with severe asthma attacks, 38 percent needed to be
hospitalized after being given the ipratropium. By comparison, 53
percent who received only the standard treatment needed to be
hospitalized.
	   Ipratropium has been available to treat asthma in children for
years, though its use is not common, said Dr. Thomas Fischer,
clinical pediatrics professor at the University of Cincinnati
College of Medicine.
	   Qureshi's findings ``reflect my clinical impression of the
drug,'' he said. ``It's not a magic bullet. It seems to be
helpful.''

Marc Buoniconti visits paralyzed gymnast

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sang Lan's giggling and constant smile amaze
even other paralyzed patients.
	   The 17-year-old Chinese gymnast, who was injured during a warmup
vault at this summer's Goodwill Games, got a hospital visit
Wednesday from Marc Buoniconti and his father, Nick, the former
American football star with the Miami Dophins.
	   Marc has been in a wheelchair since a football injury 13 years
ago and was the inspiration for the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis.
	   The 32-year-old former college football player told Sang about
the progress being made in finding a cure for spinal cord injuries.
	   ``She's precious,'' Buoniconti said after meeting Sang. ``She is
a champion you can see that. It kind of makes everything that you
do seem a little bit more important. She inspired me.''
	   Sang is expected to be released from the hospital in the next
few weeks. She will remain in a wheelchair but doctors hope she can
eventually care for herself.
	   ``She is not quite self-sufficient yet,'' said Dr. Kristjan
Ragnarsson, chairman of Rehabilitation Medicine at Mount Sinai-NYU
Medical Center, where Sang has been since mid-August.
	   ``It is our goal that in the near future I hope she will become
self-sufficient, but it would be at a wheelchair level because she
has not had any neurological recovery in her legs. For the moment,
walking is out of the picture.''
	   Sang has improved certain basic skills. She will continue her
rehabilitation at the hospital as an outpatient for several months
before being able to return home.
	   But when she leaves the hospital, Sang, smiling and speaking
through an interpreter, knows exactly where she wants to go.
	   ``Disneyland,'' she said.

Cowboys offense hard to figure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) _ Before Chan Gailey arrived as the Dallas
Cowboys coach, ``Load Left'' was the standard play for the Dallas
Cowboys in short yardage situations.
	   The ball was handed off to Emmitt Smith who ran to his left
behind fullback Daryl Johnston and offensive linemen Nate Newton
and Mark Tuinei.
	   The opponents knew the play was coming. Their problem was
stopping it.
	   For years they couldn't and the Cowboys were the best in the
National Football League.
	   But once injuries hampered Johnston, Newton and Tuinei and Smith
lost a half-step teams had no trouble stuffing the play.
	   The most famous example was a fourth and one from their own
30-yard line against Philadelphia in 1995 when Barry Switzer went
for it and the Eagles stopped the play to turn the game around in a
20-17 Eagles win.
	   Under Gailey, the former offensive coordinator at Pittsburgh,
opponents have no idea where the Cowboys will attack and can't be
sure which weapons they will use.
	   ``People can't predict what we're going to do, what we're going
to throw at them,'' said Smith. ``I'm not surprised about the
success we've had. Our new system allows us go out and play and to
make plays. I feel our offense is getting good enough to compete
with anybody in the NFL.''
	   The Cowboys (3-2) are third in the NFC in offense and the
average of 27 points per game is fifth in the NFL.
	   Dallas averages 145.9 yards rushing, second in the NFC and
fourth in the NFL. Their 209 yards passing average puts them in the
top 10 in the NFL.
	   Teams can't load up on the Cowboys running game. If they do,
they get burned by Deion Sanders, Ernie Mills or Billy Davis, all
of whom have taken the load off Michael Irvin.
	   Last week in a 31-10 victory over Washington, the Cowboys
rediscovered their tight end position as a threat. The Redskins
weren't ready for it as David LaFleur had four catches for 29
yards.
	   The offensive line also is vastly improved in pass protection,
permitting only five sacks, second best in the NFL.
	   ``Statistics are nice but the bottom line is did you win the
game?'' Gailey said. ``That's where our focus is more than yardage
are numbers.''
	   Against Washington, Smith and Chris Warren each rushed for more
than 100 yards. It was the first time a pair of Dallas running
backs had surpassed 100 yards since Tony Dorsett and Robert
Newhouse did it in 1978 and only the third time in club history.
	   ``The great thing about our offense is that we can get even
better,'' Smith said. ``We're just scratching the surface.''
	   Warren said Gailey's system ``keeps fresh players in the game.
Emmitt's the starter but I'm ready for whatever comes my way. I
don't care if I carry the ball five times or 25 times.''

Scientists make first contact in a year with rare mountain
</HEADLINE>
gorillas &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Two groups of rare mountain gorillas first studied
by Dian Fossey have been found in good condition in east Africa a
year after animal researchers were driven out by rebel fighting.
	   Trackers searching the jungles along the Rwanda-Congo border
last month found 63 of the animals, representing two of the three
groups observed by Fossey in the mid-1960s. She was mysteriously
murdered in 1985.
	   The gorillas appeared healthy and calm, Dieter Steklis,
scientific director of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, said Tuesday.
One of the groups included an infant no more than 6 months old.
	   Primate researchers were forced to halt their observations in
August 1997 because of rebel fighting. Conservationists worried
that war, poachers and other hardships would push the apes to the
brink of extinction.
	   Researchers made contact with the gorillas the first day they
were able to re-enter the region in late September.
	   ``It's been agonizing because we weren't hearing anything and
there's not much you can do to change the situation,'' Steklis
said.
	   The positive results of the survey gave researchers hope that
the other gorillas in the war-torn area may also have fared well.
Only 620 mountain gorillas are estimated to survive on the flanks
of a volcanic mountain range that forms the border of Rwanda, Congo
and Uganda.
	   Despite weighing up to 500 pounds (225 kilos), they are shy,
plant-eaters that live in small, tightly knit social groups.
	   Since Fossey's time, scientists have named mountain gorillas
and, more recently, profiled them genetically. Gorillas also can be
identified by the peculiar shapes of their wrinkled noses, which
are as unique as a zebra's stripes.
	   Rebellions and ethnic violence have forced scientists repeatedly
to retreat from the gorillas' home, known as Virungas National Park
in Congo and the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda.
	   Since 1994, more than 1 million refugees have established camps
on the park's fringes, cutting down as many as 36 million trees for
firewood and shelter.
	   Poachers and others have killed at least 14 mountain gorillas in
the past two years, and more have become tangled in snares meant to
capture small game.

Malaysia calls for overhaul of monetary system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Malaysia, the country that warned a year ago
global economic turmoil could happen, called Wednesday for a quick
and complete overhaul of the international monetary system before
it melts down.
	   Dato Mustapa Mohamed, who runs Malaysia's finance ministry on a
day-to- day basis, also recommended a regulatory authority for
international capital markets similar to ones governments maintain
at home to supervise stock markets or commodity trading.
	   He had harsh words for the International Monetary Fund, saying
the high interest rates and tight monetary conditions that come
with its billion-dollar rescue packages ``make a bad situation
worse.''
	   At last year's annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in
Hong Kong, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said rapid
flow of investor funds in and out of emerging market countries was
destabilizing and had a devastating effect on the nations when
international investors fled with their capital.
	   Mohamad now is his country's finance minister following the
dismissal last month of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his
arrest on corruption charges.
	   Mohamed, the finance ministry's No. 2 official who spoke at this
year's IMF/World Bank meetings, said when Malaysia proposed some
rules for currency trade at the Hong Kong meeting ``our suggestion
was dismissed as an attempt at `denial' or `blaming others' for our
own problems.''
	   He said the ``belief that globalization and the unfettered
workings of the market, especially the financial market, can only
bring benefits'' is a flawed one.
	   More rather than less government intervention may be needed, he
said, to ensure there is an effective financial regulation and
supervising of companies' operations.
	   ``We risk a global meltdown if we continue with ad hoc
incremental measures,'' Mohamed said. ``A complete overhaul of the
international monetary system is required and required soon.''
	   He also said the near collapse in the United States of the
``mother of all hedge funds, the Long Term Capital Markets, is a
strong indication that no country is spared from the contagion
effect of the current crisis.''
	   Mohamed said the activities of the fund would have been
overlooked ``but for the fact it could have destroyed the financial
system of the very rich.'' He said Malaysia will not drop the its
foreign exchange controls until there is a significant
restructuring of the world's financial system. Malaysia imposed
these controls Sept. 1 to protect its currency.
	   Mohamed described the controls as ``selective, administrative
measures'' that don't impact foreign trade or investment, and said
Malaysia was not shutting itself off from the world.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a U.S. envoy left in silence
after three days of talks, a defiant President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced NATO threats to end his violent crackdown in Kosovo. His
government prepared people for possible NATO airstrikes, sweeping
out World War II-era bomb shelters.
	   Following his last meeting with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
Milosevic's office said ``attempts were made to overcome the
differences.''
	   The Yugoslav statement also said threats of NATO airstrikes
``jeopardize the continuation of the political process.''
	   U.S. officials refused comment on the substance of the talks,
and Holbrooke left for Brussels, Belgium, to meet Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday.
	   One senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the meetings as ``extremely serious and sober'' and that
Holbrooke had tried to learn what steps Milosevic was prepared to
take to end the crisis.
	   He said Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for
Selman Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which
13 other ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by
Serb police at point-blank range.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, the official said.
	   After the talks, the government of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia, announced measures that bring the country nearer to war
footing. It ordered government departments to increase security and
threatened punishment for those who spread ``fear, panic and
defeatism.''
	   Ignoring official appeals, Yugoslavs went on panic shopping
sprees _ causing shortages of flour, sugar and other staples. Plane
tickets for Western destinations have been booked for a while, as
those who could afford it prepared to flee the country.
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   ``At first, I never thought they would bomb us. This is Europe
after all. But now I'm starting to panic,'' said Emilija Kacanac,
22-year-old university student, as her hands trembled.
	   Most of the Belgrade bomb shelters were filled with garbage, and
some have been turned into discos and cafes. It was estimated that
only one-third of Belgrade's 2 million people could pack into the
existing ones.
	   Some hospitals released patients who are not seriously ill,
anticipating victims of the possible airstrikes. Warning sirens
also blared in some towns, and some opposition parties said
mobilization of air defense reservists was under way.
	   Britain, France, Austria and Germany all recommended their
citizens leave Yugoslavia. Canada has already evacuated
nonessential diplomatic staff and their families from its Belgrade
embassy, and U.S. officials said dependents of its embassy
employees would soon be evacuated.
	   Before the talks ended, President Clinton reiterated that
Milosevic has to end his crackdown in Kosovo, pull out his special
police force and resume negotiations. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
for Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people
have been driven from their homes.
	   The U.S. official said foreign military observers have reported
no significant military activity for the past six days, and Serbia
claims it has removed significant forces.
	   ``I have not seen that,'' the U.S. official said. ``They are
making claims of additional withdrawals. I personally cannot
confirm it. They are moving in and out all the time.''
	   Despite mounting evidence of Milosevic's non-compliance and a
U.N. declaration, Washington seemed to lack the international
consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into compliance.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree to defer for two or three years on deciding
whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia. U.S. officials said
Holbrooke presented Milosevic with a modified version of the plan
and would show it to ethnic Albanian leaders Wednesday.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   U.S. officials also face strong opposition from Russia, whose
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday the move could lead
to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on divisions between
the Russians and NATO, and within NATO itself.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position of letting tens of thousands
of people starve or freeze to death this winter,'' Clinton said.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said ``NATO
will take a decision of their own.''
	   Meanwhile, Milosevic tried to show that he was working to settle
the Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic
to the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's state-run Politika newspaper also carried a
front-page headline Wednesday saying police actions have ceased in
Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international observers have disputed Serb claims.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian villagers said Serb forces fired
automatic weapons at their homes Wednesday in the Malisevo area
about 25 miles southwest of Pristina. Reporters who visited the
area later heard no firing, but villagers claimed Serb police wait
until foreign observers leave the areas.
	   On Wednesday, officials in both Yugoslavia and Albania reported
gunfire Tuesday along the Kosovo-Albania border that they blamed
each other for starting. No casualties were reported.
	   A NATO official who asked not to be named said Wednesday that an
estimated 14,000 Yugoslav army troops remain in Kosovo _ down from
36,000 10 days earlier. That is in addition to 11,000 special
military and anti-terrorist police, half the total in all of
Yugoslavia.
	   He also said 50,000 refugees remain without shelter, and that at
least 15 percent of buildings in central and western Kosovo have
been damaged or destroyed.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A proposal President Bill Clinton put forward
to calm turbulent financial markets caught officials at the
International Monetary Fund off guard and will need further
refinement, a top IMF official said Wednesday.
	   Jack Boorman, IMF's policy director, called the U.S.
recommendation to speed IMF loans to countries threatened with
investor flight a ``distant'' part of the global architecture
officials are struggling to create to cope with the current crisis
and prevent future crises.
	   ``I want to make sure that efforts on this front are not
discussions that take away from the first order of business _
dealing with the crisis,'' Boorman told a small group of reporters
during an interview.
	   Calling it more a ``concept'' than a thought-through proposal,
Boorman said the idea merited further consideration. However, he
said, a number of potential problems would have to be resolved,
including how to involve rich countries and the private sector
along with the IMF in supplying emergency loans.
	   The feeling is that all three groups need to be involved to
offer enough resources to persuade frightened investors to leave
their money in a particular country.
	   Boorman said Clinton's proposal caught the IMF off guard because
it had not been raised by the U.S. representative to the
organization during preparations for the annual meeting or in
discussions by a separate group of 22 nations convened by the
United States to explore reforms to the global financial system.
	   The IMF learned of the proposal only a few days before Clinton
made it public last Friday in brief remarks on the South Lawn of
the White House, he said.
	   Clinton, who has given increasing attention to the financial
crisis in recent weeks, has been involved in a series of
brainstorming sessions at the White House with his top economic
advisers, searching for bolder proposals to contain what he has
called the biggest threat to the global economy in 50 years.
	   Boorman, an American, made his remarks as the annual meetings of
the 182-nation IMF and World Bank were heading to their closing
sessions Thursday.

IOC and members seek solutions on drug use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Sport leaders are finally going to do something
about drug use in amateur sport, according to IOC vice-president
Dick Pound.
	   Widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in amateur sport
has been common knowledge for decades, but various and very public
examples have brought the issue to the forefront _ a doping scandal
at the Tour de France and a drug suspension for swimming gold
medallist Michelle Smith of Ireland most recently.
	   According to Pound, the result has a mixture of positive and
negative.
	   ``It's bad because it's clear it's still going on, but it's good
because now everybody is focused on it,'' said Pound, who was in
Toronto to speak at a Sports Media Canada luncheon Wednesday. ``I
think everybody _ athletes, international federations, the IOC
(International Olympic Committee) _ say `Oof, if it can happen to
these sports it can happen to anybody, maybe we better circle the
wagons now and take this opportunity to re-assess how we're going
at this.'''
	   The re-evaluation of an inefficient, and usually non-existent,
drug abuse prevention program is geared toward globalization.
	   ``It's important to have a single code,'' he said.
	   An IOC subcommittee is presently studying the cost of a drug
program that would involve all the international sport federations
under the IOC umbrella.
	   ``The key thing is going to be to have an expanded,
out-of-competition testing network that is administered the same
way, for all sports in all countries by consent (and) with a
standardized set of procedures,'' said Pound, a native of Montreal.
``What you really have to do is win the confidence of athletes that
your program is good enough to give them reasonable assurance that
if they're in a race and they're not doped nobody else will be
either.''
	   Given the Ben Johnson scandal 10 years ago, why did it take so
long for the federations and the IOC to do anything?
	   ``There are a number of reasons,'' Pound said. ``One, because
this fight against doping started with the IOC, it makes it a bad
idea as far as a lot of international federations are concerned.
	   ``Another is that the international federations quite often are
not in close contact with the coaches and athletes that are
actually out there in the field.
	   ``I'm not sure some of them know for sure how much is going on,
and even if they knew I'm not sure they'd know how to go about
stopping it.''
	   Pound added that only about a dozen federations conduct
out-of-competition testing, ``which is the key to all this,'' he
said _ and that steroids are seldom used during competition
periods.

Opposition calls for withdrawal of intervention troops

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with SA defense official meeting prime minister,
criticism from South African analysts of involvement, and first
week's cost to South Africa in 11th to 15th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Opposition parties on Wednesday called
for the immediate withdrawal of Southern African Development
Community troops, even as South Africa sent more soldiers to the
strife-torn kingdom.
	   South Africa, which sent 600 of its troops across the border on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and end other unrest, deployed 750
more soldiers to the Belgium-sized country, said Lt. Col. Laverne
Machine.
	   The soldiers will look for weapons caches in northern Lesotho,
where there are reports that armed youths are ``running around,''
Machine said.
	   The deployment brings to 3,500 the total number of SADC forces _
including about 450 from Botswana _ who are part of the Lesotho
task force, Machine said. She added that 1,700 are foot soldiers
and the rest are support troops, many of whom are stationed on the
South African side of the border.
	   Lesotho's nine opposition parties called for the immediate
withdrawal of SADC forces, the South African Press Association
reported.
	   The opposition parties also suggested that a government of
national unity run Lesotho until new elections are held. Under a
tentative agreement mediated by South Africa on Friday, the
elections are to be held in 15 to 18 months.
	   Opposition groups last week rejected South Africa's proposal
that the Lesotho Congress for Democracy continue to rule until the
next elections. The opposition claims the LCD stole last May's
general elections.
	   The SADC has proposed the formation of a transitional structure
to prepare for new elections. The body, which would consist of one
or two members from each political party, would ensure fair
treatment of all parties by state-owned media and would decide all
electoral matters, including the role of law-enforcement
authorities in the election process.
	   But the proposal came under fire Wednesday by ruling party
members who said a transitional government would violate Lesotho's
constitution. The remarks came during the first meeting of
Parliament since political turmoil forced it to close down Sept.
14.
	   Opposition alliance spokeswoman Mamello Morrison said that even
if such a body was created, it would not preclude that a new
government of national unity also be formed to rule until the next
elections, the South African news agency reported.
	   South Africa's Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils, who on
Wednesday met with Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, said
he encouraged Lesotho to consider how to control the army that
rebelled against the government.
	   He defended South Africa's military presence that had allowed
``more and more people ... to enjoy their daily living.'' Before
the military intervention, protestors had shut down businesses and
government in Maseru.
	   But political analysts in South Africa on Wednesday criticized
South Africa's involvement.
	   '' Our troops are being sucked deeper and deeper into the
situation,'' Carl Schutte of the Human Sciences Research Council in
Pretoria was quoted as saying by the South African Press
Association.
	   ``If one wants to be realistic, it will take months before they
can withdraw,'' he said.
	   The first week of South Africa's military activities in Lesotho
were estimated to cost more than 8 million rand (dlrs 1.3 million),
Ministry of Defense spokesman Puso Tladi said.

Malaysia calls for overhaul of monetary system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to correct style on second reference to Malaysian
official to Mustapa, sted Mohamed; second reference to prime
minister as Mahathir, sted Mohamad, Minor editing throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Malaysia, the country that warned a year ago
global economic turmoil could happen, on Wednesday called for a
quick and complete overhaul of the international monetary system
before it melts down.
	   Dato Mustapa Mohamed, deputy Malaysian finance minister, also
recommended a regulatory authority for international capital
markets similar to ones governments maintain at home to supervise
stock markets or commodity trading.
	   He had harsh words for the International Monetary Fund, saying
the high interest rates and tight monetary conditions that come
with its billion dollar rescue packages ``make a bad situation
worse.''
	   At last year's annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in
Hong Kong, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
international financier George Soros disagreed over the need for
some kind of regulation for currency trading.
	   Mahathir said rapid flow of investor funds in and out of
emerging market countries was destabilizing and had a devastating
effect on the nations when international investors fled with their
capital.
	   Mahathir now is his country's finance minister following the
dismissal last month of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his
arrest on corruption charges.
	   Mustapa, the deputy finance minister, who spoke at this year's
IMF/World Bank meetings, said when Malaysia proposed some rules for
currency trading at the Hong Kong meeting ``our suggestion was
dismissed as an attempt at `denial' or `blaming others' for our own
problems.''
	   He said the ``belief that globalization and the unfettered
workings of the market, especially the financial market, can only
bring benefits'' is a flawed one.
	   More rather than less government intervention may be needed, he
said, to ensure effective financial regulation and supervising of
companies' operations.
	   ``We risk a global meltdown if we continue with ad hoc
incremental measures,'' Mustapa said. ``A complete overhaul of the
international monetary system is required and required soon.''
	   He also said the near collapse in the United States of the
``mother of all hedge funds, the Long Term Capital Markets, is a
strong indication that no country is spared from the contagion
effect of the current crisis.''
	   Mustapa said the activities of the fund would have been
overlooked ``but for the fact it could have destroyed the financial
system of the very rich.'' He said Malaysia will not drop its
foreign exchange controls until there is a significant
restructuring of the world's financial system. Malaysia imposed
these controls Sept. 1 to protect its currency.
	   Mustapa described the controls as ``selective, administrative
measures'' that don't impact foreign trade or investment and said
Malaysia was not shutting itself off from the world.

Leyland brings title hopes to Rockies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Armed with a record contract for a manager, Jim
Leyland said he is confident of leading the Colorado Rockies into
baseball's postseason next year.
	   But he also wants to keep expectations reasonable.
	   After being praised by team management during his introduction
to the media on Wednesday, Leyland said, ``Before you get too
excited, I want you to know that I lost 108 games last year and I
went to the wrong airport to pick up my new bosses the other day.
So don't get carried away with what they've been saying.''
	   Leyland, 53, who signed a three-year, dlrs 6 million deal with
the Rockies on Monday, insisted he brings ``no special tonic with
me. I can be ornery at times. I can be cold at times. I can be
rough at times. But don't take that too seriously. I'm dedicated to
getting this organization into postseason play.''
	   Leyland plans on staying in Colorado longer than the two
roller-coaster years he spent in Florida, where he led the Marlins
to the World Series title in 1997 and then, after the team was
stripped of its talent in preparation for its sale, presided over a
young team that won only 54 games.
	   With the Rockies, who led the majors in attendance for the sixth
straight season, he has been promised that management will pursue
free agents such as catcher Mike Piazza and pitcher Kevin Brown.
	   The offense already boasts 1997 National League MVP Larry
Walker, power-hitting Vinny Castilla, Dante Bichette and Todd
Helton and fast-improving Neifi Perez.
	   The Rockies had a payroll of about dlrs 50 million last season,
but owner Jerry McMorris said Wednesday he anticipated ``about a 20
percent increase. We're going to have significantly more money to
spend.''
	   It is this newfound stability in payroll, ownership, attendance
and player loyalty that persuaded Leyland, a former NL manager of
the year, to replace Don Baylor, the only manager the Rockies had
known in their first six years of existence.
	   Leyland is expected to bring along four coaches from Florida and
Pittsburgh: hitting coach Milt May, third base coach Rich Donnelly,
first base coach Tommy Sandt and bullpen coach Bruce Kimm. He also
will hire his own pitching coach.
	   Leyland is 996-1,039 in 13 major league seasons, winning three
division championships (1990-1992 in Pittsburgh), one NL pennant
and one World Series.

Government to ban airing of foreign media programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian government officials ordered
independent broadcasters Wednesday to stop airing foreign programs
and said an official ban will follow.
	   Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic and Deputy Premier Milovan
Bojic met editors of Serbian non-government radio and television
stations to convey the order. The meeting came after a written
warning sent to the media earlier this week.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior'' accordingly, said Bojic,
referring to possible NATO air strikes against Serbia. ``This is
not an appeal. This is an order,'' he said according to the Beta
news ageny.
	   ``We must defend the sovereignty of our country,'' Vucic
declared.
	   According to the two government officials, transmitting of
Serbian-language programs by BBC, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle
and Radio Free Europe, while Yugoslavia is threatened with NATO air
strikes, spreads ``panic and defeatism.''
	   They said the move was a temporary measure which would last
while the country faces the danger of a military intervention.
Vucic announced the government will issue an official decree.
	   Analysts in Belgrade believe that the autocratic government,
loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, would use the
concern over NATO threats to silence his pro-western opponents at
home.
	   Officials in Serb-led Yugoslavia accuse foreign media and local
independent media of fabricating reports about Kosovo in order to
provoke NATO action. In a statement Wednesday, Milosevic also
mentioned a ``media campaign against our country.''
	   An association of independent media has warned the next move
could be closure of many radio and TV stations in Serbia. It was
not clear whether the media would obey the government order.

Athletics re-sign Howe as manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ The Oakland Athletics extended the
contract of manager Art Howe through next season, with a club
option for 2000, and also announced Wednesday they have agreed to
terms with left-hander Mark Mulder, the No. 2 overall pick in this
year's draft.
	   Howe has a 217-269 record in three years with Oakland, which has
been in a rebuilding mode throughout his tenure.
	   Although the A's have finished last in the American League West
in consecutive seasons for the first time since moving to Oakland
in 1968, their 74-88 record this year was a nine-game improvement
from 1997.
	   Howe spent 1989 to 1993 as manager in Houston, compiling a
392-418 record. The Astros also were rebuilding during Howe's
tenure there.
	   Several players, including Jason Giambi, Matt Stairs and Kenny
Rogers, went to general manager Billy Beane late in the season to
lobby for Howe's return. Stairs and teammate Tom Candiotti attended
Wednesday's news conference.
	   The A's, who began the season losing 10 of their first 12 games,
finished with a losing record for the sixth straight year.
	   Oakland started four rookies _ All-Star Ben Grieve in right
field, Ryan Christenson in center field, Miguel Tejada at shortstop
and A.J. Hinch at catcher _ and tried to build a team with one of
the smallest payrolls in baseball.
	   Another young player the A's hope will soon be in the majors is
Mulder, who broke Michigan State's season strikeout record with 113
while walkiing just 19 last season as a junior.
	   Mulder reportedly got a record dlrs 3.2 million signing bonus,
exceeding the dlrs 3.15 million received by top pick Pat Burrell
from the Philadelphia Phillies and No. 3 pick Corey Patterson's
dlrs 2.89 million from the Chicago Cubs.

U.S. peacekeepers, citizens in Bosnia at risk from threats on NATO

<TEXT>
	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ American peacekeepers in
Bosnia take ``very seriously'' threats of retaliation in the event
NATO launches airstrikes against neighboring Yugoslavia, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Gen. Kevin P. Byrnes, who assumed command of the American-run
northern sector of Bosnia on Wednesday, said his soldiers are well
prepared to defend themselves and react in case of hostile actions.
	   Protecting the hundreds or thousands of American civilians in
Bosnia could be more difficult.
	   The contingent of 8,500 U.S. troops stands out as a likely
target if Serb hardliners carry through on threats to fight back
following any bombing attack by the American-led alliance, which is
trying to halt Serbia's crackdown on secessionist Kosovo province.
	   Hardliners in both Yugoslavia and Bosnia, who share the goal of
a Greater Serbia, have pledged to respond to air raids with their
own, unspecified attacks.
	   Porous borders and the lack of a professional local police force
mean retaliatory action against Americans could have a bigger
impact in Bosnia than in Yugoslavia.
	   ``We have heard, through reports, about these threats and we
take them very seriously,'' said Maj. Jim Jones, a spokesman for
the American peacekeeping contingent.
	   While intelligence-gathering is almost certain to have been
stepped up as a result, American officers and soldiers remained mum
on the subject Wednesday.
	   Jones said there were no plans to increase security _ which in
any event is ``our first priority at any time,'' he stressed.
	   Daily activities appeared to be as usual around this northern
Bosnian town. Humvees and trucks painted in camouflage colors
roared down Bosnian roads while foot patrols kept watch as usual
despite rainy weather.
	   Caution is already built into their routine.
	   Located up a narrow, winding road about 16 kilometers (10 miles)
southeast of Tuzla, the site of Eagle Base itself signals a
wariness of potential attacks. In addition, strict security rules
require Americans to move in patrols of no fewer than six when
outside the base.
	   NATO officials do not expect the soldiers to be targeted because
of their numbers and firepower. More at risk are so-called liaison
officers, who live in communities alongside Bosnians in order to
instill confidence and monitor any problems.
	   Even more vulnerable are the American civilians in Bosnia who
work mostly for aid agencies, reconstruction organizations or the
U.S. government.
	   Last weekend, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo issued a travel
advisory warning American citizens of possible Serb retaliation.
Due to the ``potential increased danger,'' the advisory urged all
Americans in Bosnia to consider leaving the Serb-held half of the
country, or at least to try to avoid traveling through it.
	   This has already caused some inconvenience for some U.S.
employees based in the other half of Bosnia _ the Muslim-Croat
Federation. By heeding the advisory, they often must travel for
several additional hours in order to skirt areas dominated by
Serbs.
	   In the Bosnian Serb republic itself, officials for the U.S.
Agency for International Development denied reports it had pulled
out American stafff but said some other American contractors may
have left.

Immigration drops due to Asia economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada is expected to receive about 20,000 fewer
immigrants this year than it had hoped to attract, mainly because
of the devastating effects of the Asian economic crisis.
	   About 15,000 visas issued to skilled workers in Asian countries
were ``wasted'' this year because recipients with nearly empty
pockets changed their minds about coming to Canada, Immigration
Minister Lucienne Robillard said Wednesday.
	   Immigration estimates were at 200,000 to 225,000. Robillard says
the number will more likely be between 180,000 and 200,000.
	   ``This is not a cause for alarm. Most of our immigrants in
recent years have come from (Asia). But the current fiscal
uncertainty and roller-coaster stock markets have caused many
people to think twice about plans to emigrate.''
	   Despite continuing turbulence, the target level for 1999 will
stay at up to 225,000.
	   ``We remain hopeful for the future,'' said Robillard.
	   This year's drop is mainly among so-called ``economic''
immigrants recruited for their skills.
	   Robillard was vague on the economic impact of losing the 15,000
skilled workers and there were no figures available on the types of
jobs they would have filled.
	   ``If we decrease the number of new immigrants received every
year in our country, then in the long term there will be a negative
impact on the economic side.''
	   It's the first time that so many people abandoned visas
guaranteeing their entry to Canada. Normally the number's no higher
than 3,000.
	   Critics say the system should be more flexible to allow unused
visas in one immigrant category to be transferred to another where
the queues are long.
	   Canada is on target in welcoming government-assisted refugees
this year _ about 7,300 _ and the number of immigrants sponsored by
immediate family members is on the rise.

Tyson files Supreme Court appeal on psychological record release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDAN RILEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARSON CITY, Nevada (AP) _ Mike Tyson petitioned the Nevada
Supreme Court on Wednesday in an effort to keep results of recent
psychological tests hidden from the public.
	   Tyson's emergency petition asks for a stay of a lower court's
refusal on Monday to reconsider an order allowing the records to be
made public upon their release to the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   The documents are from a team of psychiatrists that examined
Tyson for five days last month.
	   Commission members ordered the tests following a Sept. 19
hearing on Tyson's request to replace a license revoked for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight title fight.
	   Tyson lawyer Jim Jimmerson said it was clear the records should
be kept under wraps ``when considering the harm likely to be
suffered by (Tyson) ... as opposed to the feeding frenzy of the
media and the mouths of the hungry public.''
	   ``Clearly when balancing the public curiosity in these records
to (Tyson's) interest in maintaining their confidentiality, the
court could have reasonably found that these sensitive records
should be withheld from public inspection,'' he said.
	   Jimmerson noted Dr. Ronald Schouten, who directed the tests,
agreed that the information should only go to the Athletic
Commission for its internal use.
	   The lawyer also said that Tyson is in poor financial shape and
``needs to box again to support himself and his family.''
	   Tyson wants to fight in December, which would be 18 months since
the Holyfield fight. He desperately needs money to pay off a dlrs
13 million lien to the Internal Revenue Service.
	   But his opportunity to box could be hindered if he doesn't
comply with orders to turn the records over to the commission by
Monday. Jimmerson said the fighter could lose an Oct. 19 hearing
date before the commission to try to get his boxing license back.
	   Tyson also faces a battle with the commission over his alleged
attack on two men following an Aug. 31 traffic accident in a
Washington, D.C., suburb.
	   Tyson faces an Oct. 19 trial in Montgomery County, Md., despite
efforts by his attorneys to settle with the two men. One man claims
Tyson hit him in the face, while the other claims he was kicked in
the groin by the boxer.
	   Tyson's lawyers refused to allow him to answer questions about
the accident during a Sept. 19 hearing before the commission,
saying he could not talk about it because of the pending criminal
charges.
	   Since then, however, commissioners have said they want to know
what happened and will expect Tyson to answer questions about it.
And, even if a settlement is reached with the alleged victims,
prosecutors could still go forward with the charges.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a U.S. envoy left in silence
after three days of talks, a defiant President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced NATO threats to end his violent crackdown in Kosovo. His
government prepared people for possible NATO airstrikes, sweeping
out World War II-era bomb shelters. Following his last meeting with
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's office said ``attempts
were made to overcome the differences.'' The Yugoslav statement
also said threats of NATO airstrikes ``jeopardize the continuation
of the political process.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ARIEL, West Bank (AP) _ Hours after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright asked Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral actions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday he would continue to build in Jewish settlements.
Netanyahu spoke in Ariel several hours after talks with Albright
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat over a long-delayed Israeli
pullback from part of the West Bank. ``We are building and will
continue to build,'' Netanyahu said to cheering crowds of settlers
in Ariel, where he conferred city status on the large settlement
slated for expansion. (ISRAEL-SETTLEMENTS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Empty pockets and anger over the failure of Boris
Yeltsin's government to end years of economic malaise drove
hundreds of thousands of Russians to nationwide protests Wednesday,
but disillusionment and pragmatism kept many more away. Miners,
monarchists, students and business people took to the streets from
Moscow to Vladivostok in the first major public protest since an
economic crisis hit in August, but the peaceful demonstrations fell
far short of organizers' predictions they would be the biggest
anti-Yeltsin protest ever. Many Russians eschew politics for
reasons ranging from apathy after decades of Soviet
authoritarianism to a traditional Russian fatalism that people have
to make the best of things. Others shunned the protests because of
fear of violence or their association with the Communists, who have
the support of about 20 percent of the population. (RUSSIA-PROTEST)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Wednesday that
members of the House of Representatives should cast ``a vote of
principle and conscience'' on whether to approve a broad,
Republican-written impeachment inquiry against him. He denied he
was trying to pressure lawmakers. ``It's up to others to decide
what happens to me and ultimately it's going to be up to the
American people to make a clear statement there,'' the president
told reporters in the Oval Office. ``More important than anything
else to me is they do the people's work and then let the people
decide where we go from here.'' In return, Sen. Robert Byrd, the
senior Democrat in the Senate, offered ``friendly advice'' to the
White House: ``Don't tamper with this jury.'' Senators would be the
jury if impeachment resolutions were approved by the House and a
Senate trial was convened. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   ROME (AP) _ A breakaway faction of Italy's Communist party on
Wednesday indicated it would take up Premier Romano Prodi's appeal
for support, boosting the chances that the center-left government
could survive a confidence vote. The leadership of the Communist
Refoundation party, prodded by its No. 1, party secretary Fausto
Bertinotti, had decided over the weekend to withdraw support for
Prodi, saying the proposed 1999 budget did not do enough to
stimulate job creation. Prodi, who has relied on the Communists'
votes in the lower Chamber of Deputies for a majority throughout
his 2 1/2 year term, was forced to call the confidence vote,
expected Friday, to determine whether his coalition is still
viable. (ITALY-POLITICS)

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials pulled off a sharp
turnaround for the third time in four sessions Wednesday, but the
Nasdaq market fell to a new low for the year as big-name technology
stocks extended this week's plunge. The Dow Jones industrial
average gave back an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113
points before reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower
at 7,741.69. Broader stock indicators suffered heavier losses, with
the technology-heavy Nasdaq market taking the biggest hit for a
third straight day. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Wednesday the U.S. economy still is in ``reasonable shape'' but
warned that the stock-market drop and turmoil overseas would
clearly dampen growth. Financial markets took his carefully
balanced comments as a signal the central bank planned further
reductions in short-term interest rates. Greenspan, noted for his
gloomy and pessimistic pronouncements, poked fun at newspaper
headlines that he said give the impression the economy is on the
verge of collapse. He told the National Association for Business
Economics: ``We are still seeing fairly significant continued
momentum. (US-GREENSPAN-ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ To end complaints by some countries
they pay too much for their membership, the EU head office proposed
reforms Wednesday in how the European Union is financed by its 15
member states. The European Commission's biggest-ever budget review
seeks to put EU financing on a fairer footing to satisfy Germany,
Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden who say they pay far more into
the EU than they get back in benefits. The commission's report
acknowledged shortcomings in current budget rules. Among the
changes proposed is to let the EU pay 75 percent of subsidies for
EU farmers and let governments pay the rest from their own budgets.
(EU-NEW FINANCING)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued
Visa and MasterCard, America's two largest credit card networks, on
grounds they limited credit card competition. Together, Visa and
MasterCard account for 75 percent all credit card purchases in the
United States, the government said. In a lawsuit filed in New York,
the department's antitrust division challenged the joint control of
the networks by the same group of large banks. The lawsuit also
challenges rules imposed by both Visa and MasterCard barring banks
that issue their cards from doing business with other, smaller
competing credit card networks, like American Express and Discover.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Electronic commerce is projected to mushroom into
a trillion-dollar global phenomenon by 2005, yet vital questions
about security and reliability trouble many businesses and
consumers. In one of the most ambitious attempts yet to ease those
doubts, delegates from 29 of the world's wealthiest countries
opened a three-day conference on electronic commerce Wednesday.
Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the meeting is an unprecedented get-together of
government officials and private-sector executives seeking to
figure out who should regulate global electronic commerce _ and
how. (CANADA-OECD-ELECTRONIC COMMERCE)
	   HIGH POINT, North Carolina (AP) _ Thomas Built Buses, the
second-largest maker of school buses in North America, will be sold
to the company that produces Mercedes-Benz automobiles and
Freightliner trucks. Daimler-Benz AG, parent company of the heavy
truck and bus-chassis manufacturer Freightliner Corp., said it will
buy Thomas Built Buses in a deal set to close this month. The cost
of the transaction was not disclosed. (US-THOMAS BUILT SALE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly said Wednesday it
was close to obtaining a loan from a consortium of Italian banks to
build a pipeline from southern Russia to Turkey. The loan for
building the pipeline, which would stretch across the Black Sea,
would be underwritten by Italy's export credit-insurance agency
SACE, said Yuri Komarov, head of Gazprom's export arm, Gazexport.
Gazprom officials refused to say how big the loan would be, or
which Italian banks are involved. SACE officials said the agency
has received no request for credit to build the pipeline although
there have been technical discussions on the issue. The
1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline will stretch from the southern
Russian town of Zhubga to the Turkish port of Samsun.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Alistair Cooke, Burt Reynolds, Muhammad Ali,
a kosher convict and Barbara Streisand; Some of the items may have
moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ When it comes to the English language, who has the
perfect pitch?
	   Alistair Cooke, according to listeners polled by BBC Radio's
``Word of Mouth'' program. They named him Best Living Speaker of
the English Language.
	   Cooke is the longtime host of British radio's ``Letter from
America,'' a weekly window on life in the United States. He is the
former host of ``Masterpiece Theater'' on public television.
	   ``I love broadcasting and try to write a form of English which
can be, as the Bible says, `understanded of the people,' meaning
truck drivers, professors, bishops, nurses, people everywhere,''
Cooke said.
	   Cooke, 89, lives in New York.
	   ``My wife always says that I don't speak British English,'' he
said. ``I don't speak American English _ I speak like a child sent
at an early age to school in Switzerland.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Burt Reynolds' plan to get out
of bankruptcy was approved by a judge Wednesday and will allow him
to keep his home and all of his personal property.
	   The reorganization plan should allow the actor to emerge from
bankruptcy protection within a month.
	   ``I'm pleased that this matter is behind me and I'm now looking
forward to focusing on my work and enjoying time with my family and
friends,'' Reynolds said in a statement.
	   He declared more than dlrs 10 million in debts when he filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1996. His financial problems began in the
late 1980s when he lost dlrs 15 million invested in a restaurant
chain.
	   Reynolds agreed to make payments to his creditors over three
years.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ Muhammad Ali returned home Wednesday
to promote plans for a museum to chronicle his boxing achievements
and highlight racial justice and peace, the causes he championed
outside the ring.
	   Organizers want to raise dlrs 80 million to build and operate
the museum in Louisville. They hope to open the museum on Jan. 17,
2001, Ali's 59th birthday.
	   Ali's wife, Lonnie, said the goal is to inspire people,
especially children, to reach their potential.
	   ``The Muhammad Ali Center will provide a place where the values
and virtues that he represents can come together to continue the
inspiration that his life has already given to a multitude of
people to pursue their own potential and greatness,'' she said.
	   Ali has Parkinson's disease and made no formal remarks.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   FAIRFAX, Virginia (AP) _ A conviction for writing a bad check
got Neil H. Lederman 11 months in jail. He was out in three weeks
because Fairfax County jail officials couldn't afford his kosher
meals.
	   The 43-year-old Orthodox Jew was sent home last month and placed
on home detention. The special meals would have cost the jail an
extra dlrs 70 a day, Chief Deputy Sheriff James A. Vickery said
Tuesday.
	   Prosecutor James Bitner isn't happy, and wants police to
investigate whether Lederman's meal request was valid.
	   ``I always believed that when a jury sentences someone to jail
they go to jail,'' Bitner said. ``I didn't know they would later be
released because the jail couldn't meet that person's needs.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MALIBU, California (AP) _ Barbra Streisand moved out and the
neighborhood went downhill fast.
	   That's what about 30 Ramirez Canyon homeowners claim in a
lawsuit against the Streisand Center for Conservancy Studies.
	   Ms. Streisand donated the center to the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy in 1993. It has been the site of noisy commercial
events that intrude on the privacy and solitude of the rustic area,
according to the lawsuit filed last week.
	   ``Barbra Streisand was always a good neighbor when she owned the
property. It is unfortunate that her name is now used to attract
hordes of visitors,'' homeowners group president Ruth White said.
	   The lawsuit said the center is used for sightseeing tours,
weddings and parties. The homeowners want a judge to end the noisy
intrusion.
	   ``To date, we have no record of a single study or significant
work concerning nature or the environment,'' Ms. White said.
	   The conservancy had no comment.

Wind power, other renewable sources, attracting new customers

	   TEHACHAPI, California (AP) _ The three-bladed propellers play an
eerie wind waltz _ a steady whoosh, whoosh, whoosh _ as the
persistent breeze blows.
	   The sleek, angular towers, reaching up to 140 feet (43 meters),
stand like sentries guarding the grassy hillsides that lead to
California's high desert.
	   ``To me, they look like giant toy pinwheels flickering in the
afternoon sun,'' said Geraldine Veatch, who lives just west of
Tehachapi Pass, where more than 4,900 wind turbines spin out enough
energy annually to power 250,000 homes.
	   ``Some say they're an eyesore. But I'd rather have wind turbines
than nuclear power plants.''
	   California is the birthplace of wind power in the United States.
It's also the first state to let consumers choose the source of the
electricity they use. Now the rest of the country is watching to
see how wind farms and other pollution-free, or ``renewable,''
energy producers fare in a competitive marketplace.
	   Power sources considered renewable include wind, solar,
geothermal, biomass (electricity produced by burning garbage) and
small hydroelectric plants (which don't significantly impact
wildlife and water).
	   Prior to March 31, a handful of utilities held a monopoly on the
state's dlrs 20 billion power industry. The system made sense,
given the high cost of producing and transmitting electricity and
the need for reliable electricity in this energy-dependent age.
	   But California's deregulation legislation, passed in 1997,
opened the market in the same way the American airlines and
long-distance phone industries were restructured.
	   ``You used to have to give all your money to the monopoly
utility. Now you can choose an independent supplier,'' said Rich
Ferguson, spokesman with the Sacramento-based Center for Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.
	   Whether consumers will use their buying power to demand lower
prices or whether they'll be willing to actually pay more for
nonpolluting choices of electricity generation are unanswered
questions.
	   About 69,000 residential customers have switched their power
providers from utilities to independent suppliers since the program
started late last year, according to California Energy Commission
spokeswoman Claudia Chandler.
	   But the utility industry is not yet able to determine how many
of those customers chose renewable power sources, Ms. Chandler
said.
	   Ferguson said the majority were likely green switches.
	   ``It's the biggest factor in the competitive market,'' he said.
``Prices aren't a strong marketing factor at this point.''
	   John Shahabian, owner of The Coffee Works in Sacramento, said he
has switched his small business to renewable energy and is planning
to change over at home as well.
	   ``I'm doing it because I'm so opposed to nuclear power,'' he
said. ``It's such a disaster for the planet. We have to think not
just about the quantity but also the quality of the energy we use
and how it affects the air and the earth.''
	   Several high-profile companies also have gone green for all its
rewards, which include being a strong image marketing tool.
	   Patagonia, Inc., a Ventura-based outdoor clothing company,
announced recently that it has committed to using 100 percent wind
energy to power its 14 California facilities.
	   ``We decided, as a company, to participate in eliminating or
reducing the dirty power that's on the grid by replacing it with
clean power,'' said company spokeswoman Lu Setnicka.
	   But the company won't be going off the grid and running power
lines direct to the wind turbines. Instead, it has contracted to
buy its electricity from Enron Energy Services. Enron is building a
16-megawatt wind farm near Palm Springs to accommodate the
contract.
	   ``We think of the grid as a pool full of dirty water,'' Ms.
Setnicka said. ``As more and more power users add clean energy to
the pool by buying renewable energy, the water will slowly clear.
It's the replacement principle.''
	   Ms. Setnicka said Patagonia will pay a premium for the power but
declined to say how much.
	   ``We're thinking in broader terms about what cost means,'' she
said. ``What are the costs of using non-renewables to our health,
or the earth?''
	   Toyota Motor Sales also committed to using a mix of renewables _
including wind, solar and geothermal _ to power its Torrance and
Irvine headquarters. The division also is working on switching over
to renewable energy at its Long Beach docking facility and an auto
parts supply facility.
	   Jim Cooke, Toyota's national manager of real estate and energy
affairs, said choosing clean electricity will cost the company an
extra dlrs 1 million. The positive response justifies the higher
price, he said.
	   Among municipal customers, Santa Monica recently became the
first city in the state to commit to green power. Its city council
voted to ``pursue at the earliest possible date'' the purchase of
green power for city hall and other city-owned buildings.
	   Wisconsin, Colorado, and Texas are a few of the states where
monopoly utilities offer environmentally friendly energy sources.
In their programs, customers volunteer to pay a premium for their
electricity. The utility then invests that money in renewable
power.
	   In California, customers can simply call an independent power
source and choose from a variety of packages.

Utah is fertile ground for genetics researchers

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ What do you get when you pair a Mormon's
affinity for big families and genealogy with his enthusiasm for
advancing science?
	   A geneticist's dream come true: a welcome at Utah family
reunions.
	   Where else can a researcher collect 200 blood samples in one day
to learn whether premature labor or an infant's enlarged heart runs
in a family? asks Ken Ward, an obstetrician and geneticist at the
University of Utah.
	   Ward and colleagues have been invited to countless reunions
since he came to Salt Lake 12 years ago, drawn by its reputation as
a mecca for genetic research.
	   ``We set up a little shade tent and have some orange juice and a
phlebotomist,'' Ward says. ``In between softball and hot dogs,
people will run by to share family history, sign consent forms,
learn about the study and, frequently, roll up their shirt sleeves
and give a blood sample.''
	   Geneticists for 50 years have recognized the value of Utah's
extended families and their precise genealogical records. And in
the 20 years that genetics has been revolutionizing medical
science, Salt Lake City has become one of the centers of that
research.
	   The University of Utah isn't alone. The Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and the Huntsman Cancer Institute, searching for genetic
causes of disease from a base at the university, also attract top
researchers.
	   ``It's a matter of having built up over the years a critical
mass of very good research people.'' That in itself can act as a
magnet, says Richard Koehn, the university's vice president of
research and a geneticist himself.
	   Ward compares his research in genetics here to earlier work in
Washington, D.C., where patients often didn't know their medical
histories or where to find their siblings.
	   ``Here, you're likely to have met dozens of your cousins and to
have seen the premature baby who is still on an oxygen tank at the
family reunion,'' Ward says.
	   Most of Ward's gene research begins with patients who, when
queried, know of parents, siblings or cousins with similar
problems. Using this approach, Ward discovered two genes involved
in pregnancy toxemia.
	   ``Families here tend to be a little closer knit and more
involved, for better or worse, in each other's lives,'' Ward says.
``Because of this phenomenon, we are able to see patterns that may
not be as obvious to other investigators.''
	   DNA from three generations of several Utah families is part of a
repository in France where geneticists worldwide obtain samples to
create genetic maps. Utah contributions, says Ward, have been among
the most useful because of the size of the families.
	   Utah's ``founder population'' makes the state unique. Several
thousand Mormon pioneers, many of them polygamous, settled the
Intermountain West beginning in the 1840s. They had large families
that often stayed put.
	   Some 2 million residents of Utah, Idaho, Nevada, northern
Arizona, western Colorado and parts of Wyoming and Montana can
trace their roots to those Mormons.
	   ``If the original pioneer had a mutation responsible for cancer
that spread through the family, that can be traced fairly easy,''
says Bill Hockett, spokesman for Myriad Genetics Inc., a company
searching for genetic causes of disease with the hope of developing
treatments.
	   Only Iceland and some remote island populations can rival Utah
for its value to genetics research, with founder populations and
extensive genealogical data, he says.
	   Myriad, founded by former University of Utah researcher Mark
Skolnick, identified a gene involved in breast and ovarian cancers.
As the tests gained market acceptance, Myriad's revenue rose 339
percent last year.
	   Now the company has discovered a gene related to heart disease
and is closing in on others related to asthma and other cancers. It
is also looking into genetic causes of depression and dementia.
``You couldn't do the same thing in many places in the world,''
Hockett says.
	   Other companies also are leveraging off the university's
expertise in genetics. Biotechnology companies, many using genetics
to varying degrees, now employ 11,000 workers in Utah, up more than
25 percent in three years.
	   Researchers often tap genealogical data that The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints gave to the university. The church
gathers information so members can perform sacred temple ordinances
for the dead.
	   Access to that genealogical information is strictly limited,
Koehn says, and the church gives the university no names of living
persons to protect their privacy.
	   But for him, the real value of the genealogical data comes with
crossmatching against other databases such as the Utah Cancer
Registry and state birth and death records.
	   Even more valuable than the records, though, is the culture of
cooperation among Mormons.
	   Koehn, who came from New York six years ago, noticed a different
attitude right away. ``It's not so much `What's in it for me?' It's
`It sounds like a good idea. We'd all be better off if we did
it.'''
	   The last time Ward kept track, about three years ago, only a
dozen of 15,000 people refused to participate in a study.
	   To explain cooperation that he calls ``legendary,'' Ward recalls
a woman in rural Utah, now in her 60s, who had lost every other one
of her babies to heart defects.
	   ``Every time the obstetrician would come for one of my
deliveries,'' she reported, ``he'd bring a box to bury the baby
just in case.'''
	   Now, Wards says, she watches her surviving children bury their
babies.
	   ``When you see that going on in your family,'' he says, ``the
cooperation is understandable.''

No more cavities, chips or gaps _ just perfect pearly whites

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Some people may be OK with it, but a
gap-toothed smile wasn't for Lisa Marciano.
	   To look at her smile now, no one would ever guess that the
straight, snug line of gleaming teeth was ever anything less.
	   Hollywood smiles previously seen only on-screen are now becoming
mainstream. It's a trend driven by new technology and materials,
and the awakening of dentists and patients to the possibility of
pearly perfection.
	   A mouthful of ugly metal and a lecture on flossing is no longer
the inevitable reward for uncomfortable hours in the dentist's
chair.
	   ``When people leave with tears in their eyes now, it's because
they're so happy,'' says Dr. Richard Price, a dentist from Newton,
Massachusetts, and spokesman for the American Dental Association.
``This is the golden age of dentistry in terms of what we can do.''
	   But the patients are not the only ones enjoying aesthetic
dentistry. Dentists are also having fun.
	   ``Dentists are going through a renaissance of attitude,'' says
Dr. George Tysowsky, a clinical assistant professor at the State
University of New York at Buffalo and vice president of technology
for Ivoclar, manufacturer of dental products.
	   Aesthetic dentistry merges dentistry's traditional
form-and-function with cosmetics. The result: tooth-colored
fillings, resins bonded to teeth to repair chips or cover
discolored teeth, and natural-looking veneers that close gaps and
even out misshapen teeth.
	   With the help of ``smile designer'' dentists, patients can now
choose a smile from a catalog and try it on via computer
simulation.
	   So in demand are the procedures that SUNY-Buffalo just opened a
state-of-the-art center devoted to training dental students in
aesthetics from the first year and beyond.
	   While most dental schools offer courses in aesthetics, SUNY is
the first to offer them at all levels of dental education,
according to Dr. Frederick McIntyre, a co-director of the center.
	   The university considers the center a model for other dental
schools, now challenged to fit the most current techniques into
already full four-year programs.
	   ``It's much more difficult to train dental students now because
they have the same amount of time to do it in and far more material
to give them,'' says the ADA's Price.
	   While technology makes the improvements possible, patients are
driving the trend. ``People have a lot of expendable income, and
they're spending it on things that make them feel good,'' McIntyre
says. ``Think of the money spent on weight loss. It's the same
thing with teeth... . They want to look nice. They want to have a
nice smile.''
	   And people are keeping their teeth longer, giving them more time
to yellow and wear. Today, the average 60-year-old has 22 of his 32
adult teeth, compared with an average of nine in 1970, according to
the American Academy for Cosmetic Dentistry.
	   Ms. Marciano has 10 porcelain veneers, ultra-thin laminates
bonded to her top teeth to fill in gaps.
	   ``My teeth weren't really bad before,'' says the 23-year-old
substitute teacher who has never had a cavity. ``I hated the space
in the middle because it was my two front teeth.''
	   The veneer procedure required several visits to her dentist,
including two long days: the first to have her existing teeth filed
down, and the second to have temporary veneers replaced with
permanent ones.
	   Her bottom teeth were bleached to match the whiter veneers.
	   The work was uncomfortable, she admits, ``but not killing pain
or torture.''
	   The bill? About dlrs 8,000. ``It was definitely worth it,'' she
says.
	   Insurance companies won't cover strictly cosmetic procedures
like veneers. And many won't pay the full cost of the more
expensive and time-consuming tooth-colored fillings.
	   ``Insurance is lagging behind the technology,'' says Price.
``Patients are demanding white fillings, but many insurance
companies are paying only up to the limits of silver fillings.''
The difference is usually dlrs 20 to dlrs 30.
	   Ms. Marciano's dentist, Robert Gianadda of Buffalo, has patients
as young as 10 and as old as 77 seeking cosmetic procedures.
	   A typical patient, he says, is ``anyone who's ever looked at
their teeth critically and said, `I don't like the shape, size,
color.' Fill in the blank.''
	   A side effect is that patients usually take better care of their
teeth. ``It's like a new car,'' Gianadda says. ``You always wash a
new car.''
	   The demand does not surprise Robert Ganley, president of Ivoclar
North America, Inc., noting that 10,000 Americans turn 50 every
day. ``People are coming into an age group where they've got
money,'' he says, ``and they're used to fixing things.''
	   Even without insurance, costs may be within reach. For dlrs 200
to dlrs 500, bleaching can be done in office with laser or at-home
with a molded tray worn for several nights. At dlrs 700 per tooth,
ultra-thin porcelain facades can be bonded to the teeth to create
straighter, more evenly spaced teeth. For dlrs 150 or more per
tooth, bonding sculpts enamel-like material onto the teeth to close
gaps or repair chips.
	   Ganley's company in nearby Amherst developed the ceramic-based
IPS Empress material now widely used for metal-free crowns and
veneers. Ivoclar trains dentists at a mobile lab and in-house
center.
	   ``Technology is driving a whole new re-education,'' says
Tysowsky, of SUNY-Buffalo. ``We're re-creating smiles.''

Daly feels Old Course is ideal for another title

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ It's one addiction John Daly
doesn't want to lose.
	   Winning at St. Andrews.
	   Ideally contoured to take Daly's booming drives, the Old Course
at St. Andrews is laid out to offer the drying out American the
chance of a second Dunhill Cup triumph to go with the British Open
title he won here in 1995.
	   ``I'm excited to be here again,'' said Daly, who is battling to
shake off the after-effects of the alcohol and gambling addictions
that have blighted his career.
	   ``There is always something special about St. Andrews, not just
because I won, but the way the golf course is. I love it. I can hit
my driver pretty well and the course makes it fun for me.
	   ``It's a golf course that I don't want to get off.''
	   Daly, who triumphed in the Dunhill Cup two years before his Open
success, teams up with Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara on the United
States lineup in this 16-nation championship which has prize money
of 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.67 million).
	   ``I'm honored to be here on the team with these guys,'' Daly
said. ``Tiger is No. 1 in the world, Mark is No. 4 and I'm in the
hundreds I guess.''
	   The trio faced up to England in their opening Group 1 match
Friday with Daly going against Lee Westwood.
	   O'Meara, winner of this year's Masters and British Open titles
and a member of the American Dunhill Cup winning team two years
ago, is the U.S. captain and he explained that it was Daly's past
performances at the home of golf that persuaded the team to put him
up against England's leading player.
	   ``His record has shown he can play really well here,'' O'Meara
said. ``I know Lee is playing some extremely good golf and I felt
it would be a nice matchup to play John and Lee up front.''
	   Woods faced David Carter and O'Meara played against Peter Baker
while, in the other Group 1 match, Sweden, which has Per-Ulrik
Johansson on the lineup, faced Japan.
	   Host Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie, faced debutant China
and Spain, with Jose Maria Olazabal on the lineup, met Ireland.
	   Defending titlist South Africa, powered by Ernie Els, met France
in Group 3 and Zimbabwe, led by Nick Price, faced Germany.
	   Australia, seeded two behind the Americans and with former PGA
champion Steve Elkington on the lineup, faced Argentina in Group 4
while New Zealand, runner up in 1996 and semifinalist last year,
meets South Korea.
	   The 16 teams play three round-robin matches and the winners of
each group advance to the semifinal which is played on Sunday along
with the final.
	   Each member of the winning team collects 100,000 pounds (dlrs
167,000).

Gloom in the air at financial leaders' gathering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Tables overflow with oysters at lavish
receptions. Drinks flow copiously. Piano music soothes.
	   But at this year's gatherings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the mood has been as dark as a banker's suit.
	   The world financial crisis means poverty for millions in Asia
and Russia. People are thrown out of jobs, children drop out of
school, firms go bankrupt for lack of credit, and stock markets
tumble deeper each day.
	   With few fresh remedies coming from the United States or anyone
else, it's hard to find an optimist among the financial officials
and central bankers from hundreds of countries meeting this week to
seek a credible solution.
	   Instead, even at the elegant receptions where deals are usually
done, such as one hosted by Citibank inside a grand, marbled
museum, officials' brows are furrowed and their sighs heavy with
frustration.
	   ``Pessimism is dominating. You cannot find one sincere smile,''
said Alexander Korshunov, assistant to the chairman of Russia's
central bank. ``It's very easy to ask the questions, but it's
difficult to find the answers.''
	   Jian Tan, a delegate from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said:
``No one talks about an end. No one is brave enough to tell the
others how long it will last.''
	   In all, it is the ``most curious meeting, because we don't know
what the IMF will do,'' Pakistani investor Iftikar Shirazi said.
``People are looking for answers and solutions.''
	   That is certainly why Osman Akyuz, general manager of AlBaraka
Turkish finance house, and his assistant, Adnan Buyukdeniz, came to
Washington. They wanted to meet with their American counterparts
for suggestions on how to prevent the crisis from hurting.
	   Are they going back with answers?
	   ``From the people we have spoken to so far? No, we haven't heard
anything substantial,'' Buyukdeniz said.
	   Some have other missions. Nicaragua's Economic Minister, Noel
Sacasa, is trying to persuade potential investors not to be
infected by the panic that's beginning to sweep other Latin
American countries. Nicaragua, Sacasa wants them to understand, has
implemented serious economic reforms and is firmly on the path to
economic stability.
	   ``It's very important for financial markets to differentiate
between markets,'' said Sacasa.
	   Guyana's minister of finance, Bharrat Jagdero, on the other
hand, is worried that the world is so taken with the economic
crisis that small economies' problems will be forgotten.
	   ``There should be new facilities to help those countries, but
they should be financed with new resources,'' he said. ``Otherwise,
it will affect us.''
	   Mostly, there is frustration. Even George Soros, the billionaire
global trader and financier, said in a talk this week that he finds
too weak a response so far from the rich industrialized nations.
	   Talking about one aspect of the global economic system, Soros
said world financial officials ``should have been shut into a room
and hammer this thing out and come out with a decision rather than
decide to explore (options) _ because I think the situation is much
more urgent than that.''

Top pick in NHL draft signs with Lightning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ First, rookie Vincent Lecavalier earned a
roster spot. Then he signed a contract with the Tampa Bay
Lightning.
	   The first pick in this summer's National Hockey League draft
agreed to a three-year deal Wednesday, a day after learning he had
played his way onto the team with a solid training camp and
exhibition season.
	   Lecavalier, who in the past two seasons had 86 goals and 218
points in 122 games for Rimouski Oceanic of the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League, led the Lightning with four goals and nine points in
seven preseason games.
	   Terms of the agreement were not announced. However, Lecavalier's
agent reportedly had been in town since last weekend to negotiate
bonus clauses in a three-year deal worth dlrs 975,000 per season in
base pay _ the maximum allowed under the NHL's collective
bargaining agreement.
	   ``We are extremely pleased to have Vincent signed and ready to
help this team immediately,'' Lightning general manager Phil
Esposito said. ``Throughout the preseason he has made it clear he

Bunt turns Game 2 to Indians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Basic baseball turned into a comedy of errors
that led to Cleveland's winning run in a 4-1 victory over the New
York Yankees Wednesday in Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series.
	   With the score 1-1, Jim Thome opened the Cleveland 12th with a
single, becoming the Indians' first baserunner since the eighth
inning. Manager Mike Hargrove sent in rookie Enrique Wilson to run
for Thome and flashed the bunt sign to Travis Fryman, hoping to get
the lead runner to second base.
	   Fryman dropped a perfect bunt down the first base line and
accompanied the ball, which was fielded by Tino Martinez. Chuck
Knoblauch covered first but Martinez's throw hit Fryman in the back
and bounced past Knoblauch.
	   Knoblauch pointed at Fryman, claiming the Indians runner had
interfered by running in fair territory. Meanwhile, the ball lay
untouched and Wilson kept right on running.
	   By the time he rounded third, the rookie was staggering, almost
falling as he headed for home. Finally, Knoblauch recovered the
ball but his throw to catcher Jorge Posada was too late to catch
the runner.
	   Replays indicated Knoblauch was right, that Fryman was never in
the designated runner's lane next to the foul line, although he was
square with the bag as he crossed it and was hit by the throw.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre appealed to home plate umpire Ted
Hendry and then to first base ump John Shulock.
	   Meanwhile, Hargrove came out to the top of the Indians dugout,
ready to argue any reversal of the call. There was none. Wilson's
run counted and then Kenny Lofton's bases-loaded single delivered
two more to wrap up Cleveland's victory that tied the best-of-7
series 1-1.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes and background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The umpires botched the call, Chuck Knoblauch
blew his cool and the Cleveland Indians escaped Yankee Stadium with
a split.
	   After 11 innings of excruciatingly intense baseball, Game 2 of
the American League championship series turned on a bizarre bunt
play in the 12th inning Wednesday.
	   Umpires failed to call Travis Fryman out for interfering with
the throw as he ran inside the line on his bunt attempt, and
Enrique Wilson broke a 1-all tie by scoring all the way from first
base as Knoblauch stood at the bag pointing and arguing, instead of
picking up the ball.
	   Kenny Lofton followed with a two-run single, and the Indians
beat New York 4-1, evening the American League championship series
at one game apiece.
	   It was a play that will surely be debated, much like J.C.
Martin's controversial bunt in Game 4 of the 1969 World Series.
	   Forget about domination, and put revenge on hold _ plays like
this can turn a series around.
	   Jim Thome singled off Jeff Nelson leading off the 12th,
Cleveland's first runner since Omar Vizquel tripled with one out in
the eighth. Wilson ran for Thome, and Fryman sent a bunt up the
first-base line to Tino Martinez.
	   Martinez threw to Knoblauch, the second baseman who was covering
the first-base bag, and the ball hit Fryman, clearly running in
fair territory, in the back.
	   ``I started out inside the line and when I knew I could get by
Tino, I tried to straighten out a little bit,'' Fryman said.
	   Baseball rules require that a runner be on the foul side of the
line for the final 45 feet (13.5 meters) to first base, but it is
up to the umpire's judgment whether a runner interferes with the
play.
	   While Wilson rounded second, Knoblauch was pointing at the base,
trying to get first-base umpire John Shulock to reverse the call.
While Wilson rounded third, Knoblauch still was pointing.
	   Finally, he picked it up, but it was too late. Wilson, who
nearly tripped himself up as he headed home, sprawled into the
plate with the go-ahead run.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre argued to no avail.
	   ``It was so blatant. I don't know what to say. It was a terrible
call,'' Torre said. ``There was no line ever touched.''
	   In blowing out Jaret Wright in the first inning of Game 1
Tuesday and cruising to a 7-2 victory, the Yankees looked
invincible, just like they did during the regular season. But maybe
avenging last year's loss to Cleveland in the first round won't be
so easy for the Yankees, who lost for the first time in five
postseason games this fall.
	   Right from Kenny Lofton's game-opening flyout to the warning
track in center, the Indians seemed different. David Cone nearly
matched Charles Nagy but the top of the New York batting order,
nearly silent in the first-round sweep of Texas, once again
sputtered.
	   David Justice put the Indians ahead with a fourth-inning homer
off Cone _ the first time the Yankees trailed this postseason _ but
Scott Brosius' RBI double tied the score in the seventh and chased
Nagy, who had been working on a four-hit shutout.
	   Cleveland is used to coming from behind in the postseason. This
is the eighth straight time the Indians lost a series opener.
	   After an off day, the series resumes Friday night at Jacobs
Field in Cleveland, with Andy Pettitte (16-11) pitching for New
York against Bartolo Colon (14-9).

Tonga, Fiji building massive canoe for millennium celebrations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUKU'ALOFA, Tonga (AP) _ Tonga and Fiji are building a huge
double-hulled war canoe of a type not seen in Pacific waters for
more than a century to help mark the turn of the millennium, a
government spokesman said Thursday.
	   The canoe, known as kalia in Tonga and drua (twin) in Fiji, will
be more than 100 feet (30 meters) long and able to carry 200
people, said Afu Taumoepeau, manager of Tonga's National Cultural
Center.
	   The new canoe will be faithful to traditional design and
construction, recreating a type regarded by marine historians as
the fastest and most sophisticated sailing craft ever developed by
Pacific Island voyagers, Tauoepeau said.
	   The U.S. dlrs 200,000 project is backed by the United Nations
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Taiwan
Embassy in Tonga, he said.
	   With the permission of Fijian President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara,
huge trees will be felled on the Lau island of Kabara to provide
the hulls and other building materials.
	   Lau, where Kamisese Mara is paramount chief, was where people
from the neighboring and relatively treeless Tonga went to have
canoes built in the 18th and 19th centuries.
	   Then, construction of the massive craft took up to seven years.
	   They were customarily launched by sliding them down to sea over
the prone bodies of enemies captured in battle.
	   No canoe of the size of the new craft has been built since the
1860s, though the last were still in use in the 1890s.
	   European navigators, including British explorers James Cook and
William Bligh, referred to the drua of Fiji with awe, estimating
their speed at more than 15 knots.
	   Fijian chiefs, constantly at war with each other or engaged in
cannibal raids, maintained fleets of them.
	   Early European explorers referred to the canoes engaging in
bloody sea battles between crews each of several hundred men.
	   Bligh described how he was chased in a longboat through the Fiji
Islands by several drua. Cast into the longboat after the crew of
his ship, the Bounty, mutinied in Tonga, Bligh escaped the drua
only because of his boat's ability to sail closer to the wind.
	   The Fiji Museum in Suva displays massive drua steering paddles,
which could only be operated by several men at once and who were
often crippled by the effort needed to steer the massive craft.
	   Unlike the old canoes, the new Tongan craft will take only one
year to build and will have toilets and beds for the crew.
	   It's planned launch date is late in 1999, Tauoepeau said.

Latest Nobel Literature Prize winner to be named Thursday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Award announcement scheduled for 1100 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Placing a bet on who will win the Nobel
Literature Prize on Thursday is a risky wager _ but betting it
won't be someone as colorful as last year sounds like a sure thing.
	   The Swedish Academy surprised, delighted and annoyed the
literary world when it picked the scathing and hilarious Italian
playwright Dario Fo for the prestigious prize.
	   He tweaked the august Nobel traditions gleefully, turning the
usually staid prize lecture night into an evening of stand-up
comedy. Then, just when Swedes were fearing he might misbehave at
the elegant prize banquet, he shocked them again _ by being
perfectly proper.
	   Speculation on who will win this year's prize, worth 7.6 million
kronor (dlrs 950,000 as Sweden's currency dips into a decline),
turns up many names _ some of them with a gift for comedy, but none
with Fo's rambunctiousness.
	   Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon are often mentioned as American
writers of Nobel-worthy caliber and both could be strong
possibilities this year, each having recently written novels
regarded as their masterworks. In their different styles, both have
used humor to underscore, and undermine, serious topics.
	   Both also have a distaste for attention _ Pynchon hasn't made a
public appearance in decades _ and that could make either an
awkward laureate.
	   It's not clear whether the Swedish Academy thinks about these
things when it chooses a winner. In fact, much of how the Academy
reaches a decision isn't clear.
	   Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor who
established the prizes in his will, said the literature prize
should recognize an author whose work moves in an ``ideal
direction.'' How the Academy interprets that imprecise instruction
is kept secret, as are the rest of the deliberations on the prize.
	   V.S. Naipaul is a name that has shown up on speculators' list of
likelies for years, as are Portugal's Jose Saramago, Jaan Kross of
Estonia, Latvia's Vizma Belsevica and Ismail Kadare of Albania.
	   Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer is also seen by many as a strong
likely pick, but the Academy has chosen Europeans the past three
years and may want to shift the glory to another part of the world.
	   If that's the case, Latin America provides contenders in Carlos
Fuentes of Mexico and Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru.
	   In Asia, from which only three winners have been chosen, Chinese
writers are rich possibilities, notably poet Bei Dao but also
novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin.

Dollar plunges against yen, Tokyo stocks tumble in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against the
yen early Thursday after plunging overnight amid hopes that Japan's
economic and banking problems may be nearing an end. Tokyo stock
prices fell as investors took profits.
	   The dollar was quoted at 121.82 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market in early trading, down 6.36 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo, but above its late New York level of 120.25 yen.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
fell 278.26 points, or 2.01 percent, to 13,547.35 in the first 30
minutes of trading. The Nikkei average surged 6.17 percent, or
803.97 points _ its second-largest points gain this year _ on
Wednesday.
	   The dollar fell a stunning 8 percent against the yen overnight
for the biggest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter
century. The last time the dollar posted such a sharp single day
drop was 1974, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The yen rally came amid growing optimism that Japan's government
will soon enact a bill designed to strengthen the country's ailing
banks.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been wrangling with
opposition forces for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday
	   The government was scheduled to begin deliberations on the law
Thursday and media reports said the bill would pass Parliament by
the end of the current session on Oct. 16.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices fell on profit-taking
following the market's second-largest point gain for the year
Wednesday.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar also hurt some
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more
expensive in dollar terms.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 16.84 points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,030.14 yen.
On Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo stocks followed another volatile session
overnight on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average
gave back an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points
before reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at
7,741.69.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.800 percent from Wednesday's close of 0.770 percent,
driving its price down to 108.98 yen from 109.28 yen.

Aussies rejoice under hot showers after 13-day gas cutoff ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Millions of Australians deprived of
hot water by a 13-day natural gas shortage in Victoria state
celebrated Thursday by turning on their gas again and enjoying hot
showers.
	   An explosion Sept. 25 and fires that took two days to quench
damaged the Esso Corp.'s refinery at Longford, which supplies 98
percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has not yet determined the cause of the disaster, which
killed two workers and injured eight.
	   Gas flow to all businesses and industry was restored Wednesday,
and gas distributor VENCorp began the staged resupply of 1.4
million households Thursday in what it called the world's biggest
reconnection of gas.
	   The estimated cost of the crisis has been 100 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) a day, with 150,000 workers stood
down temporarily. Workers in many industries shut down by the
crisis went back to work Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Talk radio programs received a surge of calls from people
Thursday with problems or from people saying how happy they were.
	   Householders with even street numbers were able to turn on from
6 a.m. and those with odd numbers could reconnect from 3 p.m.
	   One woman told radio station 3AW about lighting her hot water
heater: ``I went out and had to lie on my belly to turn it on and
it wouldn't turn on so I tried three times following the
instructions and then it went whoosh.''
	   Luckily she had followed the safety precautions given in
millions of brochures delivered to mail boxes Wednesday instructing
people to wear glasses or sun glasses.
	   ``I wear glasses so I had them on, but I scorched the top of my
hair and my dressing gown,'' she said.
	   Another woman said: ``I've just rung to say we've got gas and my
85-year-old grandmother can now have a nice hot shower, instead of
me holding the watering can, thanks for all your instructions.''
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Germany's chancellor-elect promises no major tax increases

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Having agreed on programs to fight
unemployment, Germany's Social Democrats and Greens discuss how to
pay for them on Thursday, when taxes take center stage in coalition
talks.
	   The two parties said bringing down Germany's double-digit
jobless rate was their top goal after Wednesday's session, but put
off debate over financing.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder insisted, however, that he
plans no major tax increases despite a huge budget gap he says he
is inheriting from the outgoing government.
	   ``We're not talking about tax hikes in this economic
situation,'' he said following Wednesday's talks. ``We're saying
that we especially want tax relief for workers _ and will do it.''
	   The environmentalist Greens are pushing for higher energy taxes,
arguing they would not only encourage conservation, but also spur
the economy through ``ecological innovation.''
	   Greens co-chairman Juergin Trittin said incremental rises in the
price of fossil fuels also would finance reductions in non-wage
labor costs, which the new government wants to help create jobs.
	   Schroeder, though, has ruled out any big jump in gasoline taxes,
which he says would hurt the auto industry. His party favors
closing tax loopholes and other measures aimed more at the rich.
	   Greens leader Joschka Fischer predicted a ``difficult'' session
Thursday.
	   Although Schroeder needs the 47 Green lawmakers to form a
majority in the 669-seat parliament, he indicated he would not bend
over backwards to accommodate their energy tax demands.
	   ``Each side knows the other's central points,'' he said. ``But
the differing strengths of the two parties will also influence the
extent of what they can expect to accomplish.''
	   Both sides said the new government would be limited in what it
could do by a budget gap inherited from outgoing Chancellor Helmut
Kohl that Schroeder pegged at ``clearly more than 20 billion marks
(dlrs 12 billion).''
	   But Kohl's government denied there was any shortfall in the 1999
budget presented by Finance Minister Theo Waigel last month.
	   ``This is an invention of the future `red-green' coalition to
conceal their policies of planned tax hikes and to divert attention
from frivolous campaign promises,'' said Adolf Roth, Kohl's budget
spokesman in parliament.
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end.
	   Schroeder and Fischer, considered the front-runner to become
foreign minister, leave late Thursday for a two-day visit to
Washington, where they will lunch with President Bill Clinton and
meet with the head of the World Bank.

Citibank to set up regional foreign exchange base in Sydney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ One of America's largest banks plans to
set up its regional foreign exchange headquarters in Sydney,
creating 100 new jobs and investing 15 million Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 9 million) in the local economy, New South Wales state
Premier Bob Carr announced Thursday.
	   Citibank's Asia-Pacific center will handle 1.5 million bank
transactions a year and provide processing and support services in
at least 13 countries in the region, Carr said in a statement.
	   He said the center will be one of only two regional foreign
exchange processing headquarters for the U.S. bank in the world.
The other is in London.

Polish hold vote to complete shift from communist-era system, but

<TEXT>
	   BRZEZINY, Poland (AP) _ Poland holds local government elections
Sunday to complete the shift from centralized communist era
structures to a Western-style democratic system, but few people
appear to be celebrating.
	   The voting for provincial, district and various city and
neighborhood councils will be the first nationwide local elections
under an administrative reform program that transfers some power
from the national government to regional and city bodies.
	   Around the country, general unease with the changes from
post-communist reforms has translated into unhappiness linked to
the ninth vote _ in referendums or elections _ since communist rule
ended in 1989.
	   Some people, such as the dozens who blocked a main road Monday
in Brzeziny in central Poland, oppose the way new district
boundaries and capitals were designated.
	   A district capital for much of the communist era, the town of
13,700 was excluded from the 308 new capitals under a format that
takes effect Jan. 1.
	   ``If we are not a district center, we will lose many jobs, there
will be no development, no prospects for our children,'' said
Elzbieta Szuflinska, 42, who marched in the blockade that forced
police to detour traffic to Warsaw, 110 kilometers (65 miles) to
the northeast.
	   Others stung by economic hardships such as high unemployment in
the reform era say voting will make little difference.
	   ``There is no job to be had in the region and no council can
change that,'' complained Leszek Turkiewicz, 54, one of 3,000
people just laid off from the machinery works in Poniatowa, 140
kilometers (85 miles) east of Warsaw.
	   A confusing ballot, with voters choosing candidates for up to
five governing councils _ provincial, district, city, city center
and neighborhood _ also could cause a low turnout.
	   Government officials predict fewer than 50 percent of eligible
voters will take part, with results taking a week or more to
compile.
	   The election sets in place an administrative overhaul that will
help prepare Poland for possible European Union membership in five
years' time. The 64,000 officials chosen from 260,000 candidates
will implement spending authorized by the central government for
specific needs _ education, roads, housing, water supplies,
environment protection and various services.
	   While 15 billion zlotys (dlrs 4.1 billion) in the 1999 national
budget are designated for local needs, some parties complain most
of the money is for specific projects, cutting the decision-making
power of the local authorities. Government officials respond by
noting that up to 40 percent of the money for local governing
bodies lacks such specific designations.
	   In an irony of post-communist Poland, leftist parties with roots
in the communist era were expected to do well, mostly in a backlash
against the rightist Solidarity-led central government.
	   People complain the reform program first implemented by
Solidarity has failed to address urgent development needs in areas
neglected during more than 40 years of communist rule. But the
communist leadership supported heavy industry and areas governed by
the most obedient party activists, while ignoring other regions
that now require the most help.
	   The reforms also have increased insecurity among average Poles
by introducing unemployment and raising living costs. Under
communist rule, despite the lack of personal freedom, people were
guaranteed jobs and health care, education and other services were
paid by the state.
	   Zbigniew Pakula, one of the Brzeziny protesters, accused the
rightist national government of betraying its traditional
supporters in the town by failing to grant it district capital
status.
	   Pakula, 38, who was laid off from his steel industry job in
1994, said he would support leftist candidates from Brzeziny to try
to force a redrawing of district maps.
	   ``It may be a kind of revenge,'' he said.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese and South Korean leaders met Thursday for
a summit aimed at boosting economic cooperation and inaugurating a
``new partnership'' between the two countries.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, on his first visit to Tokyo as South
Korean leader, held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
on how the two countries should handle the Asian economic crisis.
	   Kim arrived on Wednesday for the four-day visit. He met with
Emperor Akihito after arriving and spoke at a gala banquet at the
Imperial Palace.
	   During the summit, Japan was expected to offer its most explicit
apology yet for Tokyo's harsh 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean
Peninsula _ a period still deeply resented in South Korea. The
issue has come up during the nine previous visits by South Korean
presidents since World War II.
	   In his speech at the banquet Wednesday night, Akihito reiterated
the apology he has made previously, acknowledging that ``Japan
brought great suffering on the people of the Korean Peninsula.''
	   Despite the Japanese apology, the two sides clearly stressed the
economic and cooperative aspects of the summit. In his speech
Wednesday night, Kim made no mention of history. Instead, he
pointed out that the two nations will be working together as
co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Kim and Obuchi will endorse guidelines for a ``new
partnership.'' In addition to a Japanese apology, the guidelines
are expected to include a promise by Kim to lift restrictions on
Japanese culture in South Korea, where Japanese movies are still
banned.
	   Obuchi is expected to offer Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to
help South Korea overcome its severe economic downturn.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Also on the agenda is last month's rocket launch by North Korea.
The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the North has
considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   On Thursday, Kim and Obuchi were expected to sign a number of
agreements, including one promising the new loans by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to help small businesses in South
Korea.
	   Seoul is struggling to restructure its economy under a dlrs 58
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Nay report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   It said the main cause of the noise is the disturbed flow
pattern of water along the hull and into the propellers, which are
also vibrating and cracking because of faulty construction.
	   The newspaper quoted the report as saying said the engines
suffer gearbox failures and overheating generators, the combat
systems are virtually useless due to faulty software, and the boats
have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   It said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would not accept
any more of the submarines -- which cost 800 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each -- until all the faults were
fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
contractor Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that
construction problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   Australian Submarine Corp. told the newspaper that it would not
comment and the U.S. Navy report was a matter for the Australian
navy.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

Indians beat Yankees 4-1 in 12 innings to knot series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The umpires botched the call, Chuck Knoblauch
blew his cool and the Cleveland Indians escaped Yankee Stadium with
a split.
	   After 11 innings of excruciatingly intense baseball, Game 2 of
the American League championship series turned on a bizarre bunt
play in the 12th inning Wednesday.
	   Umpires failed to call Travis Fryman out for interfering with
Tino Martinez's throw as he ran inside the line on his bunt
attempt, and Enrique Wilson broke a 1-all tie by scoring all the
way from first base as Knoblauch stood at the bag pointing and
arguing, instead of picking up the ball.
	   Kenny Lofton followed with a two-run single, and the Indians
beat New York 4-1, evening the AL championship series at one game
apiece.
	   ``It was so blatant. I don't know what to say. It was a terrible
call,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``There was no line ever
touched.''
	   Forget about domination, and put revenge on hold _ plays like
this can turn a series around.
	   Jim Thome singled off Jeff Nelson leading off the 12th,
Cleveland's first runner since Omar Vizquel tripled with one out in
the eighth. Wilson ran for Thome, and Fryman sent a bunt up the
first-base line to Martinez.
	   Martinez threw to Knoblauch, the second baseman who was covering
the first-base bag, and the ball hit Fryman, who was clearly
running in fair territory, in the back.
	   Baseball rules require that a runner be on the foul side of the
line for the final 45 feet (13.5 meters) to first base, but it is
up to the umpire's judgment whether a runner interferes with the
play.
	   ``The play occurred right at the base,'' crew chief Jim Evans
said. ``The fact that he was literally on the base or half a step
from the base, he has the right to be in that position.''
	   Evans said there are two keys.
	   ``Is it a throw that would have retired him, and how close is he
to the base?'' Evans said. ``He has the right to be in fair
territory that close to the base.''
	   While Wilson rounded second, Knoblauch was pointing at the base,
trying to get first-base umpire John Shulock or plate umpire Ted
Hendry to reverse the call.
	   While Wilson rounded third, Knoblauch still was pointing.
	   Finally, he picked it up, but it was too late. Wilson, who
nearly tripped himself up as he headed home, sprawled into the
plate with the go-ahead run.
	   ``I thought we'd have to get a wheel-barrow out there for a
while,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.
	   Torre argued to no avail.
	   ``I thought they made the right call,'' Hargrove said. ``If I
were on the other side, I might have a different opinion.''
	   Torre also was angry at Hendry's calls behind the plate.
	   ``The ball-strike stuff stunk tonight, but it stunk for both
sides,'' he said.
	   In blowing out Jaret Wright in the first inning of Game 1
Tuesday and cruising to a 7-2 victory, the Yankees looked
invincible, just like they did during the regular season. But maybe
avenging last year's loss to Cleveland in the first round won't be
so easy for the Yankees, who lost for the first time in five
postseason games this fall.
	   Right from Kenny Lofton's game-opening flyout to the warning
track in center, the Indians seemed different. David Cone nearly
matched Charles Nagy, but the top of the New York batting order,
nearly silent in the first-round sweep of Texas, once again
sputtered.
	   David Justice put the Indians ahead with a fourth-inning homer
off Cone _ the first time the Yankees trailed this postseason _ but
Scott Brosius' RBI double tied the score in the seventh and chased
Nagy, who had been working on a four-hit shutout.
	   Cleveland is used to coming from behind in the postseason. This
is the eighth straight time the Indians lost a series opener.
	   After an off day, the series resumes Friday night at Jacobs
Field in Cleveland, with Andy Pettitte (16-11) pitching for New
York against Bartolo Colon (14-9).
	   Dave Burba, the sixth of seven Cleveland pitchers, was the
winner, and Mike Jackson got the save. Nelson, the fourth of five
New York pitchers, was the loser.

Australians enjoy hot showers after 13-day gas cutoff ends

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Millions of Australians deprived of
hot water by a 13-day natural gas shortage in Victoria state
celebrated Thursday by turning on their gas again and enjoying hot
showers.
	   An explosion Sept. 25 and fires that took two days to quench
damaged the Esso Corp.'s refinery at Longford, which supplies 98
percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has not yet determined the cause of the disaster, which
killed two workers and injured eight.
	   Gas flow to all businesses and industry was restored Wednesday,
and gas distributor VENCorp began the staged resupply of 1.4
million households Thursday in what it called the world's biggest
reconnection of gas.
	   The estimated cost of the crisis has been 100 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) a day, with 150,000 workers stood
down temporarily. Workers in many industries shut down by the
crisis went back to work Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Talk radio programs received a surge of calls from people
Thursday with problems or from people saying how happy they were.
	   Householders with even street numbers were able to turn on their
gas from 6 a.m. while those with odd numbers could reconnect from 3
p.m.
	   One woman told radio station 3AW about lighting her hot water
heater: ``I went out and had to lie on my belly to turn it on and
it wouldn't turn on so I tried three times following the
instructions and then it went whoosh.''
	   Luckily she had followed the safety precautions given in
millions of brochures delivered to mail boxes Wednesday instructing
people to wear glasses or sun glasses.
	   ``I wear glasses so I had them on, but I scorched the top of my
hair and my dressing gown,'' she said.
	   Another woman said: ``I've just rung to say we've got gas and my
85-year-old grandmother can now have a nice hot shower, instead of
me holding the watering can, thanks for all your instructions.''
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Jamaica defeats US cricket team

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica defeated the United States by
eight wickets Wednesday in the Red Stripe Bowl cricket tournament
at Chedwin Park. The Jamaicans scored 108 for the loss of two
wickets to beat the Americans' 107 in just 20 overs.
	   The win gave Jamaica a first-place tie in Zone Two on three
points with defending champions the Leeward Islands. The Leewards
beat the United States by 242 runs Tuesday.
	   Aggressive strokeplay from openers Robert Samuels and Raymond
Ferguson powered Jamaica to victory. Samuels struck 47 while
Ferguson made 28 in an opening stand worth 62 runs.
	   Christopher Gayle, who struck the winning runs, was unbeaten on
22.
	   The United States again found the going tough after Jamaican
captain James Adams won the toss and sent them in to bat. They
never recovered from losing their first three wickets for 14 runs
and were dismissed for a meager total in 43.1 overs.
	   West Indies fastbowler Franklyn Rose, who started the rout, was
the pick of the Jamaican bowlers, capturing up three wickets for 17
runs in 6.1 overs.
	   Of the American batsmen, only middle-order batsmen David
Hoilette and captain Richard Staple looked at home against the
Jamaican attack.
	   Hoilette, a former Jamaica player, topscored with 31 and was the
last man out. Staple, also a one-time Jamaica player, played
steadily for a patient 24 before he was run out in the 28th over.
Of the other batsmen, only Desmond Richards with 14 reached double
figures.
	   The tournament continues Thursday with the Leewards playing
Barbados.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   It said the main cause of the noise is the disturbed flow
pattern of water along the hull and into the propellers, which are
also vibrating and cracking because of faulty construction.
	   The newspaper quoted the report as saying said the engines
suffer gearbox failures and overheating generators; the combat
systems are virtually useless due to faulty software; and the boats
have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   It said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would not accept
any more of the submarines _ which cost 800 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each _ until all the faults were
fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
contractor Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that
construction problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   Australian Submarine Corp. told the newspaper that it would not
comment and the U.S. Navy report was a matter for the Australian
navy.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

Rain, lightning delays start of NL championship series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Steady rain, lightning and the threat of severe
weather delayed the start of Game 1 of the National League
championship series Wednesday night between the San Diego Padres
and Atlanta Braves.
	   The tarp was on the field at the scheduled start time of 8:15
p.m. EDT and thunder rumbled about 20 minutes later. Rain, which
began about an hour before the scheduled start, let up at 9:30 p.m.
and the tarp was removed. The game was tentatively scheduled to
begin at 10:15 p.m. (0215 GMT Thursday).
	   There has never been a rainout in the two-year history of Turner
Field. A few thousand fans sat under umbrellas in their seats
during the delay, watching the AL playoff game between the Yankees
and Cleveland on the center-field scoreboard.
	   The last postponement in the postseason came at Game 1 of the
1996 World Series between the Braves and Yankees in New York. There
was, however, a three-hour rain delay last week in the middle of a
playoff game between the Yankees and Rangers in Texas.
	   A rainout would force the Padres and Braves to play Game 1 on
Thursday night. They would then play Game 2 on Friday, which was
supposed to be a travel day, in Atlanta.
	   Andy Ashby was supposed to pitch the opener for the Padres
against John Smoltz. But a one-day delay would give San Diego the
option of switching to its ace, Kevin Brown, to start the opener
instead of Game 2.

U.S. trying to build united front against Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Trying to build a united front against
Yugoslavia, the United States is offering assurances that American
ground troops will not be involved if NATO attacks the Balkan
country for its harsh crackdown in Kosovo province.
	   The attack would be carried out solely with air power, U.S.
officials said as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright flew from
the Middle East to Brussels, where she was to meet with NATO
officials on Thursday.
	   Earlier in the week, Albright raised the possibility that U.S.
troops would be sent to Kosovo as part of an international force to
help keep any peace settlement resulting from NATO attack or
negotiations.
	   ``We think there has to be some kind of international
presence,'' Albright said.
	   Currently, 7,500 U.S. troops are serving in a peacekeeping force
of 33,000 in Bosnia. Sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as well could be
controversial.
	   Clarifying the U.S. position, the officials said Wednesday night
that if Milosevic agrees to negotiations with ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and they reach a settlement, the administration would
consult Congress and the allies on whether U.S. troops should be
part of an international peacekeeping force.
	   If Milosevic refuses to negotiate, to withdraw his troops from
the province and to permit humanitarian assistance to reach
refugees ``we will use only air power,'' a senior official said.
	   ``But if he complies, there will be a verification force without
U.S. troops,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic claims to be complying with most U.N. demands by
withdrawing his security forces from Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic
Albanian region within the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Albright was meeting in Brussels on Thursday with Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. diplomat who was sent to Belgrade to seek
Milosevic's compliance, and with NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana.
	   Albright said Monday that she doubts Milosevic can be trusted.
She also claimed the European allies share U.S. revulsion over the
violence Yugoslav crackdown in Kosovo, where hundreds have died and
thousands more displaced by fighting in recent months.
	   However, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Greece all have
expressed reservations.
	   Russia, meanwhile, has openly opposed military action against
Yugoslavia, threatening to block attempts at the United Nations to
authorize an armed strike.
	   ``A military strike will not help normalize the situation but
will have the opposite effect,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Nvanov said Tuesday.
	   Albright shot back at a session with reporters before leaving
Jerusalem Wednesday. ``I assure you if we decide to use force,
Russia will not veto it,'' she said.
	   Even while working on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over the
West Bank, Albright made more than a dozen telephone calls to
Ivanov and other foreign ministers, trying to enlist their support.
	   Later Thursday, Albright planned to fly to London for a meeting
with foreign ministers whose governments are in a six-nation
``Contact Group'' that oversees the Balkans. They are Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   But as Albright flew to Brussels, her aides said they did not
know how many would be in London to meet with her.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

NATO envoys at 1200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As Washington seeks support for a
tough stand against Slobodan Milosevic, the defiant Yugoslav
president has issued his own warning: Threats of NATO airstrikes
only dim chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic gave the warning to special U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke during a third meeting Wednesday. Holbrooke, the U.S.
ambassador-designate, left afterward for Brussels, Belgium, to
brief Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO officials.
	   Albright plans to travel on to London later Thursday for a
hastily called meeting of the six countries most deeply involved in
the negotiations: the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy. Holbrooke and Albright were scheduled to meet
NATO officials at 1200 GMT Thursday.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences in estimating the situation in Kosovo, which have
emerged in some parts of the international community despite the
facts on the ground.''
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
	   Milosevic's repeated references to the ``threats'' undermining
chances for peace appeared aimed at playing on international
divisions over the wisdom of airstrikes. Those divisions have
appeared not only between the Russians and NATO but within the
Western alliance itself.
	   ``We are continuing to push for military action against the
Serbs,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said. ``NATO is not
there yet.''
	   All the major countries involved in mediating the seven-month
crisis _ except the United States and Britain _ have indicated
varying degrees of misgivings about using force if Milosevic
ignores the U.N. demands to halt the crackdown against ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   They are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States also faces strong opposition from Russia,
whose Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned Wednesday that
airstrikes could lead to even more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ``This is not a penalty or punishment of an isolated country but
almost a real war,'' Marshal Sergeyev said in Athens, Greece.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule.
Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds have been killed and more
than 270,000 people have been driven from their homes.
	   President Clinton has insisted that Milosevic end his crackdown,
pull out his special police force and resume negotiations. The
United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians
to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three years a
decision on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
	   ``I do not believe the United States can be in a position, I do
not believe NATO can be in a position, of letting tens of thousands
of people starve or freeze to death this winter,'' Clinton said.
	   In Belgrade the city government said it was making preparations
for possible strikes. Warning sirens blared in some Serbian towns.
Some opposition parties said mobilization of air defense reservists
was underway. It ordered government departments to increase
security and threatened punishment for those who spread ``fear,
panic and defeatism.''
	   On Wednesday, Serbian government officials ordered independent
media to stop broadcasting foreign media programs and said an
official ban will follow.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior'' accordingly, said deputy Premier
Milovan Bojic told Serbian non-government radio and television
editors. ``This is not an appeal. This is an order,'' he said,
according to the Beta news ageny.
	   Meanwhile, Milosevic tried to show that he was working to settle
the Kosovo crisis by dispatching Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic
to the province and inviting the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to the area.
	   Belgrade's Politika newspaper, a state-run daily, carried a
front-page headline Wednesday saying all police actions have ceased
in Kosovo.
	   But Milosevic has a long history of breaking promises and
international diplomatic observers have disputed Serb claims. Late
Wednesday, Serbian government officials ordered independent media
to stop broadcasting foreign media proygrams and said an official
ban will follow.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors, according to the independent Beta news agency. ``This
is not an appeal. This is an order.''
	   Ethnic Albanian villagers claim Serb forces lay low when foreign
observers visit communities, then return to harass them after the
foreigners leave.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian villagers claimed Serb forces fired
automatic weapons at their homes Wednesday in the Malisevo area
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The army has criticized the leader of a
human rights group who claims Guatemalan military officers were
responsible for the April 26 slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop.
	   An army statement issued Tuesday said human rights activist
Factor Mendez should present evidence to judicial authorities
rather than simply make claims in public.
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi Conendera, head of the archdiocese's human
rights office, was killed two days after he made public a report
blaming the military and death squads for most of the atrocities
committed in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   Church officials believed the killing was tied to Gerardi's
human rights work. But in July, authorities arrested a priest who
lived in Gerardi's residence at the time of the killing.
	   Mendez said his activist group has ``irrefutable documents''
pointing to military involvement.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The Legislature said Wednesday it
will revise a system of immunity that has long protected Honduran
military officers, politicians, judges and government officials
from prosecution.
	   Rafael Pineda Ponce, the president of Congress, said a special
commission of six legislators will formulate a proposal to give
limited immunity to a small number of officials.
	   ``Immunity has only created a system of impunity in Honduras,
and for this reason we must end this benefit, which many officials
do not merit,'' Pineda Ponce said.
	   For more than 40 years, the constitution has granted immunity to
former presidents, federal deputies, politicians and military
personnel, giving them protection from civil and criminal
prosecution.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A regional labor group in eastern Mexico is
searching for one of its officers who has been missing for two
weeks, a Mexico City newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Silverio Ricardo Alvarado, assessor for the Regional
Confederation of Farm Laborers in Veracruz, disappeared on Sept.
22, the daily Reforma said. He was last seen at a national meeting
of the labor organization.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Lawmakers in Baja California state on
Wednesday elected Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer, state chairman of the
opposition National Action Party, as acting governor of the
northern border state.
	   The state legislature voted 24-0 with one abstention to have
Gonzalez complete the last three years of Gov. Hector Teran Teran's
six-year term. Teran died of a heart attack Sunday in the state
capital, Mexicali.
	   The Pacific Coast state borders the state of California.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of state employees
went on strike Wednesday, trying to force President Andres Pastrana
to ease an austerity program that cuts government spending and
limits salary increases.
	   Union leaders claimed 90 percent of 650,000 state workers were
taking part in the indefinite strike, while Labor Minister Hernando
Yepes Arcila said participation was ``far less than 50 percent.''
	   The strikers included teachers, and judicial and hospital
workers. School was canceled for about 7 million students, courts
were closed and state-run hospitals were only treating emergencies.
Workers at the state oil company, Ecopetrol, reduced pipeline
pumping by 50 percent to 20,000 gallons (75,700 liters) a day, said
union president Hernando Hernandez.
	   Public employees unions said the walkout would continue until
the government agrees to an 18 percent salary increase for 1999.
The government has said it would limit wage increases to 14
percent.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Foreign Office Minister Baroness Symons of
Britain arrived in Cuba on Wednesday for a two-day visit she hoped
would improve trade and relations between the two nations.
	   ``I'm delighted to be here,'' Symons told reporters upon
arriving at Havana's International airport Wednesday. ``It's a very
special visit.''
	   Symons is the first representative of Britain's new Labor
government to visit Cuba.

	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ The temper of the Conservative Party
after more than a year out of power could be measured in two
crowds: a rather small one for a former prime minister, a larger
one and much media interest for a man touted as the next leader.
	   Sir Edward Heath, prime minister from 1970-74 and the man whose
proudest achievement was leading Britain into the European Union,
cut a defiant but somewhat forlorn figure Wednesday night at one of
the ``fringe'' events at the annual party conference.
	   But former Defense Secretary Michael Portillo drew a full house
to a dinner later in the evening, with Margaret Thatcher there to
show her support.
	   Portillo, 45, one of the stars of the ``Euroskeptical'' Tory
right wing which dominates this conference, might well have been
party leader by now, had he not been one of the scores of
Conservative lawmakers who lost their seats to Labor in May 1977.
	   Instead, William Hague, 37, won the leadership election within
the depleted corps of Conservatives in the Commons.
	   With Conservatives showing no sign of recovery in opinion polls,
some party members are already talking about disposing of Hague and
installing Portillo as leader _ assuming Portillo can win a
Parliamentary seat when a vacancy arises.
	   As a leading critic of the European Union, Portillo has grown
popular in the party, which is largely skeptical over European
monetary union. The telegenic former defense secretary is also
thought by some to be a stronger leader than the softspoken Hague.
	   Lest anyone accuse him of undermining Hague, Portillo closed the
event to the media _ but paused outside to congratulate Hague on
winning 84 percent of members' votes to back a policy of opposing
British entry into a European currency for at least a decade.
	   Heath, 82, who was promoting publication of his long-delayed
memoirs, scoffed at Hague's policy.
	   ``I don't know how you can possibly justify saying we won't do
anything, in any sphere, for 10 years. No businessman would say it,
no artist would say it. I can't think of anybody who would say
it,'' Heath said.
	   He had looked unhappy early in the day sharing the platform with
Thatcher, who ousted him as party leader in 1975. And he looked
even less happy hearing younger Tories denounce him and the
European Union.
	   Young Conservative delegate Francis Hoar had accused Heath of
not telling Britons that a single currency was an inevitable
outcome of joining the European Union. ``He knew that but he chose
to forget about that and then not to inform us of that,'' Hoar
said, as delegates applauded.
	   ``It was always explained that this was for political unity. It
was not only an economic question, it was a political question,''
Heath said at his book launch.
	   ``All these people are either ignorant or deliberately _ I am
afraid there are many deliberate cases _ misleading the public and
trying to damage this country as well as the European Union,''
Heath said.
	   Heath has been in the House of Commons since 1950, longer than
any other current member, and has rejected all suggestions of
moving to the House of Lords, like Lady Thatcher and other former
prime ministers.
	   His memoirs, ``The Course of My Life,'' are appearing 24 years
after his term as prime minister, while Lady Thatcher published the
first volume of her memoirs within three years of her ouster in
1990.
	   ``I really don't see why one is expected to write a book
directly (after) one stops being prime minister. In fact it's
rather stupid if you do,'' Heath said at the book launch. His
audience, accustomed to his waspish remarks about Thatcher, laughed
loudly.
	   ``I wasn't making any particular reference,'' Heath said, and
that got a bigger laugh.

New alarm introduced to warn whales away from shark nets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ A new acoustic alarm system will be
installed along the Gold Coast to drive humpback whales away from
shark nets, in which they can get tangled and drown, the program's
manager said Thursday.
	   The battery-operated alarm, to be placed on shark nets that
protect swimming and surfing beaches, uses sound at a frequency
that is supposed to drive whales away from the nets.
	   ``The problem we have is that there are more humpback whales now
than there were ever and the animals themselves are coming closer
and nearer to shark nets,'' said Baden Lane, Queensland state's
shark control program manager.
	   ``What we want to do is to try and keep the whales away from the
nets,'' he said.
	   The alarm, which cannot be heard by other marine animals, was
developed and manufactured by the Queensland Department of Primary
Industries and BASA Technical Services in Brisbane.
	   Lane said the alarms were an improvement on similar overseas
technology. He said the Australian design was more robust, smaller
and less expensive.
	   Primary Industries Minister Henry Palaszczuk said the
performance of the alarms would be assessed in the future.
	   ``This type of alarm has been used very successfully in
commercial fisheries overseas,'' he added.

Dollar plunges against yen, Tokyo stocks tumble on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded sharply lower against the
yen Thursday morning after plunging overnight amid hopes that
Japan's economic and banking problems may be resolved. Tokyo stock
prices tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 121.39 yen in late morning trading, down 6.79
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
fell 458.87 points, or 3.32 percent, to 13,366.24 at the end of the
morning session. On Wednesday, the average surged 6.17 percent, or
803.97 points _ its second-largest points gain this year.
	   Tokyo players bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or
oversold, dollar positions, bringing the dollar a bit higher than
its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on
Wednesday's dollar plunge. ``I don't talk about specific levels,''
Miyazawa said. ``The market is the market.''
	   In New York on Wednesday, the dollar fell a stunning 8 percent
against the yen overnight for the largest one-day drop in
percentage terms in a quarter century. The last time the dollar
posted such a sharp single day drop was 1974, according to Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The yen rally came amid growing optimism that Japan's government
will soon enact a bill designed to strengthen the country's ailing
banks.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been wrangling with
opposition forces for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday
	   The government was scheduled to begin deliberations on the law
Thursday and media reports said the bill would pass Parliament by
the end of the current session on Oct. 16.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, share prices moved lower on
profit-taking following the market's big jump Wednesday.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar also hurt some Japanese
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more
expensive in dollar terms in overseas markets.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 24.67 points, or 2.36 percent, to 1,022.31. On
Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back
an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points before
reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at 7,741.69 on
Wednesday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.800 percent from Wednesday's close of 0.770 percent,
driving its price down to 108.98 yen from 109.28 yen.

Report: at least highlanders buried alive in landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A newspaper reported
Thursday that at least 30 people are feared dead after being buried
by a landslide in a remote part of Enga Province in the mountainous
highlands.
	   The National newspaper said a church congregation was buried
alive near the isolated Maramuni Station in the north of Enga
province last Friday, and said the death toll could rise above 100.
	   Eight bodies had been recovered and a 9-year-old girl was the
sole survivor of the disaster, the newspaper reported.
	   A spokeswoman for the administrator's office told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio she had received reports that 32 had died
following heavy rains in the area.
	   The National Disaster and Emergency Services said it was still
awaiting confirmation of the disaster from state emergency
authorities.

Another strange postseason victory for the Indians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians are winning bizarre
postseason games again.
	   For some strange reason, when one of the Indians squares around
to bunt in the 12th inning, good things seem to happen to
Cleveland.
	   Enrique Wilson's mad dash and comical dive across the plate in
the 12th Wednesday allowed the Indians to even the American League
championship series 1-1 with a 4-1 victory over the New York
Yankees.
	   And for the first time since that fateful 11th inning of Game 7
in Florida last October, extra innings didn't bring extra heartache
to Cleveland. And for the second straight year, there may be
something magical about these Indians.
	   Magical or lucky.
	   ``In a game like this, sometimes you need some luck,'' David
Justice said.
	   In Game 3 of the ALCS last year, Cleveland beat Baltimore when
Omar Vizquel missed a squeeze bunt and the ball got past Orioles
catcher Lenny Webster, allowing Marquis Grissom to score the
winning run.
	   Before they took on the Yankees juggernaut this week, the
Indians knew that along with good pitching and hitting, they might
need some breaks to make it back to the World Series.
	   And as the adage goes, sometimes it's better to be lucky than
good.
	   ``They won 114 games this season by finding a way to win,''
reliever Mike Jackson said of the Yankees. ``And I think the tables
turned tonight.''
	   Wilson, pinch-running in the 12th after Jim Thome's leadoff
single, scored all the way from first on Travis Fryman's
controversial bunt single.
	   His arms flailing as he tried to stay upright, Wilson slid
across the plate on his belly to give the Indians an improbable
Game 2 victory that will surely go down with the some of October's
most bizarre baserunning plays.
	   The Indians led a charmed existence last October, and now
they're doing it again. They weren't supposed to beat the Yankees
and did. They were underdogs against the Orioles and somehow ended
their season early, too.
	   Cleveland opened this postseason by getting routed at home by
Boston, but despite manager Mike Hargrove and starting pitcher
Dwight Gooden being ejected in the first inning, they bounced back
to win Game 2 at Jacobs Field.
	   Even after the home split, few gave them a chance of advancing
when the team left for Boston. But Fenway Park didn't spook the
Indians and they took care of the Red Sox last weekend.
	   After New York's 7-2 victory in Game 1, there was talk of a
Yankees sweep. There's no such discussion any longer and now the
Indians are going home where strange October events have happened
before.

Rain, lightning delays start of NL championship series

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of game &QL;

 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Steady rain, lightning and the threat of severe
weather delayed for about two hours the start of Game 1 of the
National League championship series Wednesday night between the San
Diego Padres and Atlanta Braves.
	   The tarp was on the field at the scheduled start time of 8:15
p.m. EDT and thunder rumbled about 20 minutes later. Rain, which
began about an hour before the scheduled start, let up at 9:30 p.m.
and the tarp was removed. The game began at 10:16 p.m. (0216 GMT
Thursday).
	   There has never been a rainout in the two-year history of Turner
Field. A few thousand fans sat under umbrellas in their seats
during the delay, watching the AL playoff game between the Yankees
and Cleveland on the center-field scoreboard.
	   The last postponement in the postseason came at Game 1 of the
1996 World Series between the Braves and Yankees in New York. There
was, however, a three-hour rain delay last week in the middle of a
playoff game between the Yankees and Rangers in Texas.

<TEXT>
	   SANTOS, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Santos started off strong in this
first game of the Conmebol Cup home and away final, beating Rosario
Central 1-0 Wednesday night.
	   The game was decided early when Claudiomiro headed it past
Rosario Central goalie Bujiubasich for a goal in the 28th minute.
	   After that Santos was a hard team to stop, but Rosario Central
closed the defense and held them off.
	   Santos who are currently leading in the Brazilian national
championships wanted a win at home to give them an advantage when
they meet Rosario Central, this time in Argentina, on Oct. 21 in
the game that will decide the Conmebol Cup.
	   It is the first time Santos has reached the final of the
Conmebol Cup and a win or a even a time in the next game will give
them the team's first win in an international tournament since they
won the Recopa International in 1969 against Internazionale 1-0 in
Italy.
	   The Conmebol Cup is a South American version of the Uefa Cup,
played by teams that although they haven't won their national
championships, they made a good showing.
	   Lineups:
	   Santos: Zetti, Anderson, Argel, Claudiomiro, Athirson, Marcos
Basilio, Narciso, Eduardo Marques, Lucio, Alessandro and Viola.
	   Rosario Central: Bujiubasich, Dario Marra, Gerbaudo, Cuberas,
Jara, Cappelletti, Daniele, Hugo Gonzalez, Walter Gaitan, Scotto,
Carracedo.

Wright's wrong night could cost second start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to `Yankees' in 7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jaret Wright might not get thrown to the Yankees
again.
	   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove hopes his team can make it to a
Game 5. And if the Indians do, he'll then have to decide on a
starting pitcher.
	   Hargrove said before Game 2 on Wednesday that he was keeping his
options open. One of them could be not using Wright.
	   Wright didn't get out of the first inning in Game 1 as the
Yankees tagged him for five runs and five hits. It was Wright's
second straight disastrous postseason start. He gave up a pair of
three-run homers in his Game 1 start against the Red Sox in the
division series.
	   ``I think I have in consideration the fact that Jaret's last two
postseason starts have not been what I think he expects of himself
or we would like to have seen,'' he said.
	   ``But I think we also have to realize that he has got tremendous
stuff, and I think we will make the decision as we get closer to
that. But I am looking at other options.''
	   Wright had a storybook October last year. He beat the Yankees
twice in the opening round of the playoffs and became the second
youngest pitcher to start a deciding game of the World Series.
	   But his postseason in '98 has read more like a Stephen King
novel.
	   Hargrove said Wright's biggest problem this fall has been his
inability to get a breaking ball over for strikes. A power pitcher
who realizes on locating his fastball, if Wright can't get his
curve or slider over, he's in big trouble. And that's been just the
case.
	   ``Anytime he's struggled this year, it's been because he
couldn't get his breaking ball over,'' said Hargrove. ``I haven't
seen what his velocity was last night, (catcher) Sandy Alomar said
he was throwing the ball well.''
	   Wright went 12-10 during the regular season and struggled
through a period of ``dead arm'' trouble mostly because in his
first full season in the majors, Wright had never thrown as many
129 innings in a season. He pitched 192 2-3 innings this year.
	   Hargrove will start Bartolo Colon in Game 3 and anticipates
starting Dwight Gooden against his former Yankee teammates in Game
4. As long as Hargrove doesn't have to use Gooden or Dave Burba in
long relief before then, Hargrove could start Burba in Game 5 _
should the Indians get to one.
	   However, Burba was 0-3 vs. the Yankees this season with a 6.16
ERA, and gave up four home runs against them just two weeks ago in
a Sept. 22 start.
	   ``Stats can be a deciding factor if you're on the fence,''
Hargrove said.
	   And right now, that's where Wright is sitting.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes typo in `Navy' in lead. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   It said the main cause of the noise is the disturbed flow
pattern of water along the hull and into the propellers, which are
also vibrating and cracking because of faulty construction.
	   The newspaper quoted the report as saying said the engines
suffer gearbox failures and overheating generators, the combat
systems are virtually useless due to faulty software, and the boats
have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   It said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would not accept
any more of the submarines -- which cost 800 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each -- until all the faults were
fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
contractor Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that
construction problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   Australian Submarine Corp. told the newspaper that it would not
comment and the U.S. Navy report was a matter for the Australian
navy.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

Reports: Malaysian police release senior university official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police have released a senior
official of a Kuala Lumpur university who was arrested under a
harsh security law for being involved in dissident activities, news
reports said Thursday.
	   Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International Islamic
University, was released Wednesday after 16 days in jail for being
a threat to national security.
	   He was among numerous people detained in the crackdown that
followed the arrest of Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister,
Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 20. All but five of those arrested,
including Anwar, have been released.
	   ``I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during by
involvement with the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,'' Sidek was
quoted as saying by The Star daily.
	   Anwar was fired Sept. 2, accused of corruption and engaging in
illegal homosexual acts. Anwar, who has denied the charges, was
arrested after two weeks of nationwide rallies at which he called
for government reform and Mahathir's resignation.
	   Despite the protests, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and
there have been no defections from the party, which claims a
membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million.
	   He ruled out an early election to prove his popularity. A
general election is not scheduled until 2000.
	   Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. ``There is no exodus from
the party.''
	   Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor but fired him on grounds he was morally
unfit to lead. The two differed over economic policy, and Anwar has
said his former boss feared he was a threat.
	   This week Mahathir also declined to name a successor in place of
Anwar, who had been Malaysia's deputy prime minister since 1993.
	   The absence of a successor could lead to a power struggle in the
event Mahathir is forced to resign or dies, because there is no
clear line of succession.

Report: At least 30 highlanders buried alive in landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A newspaper reported
Thursday that at least 30 people were feared dead after being
buried by a landslide in a remote part of Enga Province in the
mountainous highlands.
	   The National newspaper said a church congregation was buried
alive near the isolated Maramuni Station in the northern part of
Enga province last Friday, and said the death toll could rise above
100.
	   Eight bodies had been recovered and a 9-year-old girl was the
sole survivor of the disaster, the newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman for the administrator's office told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio she had received reports that 32 had died
following heavy rains in the area.
	   The National Disaster and Emergency Services said it was still
awaiting confirmation of the disaster from state emergency
authorities.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to put the past behind them, Japanese and
South Korean leaders signed an agreement Thursday to boost economic
cooperation and inaugurate a ``new partnership'' between the two
countries.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, on his first visit to Tokyo as South
Korean leader, met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on how
the two countries should handle the Asian economic crisis.
	   In the agreement, Obuchi offered an explicit apology for Tokyo's
harsh 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula _ a period
still deeply resented in South Korea.
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the sincerity of the Japanese
statement, adding that the ``form and feeling'' of the apology was
different from in the past.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said at a news conference following
his meeting with Obuchi.
	   The Obuchi statement followed a speech Wednesday night in which
Emperor Akihito reiterated a previous apology, acknowledging that
``Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean
Peninsula.''
	   The pact signed Thursday included agreements on economic
cooperation, more student exchanges between the two countries and a
South Korean pledge to lift bans on Japanese culture, such as
movies. The two sides also agreed to work together in their
approach to North Korea.
	   Kim arrived on Wednesday for a four-day visit. He met with
Akihito after arriving and spoke at a gala banquet at the Imperial
Palace. Later Thursday, he was to address Parliament.
	   Despite the Japanese apology, the two sides clearly stressed the
economic and cooperative aspects of the summit. In a speech
Wednesday night, Kim made no mention of history. Instead, he
pointed out that the two nations will be working together as
co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Economy played a central role in the meeting. Obuchi offered Kim
a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Also on the agenda was last month's rocket launch by North
Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the North
has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   In Thursday's talks, the two sides acknowledged that a program
to build nuclear reactors in the isolated country was the best way
to insure North Korea does not develop its own nuclear weapons.
	   Japan withdrew funding from the program after the recent rocket
launch. The leaders on Thursday made no mention about if or when
Japan would restore the funding.

Chemical `mirror' of marijuana ingredient helps head trauma
</HEADLINE>
patients &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM KLASS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ A synthetic ``mirror image'' of the active agent
in marijuana won't get you high but may represent a great leap
forward in treatment for head trauma patients, according to recent
research.
	   The discovery also could fuel further debate over laws and
regulations that ban virtually any marijuana research in the United
States.
	   In a dlrs 2 million test at six trauma centers in Israel, an
injection of dexanabinol was associated with a 26 percent increase
in survival among patients who lost consciousness after a blunt
blow to the head, said Dr. Nachshon Knoller, a neurosurgeon at
Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv who directed the research.
	   Knoller's findings were announced Wednesday at the Congress of
Neurological Surgeons, an annual gathering of about 2,000 doctors,
scientists, nurses and other central nervous system experts. The
congress opened Saturday and concludes Thursday.
	   Of the 67 patients in the study, 30 got one injection of the
chemical knockoff based on cannabis within six hours after being
injured and a control group of 37 got placebos.
	   On a test called the Glasgow Outcome Scale, 40 percent of those
given the drug made a virtually complete recovery, or ``good
outcome,'' within three months, compared with 19 percent of those
who received the placebo. Six months out, 45 percent achieved a
good outcome to 37 percent for the control group.
	   No adverse effects were reported. The most pronounced side
effects included upper body and facial flushing, hiccups and
tightness of the chest.
	   ``This research indicates that this drug therapy has an
immediate and long-term benefit to severe head-injury patients,''
Knoller said. ``There currently is no approved drug therapy for
patients with these types of injuries.''
	   Animal tests indicate the drug also holds promise in combating
the debilitating effects of stroke, multiple sclerosis, nerve gas
and inflammatory bowel disorders such as colitis, he said.
	   Pharmos Corp., with offices in Iselin, New Jersey, and research
operations in Israel, is seeking a corporate partner for Phase III
clinical tests, a dlrs 20 million study involving 700 to 1,000
patients, said Anat Biegon, vice president for research and
development in Rehovot, Israel.
	   The drug ``has a number of very interesting features, although
it's a relatively small study (sample),'' said Dr. Brian T.
Andrews, a neurosurgeon at the University of California in San
Francisco who heads the congress' neurotrauma section and was not
involved in the project.
	   ``It has multiple properties at the cellular level that seem to
be beneficial,'' Andrews said.
	   Dexanabinol was found to combat three processes that contribute
to loss of brain cells following blunt-force trauma.
	   The drug blocks glutamates, amino acids that may multiply with
deadly effect following damage to cell membranes. It scavenges free
radicals, the destabilizing byproducts of oxygen metabolism that
also seem to multiply in damaged cells. It also inhibits the action
of inflammatory cytokine, which causes swelling.
	   About 30 to 40 drugs have been tested without success in efforts
to develop a medication that would achieve even one of those
effects, Andrews said.
	   Dexanabinol is one of a number of non-psychotropic synthetic
analogs of marijuana compounds invented by Raphael Mechoulam, who
in 1965 became the first scientist to isolate Delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.
	   Mechoulam's research, including subsequent studies that
identified the receptor cells within the brain to which THC
attaches to produce marijuana's mildly intoxicating effects, would
have been illegal in the United States.
	   ``In Israel there are no legal restraints,'' Knoller said.
	   The synthetic version can't produce a ``high'' because, as a
mirror image of the real thing, it won't fit the protein pattern of
the receptor cells, Biegon added.
	   ``It's like trying to fit your right hand into a left-handed
glove,'' she explained.

Chinese authorities execute two convicted of smuggling, bribery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in southern Guangdong province have
executed two men found guilty of smuggling millions of dollars
worth of cars, appliances and other items, state news media
reported Thursday.
	   The Supreme People's Court on Wednesday announced the outcomes
of several cases resulting from a nationwide crackdown on rampant
smuggling.
	   The smuggling has pushed prices for many goods higher and has
provoked armed battles between smugglers and law enforcement
officials, the official China Daily and other government-run papers
reported.
	   The reports cited court vice president Liu Jiachen as saying
that all government and law enforcement officials found to be
involved in smuggling would be ``severely punished.''
	   Residents of Taiwan, Macau and other countries would also be
prosecuted and could even face the death penalty, he warned.
	   Zou Weiquan, manager of Hong Kong Jing Feng Trading Co., and
Chen Baoquan, a vagrant from Guangdong, were sentenced to death for
colluding to smuggle more than 38 million yuan (dlrs 4.6 million)
worth of goods into China, the China Daily report said.
	   Zou also was convicted for bribing Guangdong customs officials,
who were punished separately, it said.
	   It said both men had already been executed, without providing
further details.
	   In a second case, the police superintendent in Yunfu, Guangdong,
Wen Guobin, was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined 120,000
yuan (dlrs 15,000) for taking bribes and conspiring to allow 46
million yuan (dlrs 5.5 million) of aluminum ingots to be smuggled
into the country, the report added.
	   Wen also was found guilty of embezzling public funds and a
Toyota car, it said.
	   In another case, Hong Kong businessman Zhou Shaoquan and a
Guangdong ship captain, Bu Lu, were sentenced to 15 years and 14
years in prison respectively for their involvement in smuggling 28
cars worth 6 million yuan (dlrs 720,000) into China, the report
said.
	   In the past, the involvement of many police and army units in
smuggling operations along China's vast and porous borders has
confounded efforts to stop trade in contraband items.
	   The current campaign appears to be the government's most
strenuous effort yet to curb smuggling. Officials say smugglers
flood China with cheap imports that put its struggling domestic
industries at a disadvantage.
