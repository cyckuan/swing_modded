<HEADLINE> Albright Leaves for Visit to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright left for Moscow on Sunday for a two-day visit,
hoping to improve bilateral relations which were damaged by a
series of disputes on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow had deep differences on Iraq, Kosovo and
many of the arms control negotiations inherited from the days of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"We consider it all the more important to maintain a regular
engagement to try to pursue areas of agreement... and deal with
disagreements as they emerge," added a senior U.S. official,
briefing reporters on Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official listed four areas of "tough issues" on the
agenda for the visit and suggested that Albright wanted to move
away from a narrow focus on the regional conflicts that dominated
her previous meetings with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The biggest area is arms control, including Russia's failure to
ratify the START II treaty on reducing nuclear arsenals and the
effect that U.S. plans for a National Missile Defense will have on
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The second is the "nonproliferation" dispute, specifically U.S.
allegations that Russian nuclear and missile technology is leaking
to developing countries like Iran.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in Iraq and Kosovo, where Moscow opposes the use
of force by the United States, will also come up in Albright's
talks with Ivanov and probably with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, an Iraq expert and former foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Another tough issue on the agenda of Albright's visit will be
how Russia can put its economic house in order.
</P>
<P>
The Russians might bring up limits on Russian exports of
hot-rolled steel to the United States, while Albright will discuss
Moscow's plans to follow up on legislation allowing
production-sharing agreements in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
After Russia, Albright is expected to fly to Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Britain and France, and return to Washington on January
29.

<HEADLINE> People's Resilience Helping Economic Recovery: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
recovering thanks to the people's resilience, the government's
determination and businessmen's confidence, Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the signs of the recovery were evident from the
increase in national reserves and a 30 percent rise in the 1998
final quarter trade surplus to 194.37 million ringgit (about 51.15
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said although the country was experiencing an economic
crisis, the people remained calm and there was no chaos like in
some other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The people's support for the recovery measures enables the
government to proceed with efforts to get the country to rise
again and continue progressing," he said at a function in Alor
Setar about 460 kilometers north from here, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the business sector had begun to show confidence
in the economy by increasing investments through higher bank
borrowings.

CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid called on Arab countries here on Sunday to
reach a unified stance to grapple with "challenges and dangers at
the regional and international levels."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a meeting of Arab foreign
ministers on the Iraqi impasse, which started earlier in the day,
Abdel-Meguid also urged Arab countries to handle the problem
"through dialogue, understanding and hard work."
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to consolidating Arab capabilities and
building sound and stable inter-Arab relations based on frankness
and reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled in December but later
postponed for disagreements in the Arab world, has been intended
to formulate a common stand on the Iraqi issue following the
U.S.-British airstrikes on December 16-19.

BERLIN -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday did
not rule out the possibility that German ground troops would take
part in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) military
intervention in the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said in an interview with the Focus magazine that
military pressure is needed on Yugoslavia to prevent an increase
in violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have to talk to our partners about how we can avoid a
situation similar to what happened in Bosnia," Schroeder
said,"The intervention there came only after tens of thousands
were killed."
</P>
<P>
"We can hardly believe the policies of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic any more," Schroeder added, "Everyone has to
know that a military intervention can no longer be ruled out."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he opposes isolated air strikes because it
"won't improve the lot of people of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He also argued that it is wrong that Germany could not send
troops to places where Hitler's Nazi troops once invaded during
World War II. (Germany-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> Arafat May Delay Independent State Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is considering to postpone his announcement of an
independent Palestinian state till the end of this year, Israel
Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Arafat held secret meetings with
representatives of the European Union and agreed to think about
the postponement.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not say when and where the meetings took place,
but added that Arafat told the EU representatives that he may
choose December to announce the statehood and requested the EU to
ask Israel to stop its settlement activities in the occupied
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Due to the upcoming Israeli general elections in May, the
United States and some other countries reportedly asked Arafat to
delay his statehood announcement. But Arafat and senior
Palestinian officials refused so far to comment if they have
accepted this proposal.
</P>
<P>
They have been insisting that an independent Palestinian state
will be declared on May 4 when the five-year interim period of the
Oslo Accords expires.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat told the Voice of Palestine on Sunday that the
Palestinian side is worried about the stalemate of the peace
process and asked the United States to find compulsory mechanisms
to force Israel to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said May 4 "is not a Palestinian day and was not invented by
the Palestinians," and "it is a day which have international
legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian leadership can not postpone this date for even
an hour in announcing an independent palestinian state," he said
in the interview.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Early Defining Caspian Legal Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's First Vice President
Hassan Habibi here Sunday called for an early determination of the
legal regime of Caspian Sea, based on the consensus of all
littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Habibi made the appeal at a meeting with visiting Turkmen
Deputy Primer in charge of Transportation Affairs Khudaykuly
Khalykov, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The longer it takes for the issue to be settled, the higher the
chance for foreigners to intervene in the region, he warned,
adding that Iran and Turkmenistan share common view on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The five Caspian littoral states - Iran, Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan, Russia and Azerbaijan - have different view on how to
exploit the natural resources in the world largest inland water
after the discovery of oil and gas reserves there.
</P>
<P>
Most of them demanded a division of the sea into national
sectors, but Iran has been persistent in its proposal of common
ownership governing the sea.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's talks, Habibi expressed satisfaction with the
expansion of Iran-Turkmenistan ties. He called for broadening of
bilateral cooperation in various fields, particularly in
transportation, which plays an important role in international
trade.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should take advantage of the opportunity to
find their places in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khalykov said that bilateral cooperation in rail and air
transportation between the two countries are expanding and
Turkmenistan attaches great importance to its relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran is the most economical and appropriate
route for good from Central Asian countries to reach international
markets.

<HEADLINE> Asian Investors Sell Their Hotels in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some of the Asian companies
running into difficulties in the current financial crisis have
been selling their hotels in the United states, The New York Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airline is one of the Asian companies that were joining
in the trip to the auction block in New York and other cities. The
company was selling the Essex House to an American company,
Strategic Hotel Capital, for about 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airline bought the hotel in Manhattan, New York City, 15
years ago and turned it into a flagship for its Nikko hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a series of retreat by other Japanese
companies. Last month, the Taisei Corporation of Japan sold the
Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California to Hilton
Hotels for 82.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The sales mark the end of what was actually the second wave of
Asian investment in American real estate," the New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1992, Japanese companies invested 77 billion
dollars in real estate in the United States. They were confident
of the long-term value of the office buildings, hotels, golf
courses and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
But these companies became ailing during the recession in the
early 1990's. They have sold about one-third of those properties
for a little more than half the original purchase prices,
according to the E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Japanese companies, other Asian investors
who had also poured billions of dollars into American real estate
are now selling out. Last year, a company controlled by Ong Beng
Seng, the Singapore billionaire, sold its 40 percent stake in the
Pennsylvania Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
Sinar Mas Group, the second-largest conglomerate in Indonesia,
sold a real estate portfolio that included the Pasadena Hilton in
California and the Melrose Hotel in Dallas to pay off mounting
debts.
</P>
<P>
Paliburg Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong company, is selling its
stake in Regal Hotels, a chain that has 13 properties in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, Brunei and
the regions of Hong Kong and Taiwan snapped about 6.3 billion
dollars worth of real estate, most of it hotels, in the United
States between 1993 and 1996. That was called the second wave of
Asian investment in American real estate after the Japanese
started a retreat from the United States in 1992.

JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An African National
Congress (ANC) delegation were ambushed in the center of Richmond,
KwaZulu-Natal, Sunday afternoon, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The scene of the shooting is 50 meters away from the place
where Sifiso Nkabinde, United Democratic Movement general
secretary and strongman in the area, was assassinated Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which included safety and security spokesman
Bheki Cele and KwaZulu-Natal health minister Zweli Mkhize, had
visited the scene of Saturday night's massacre in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
The massacre was thought to be a revenge attack for Nkabinde's
death.
</P>
<P>
Cele said as the convoy reached the corner of Shepstone and
Chilley streets, a light delivery vehicle stopped in front of it,
men jumped off the back and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
ANC bodyguards returned fire in a shootout which lasted about
two minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the attack, national police commissioner George
Fivaz and senior policemen were locked in a meeting at the police
headquarters in the town to assess the situation.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai to Lead Centrist Party in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sacked Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai will run for the premiership as head of a
forming centrist party in the upcoming elections, one of the
party's co-founders confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Roni Milo, the former Likud mayor of Tel Aviv, told Israel
Radio that Mordechai will head the new party being formed by him,
ex-army chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and former Finance Minister Dan
Meridor, regardless of results of any opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The three co-founders of the party have earlier agreed that
Mordechai will be at the top of the list if opinion polls show
that he will have the best chance to win the elections, scheduled
for May 17.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister, who was fired by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Saturday night for "disloyalty" to the Likud, will make
an announcement at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) over his widely-expected
decision to join the centrist party.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Netanyahu have been at odds over a number of
issues, especially the peace process with the Palestinians. The
defense minister has earlier threatened to resign if the peace
process remained stalled.
</P>
<P>
In his final cabinet meeting as defense chief Sunday,
Mordechai exchanged sharp words with Netanyahu, quoting the Bible
to imply the prime minister was a liar and an enemy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"Save my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and a deceitful
tongue," he said. "I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for
war," he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Netanyahu accused Mordechai of putting his
personal interest above that of the Likud and the country. He
alleged that Mordechai quitted the Likud only because he refused
to guarantee him the post of defense minister in the next
government, a charge denied by Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu described
Mordechai and the other three leaders of the centrist party as
"political losers."
</P>
<P>
"These four gentlemen have only thing in common ... They all
want to be number one. Everyone of them is a loser," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's departure from the Likud, which will undoubtedly
deal a severe blow to Netanyahu's chance to get re-elected, was
welcomed by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset (Parliament) member Shlomo Ben-Ami said
Mordechai's move was "a good development" in the elections. He
urged the centrist party to hold "serious negotiations" with the
Labor to coordinate their efforts to oust Netanyahu, saying he
sees no "practical difference" between the platforms of the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
The new centrist party made public parts of its campaign
slogans Sunday, calling for territorial compromise with the
Palestinians and the continuation of the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Former defense minister Moshe Arens, who is running against
Netanyahu for the Likud leadership, said he will not answer
Netanyahu's offer for him to take over Mordechai's post until the
party's primary, due to be held Monday, ends.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Reporters Tortured for Alleged Links With S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The detention and
torture of two Zimbabwean journalists by military and security
authorities was driven by a belief that their newspaper was linked
to South African military intelligence, South Africa's Sunday
Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
 The paper quoted Mark Chavunduka, editor of Standard, as
saying that his torturers made a desperate effort during his nine
days in military custody to establish these links.
</P>
<P>
 Interrogators claimed that news of a foiled coup plot had
started circulating within South African military intelligence
just 24 hours before the Standard splashed the story that led to
the arrest of Chavunduka and his colleague Ray Choto.
</P>
<P>
 They wrote a story claiming that 23 senior army officers have
been arrested for inciting colleagues to overthrow President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
 "They (The interrogators) never said the story was untrue.
They were more concerned about our sources, and especially our
alleged link with South African military intelligence," Chavunduka
said during a description of his ordeal at the hands of the
military and security intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
 Their torturers were not convinced that the timing was mere
coincidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
 The South African government has denied any links with the
alleged coup plot, but the Zimbabwean authorities have threatened
to tighten laws to ensure political stability.
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Standard's managing director Clive Wilson was
arrested, just 24 hours after Chavunduka and Choto were released.
The pair may be arrested again, according to reports circulating
in Harare.
</P>
<P>
 Chavunduka and Choto said they were tortured at a state
interrogation center outside the capital. They had been
blindfolded before being driven to the center, about an hour out
of town.
</P>
<P>
 They said they were subjected to electric shocks and physical
assaults with fists and rubber batons, and were forced to roll on
wet ground to remove blood from their bodies, according to Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
 Chavunduka said his head was put into a canvas bag filled
with water. It was tied around his neck and water force up to his
face.
</P>
<P>
 His interrogators claimed their actions had the blessing of
Mugabe, Chavunduka said.
</P>
<P>
 "They even went as far as saying the president had signed our
death warrants.
</P>
<P>
 "At one time it came to a point where I thought they were
going to get rid of us. It could not get any worse," Chavunduka
said.
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups and civic organizations have condemned
their treatment.
</P>
<P>
 The Zimbabwean Union of Journalists has appealed to western
donors to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
 "We particularly appeal to the European Union, the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and others to
withhold aid from a government that has shown beyond reasonable
doubt that it does not respect the rights of its citizens."

<HEADLINE> British Medical Aid Arrives in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two tons of medical aid
from Britain were flown into Sierra Leonean capital Freetown
Sunday, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said.
</P>
<P>
The report said it is the first substantial medical aid to
Sierra Leone since fighting broke out in December between
pro-government army and rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The medical aid, which includes two ambulances, will be given
to the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health, which is desperately
short of supplies for hospitals full of war-wounded civilians, BBC
said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the aid agencies have left Freetown amid fierce
fighting for the control of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report reaching here said church services resumed
in Freetown Sunday, for the first time since the rebels entered
the town on January 6.
</P>
<P>
It quoted witnesses as saying that Christians and Moslems
prayed and sang together, sometimes in the open air.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG is reportedly
continuing its mop-up operations on the fringes of the city, where
the rebels are still active.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG spokesman said the peace keepers were sweeping the
town, conducting house-to-house searches. "Once a place is swept
we deploy soldiers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the ECOMOG has trapped the rebels in the
Kissy area on the eastern outskirts of the town.

<HEADLINE> First Aorta Replacement Case Successful in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A medical team at Kuwait's
Mubarak Pectoral Diseases Hospital has successfully replaced a
natural aorta with an artificial artery for an expatriate, the
first such surgery in Kuwait, a doctor said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The operation, also the first in the Gulf region, was conducted
on Jaber Thabet, a 27-year-old Egyptian and father of three,
doctor Sam Safari, who headed the medical team, told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The damaged aorta had to be replaced after the patient
suffered from bleeding, Asfar said. The operation lasted 11 hours,
and the patient survived an artificial heart, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the patient, who was equipped with a respiratory system
for six days pending a heal of the surgical cuts, enjoys excellent
health and is expected to return home on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are only six medical centers in the United States and two
in Europe specialized in these critical surgeries. Some 10-15
percent of patients die while undergoing this operation, which
costs an average of 300,000 U.S. dollars. Some 10 percent suffer
from hemiplegia.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, both Kuwaitis and expatriates in Kuwait, which
implements a cradle-to-grave welfare system, enjoy free medical
services.

<HEADLINE> ECO Chief Calls for More Trade Among Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Onder Ozar Sunday
called for member states to enhance their commercial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general assembly of the ECO chamber, Ozar said
that trade volume among ECO members stood at only 153 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, 80 percent of which was among Iran, Turkey
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1964, the ECO has 10 members, namely Afghanistan,
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Ozar expressed the hope that the next ECO chamber meeting will
take measures to ease up trade laws and regulations, reduce
customs tariffs among members and will focus on sharing
information and facilitating investments, transit of goods and the
issuance of visas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Industries
and Mines Alinaqi Khamoushi expressed regret that ECO members
have so far failed to increase their trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, member states have imposed discriminatory
tariffs on goods of other members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamoushi said that several joint agreements reached between
member states on aviation and shipping cooperation have not been
implemented and the private sector has not been given any part to
play.
</P>
<P>
He said that some political considerations have led to weak
economic relations among member states.
</P>
<P>
Iran favored expanding ties among the ECO members because such
ties will lead to better political relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iraqi Delegation Withdraws From Arab FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi delegation Sunday
evening walked out of an ongoing Arab foreign ministers' meeting
in Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and members of
the Iraqi delegation have returned to the Hilton Hotel here where
they stay.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation did not give the reasons for its
withdrawal, which took place when the second closed meeting began
at 18:00 local time (1600 GMT).
</P>
<P>
But conference sources said the withdrawal might be prompted by
al-Sahhaf's disagreement over the contents of the draft of the
meeting's final communique.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Iraq insisted that the final communique
include condemnation of the U.S.-British attack on the country
last December and Arab's call for the lifting of the U.N. economic
sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait insisted that Iraq's demands be conditional on its
official apology for its 1990 invasion of the Gulf sheikdom, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf is expected to hold a press conference later in the
evening to explain the withdrawal of the Iraqi delegation.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers were meeting here to discuss the Iraqi
issue following the U.S.-British mid-December attack on the
country and seek Arab reconciliation.

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Exchanges and
cooperation between the Chinese National People's Congress and the
Madagascar National Assembly are important part of the friendly
cooperative ties between the two nations, Chinese Vice-President

</P>
<P>
This has served to play a positive role to promote the

years ago, they have enjoyed fruitful and satisfactory cooperation
in the political, economic, cultural and public health care

CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official said

for mutual apologies among Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in Baghdad during
the day that Iraq is ready to apologize for its mistakes if other
Arab countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the offer, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who was here for the ongoing Arab
foreign ministers' meeting, said "what does he (Aziz) want us to
apologize for?"
</P>
<P>
It is Iraq not Kuwait that should make apology since Kuwait
"has done nothing to apologize for," Sheikh Sabah stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait have been sworn enemies since 1990 when the
Iraqi troops stormed into the Gulf sheikdom and put it under
occupation for half a year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that any reconciliation be conditional on
Baghdad's official apology for the invasion, which ended by
U.S.-led allied forces in 1991 Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers were meeting in the Egyptian capital to
take up the Iraqi issue following the U.S.-British attack on Iraq
in mid-December and try to forge a unified stance.

They were also seeking Arab reconciliation and solidarity in

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The national political
commission of the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) held its first meeting here Sunday
in which Silvestre Gabriel Samy was elected the new general
secretary of the breakaway group.
</P>
<P>
A new constitution of the current national political
commission, which was established in mid-January at the 9th
special representatives' meeting, was also passed at Sunday's
meeting. And as a major part of the new party constitution, the
splinter group of UNITA decided to cancel the posts of vice
chairman and vice general secretary.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, the UNITA political
commission said the election of the new general secretary and the
passage of the new party constitution marks the end of the reform
campaign of the UNITA Renovation Committee and the new birth of
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
On September 2 of last year, some UNITA officials in the
national unity and reconciliation government issued a statement,
urging UNITA members to continue its peace process and refrain
from new war and achieve de- militarization of the party.
</P>
<P>
Later, they formed the UNITA Renovation Committee and split from
Jonas Savimbi, founder of UNITA, and his followers who now renewed
the civil war with government troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
On January 11 to 14, over 700 representatives from all over the
country attended the 9th special meeting of UNITA under the
initiatives of the Renovation Committee and elected former general
secretary Eugenio Manuvakula as its new chairman.

comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao made the remarks here
Sunday afternoon during talks with Madagascar Prime Minister
Tantely Andrianarivo.
</P>
<P>
He said this 21st-century oriented relationship is
characterized by long- term stability, equality, mutual benefit
and sincere cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides exchanged views on bilateral ties
and on international and regional issues of shared concern.
</P>
<P>
Hu said bilateral friendly cooperation has been advancing in a
sustainable and stable way while exchanges and cooperation in
various fields have been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and exchange of visits between leaders of the two
nations and various departments are on the rise while
non-governmental exchanges are frequent, he said, adding the
economic and trade cooperation is also proceeding smoothly and
areas of cooperation are expanding with satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is shifting from the planned economy to the
 socialist market economy, in which enterprises will be the main
body of the country's external economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages and supports its enterprises
to undertake mutually beneficial cooperation in various forms in
Madagascar, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Madagascar for its support to China in many U.N.
human rights conferences, saying both nations, as developing ones,
support each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Hu continued, the Madagascar government
abolished the so- called "special arrangement" with Taiwan, which
indicates Madagascar government's firm stance on "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
This is the support to China's reunification cause, and China
appreciates it very much, Hu said, adding that strengthening unity
and cooperation is in the common interests of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Andrianarivo said his government is striving
to develop its economy and he believed the government's plan and
goal to eliminate poverty can soon be realized.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his government and people have developed a
special friendly feeling toward the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China has offered sincere yet effective assistance to
Madagascar's economic development and he hoped bilateral friendly
cooperation be expanded, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Madagascar will continue to support China's stance on
the Taiwan issue and wishes that it will achieve reunification at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Hu and Andrianarivo attended a signing
ceremony of two documents, one on bilateral economic and
technological cooperation and the other on China's supply of
preferential loans to Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Hu met with overseas Chinese living in
Madagascar. He said they have served as important links for the
Sino-Madagascar friendship.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also encouraged the Chinese embassy staff
and Madagascar-based Chinese firms to make further efforts for
Sino-Madagascar friendship.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Joins Centrist Party, Vowing to Oust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Announcing his decision to
leave the ruling Likud party and join a centrist party, outgoing
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday the policy
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed and he has to be
ousted.
</P>
<P>
He made the widely-expected announcement at a nation-wide
broadcast news conference in Tel Aviv, at the same hotel where
Netanyahu announced the removal of the defense minister from his
post Saturday night over alleged disloyalty to the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he joined the Likud in 1996 in a hope that
Netanyahu would bring Israel peace and security as he had
promised in the elections, but was disappointed that the prime
minister ran away from the line and was controlled by extremist
groups.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two and a half years, Mordechai said, the
security situation in Israel has deteriorated. Peace talks with
the Palestinians have stalled and the relations with Arab
neighbors worsened, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Netanyahu's policy has proven a failure, citing
the resignations of several ministers from his government.
</P>
<P>
The government of Netanyahu has reached the end of its road,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the defense minister said he will choose a new road
and work with "wonderful peoples" like former army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, former finance minister Dan Meridor and former Tel
Aviv mayor Roni Milo.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes these people will "bring a change" to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were tantamount to an official declaration that
he has agreed to join the new centrist party being formed by the
three.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Milo told Israel Radio that Mordechai will head the
party regardless of results of any opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The new centrist party made public parts of its campaign
slogans earlier Sunday, calling for territorial compromise with
the Palestinians and the continuation of the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, widely-considered as a moderate in the right-wing
government, has been at odds with Netanyahu over a number of
issues, especially the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
His departure from the Likud will undoubtedly deal a serious
blow to Netanyahu's chance to get re-elected in the May elections
since he will take away some of the voters from Likud.
</P>
<P>
A poll published Sunday in Yedioth Ahronoth, the most
widely-read newspaper in Israel, showed that a centrist party led
by Mordechai could capture nearly a third of the voters who cast
ballots for Netanyahu in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
His move was welcomed by the opposition bloc as a "good
development."
</P>
<P>
Before Mordechai made the announcement, Labor Knesset
(Parliament) member Shlomo Ben-Ami urged the centrist party to
hold "serious negotiations" with the Labor to coordinate their
efforts to oust Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said he saw no "practical difference" between the
platforms of the centrist party and the Labor party.
</P>
<P>
While Shahak and Labor leader Ehud Barak were both proteges of
late dovish prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, Mordechai is regarded as
a clone to the late prime minister in strategic thinking.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Defends His Exit from Arab Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said Sunday evening that Iraq withdrew its
delegation from the ongoing Arab foreign ministers' meeting to
protest its failure to condemn the U.S.-British attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf told a press conference here that the Iraqi
delegation attended the meeting in a bid to egg the Arabs on to
adopt "a balanced communique" demurring at the U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister walked out of the foreign ministers'
meeting in the evening when the ministers adopted a final
statement, which only expressed "deep concern at the use of the
military option against Iraq," failing to satisfy Iraq's demand
the attack be called as an "aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said his country has hoped the ministers
would condemn the U.N. economic sanctions on it and call for the
lifting of the punitive measures for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But the statement also fell short of meeting Iraq's request,
saying only that the Arabs would work for the lifting of the trade
sanctions, al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation wanted a plea in the statement to cancel
the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq because they were
created by a unilateral U.S.-British decision lacking the
authority of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign minister were meeting in Cairo to discuss the
Iraqi issue following the U.S.-British attack, in an attempt to
forge a unified stance on Iraq and seeking Arab reconciliation and
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that Iraq's demands be conditional on its
official and public apology for its invasion of the Gulf sheikdom
and a final recognition of the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister attacked Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for their
rejection of condemning the U.S.-British air strikes in the final
statement of the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
He described the final communique as "unbalanced," maintaining
that the support expressed by the statement to Iraq is "worthless."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Iraq's walking out of the ministerial meeting implied
withdrawal from the Arab League, al-Sahhaf said the move is just a
protest at the meeting and its final statement.

<HEADLINE> China Values Ties with Africa: Senior Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZANZIBAR, Tanzania, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) of China Xu Jialu said in Zanzibar Sunday that
China pays great attention to its relationship with Africa.
</P>
<P>
During talks with speaker of Zanzibar House of Representatives,
Pandu Ameir Kificho, Xu said the delegation he is heading is the
first one sent overseas by NPC, the Chinese Parliament, this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, it came only days after Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan's visit to Africa, which shows that China
attaches great importance to Tanzania and other African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the friendship between China and Tanzania can be traced
back to the ancient times and the bilateral relationship has gone
smoothly since the two countries established diplomatic
relationship 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kificho expressed gratitude to China's perennial support,
especially in sending medical teams to Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who took boat to Zanzibar from capital Dar es Salaam
Saturday, said Tanzania has also lent a lot of support to China in
international affairs, which embodies the friendship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who is heading a 12-member delegation, briefed Kificho on
the structure and functions of NPC, which is the top legislature
of China, as well as domestic situation. In return, Kificho
introduced the operation of Zanzibar's House of Representatives to
the Chinese guests.
</P>
<P>
Kificho said since 1993, the house has passed a series of acts
for the establishment of Economic Processing Zones, Tourism
Commission and a free port, in a move to boost the economic
development of Zanzibar, a part of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Xu said law enactment and enforcement plays an important role
in boosting economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, who met Xu later at his
office, described China as its "best friend." He said the cemetery
of Chinese people who died during the construction of
Tanzania-Zambia railway in the 1970s is a symbol of the deep
feelings of Chinese for Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Amour also said China's reforms have greatly benefited common
people in both urban and rural areas. He added that Africa could
follow the path of China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides agreed that democracy is an internal
issue which should not be interfered by external forces.
</P>
<P>
Xu came back to Dar es Salaam in the afternoon. He is
scheduled to fly to Kampala, Uganda Monday to attend the ceremony
for the opening of a stadium built under Chinese aid. He will
also visit Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh Teachers Strike for Salary Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Teachers from Royal Phnom
Penh University and 17 secondary schools out of the total 27 in
the capital city went on strike Monday to press their demand for
wage hikes.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are demanding that their monthly pay be increased
to as much as 300 dollars (1.2 million riel) from the current 15
to 20 U.S. dollars (60,000 to 80,000 riel).
</P>
<P>
The government offered a five-dollar monthly "bonus" to
teachers nationwide on January 15 following threats of strikes
from teachers at several schools in Phnom Penh. But the offer was
rejected by the teachers who said it was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
According to figures available here, there is a huge gap
between the salaries of government ministers and parliamentarians
(about 1,000-2,000 U.S. dollars per month) and those of teachers
as well as low-ranking civil servants (about 20 U.S. dollars per
month).
</P>
<P>
The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said in its question of the
week to the government that teachers cannot lead a decent life
based on their present level of salaries.
</P>
<P>
The government acknowledged that the five-dollar bonus for the
teachers is not enough, but it asked the teachers to be patient,
saying that any pay rise for the teachers would be pegged to the
performance of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Many students felt worried over their teachers' strike. A
secondary student named Pal said: "It's about to have an
end-of-term examination, so we are afraid it will affect our
study. We hope the classes would be resumed as soon as possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- France expressed satisfaction on
Monday over the appeal made by the Arab League calling for the
lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We noted with satisfaction that this final communique (of the
Arab League) has presented interesting convergence with our
ideas, in particular the appeal for the lifting of economic
sanctions which weigh on the Iraqi people, as well as the need to
rebuild the global relationship between Iraq and the United
Nations," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that the terms of the communique will help make
progress in the on-going debate at the U.N. Security Council
between Iraq and the United Nations on the lifting of sanctions,
imposed after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of member countries of the Arab League
issued a final communique on Sunday in Cairo calling for
"multiplication of the international efforts for lifting the
embargo as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
To the satisfaction of Britain, the league failed to condemn
the American-British "Desert Fox" airstrikes against Iraq, as has
been demanded by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
France has called for the lifting of oil embargo on Iraq and
the establishment of a new monitoring system in Iraq to control
armament.

<HEADLINE> HK Places Education on Top Agenda of 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa said here Monday that to educate local people for building a
better Hong Kong is a primary task of the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
"To help Hong Kong to move forward and to enhance our
competitiveness, we must place education on the top of our
agenda," said Tung at the Forum on "Education Blueprint for the
21st Century - Review of Academic System: Aims of Education"
organized by the Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite the current economic downturn, education
remains the single biggest item of recurrent expenditure of the
SAR Government. In 1999-2000, total recurrent expenditure on
education will amount to 44 billion HK dollars (5.6 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"At present, we in Hong Kong are faced with unprecedented
challenges and ordeals. Out of our painful experience and the
sense of threat, we find it more pressing to reflect on how we
should cope with future challenges," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In an age of advanced information technology, the one with
ample knowledge will surely be the winner, said the chief
executive. That is why he asked the Education Commission to
conduct a thorough review of Hong Kong's academic system at all
levels, from pre-primary to tertiary, so as to upgrade the
overall quality of education and ensure the system will produce
the right talents for the future development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung urged the whole community to render support to the
education review. "Indeed, education is a matter for all members
of the community," he said. "Let us put our heads together to
draw up a blueprint for education for the 21st century."

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) will launch institutional reforms in two-thirds of
its institutes within three years to meet the demand of
knowledge-innovation projects, CAS President Lu Yongxiang said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will try to complete these reforms of in 80 research
institutes by the end of the year 2000, Lu told an annual working
meeting of the academy which opened today.
</P>
<P>
He said the CAS will have this Knowledge-Innovation Project in
full swing this year, and plans to involve another 35
institutes.
</P>
<P>
The CAS started 12 pilot knowledge-innovation projects last
year including reform of the Institute of Computing Technology
with the support of the Legend Group, the overall reform of the
Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, and the merging of the
Mathematics Institute, the Institute of Applied Mathematics and
other two institutes.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that other CAS institutes will follow these pilot
institutes by cutting down their permanent research staffs and
increasing the number of "floating" employees.
</P>
<P>
He noted that personnel management and distribution systems
should be improved to involve more research workers in intensive
competition and attract more young scientists from both at home
and abroad.

<HEADLINE> China's Civil Aviation Sector Strains to Increase Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation
sector, which experienced serious financial losses in 1998, will
make efforts to increase its income through regulating ticket
prices and stabilizing the market.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the sector's gross circulating
volume in 1998 increased by 6.3 percent compared to 1997,
however, its transport income dropped by 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianfeng, director of the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China, attributed the losses to irrational
price competition among domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
An airlines should attract passengers because of its good
reputation for safety, reliability, and high-quality service, not
by blindly reducing prices, said Liu at a national work
conference which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that airlines must not raise and lower prices
by themselves or provide discount without permission. Only group
passengers, teachers and students should be given preferential
treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that airlines reach agreements on ticket
prices, especially among those who operate the same air
routes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that passenger volume for China's
entire transportation sector last year registered an annual
increase of 5.8 percent, while that for civil aviation grew by

<HEADLINE> Famine Continues to Wreck Havoc in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation
in southern Somalia is alarming with famine and starvation
claiming both human lives and livestock.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's main warlords have called on donor countries, the
international aid agencies and Somali businessmen to intervene
into the plight of the Somalis before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid have issued
warnings that unless something tangible is done, the people in the
regions of Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Lower and Middle Jubba and the
central region will suffer from serious food and water shortages
following a continued drought and lack of potable water.
</P>
<P>
The first response ever from a Somali warlord to famine victims
has reached the recently burned refugee camp in South Mogadishu.
A committee sponsored by Hussein Mohamed Aidid have distributed 60
plastic sheets and some household utensils to the internally
displaced people of the Trobunka refugee camp which caught fire 12
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these efforts, many of the approximately 700
families who lost their houses to the fire still remain without
shelter and food.
</P>
<P>
According to Ebado Ali, one of the administration officers of
the camp, the assistance has been a good gesture, but far from
being enough. Ebado said the children of the camp are especially
suffering from chronic bronchitis which resulted from lack of
shelter.
</P>
<P>
The famine related outcries are also coming from the towns of
Bardaleh, Sakow and more than 40 villages in Gado Region. In the
area surrounding the town of Badaleb, over 500 families of
refugees who crossed from the border of Kenya have started dying
at the rate of three children per day.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Hassan Mohamed Enow, a traditional leader in Middle
Jubba region also said the situation is especially grave as the
people are leaving their herds and animals and coming to the main
towns in search of food and water. He said almost all hand-dug
shallow wells had dried up because of the drought and lack of
rains.
</P>
<P>
Serious famine is also being reported from the central regions
of Mudus and Galgudud where water and food scarcity are badly
affecting the mainly nomadic societies. The famine is a result of
a ban imposed on Somalia's meat and livestock exports to the Gulf
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Yusuf Hassan Eyow, the Governor of Galgudud
region, the situation is even worse than anyone can really
imagine.
</P>
<P>
" The people have nothing to eat or drink," said Eyow, adding
"the seasonal rains did not fall in the past year."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Starts Winter Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Jatiya Sangsad, the
country's parliament, started its winter session on Monday, with
the absence of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP).
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 12th session of the seventh parliament, which
was elected in 1996, President Shahabuddin Ahmed called on all
political parties to "come out of the narrow confines of party
interests when it is the question of national well-being" and
"refrain from activities which may cause harm to our economic
development."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the government policies and programs in fulfilling
the constitutional obligation, he said: "We all must be sincere in
the pursuit of economic development and in the practice and
culture of democracy."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference during the recess of the session, Deputy
Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Badruddoza Chowdhury, a
lawmaker of the BNP, said the opposition boycotted the president's
speech because "it is no longer the president's speech" after it
was approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the president's speech, it is the cabinet's speech,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is not know immediately whether the BNP will boycott the
parliament's entire session, which may continue till the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
At another news conference during the recess, Communications
Minister Anwar Hossain Manju from the Jatiya Party (JP) said his
presence at the session was "not challenging the leadership of
H.M. Ershad," chairman of the party, the second largest opposition
in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Eleven out of 33 JP parliamentarians, including Manju, were
present at the meeting. Ershad issued letters to JP parliament
members several days ago asking them not to attend the inaugural
meeting of the parliament's winter session, in a joint move with
the BNP and other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
After the president's speech, the House may be adjourned till
January 31, and may face another round of vacation in February
because of the Language Martyrs Day on February 21 and the
municipal elections scheduled for February 23-25.
</P>
<P>
Six political parties are represented in Bangladesh's
parliament, including the ruling Bangladesh Awami League, the BNP,
the JP, the Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islami Oikya Jote and the Jatiya
Samajtantrik Dal.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Some 1,600 development projects are to become
operational in Iran's rural regions during the 10-Day Dawn period
(February 1-10) to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Construction Jihad Minister for Rural
Development and Industrial Affairs Ali Ruholamin said here on
Sunday that 131,000 villagers are expected to benefit from the
projects with a total investment of 423 billion rials (about 141
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that 17 percent of the projects are related to
drinking water supply, 12 percent to power supply, 66 percent to
road building and 5 percent to renovation plans.
</P>
<P>
Ruholamin said that 113 manufacturing units in 270 rural areas
would create 3,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has earned about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars from
exports of 8.16 million tonnes of non-oil goods during the first
three quarters of the current Iranian year ending March 20, the
Export Promotion Center announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Export volume saw an increase of 34 percent in terms of weight
and a fall of 7 percent compared with the same period of last
Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran expected 5 billion dollars from non-oil exports this
Iranian year, but the non-oil exports showed a negative growth in
value during the first two quarters, mainly caused by the fall in
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
However, in the third quarter of the Iranian year, the exports
showed an increase in value and the upward trend is expected to
continue in the last three months as oil price recovered slightly.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia saw a 7 percent increase in its proven
reserves of natural gas over the past two years, to reach 5.776
billion cubic meters, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources
Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Saudi Press Agency, the minister said
that the oil-related gas reserves have also increased to 1.9
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that "the rise in gas reserves is due to new
discoveries of gas fields in the middle part of Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is making efforts to develop the gas industry in a
bid to meet local needs of electricity which grow by 7 percent
each year.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh has also opened the door last year to American firms to
join in exploiting petroleum and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia has issued 43 oil prospecting licenses and is
expected to grant three more in an effort to increase petroleum
and natural gas production.
</P>
<P>
The number of international groups engaged in oil and gas
prospecting in Tunisia has increased to 50, of which eight have
already started extracting and marketing petroleum, the
Arabic-language daily "Al Hayat" reported on Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Prosecutes Village Committee Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Liang Manhong, a village
committee chairman in north China, was recently prosecuted for
failing to hold timely village committee elections after his
first term expired two years ago.
</P>
<P>
 According to China's law, a village committee chairman has a
three-year term of office. But Liang was elected as committee
chairman of Yingxian Village in Shanxi Province five years ago,
and has held the post ever since without holding another election
as required.
</P>
<P>
 Liang also appointed six village committee members after his
election, though China's law stipulates that village committee
members must be elected by the voters.
</P>
<P>
 Zhan Chengfu, a Civil Affairs Ministry official in charge of
village committee elections, said that Liang has violated China's
law on village committee, and local governments should
investigate the case and prosecute Liang.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that during his term of office, Liang
used more then half a hectare of the village's farm land for his
personal use, and wantonly squandered public funds.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Meets U.N. Representative to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry
Rawlings said Monday that he and his colleagues in the sub-region
are ready to hold peace talks with the Sierra Leone rebels but
will do so only if they stop the barbaric acts being meted on the
civilian population, reported the Ghanaian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to sit down to talk provided they stop those
acts of violence, killing and maiming of innocent civilians,"
Rawlings told Ambassador Francis Okello, representative of the
U.N. secretary-general in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Okello called on Rawlings to update him on the situation in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings implored Okello to get to some of the "sober minded"
allies to the rebels to bring their influence to bear for them to
see reason, reiterating his earlier points that ECOWAS entered
Sierra Leone not to wage war but consolidate democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The will of the people must be made to prevail," Rawlings
said, adding that anything short of this will make democracy in
that country suffer.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on those supporting the rebels against the
west African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, to review their action
and find an alternative, saying "We do not believe this is the
only way to handle the situation."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings made it clear that he was not an admirer of embattled
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, neither will he support any rebel
group against his government.
</P>
<P>
Okello told the president that the situation in Sierra Leone
has degenerated, saying its gravity has not been appreciated as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem. The situation is very serious, very
grave," he said, adding that something needs to be done and must
be done now.
</P>
<P>
Okello who had been to some other countries in the subregion
on a similar mission, said he deemed it necessary to come to Ghana
because of its stake and interest in the search for a lasting
peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
James Victor Gbeho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said Ghana
has a stake in the troubled country, not only because of good
neighborhood but also its desire in ensuring democracy and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regrets that some sister countries have
contributed to reverse the gains so far made in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He recalled various diplomatic efforts so far made, saying
Okello's briefing will enable Ghana and others in the sub-region
to have a good assessment of the situation and map out the way
forward.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, democracy must be restored. The
constitutionally elected government must be supported. We must
close our ranks to see the way forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Totobi Quakyi, minister responsible for national security
who also participated in the meeting lauded the UN's commitment to
review the situation in Sierra Leone with the help of others
including Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He said although the process has been difficult, progress has
been made in the last few weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) today gave its support for the decisions made by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) on January 24 in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Despite being shocked and deeply regretful with the worst
corruption in the Olympic history, the COC spokesman said the COC
believed the IOC is capable of handling the matter in a proper
way and will crack down on its members linked to the votes-buying
bribery scandals.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the COC respected the IOC's decisions and
supported Sydney and Salt Lake City to host the 2000 Summer and
2002 Winter Olympic Games respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The two host cities have paid huge efforts to prepare for the
Games, which should not be denied by several members' mis
conducts," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Although the IOC had played a major part in pushing through
the Olympic Movement since its establishment, it failed in some
respects to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of the
Olympics and the reform, especially its bidding process, is a
must, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The COC has always been opposing any conducts which would
endanger the spirit of the Olympic Movement and will strictly
comply with the new bidding regulations set by the IOC, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has officially launched a bid to host the 2008 Summer
Olympics.

The main tasks of THW, as an integral part of the humanitarian
aid of the German government, will involve the supply of drinking

remained subdued as the economic downturn is biting in, according
to government statistics published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales in November 1998 fell 20 percent on a
year-on-year basis, to 14.7 billion HK dollars (1.88 billion U.S.
dollars), the Census and Statistics Department said.
</P>
<P>
Department stores were hit hardest, with sales of commodities
declining 32 percent in value or 29 percent in volume in
November. Sales of clothing, luxury commodities, and consumer
durable goods all dropped considerably.
</P>
<P>
Sales in supermarkets went up two percent in value, but down
four percent in volume. Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and
tobacco remained virtually unchanged in value, but rose two
percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said retail business remained subdued
in November 1998, as local consumer demand was still much
affected by the uncertain economic outlook, moderated income and
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Consumers were particularly cautious in their spending on
durables and more expensive items, but expenditure on basic
necessities was less affected, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Compared with October 1998, total retail sales in November
1998 slid eight percent in value or six percent in volume.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Defense Minister Meets China PLA General Staff Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha said here Monday that the well-developed
Malaysian-Chinese relationship is a very sincere and positive one.
</P>
<P>
Meeting visiting Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Chief
of the General Staff Gen. Fu Quanyou, the minister said China is a
big country and always sincerely supports Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
At the informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Malaysia last year, for example, China
gave a lot of support, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar said some Western countries are spreading the
theory of so-called "China threat" in a bid to drive a wedge
between China and other countries, but Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has made it clear repeatedly since he assumed office that
China is a good friend but not a threat.
</P>
<P>
He said the prime minister visited China several times and has
established good friendship with Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the cold war, there still exist small
clashes in the world and some countries intend to interfere in
others' internal affairs. Asian countries should cherish their own
values in finding solutions to the difficulties they are now
facing.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Malaysia and China should have the same voice
on world issues as well as on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Fu said China, which pursues an independent foreign policy
and a defending defense policy, does not pose a threat to any
other country.
</P>
<P>
He said the theory of "China threat" spread by some people is
totally groundless and ulteriorly motivated.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is an important country in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China attaches great
importance to developing friendly and cooperative relations with
Malaysia as the two countries are close neighbors which enjoy
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Fu said developing countries should strengthen their
cooperation and promote dialogue and work together for
safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese general also met Malaysia's Chief of
Defense Forces Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin here Monday and both pledged
to make continued efforts to further promote the relationship
between the two armed forces in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Fu arrived here Sunday night on a five-day visit to
Malaysia at the invitation of Zahidi.

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese quarantine inspectors
have identified some insects seized at the Beijing Airport are
dangerous Mediterranean fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
The insects, which were found in several oranges carried by a
Chinese passenger from Switzerland, are major killers of fruits
and vegetables. This is the fifth time Beijing has seized these
insects since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The insects discovered at the airport on December 14 last year
underwent laboratory analysis which has added to an understanding
of this species, Geng Bingjin, director of the Beijing Quarantine
Bureau for Animals and Plants, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean fruit flies can damage as many as 260 varieties
of fruits and plants, and they have a history of causing great
damage in many countries. To date, China has not been plagued by
this insect.
</P>
<P>
However, Geng warned that as the country opens wider to the
outside world, an increasing number of dangerous insects will
find their way into the country, bringing new threats to China's
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-British Warplanes Continue Air Raids on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British warplanes
are continuing air raids against residential areas and economic
targets in Iraq's southern province of Basra.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes at 10:10 a.m. local time (0710 GMT) on Monday
shelled a number of heavily populated districts, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The random bombardment led to the killing of a number of
children, women and the elderly. But the specific figures of the
casualties are not available now.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a residential area in the city of
al-Jumhuriya in the southern province of Basra was attacked by
U.S-British missiles at 9:30 a.m. local time (6:30 GMT) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The missile attacks targetted civilian houses, which led to the
deaths and injuries of some children and women and the destruction
of some houses.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that residential areas in Iraq are
subjected to missile and bomb attacks since the mid-December
U.S.-British air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The civil defense teams and party organizations have been
searching for the killed and transferring the wounded to
hospitals, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq, Iraqi
air defense forces and U.S.-British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq have exchanged fires
frequently.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed no-fly zones in Iraq after
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the minority
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from what
the two countries said Baghdad's oppression.

<HEADLINE> Australia Demands Indian Action Over Missionary Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia Monday demanded
protection for Australian missionaries in India following the
weekend killing of an Australian missionary and his two young
sons.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Queensland missionary, Graham Staines, and his
sons Philip, 10, and Timothy, 6, were burnt to death when their
jeep was set alight by a mob of Hindu radicals in India's eastern
state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded statement, Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer Monday paid tribute to Staines and expressed his deep
sorrow at the murders.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Staines devoted his life to serving others and it is
unconscionable that he and his sons should have been killed in
this way," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's High Commissioner to India, Rob Laurie, has
conveyed to the Indian government our very strong concern at this
brutal incident and our hope that other Australians working in
similar circumstances will be afforded every protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia expected India to swiftly bring to
justice those responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
Indian police were reported to have already arrested 47 people
and offered a reward for the capture of a leading militant whose
organization is alleged to be responsible for the attack.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Committee Meeting to Find Ways to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (xinhua) -- The second round of talks of a
UNEP committee opened here Monday to work to reach a global
treaty to reduce or eliminate environmental emissions and
discharges of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) like DDT.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 100 countries are participating in
the five- day second session of the Inter-governmental
Negotiating Committee toward global action on POPs at the
headquarters of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) in Nairobi,
capital of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The participants will work to reach an agreement on a treaty by
the year 2000 in response to a mandate from the UNEP governing
council.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his opening speech, UNEP Deputy Executive Director,
Shafqat Kakakhel, said that POPs, which travel far from their
source to remote parts of the world, harm ecological support
system on which life depends.
</P>
<P>
He point out that POPs accumulate and magnify as they more
through the food chain, concentrating even in the largest animal
species like polar bears and whales.
</P>
<P>
"No country is safe from their effects and no person is
protected against their presence," he noted, adding that POPS
endanger public health and the environment around the globe,
causing illness and taking lives, and also pose risks to the
unborn and endanger generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
The POPs have made them a global problems requiring a global
solution and no country acting alone can solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, these talks will produce a legally binding regime that
will prevent the terrible mistake and tragedies of the past from
ever happening again.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP, one of the concerns prompting
international action in the growing number of obsolete and
uncontrolled stockpiles and toxic chemicals. This problem is
particularly acute in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Dump sites and toxic drums from the 1950s, 60s and 70s are now
decaying, leaching chemicals into the soil and poisoning water
resources, wildlife and people, the UNEP chief said.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the participants will discuss a draft of
an international legally binding instrument for implementing
international action on certain POPs. The Working Group on
Criteria will present a report on POPs.
</P>
<P>
Twelve POPs are on the initial list for action under the treaty
being draft. Negotiators will be deciding on provision to reduce
release and to eliminate or phase out uses entirely at the
session.
</P>
<P>
The 12 POPs listed fall into three categories: pesticides,
industrial chemicals and unintended by-products of combustion and
industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
They are aldrin,chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, dioxin, endrin,
furans, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, PCBs and Toxaphene.
</P>
<P>
The first round talks on this subject was held in Montreal,
Canada, from June 29 to July 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Tamil Party's Jaffna Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The leader of northern Sri
Lanka's Jaffna district branch of the People's Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) was shot dead Sunday night,
said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thillainathan Chandramohan Alias Sathis, 31, was killed
instantly by a two-man pistol group of the rebel Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the gunmen were following the PLOTE district
leader and one of his colleagues, and fired on them in a deserted
area in the Jaffna town.
</P>
<P>
PLOTE member K. Senthamilchelvan was sent to hospital with
gunshot wounds, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The killing was the first major incident of its kind after the
LTTE gunned down the secretary of the Jaffna district branch of
the Tamil United Liberation Front Ponnathurai Mathimugarajah last
month.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jaffna's two mayors -- Sarojini Yogeswaran and
Ponnuthurai Sivapalan -- were killed by LTTE rebels who have been
waging a war against the government for a separate state in the
north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Likud Votes for Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (xinhua)-- 300 Likud polling stations
are opened on Monday throughout Israel for the party members
to vote for Likud chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's Likud race, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is running against his only challenger, Likud's former defense
and foreign minister Moshe Arens, for the No. 1 party slot, which
will be the party chairman and candidate for prime minister in
the upcoming May elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the Likud, some 160,000 party members are eligible
to vote. The voting, which started Monday morning, will last till
10:00 PM (local time) in the evening. the final results will be
announced Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu cast his vote in Jerusalem in the morning.
Netanyahu is tipped by most senior party officials to easily win
against Arens.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the party election, Arens was holding his cards
close to his chest, but said he has considerable grass-root
support.
</P>
<P>
Despite Netanyahu's offer of the defense portfolio, Arens still
refused to withdraw his challenge against Netanyahu, saying he is
the only candidate capable of unifying the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Arens said on Sunday that he would only consider whether to
accept the offer after the party election.
</P>
<P>
Last week, several days before firing defense minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, Netanyahu had already approached a variety of coalition
parliament members to make sure he would receive the required
majority for Arens' appointment.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said there is no
way his party would support the appointment as someone as
"extreme" as Arens.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu confirmed after casting his vote that he on Saturday
also offered Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon of the defense
portfolio, but Sharon turned it down.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai fired by Netanyahu on Saturday and will of out of
his official duty Monday evening.

<HEADLINE> Enquist Replaces Agassi as Australian Open Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Thomas Enqvist is
the new favorite to win the Australian Open men's singles crown
following the shock defeat of Andre Agassi in Melbourne on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected victory, Vincent Spadea of the United States
beat Agassi, the 1995 Australian Open champion, 6-1 7-5 6-7 (3-7)
6-3 at the four round. But Agassi, the favorite to lift the crown
since the tournament began last Monday, believes Slovakian Karol
Kucera, the highest remaining seed left in the event, will be the
man to walk away with the title.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist beat Australian Pat Rafter and Mark Philippoussis in
the past two rounds.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov is the only previous grand slam winner (1996 French
Open) left in the tournament and Agassi expects him to reach next
Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
However, he believes the winner will come from the other half
of the draw most likely out of an expected semifinal match-up
between Kucera and Enqvist, who will start warm favourites in
their quarter final matches against Marc Rosset and Nicolas
Lapentti respectively.
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a very interesting match-up," Agassi said
of Kucera and Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
"Kucera really likes the pace and he hits well."
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to hit through Kucera because he can handle your
pace well and he moves really well so he can probably frustrate
Enqvist a little bit and get to him."
</P>
<P>
While Kucera, as the highest ranking player left in the draw,
is entitled to be the new tournament favourite, Enqvist, who only
just missed out on a seeding, is the hottest player on tour at
present.
</P>
<P>
The Swede has not only eliminated Australia's best two players
in his previous two matches but came into the tournament having
been successful in both the Australian Hardcourt Championships
earlier this month and the Colonial Classic tournament in
Melbourne before the Australian Open.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Ordered Not to Start Firing in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that he has ordered the government troops not
to trigger any clash with secessionist rebels in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But he said the military will be forced to defend themselves
and retaliate against the Muslim rebels if they continue to attack
government troops and installations.
</P>
<P>
"I told them never to start firing, just defend yourselves. So
once they start, we will go all out against them," Estrada said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
It was members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that
triggered the military attack in Mindanao last Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports that the Air Force's helicopter
gunships pounded several MILF outposts in Maguindanao, Mindanao,
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that while the government exhausts all remedies to
make the peace process with the MILF succeed, it is also ready to
meet the rebel group's force "with force."

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
agreed to open an embassy in Colombo at the request of Sri Lankan
government, according to a report carried by Khaleej Times on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal has now been approved and we expect the embassy
to come into being within two months from now," said Sri Lankan
ambassador A.M. Samsuddin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will be the third country of Gulf Cooperation Council
states to have diplomatic presence in Sri Lanka, after Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan embassy in Abu Dhabi has been functioning since

He said his government had also initiated talks with the UAE
authorities for concluding two agreements, one on bilateral
investment promotion and the other on total tax relief.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Beats Kournikova in Two Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Former champion Mary Pierce
embarrassed Russia's young rising star Anna Kournikova in a
fourth round Australian Open clash in Melbourne on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, the seventh seed, showed no mercy in disposing of the
teenager 6-0, 6-4 to set up a quarter final clash with Martina
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
It took just 19 minutes for her to wrap up the first set as
Kournikova struggled to place any pressure on the
24-year-old,winning just seven points for the entire set.
</P>
<P>
The second set started off in the same trend as the first with
Pierce breaking serve early to lead 3-0 before Kournikova took an
injury time-out to have her right shoulder attended to.
</P>
<P>
When she returned to the court the 17 year-old momentarily
sparked life into an otherwise one sided and lackluster affair by
finally winning a service game and then immediately breaking
Pierce at the first opportunity.
</P>
<P>
However, it was short lived. Pierce broke back and then held
serve to lead 5-2 and eventually took the match by breaking
Kournikova's brittle serve in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
The Russian teenager, who served 31 double faults during an
earlier round, had just five double faults tonight, but she was
tentative and served considerably slower than her rival.
</P>
<P>
While Pierce was constantly knocking down first serves between
165km and 175km, Kournikova was sending down first serves some
40-50km slower before matching the pace late in the second set.

COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- With the North Western
Provincial Council (NWPC) poll wound up this afternoon, Sri
Lanka's ruling People's Alliance (PA) will probably win the
election, informed sources said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition parties United National Party (UNP)

cancel the election results as at least dozens of election-related
incidents have been reported allegedly against the PA, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
446 candidates from seven political parties and three
independent groups contested 52 seats in a new NWPC for the next
five years.

<P>
The first result is expected to be released by a little after
midnight.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hopeful of $1Bn Loan from IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is close to reaching an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a loan
package of one billion U.S. Dollars, the independent This Day
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report quoted government officials involved in
the negotiations as saying that the IMF board is expected to meet
in February to ratify the package.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the loan package, Nigeria will start reforms
advocated by the IMF known as the Staff Monitored Program (SMP),
which will pave the way for debt relief negotiations with the
Paris Club, the single largest creditor of Nigeria's estimated 28
billion dollar external debt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loan has been made possible by reforms introduced in
the government's 1999 budget, including the removal of the dual
exchange rate and subsidy on domestic fuel, and greater autonomy
for the central bank, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government is also preparing to axe loss-making state
projects and change its pattern of spending by providing a greater
share for education, health and other social services.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the IMF is still seeking greater
transparency in central bank transactions and effective monitoring
of the state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the expected loan and debt relief would be very
important to the coming civilian government, which would face the
greatest economic crisis since Nigeria's independence in 1960, due
to the slump in the international oil market and decades of
corruption and mismanagement by successive military governments.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Trade Volume Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the Chinese
mainland and Taiwan amounted to 20.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, a sharp increase from 16.33 billion dollars in 1994,
"People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article, An Min, China's vice-minister of foreign
trade and economic cooperation, said that cross-straits trade
relations and economic cooperation have grown since President
Jiang Zemin made his eight-point announcement on reunification
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's exports to Taiwan grew to 3.87 billion U.S.
dollars worth in 1998 and imports from Taiwan rose to 16.63
billion U.S. dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, overall trade across the Taiwan Straits
was worth 136.91 billion U.S. dollars, 22.05 billion dollars of
that in mainland exports and 114.86 billion dollars Taiwan
exports.
</P>
<P>
Because of the restrictive policies of the Taiwan authorities,
An said, Taiwanese investment in the mainland has dropped in the
past few years. By the end of November last year, there were 41,1
15 Taiwan-backed projects in the mainland, with contractual
investment up to 40.6 billion dollars and actual investment
totaling 21.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investment has begun shifting to larger projects,
from manufacturing to the service sector, as well as to real
estate and science and technology, An said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is now the mainland's second largest overseas
investor.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Files Defamation Suit Against Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday filed a 100 million ringgit
(26.316 million U.S. dollars) defamation suit against Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad at the High Court here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's suit alleging that Mahathir had defamed him on
September 22 last year was filed by his counsel, Karpal Singh, at
the High Court registry here, the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is also seeking an injunction to restrain Mahathir, on
his own, or through his workers and/or agents, from further making
any defamatory statement against him.
</P>
<P>
In his statement of claim, Anwar said Mahathir had uttered the
defamatory words to local and foreign journalists including
Dorinda Elliot, a journalist from Newsweek, at his office on
September 22 last year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said this had resulted in the statements being
re-produced in the October 5 issue of the magazine under the
headline "Here's Mud In Your Face".
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that Mahathir had uttered the defamatory words
with the knowledge that the words would be widely published in
Malaysia and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Karpal Singh claimed in a press statement that Anwar's move to
file the defamation suit against Mahathir for substantial damages
was necessary to clear his name because of the recent judgments
handed down by the courts relating to his alleged sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the court would fix an early date for the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year old Anwar was sacked as the deputy prime minister
and finance minister on September 2 last year and later charged
with five counts of committing corrupt practice and five counts
of sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is on trial on four of the charges in the High court
since November 2 last year. His on-going trial will resume on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Queensland Defers Decision on Bid for Expo 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australia's Queensland
state government was unlikely to push ahead with its Expo 2002 bid
unless the international body governing the event granted a number
of concessions, including staging it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The Queensland government Monday deferred for at least another
fortnight a decision on whether to resubmit its bid, with Premier
Peter Beattie flying to Paris late Monday to ask the Bureau of
International Expositions (BIE) for more "flexibility".
</P>
<P>
He hinted this "flexibility" would most likely be in areas such
as changes in the timing, site, and theme, and would not rule out
seeking to push the event back to 2003 because of time
constraints, Australian Associated Press reported from Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
The event was awarded to the Philippines over Queensland in the
middle of last year, but the Philippines recently withdrew due to
funding problems, leaving the way open for Queensland to resubmit
its bid.
</P>
<P>
But the government has now questioned the cost of staging the
three month event at Coomera, near the Gold Coast, after the
Treasury warned there was a predicted blowout of about 254 million
U.S. dollars on the original costing.
</P>
<P>
There are also concerns over the short remaining time.
</P>
<P>
"It is incredibly difficult for us to hold an Expo under the
timeline outlined in the (former Borbidge government) bid,"
Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to clarify what parameters there are, what flexibility
we have."
</P>
<P>
"If we can't get that flexibility then I'm going to have to go
back to the cabinet and say, without that level of flexibility, it
won't work."
</P>
<P>
Beattie said a decision was now not expected until he reported
back to the cabinet in two to three weeks.

</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at looking at air traffic communications,
navigation, radar systems and routing.
</P>
<P>
ICAO Asia Pacific regional officer John Richardson was quoted
by the Australian Associated Press as saying that contingency
plans already in place to handle cyclones, typhoons and severe
storms would cope with any problems created by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"Airplanes will be safe and we won't be having collisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Day more space would be allowed between each
take-off and landing and between planes in the air, but no extra
emergency crews would be posted at airports.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the contingency plans decided upon at the
meeting would prepare airlines for every possibility from the
failure of a single air traffic control system or the worst case
scenario - multiple system failures.
</P>
<P>
But he said it would be up to individual governments to decide
whether to ground aircraft in the case of any system failures.
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems with Y2K is its unknown quantity," he
said, "but if you get on an airplane, it will be safe to fly."
</P>
<P>
Airservices Australia Y2K project manager Keith Orkney said, in
Australia more than 200 aviation systems or components had been
identified as able to cause disruptions through millennium bug
non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 160 were still being tested, and the rest
were found to have no impact on safe air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
David Behrens, Asia/Pacific assistant director of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA), said
international aviation authorities had made good progress on the
Y2K problem since 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The unknowns are the third parties who have not yet come
forward with where their systems are with Y2K, such as
telecommunication carriers, commercial power suppliers, water
suppliers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Behrens said IATA has surveyed 2,000 airports and major
international carriers and it has invested 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars in conducting inventories of all parts and systems that
could be affected by the millennium bug.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Likely to Name Son as Crown Prince: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal
is expected to remove his brother Hassan Ibn Talal as heir to the
throne, and name his eldest son Abdullah Ibn Talal as the crown
prince, says the weekly Star on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Jordanian press organization
touchs upon the possible change in the heir to the throne, which
has been largely a taboo subject in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The royal court has neither denied nor confirmed reports about
the change.
</P>
<P>
The Star echoed reports by international new agencies that
Hussein, during a royal family meeting last week, informed Hassan
of his decision to remove him as crown prince and the choice of
Prince Abdullah Ibn Talal as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan has expressed his support to the king`s decision and his
constitutional choice, the Star said.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old monarch, expected to make a public speech on
the succession soon, has given strong signals about the possible
change of heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) last
Wednesday, one day after his return home from a six-month cancer
treatment in the United States, Hussein said his decision in 1965
to name Hassan as the crown prince was prompted by the fact that
"there was no substitute but to find a member of the family close
by to take over."
</P>
<P>
"But that did not mean at all that's the end of the story (of
succession)," Hussein said during the interview.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's remarks have sparked widespread speculations in Amman
that the king intends to revert to the initial constitutional
prevision prior to 1965, according to which his eldest son
Abdullah can inherit the throne.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who turns 37 on January 30, is Hussein's son from his
second marriage to British Tony Bardiner, who adopted the name of
Mona when she converted to Islam upon her marriage to the king in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is an army major general and in charge of a special
force that is responsible for the security of the royal court.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Phase of Bangladesh's River Dredging Project Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of dredging of
the Gorai river started Sunday in the southwestern part of
Bangladesh, said a press report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 kilometers from the junction of the river will be
de-silted through "capital dredging", according to the project
implementation schedule during 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to stimulate the river in a strategic
manner in order to use the river's own energy and enable it to cut
a channel during the following monsoon.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the work will also provide the necessary
data for designing a long-term solution for restoration of the
river and for qualifying the impact of fresh water flows during
the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the whole project is 2.24 billion taka (46.2
million dollars), which has been financed jointly by the
Netherlands, the World Bank, the Bangladeshi government and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the project is to remove the silt at the
mouth of the river through manual labor, and the first phase of
the dredging work started in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dredging carried out up to 8th kilometer from the mouth of the
river has already facilitated flow of water on an average depth of
eight meters.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the river-dredging projects to be undertaken by
the government with assistance from donor countries and
international agencies.

BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- An residential area in the
Iraqi southern city of al-Jumhuriya in Basra province was
attacked on Monday by U.S and British missiles at 9:30 a.m.
local time (6:30 GMT), the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a number of people, most of them women
and children, were killed or wounded and some houses were
distroyed in the residential areas by the attack, but no specific
figure was given.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iraqi rescue workers are busy searching
for survivors of the attack and the wounded were taken to
hospitals in the city.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses said that the missiles came from the direction
of Saudi Arabia, according to INA.
</P>
<P>
This is the first U.S.-British military strike on an Iraqi city
since they launched a four-night missile attack on Iraq in mid
December, killing hundreds of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, for
what the U.S. claimed the Iraqi refusal of cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British forces have been conducting sporadic strikes
on Iraqi military targets since December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British forces have also been enforcing no-fly
zones, created by the Western allies after the Gulf war on pretext
to protect the Shiite Muslims in the south and minority Kurdish
people in the north from the government military suppression.
</P>
<P>
Basra lies in the south where anti-government Shiite rebels
have been operating.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Statistics Accuracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reform its way
of statistics gathering to improve statistics accuracy, according
to the National Statistics Bureau (NBS).
</P>
<P>
This will include improving statistics assessment, expanding
coverage, and simplifying the reporting procedure, NBS Director
Liu Hong said today.
</P>
<P>
The NBS forms are gathered from lower level governments and
some local governments have taken advantage of this method to
make false reports, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Since statistics are used to asses government performance,
local officials sometimes tamper with the figures for personal or
departmental interest, said the director.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xianyu, chief statistician of the NBS, said that the
traditional gathering method proved successful under the planned
economy when nearly all firms were state-owned and their
production and sales were determined by the government.
</P>
<P>
But as more small, private firms emerge, this method is
showing its shortcomings because it doesn't cover every firm and
local officials can still tamper with the statistics.
</P>
<P>
So, the country plans to gradually use sample surveys and in
the next three years will conduct a survey of enterprises in a
third of the country's provinces, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
They will be industrial companies each with an annual sale
below five million yuan, and small and private wholesale,
retailing and food businesses, he added.

<P>
To prevent irregularities in data collecting, the NBS will get
17,000 large industrial firms each with an annual sales of more
than five million yuan to report monthly figures directly to the
NBS, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Another 5,000 major ones will link their computers with NBS
beginning June this year, Liu said, adding that the combined
assets of 5,000 enterprises are expected to account for 49
percent of the total of the country's industrial sector. The list
of these enterprises will be determined by March.
</P>
<P>
The NBS has also worked out detailed plans to get national and
provincial statistics bureaus to assess the quality of statistics
reports from lower down, with attention given to major figures
like GDP and industrial value-added and growth, retail of consum
er goods and population growth.
</P>
<P>
The NBS will also increase checks on statistics fraud, Liu
said, and those found guilty of providing fraudulent information
will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
China did a national exam of this information in 1997, which
uncovered 60,000 false reports.

BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- An residential area in the
Iraqi southern city of al-Jumhuriya in Basra province was
attacked on Monday by U.S and British missiles at 9:30 a.m.
local time (6:30 GMT), the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.

This is the first U.S.-British military strike on an Iraqi city

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Increase Investment in IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANAHEIM, California, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice
President Al Gore announced a plan Sunday to increase investment
in information technology during the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We are proposing an additional 366 million dollars, or 28
percent increase, in cutting-edge, job-creating information
technology research for the 21st century," Gore told an annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the increase will go to research universities.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also extended an existing
2.4-billion-dollar tax credit that otherwise would expire June 30.
</P>
<P>
"We will propose an extension of America's 2.4 billion dollar
Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. This tax credit means
more high-wage jobs for our families and continued American
economic leadership well into the 21st Century," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the two measures can help U.S.
scientists develop super-fast computers that can speak and
understand human language.
</P>
<P>
Information technology industry now accounts for one-third of
U.S. economic growth and employs 7.4 million Americans at wages
that are more than 60 percent higher than the private sector
average.
</P>
<P>
Gore said all sectors of the U.S. economy are using
information technology to compete and win in global markets, and
business-to-business electronic commerce in the U.S. alone is
projected to grow to 1.3 trillion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The vice president's proposals met with cheers and applause
from some 2,000 scientists at the annual meeting.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Criticizes Lawmakers Over Comments on Marcos Assets Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday accused the congressmen, who have been criticizing
the negotiations between the government and the Marcoses for the
wealth, of issuing statements on the issue just for "media
mileage."
</P>
<P>
In an interview, he advised the congressmen to keep their mouth
shut until the deal is forwarded to Congress for their approval.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the comments made by congressmen will be
meaningless until the government has concluded its out-of-court
settlement with the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen were reported drafting a resolution, asking
for a minimum of 98 percent government share on the ill-gotten
wealth.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded a public apology from the Marcoses for the
imposition of martial law in 1972 by the late president Ferdinand
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to this, Estrada said everybody is saying their own
respective pieces but he thinks all these opinions should be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government is still in the process of
negotiating the terms of the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Exports Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's National Coal Industry
Import-Export Corporation exported 29.25 million tons of coal in
1998, up 0.8 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Economic Times reports that the exports
accounted for 90 percent of China's coal exports and were worth
nearly a billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increased exports came at a rather difficult time, when
Japan, the Republic of Korea and other major coal importers have
cut imports because of the financial crisis. Exports have also
been affected by the low price of Indonesian and Australian coal,
related to currency devaluation, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
To increase coal exports, China made a great effort to improve
coal quality by installing better dust-removal equipment and in
improving its port and railway system.
</P>
<P>
The corporation also established links with coal production
and export bases with an annual output of 20 million tons, the
paper says.

nuisance."

The spokesman said ECOMOG troops are patrolling all areas
within and around the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere in Freetown, including the hills, the valleys and
even the sea, is under ECOMOG attention," he said, adding that the

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A trademark in China has been
named for a shop assistant at Shanghai's Hualian Shopping Center
on Nanjing Road.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhen, 36, who sells and repairs photographic equipment,
does market analysis, and develops film, got his expertise
through self-study and his services have drawn a steady stream of
customers.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that this is the outcome of the economic
reforms, which have greatly increased consciousness of the need
for product and service quality. Over the past few decades, under
the planned economy, businesses didn't care much about the market
because production and sales were both controlled by the
government.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Hualian's sales of photographic
equipment grew at an average increase of 30 percent annually to
15 million yuan (1.8 million US dollars) last year. Hualian
registered the trademark at the end of last year to further
promote its business and agreed to pay Wang Zhen a certain amount
of money each year for the use of his name.

FUZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese scholars are
saying that a more comprehensive sex education for Chinese
teenagers is urgently needed.

<P>
According to Cheng Liguo, an associate professor at Fujian
Provincial Normal University, an education in human physiology,
psychology, and ethics is an important part of cultivating the
personality,
</P>
<P>
Cheng says that the sex education materials now used in middle
school textbooks fall far short of what is needed by the younger
generation who have entered a much more mature period than their
predecessors, physically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
Some middle schools have left the job of sex education to
physical education, biology, or political science teachers who
are themselves sometimes puzzled by the material. Even some
university students who are majoring in medicine have sex-related
psychological problems themselves, according to Lin Daxi, a
professor at Fujian Provincial Medical College.

a result of environmental protection measures adopted by the
local government, including a ban on fertilizers and lumbering in
areas close to the natural habitat of the rare species.

<P>
Trees have been planted on 46,700 ha, with the forest coverage
climbing from 40 percent to 60 percent over the past 18 years.
The closure of polluting factories has also improved

<HEADLINE> Low Wages For Translation Work Means Lower Quality Translations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- In a two-hour college
lecture a professor can earn 500 yuan (about 62 U.S. dollars) but
less than a fifth of that amount would be paid for a
1,000-character translation into a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Many college graduates of foreign language departments have
chosen high-paying jobs in business rather than low-paying
translation work, explains Qian Shaochang, a professor at
Shanghai International Studies University.
</P>
<P>
This has in turn become a vicious circle of lower translation
fees attracting fewer young people and the shortage of
professionally-trained translators resulting in lower translation
quality, and so on.
</P>
<P>
But, says Cao Ying, a translator with a good reputation in
translating Russian literary works into Chinese, translation is
the key to introducing Chinese culture to foreigners, and one
major difficulty he and his colleagues face is the shortage of
professionals and translating Chinese is extremely difficult and
time-consuming work.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qian says that a person needs to be perfectly clear
in introducing Chinese culture to foreigners or it will be
nonsense and gave an example he came across at the Shanghai TV
Festival last year. To help foreign judges understand one movie,
"Midnight Bus", English subtitles were added, but Qian found,
they were a complete mess.

<P>
HANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Eagle Island, with its
colorful rock formations and unique shapes that was recently
discovered off the southern tip of east China's Zhejiang
Province, will be opened to tourists in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The 250-meter by 200-meter island resembles the shape of an
eagle in flight and has red, yellow, green, blue and black rock
formation shaped like waterfalls, castles, dolphins, and other
fish.
</P>
<P>
A according to a recent study by geology and mining
departments, the island's formations contain iron and copper,
possibly the result of movements in the earth's crust hundreds of
millions of years ago. The copper, iron, barium, and other
minerals in the molten lava from volcanic eruptions were then
turned into a special type of volcanic rock at the extremely high
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Today, the local government has drafted a plan to develop
infrastructure needed to transform the island into a tourist
destination.

<HEADLINE> 54,000 Families in Northern Zimbabwe Threatened by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 54,000 families in
Guruve District in northern Zimbabwe are facing starvation because
the Department of Social Welfare does not have transport to ferry
maize allocated to the villagers under the Grain Loan Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The hunger-stricken villagers applied for the maize in
September last year and had their applications approved the
Ministry of Local Government and National Housing early this
month.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Department of Social Welfare, which distributes
the maize under the scheme, has failed to secure vehicles to
deliver maize, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday last week, no maize had been ferried to the
villagers, forcing most of them, especially those from the Dande
communal lands, to scrounge for wild fruits and edible roots.
</P>
<P>
Some of the roots require experienced elderly women to prepare
them well. They have to be boiled several times before they can be
safe for consumption.
</P>
<P>
Irked by the situation, Mashonaland Central Governor Border
Gezi toured the district together with Deputy Minister of Mines,
Environment and Tourism Edward Chindori-Chininga last week. He
accused the Department of Social Welfare and the Central
Mechanical Equipment Department of being " insensitive" to the
plight of the starving villagers.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot run a province where people starve because we cannot
transport maize which is readily available. We fought hard to have
the maize processed quickly and save people from starvation and
some insensitive government employees simply fail to coordinate,"
said the governor.

<HEADLINE> Competition Intensifying In China's Paper Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's paper industry is
having to face falling output and profits and mounting losses
because of increased competition.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 28.12 million tons of paper products in 1995,
ranking third in the world in output. The country now consumes
around 34 million tons of paper products annually, the world's
third biggest consumer, according to Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in imports in recent years and investment
from Southeast Asia and coastal areas since 1995 have posed a
threat to domestic papermakers and dumping by some countries and
price cutting by domestic dealers have also increased market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The industry faces further problems like a shortage of
comparatively high-quality paper made from pulp because China's
forest coverage is as low as 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The very large number of technically backward small papermills
is another problem, one that leads to the waste of raw materials
and serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that technical upgrading, expanded production,
and more technically-competitive enterprises are needed.

NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Two thousand and four hundred
ethnic Somali refugees from Ethiopia now accommodated at Daadab
refugee camp in Garissa, North Eastern Province of Kenya, have
asked the U.N. to send them back to their country.

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open more light
industrial sectors to foreign investors, according to Sunday's
Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes foreign investment in many light industries,
including the papermaking, silicate, daily-use chemicals, food
and beverage, salt, tanning and leather processing, stationery,
plastic products, hardware, household electric appliances,
furniture, and general-purpose arts and crafts sectors, according
to the State Administration of the Light Industry (SALI).
</P>
<P>
China will maintain strict control over the establishment of
joint ventures producing Maotai (a famous Chinese liquor) and
traditional name-brand yellow rice wine, as well as special
paper, Chinese ink, and special porcelain and lacquerware.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 overseas-funded companies in China's light
industry involve overseas investments of 35 billion US dollars,
or 14 percent of the country's total overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have flowed into many light industries such as
the food and beverage, household electric appliances, plastic

</P>
<P>
While Chinese researchers have discovered a large number of
natural chemical compounds and synthesized chemical compounds,
the lack of new medicine screening institutes has greatly

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
president Bill Hybl said the six expulsions from the
International Olympic Committee was a "good start", but warned
more will have to be done to restore credibility to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We will say there is more to be done. We don't think this
will be gone tomorrow," he said at a news conference hours after
the IOC announced its decision.
</P>
<P>
Besides the expulsions, a third member of the IOC resigned and
three others remained under investigation. Another member
received a warning.
</P>
<P>
Hybl said the action proved "that the International Olympic
Committee is taking this very seriously." He said the IOC "have
done a very good job in moving the process forward."
</P>
<P>
But Hybl said it was only the first step done by the IOC. "It
will certainly take substantial change to restore confidence and
credibility to the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy to learn the IOC will form an ethics
commission and continue the corruption probes in other cities.
</P>
<P>
"When they go to their March meeting they will be addressing a
whole series of issues. A series of issues that can make the
Olympic Movement stronger."
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal that more athletes taking part in the
Olympic bidding decision-making process will be a good policy.

<HEADLINE> World Wool Production to Hit 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Wool production in the
world this year will hit its lowest levels since the 1960s, a
Wellington-based newspaper quoted the International Wool Textile
Organization as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion said the wool production in New Zealand this
season
is forecast to be just 186,000 tons, down 5.6 percent on last
season
and 33 percent below the peak production of 277,000 tons in
1984-1985.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted President Peter Crone of the New Zealand Wool
Exporters Council as saying demand for wool has slumped to the
lowest
level in recent memory as the Asian economic crisis reaches
European
markets.
</P>
<P>
Optimism prevalent in the world textile trade in the last
quarter
of 1998 has vanished, reflecting "the growing recession in the
European textile business," Crone said.
</P>
<P>
"Many British mills, big buyers of New Zealand carpet wools in
the
last two seasons, are facing financial difficulty," he said. "In
Continental Europe, several of the big spinners and topmakers that

buy our fine wools are working reduced hours."
</P>
<P>
Crone said the wool industry is already under a cloud of gloom,

with prices falling sharply last year. But the New Zealand Wool
Exporters Council, he added, does not expect prices to go much
lower
as the world commodity index appears to have bottomed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are some facts and
figures about the educational development in the Tibet Autonomous
Region:
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has introduced boarding schools to the
rural and pastoral areas in Tibet, where Tibetan primary and
middle school students enjoy free food, clothing and
accommodation. Stipend and scholarship systems have been put in
place step by step in primary and middle schools above the town
level.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "giving priority to people of local ethnic
groups" has been adopted by all schools while recruiting students
in Tibet, and a flexible enrollment method adopted in dealing
with examinees of Tibetan and other ethnic minorities origin,
whereby "the pass marks for admission are appropriately lowered
and students are chosen on the basis of their test results."
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 810 regular and 3,314 village-run primary
schools had been established in Tibet, with a total enrollment of
310,220 students. At the end of 1998, 81.3 percent of school-age
children were in school, a 35.7 percentage points increase over
1991.
</P>
<P>
There are 90 middle schools in Tibet with 38,413 students,
16,111 more than in 1991. There are also four institutions of
higher learning and 16 special secondary schools in Tibet. The
illiteracy rate among the young and middle-aged has dropped by 41
percentage points as compared with the figure before the peaceful
liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1997 schools with a total floor space of 580,000
sq m were built in Tibet, including 27 middle schools, 278
regular township primary schools and 1,359 village-run primary
schools, and a total of over 300,000 sq m of old school buildings
renovated.

<P>
In 1997, government investment in education in Tibet accounted
for 18 percent equally of the budgeted expenditure and budgeted
capital construction investment. These facts are in strong
contrast to the situation in Tibet before peaceful liberation,
when only a small number of monk officials and children of the
nobility had the privilege of studying and less than two percent
of the school-age children went to school, with education denied
to the masses of serfs and slaves.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, to make it easier for middle school
students from Tibet to study in other parts of China, the Central
Government has appropriated special funds to set up Tibetan
junior middle-school classes in some of the provinces and
municipalities in the hinterland and one Tibetan middle school
each in the cities of Beijing, Tianjin and Chengdu.
Transportation, food and boarding, clothing and medical care
expenses of the Tibetan students in those schools are covered by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has allocated a special capital
construction fund totaling 73 million yuan and relevant provinces
and municipalities have appropriated necessary funds amounting to
well over 100 million yuan for running those Tibetan classes and
schools in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Central Government has appropriated an annual
six million yuan and relevant provinces and municipalities have
set aside a special fund from their budgets to cover the study
and living expenses of the Tibetan students in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1997 a total of 18,000 Tibetan students had
studied in all these Tibetan classes and schools, of whom more
than 5,000 have graduated from secondary technical schools,
colleges and universities and returned to Tibet to take part in
the development of the Region. At present, there are 13,000
Tibetan students studying in more than 100 schools in 26 inland
provinces and municipalities.

DHAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh failed to attain its
targeted export volume in last year's July-October period due to
the unprecedented flood, The Independent daily newspaper reported
Monday.

Ratchathani Province on Sunday that he had asked Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda to work closely with Bank of Thailand
Governor Chatumongol Sonakul to ease debt restructuring deadlocks.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that both Tarrin and Chatumongol would find a

</P>
<P>
Debt restructuring problems and the liquidity shortage were the
most important obstacles Thailand is facing.
</P>
<P>
Debt restructuring sub-committees, which have been set up in
every province by the cabinet, cannot settle the problem because
of a lack of understanding, insufficient authority and the
committees' over-staffing.
</P>
<P>
In the two-day meeting, rural businessmen raised the
continuing major issue of liquidity shortage, which was still
slowing their businesses. They commented that although the Finance
Ministry has implemented both monetary and financial measures,
commercial banks still have strict lending policies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Chamber of Commerce has submitted to Chuan a private
sector proposal for solving urgent problems.
</P>
<P>
The proposal focused on five business areas including the
competitiveness and efficiency of Thai agricultural and industrial
goods, small- and medium-sized enterprises, economic cooperation
with neighboring countries and the role of the Public and Private
Consultative Committee to ease the economic crisis.

<P>
Chuan would forward the proposal to the cabinet soon.
</P>
<P>
However, Chuan said he was still worried about the agricultural
sector, which has seen serious over-supply and reductions in
price.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet recently approved a 300-billion-baht (8.1 billion
US dollars) intervention program.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he has approved the Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry's agricultural restructuring plan, which
would increase productivity and efficiency at farms.
</P>
<P>
He said important economic indicators, including the current
account deficit, inflation and exports -- which are reported by
the National Economic Social and Development Board, Thailand
Development Research Institute and Bank of Thailand -- have shown
good signs of recovery. Thailand should begin recovery by the end
of this year, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Better Protects Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of thefts and fires
threatening cultural relics decreased considerably last year
thanks to close co-operation between cultural protection
departments and police and fire-control offices, a cultural
heritage administration official said on today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Only 52 thefts of cultural relics were reported last year,
less than half of the number in 1997, Liu Qifu, an official with
the Library Department of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage, said.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 15 have already been solved, Liu said, and in
another four cases the thieves were caught in the act, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The criminals will be punished according to the Cultural
Relics Protection Law, the revised Criminal Law of China, and
regulations issued by the National People's Congress in 1991 to
crack down on relics thefts.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to recuperate all the
relics and return them to where they belong," Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Many of the stolen relics have been smuggled out of the
country, and co-operation with foreign authorities and police is
needed to get those objects back, it reported.
</P>
<P>
Stone sculptures are the biggest targets of thefts, according
to Liu. Indeed, sculptures are usually kept in the open and eas
ier to steal.
</P>
<P>
Thefts of stone monuments occurred in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan
and Fujian provinces, where several sites of stone sculptures
have been discovered over the years.
</P>
<P>
While relics thefts have witnessed a sharp decline in number,
the violence involved in such cases as well as the damages done
are much greater than before, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Team Formed in Indonesia to Select Parties for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Home Affairs
Minister Syarwan Hamid has set up an independent team to decide
which of the country's 120 new political parties will be eligible
to participate in the June 7 polls, The Indonesian Observer
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The team includes intellectuals, student activists and
representatives of non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The team has strong integrity because its members consist of
representatives from all sectors of society, although it won't
make everyone happy," said team member Andi Mallarangeng, who is
also a member of the Home Affairs Ministry's team that drafted
political bills now under the parliament's deliberation.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft political bills, parties could contest
the polls if they have chapters in nine of the country's 27
provinces, and branches in at least half of the 243 regencies.
</P>
<P>
Culling the number of parties will start by examining which of
them fulfill criteria set by the government and the selection team
is not expected to act in the interests of the government.
</P>
<P>
"The most important task of the team is to select parties able
to take part in the next election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The team, formed by Hamid in his capacity as chairman of the
General Election Institution, will oversee the formation of a
general election committee, which will be tasked to organize
administrative details of the election.
</P>
<P>
Hamid in the past has said the election should ideally be
contested by no more than seven parties, which could lead to a
spate of mergers and coalitions between the country's new parties
before polling day.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will
take a package of measures this year to reverse the worsening of
environmental pollution and ecosystem deterioration in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Agency, as saying that attempts to halt
air and water pollution and defend the ecosystem require strict
law enforcement and support from all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xie affirmed that 1999 will be a "pivotal time" for China to
fulfill its mission to protect the environment -- a cause
directly linked to the future and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that to cure atmospheric pollution, the policy
of "total control" of sulfur dioxide in cities will be strictly
carried out. The goal is to ensure that the country's controlled
zones of acid rain and sulfur dioxide will not spread by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
To reduce water pollutants, Xie said, concrete measures
covering the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers, the Taihu, Chaohu
and Dianchi lakes and the Bohai Sea, will be taken.
</P>
<P>
Xie promised to carry out better scientific research and
promote environmental-related industries to ensure that
environmental workers have effective tools to eliminate
pollutants and protect the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The rules governing the punishment of pollutant producers will
be revised this year, he added.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's North Western
Provincial Council (NWPC) poll, scheduled to be held Monday, has
been estimated to cost 20 million rupees (294,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the Elections Department cannot guarantee that it will not
cost even more, the newspaper The Island reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said most of the money is likely to be spent in
Kurunegala District which is larger than Puttalam District. The
two districts together make up the province.
</P>
<P>
In its budget for this year the government has allocated 570
million rupees (8.38 million dollars) to the Elections Department.
</P>
<P>
Elections for five more provincial councils are expected to be
held this year. The estimates for these elections are likely to
vary and may be more than that estimated for the NWPC elections,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Elections Department sources were quoted as saying the
parliamentary and presidential polls in 1994 cost a staggering 691
million rupees (10.15 million dollars), with 358 million rupees
(5.26 million dollars) being spent on the parliamentary poll and
333 million rupees (4.89 million dollars) on the presidential
election.

BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A cataract operation project
has helped more than 2,000 blind residents in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, the area with the highest incidence of
cataract in China.
</P>
<P>
The Regaining Eyesight Project initiated by the Tibet De
velopment Fund (TDF) has raised 12 million yuan (1.45 million US
dollars) to provide free operations for residents in Tibet's
major cities and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in neighboring
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in Tibet. Yet the
incidence has not been brought under control because most of the
victims could not afford surgery by professional doctors, today's
China Daily quoted a TDF spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The TDF, jointing hands with the local government, has sent
several medical teams to rural areas throughout Tibet to perform
free operations.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of ophthalmological equipment, including
operation microscopes and artificial intraocular lenses which
valued at 800,000 yuan, were donated to local hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military, Civilians Discuss Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's top military brass
and leading civilians held a meeting late Sunday to discuss the
latest situation in the country, which was last week marred by
five days of riots in the city of Ambon, capital of Maluku
Province.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense and Security/Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander
Gen. Wiranto said after the meeting here that the riots in Ambon
had a similar pattern to other communal clashes.
</P>
<P>
The riots were the worst since those that took place in Jakarta
in May last year. Official reports put the death toll of the Ambon
riots at 50.
</P>
<P>
"The Ambon case is part of a series of other such incidents,
like those which occurred in Kupang (capital of East Nusa Tenggara
province) and Java," Wiranto was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said that in the country's history there had been no
record of clashes over religious differences.
</P>
<P>
The recent incidents, he said, "show that our nation's
brotherhood was highly threatened and under a serious test."
</P>
<P>
Those attending the meeting included Chief of Territorial
Affairs Lt. Gen. Bambang Susilo Yudhoyoni, renowned scholar
Nurcholish Madjid, activist Sugent Saryadi, Yogyakarta governor
Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, leader of the Muslim organization
Nahdlatul Ulama Abdurrahman Wahid, chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI Perjuangan) Megawati Soekarnoputri, chairman
of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais and businessman Setiawan
Djody.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, "held to strengthen brotherly ties," Wiranto
said, participants agreed to help avoid disintegration.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that all this unrest should be stopped and the
leaders agreed to help security personnel to that end. We also
agreed that (the riots) would be thoroughly investigated."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 50 people suspected of being
provocateurs in the Ambon riots have been detained by security
forces. The ABRI has started to confiscate weapons and other
potentially dangerous objects owned by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Amien Rais said he requested that Wiranto arrest all the
"intellectual actors" behind the riots, which were "well
organized, sophisticated, well planned and well financed," as
demonstrated by their ability to spread "chaos from Sabang to
Merauke," referring to the western and eastern tips of the
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The riots, he said, were "all an effort to foil the elections
(in June) and the ongoing investigation into (former president)
Soeharto."

<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's tourism industry sees
good prospects this year since the government is planning to open
more border entry points for tourists coming over from neighboring
countries, said a local journal in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The Advertisement and Procurement Guide journal cited nine
entry points along the border in five states and divisions to be
added, through which overseas tourists will be allowed to visit
the country's inland areas far up to the capital and leave from
any point.
</P>
<P>
The nine entry points are Lwejei, Muse, Chinshwehaw, Mongla,
Tachilek, Myawaddy, Phaya Thonzu, Kalein Aung and Kawthaung in
Kachin, Shan, Kayin, Mon and Tanintharyi states and divisions
respectively.

JERUSALEM -- Announcing his decision to leave the ruling
Likud party and join a centrist party, outgoing Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday the policy of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed and he has to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
He made the widely-expected announcement at a nation-wide
broadcast news conference in Tel Aviv, at the same hotel where
Netanyahu announced the removal of the defense minister from his
post Saturday night over alleged disloyalty to the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he joined the Likud in 1996 in a hope that
Netanyahu would bring Israel peace and security as he had
promised in the elections, but was disappointed that the prime
minister ran away from the line and was controlled by extremist
groups. (Israel-Mordechai)

Arab countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the offer, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who was here for the ongoing
Arab foreign ministers' meeting, said "what does he (Aziz) want
us to apologize for?"
</P>

It is Iraq not Kuwait that should make apology since Kuwait

<HEADLINE> Less Foreign Investment Flows Into Myanmar in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 250 million U.S.
dollars in foreign investment was made in Myanmar in 1998,
accounting for only 20 and 10.86 percent of the figures in 1997
and 1996, according to the local Advertisement and Procurement
Guide journal.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, no foreign investment was injected into the sectors of
agriculture, construction, transport and communications, real
estate and industrial estate, it said.
</P>
<P>
Even the hotels and tourism sector, which was most attractive
in the past, received only one foreign investment project, the
journal added.
</P>
<P>
During the year, a major amount of foreign investment was put
into the manufacturing sector, accounting for 68 percent or about
170 million dollars of the total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 170 million dollars, 140 million dollars came from
the Philippines, the largest investor in the year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, which stood as the second largest investor with 44
million dollars, was engaged in one project each in manufacturing
and hotels and tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment was 1.25 billion and 2.3 billion dollars
respectively in 1996 and 1997, according to the journal.
</P>
<P>
The fall in foreign investment in 1998 is seen as partly due to
the prolonged Asian financial crisis which broke out in July 1997,
leading to the close-down of at least 65 companies, including 26
foreign-funded ones mainly from Republic of Korea, Singapore,
Japan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in Myanmar
up to the end of 1998 since late 1988 totaled 7.1 billion dollars
in 303 projects.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief on Military Build-up in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military build-up in the
Adriatic Sea is a signal of its determination to reach a
political agreement on the Kosovo crisis, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana said here on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini, Solana said NATO is continuing its own
preparations in support of a political and diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the naval and air forces dispatched to the
Adriatic are aimed at finding "a political accord which will
work" and "a solution to the Kosovo crisis".
</P>
<P>
Beginning on January 20, NATO moved naval forces to the lower
Adriatic following a show of intransigence by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic over the Kosovo crisis, deepened by the recent
alleged massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serb forces in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Dini said after his talks with Solana that he could not rule
out sending in ground troops to take up a position along the
Albanian border with the Serbian province, "if there were a
specific request from Albanian authorities".
</P>
<P>
"In this case, I think the international community, which is
committed to stability in the region, should take this into
consideration," he added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary general came to Rome on Sunday evening from
Moscow and is scheduled to confer Monday with Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Solana and D'Alema are likely to take an in-depth look at
NATO's new strategic concept in view of the fiftieth anniversary
summit to be held in Washington in April.

<HEADLINE> Zhang Cites Broad Prospects for Sino-Russian Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang
Deguang said that this year will be an extremely important year
for the development of Sino-Russian relations, with Premier Zhu
Rongji set to visit Russia next month and a possible meeting betw
een the two heads of state later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu and his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov are
expected to hold the fourth regular meeting between the prime
ministers of the two countries during the former's visit to
Russia, said Zhang in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Zhang will leave for Moscow later today to attend the second
session of Sino-Russian Committee for Friendship, Peace and
Development established in 1997 during the summit between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The major tasks of the committee include regularly assessing
Sino-Russian relations and various government proposals
concerning bilateral ties. The committee is also responsible for
coordinating exchanges between nongovernmental organizations in
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that Chinese and Russian committee members
committee come from all walks of life. The committee sponsors a
variety of bilateral exchanges, including academic symposiums,
cultural and art festivals, exhibitions, movie festivals and
publications to introduce the latest situations in the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Zhang Cites Broad Prospects for Sino-Russian Ties (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang noted smooth development of Sino-Russian relations in
various fields in recent years. For example, President Jiang
Zemin and President Yeltsin held their sixth summit in Moscow
last November and the two sides signed six joint statements. The
two countries have completed the demarcation of eastern and
western borders, and agreed to continue talks to settle issues
involving remaining disputed areas.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China, Russia and three central Asian nations
have signed agreements on increasing military trust and
disarmament in border areas is of major significance for
maintaining regional peace and stability, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are building a cooperative strategic
partnership quite different from allied ties between China and
the Soviet Union in the 1950s and from ties between the major
powers during the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
The nonaligned partnership between China and Russia is based
on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is not
directed at any third country, said Zhang, adding that
establishment of the partnership will promote world peace and
balanced development of the international pattern.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed a level of dissatisfaction with current
Sino-Russian economic cooperation, noting the fact that last
year's bilateral trade volume was only five billion US dollars
"fails to match the potential which exists for cooperation
between the large neighboring countries".
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two countries should expand economic
links in accordance with market rules. Zhang stressed that China
and Russia could enhance bilateral cooperation in the economy and
technology, including high-tech and new technology, and could at
the same time increase mutual investments to explore new areas
for the growth of bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his conviction that joint efforts will further
promote economic and trade ties between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The vice-foreign minister concluded that the healthy
development of Sino-Russian ties will play an important and
positive role in promoting multi-polarization and establishing a
just and rational international political and economic order.

<HEADLINE> Private Enterprises Boom in East Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Private enterprises in Ningbo,
a coastal city in east China's Zhejiang Province, contributed a
combined industrial value of 101.1 billion yuan in 1998, up 26.4
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for more than half of the total industrial
value for the city's township enterprises, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
A modern enterprise system has now been introduced to more
private enterprises in the city and many are issuing shares to
sharpen their competitive edge on the market, officials said.
</P>
<P>
By the end last year, the city had established more than 40
private enterprise groups, with about half of them each producing
more than 100 million yuan worth of goods annually, with nine
listed on China's top 500 private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo has also cultivated a batch of products with village's
or township's features, such as Xinpu's copper products and
Xushan's textile.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Factions Form Unified Military Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan anti-Taliban
factions have formed a unified military council to go for a
full-scale war against the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Named as the supreme military council, it includes former
Mujahideen factions of the Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat, Hezb-i-Islami of
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and Ittehad-e-Islami of Profe Sayyaf, sources
in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not known if ethnic Uzbek warlord Rashid
Dostum's Jumbash-e-Milli was part of the new anti-Taliban group,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Former Afghan Defense Minister and arch rival of the Taliban
Ahmad Shah Masood said the decision about the ganging up against
the Taliban was taken at a meeting in his stronghold of Punjshir
to the north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the causes which led to the loss of territory
from our hands and felt the need for a unified command," Masood,
who has been nominated as the supreme commander of the new
council, was quoted as saying by Radio Tehran recently.
</P>
<P>
He also said the opposition forces would launch a full-scale
war against the Taliban soon after the winter.
</P>
<P>
A similar northern alliance of the opposition forces
spearheaded by Masood had fallen apart due to distrust among many
of its factions when the Taliban moved to take much of northern
Afghanistan, forcing Dostum to flee to the neighboring Uzbekistan.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney's tarnished bid for the 2000 Olympics was facing the
prospect of an investigation Sunday night, although International
Olympic Committee chiefs were expected to resist calls for
Australia to be stripped of the right to stage the games.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney's Olympic officials are fighting to head off an
inquiry into how Sydney won the right to hold the games as the
International Olympic Committee prepares to expel at least six
members over a growing corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Opponents of a republic run the risk of having a more
radical model imposed on them in the future if a republic is
rejected at this year's referendum, the founder of a high-powered
conservative republican group launched Sunday has warned.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's 9 billion dollars (5.67 billion U.S. dollars)
coal export industry is showing remarkable resilience in bleak
times. A slump in export contract prices has seen it shunned by
the investment community but within the industry there is
surprising optimism.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Liver Cancer Patients Given New Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man who had an
advanced form of liver cancer recently became China's first
recipient of chemotherapy treatment for the disease, in Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The man is now in stable condition and can take solid foods,
after an 8-hour operation performed by a surgeon at the city's
Xiangya Hospital and a Japanese doctor from Kobe University.
</P>
<P>
They used a special tube inserted into the liver through a
vein entered at a small cut in the groin and another tube into an
artery near the cancerous lump for the chemical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese doctor says that the therapy is especially
effective on patients whose cancer is at a middle or late stage,
who perhaps couldn't survive a tumor removal, the traditional
treatment. Clinical studies of the chemotherapy show a 60 percent
inhibitory rate in malignant liver tumors.
</P>
<P>
Liver cancer is regarded by some researchers as a "King of
Cancers" because of its high death rate. Some 110,000 people in
China get the disease every year and fewer than 30 percent are
diagnosed at an early stage because of a lack of clear symptoms.

MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government is seeking revisions in the
proposed fiscal program with the International Monetary Fund to
reflect a higher level of capital outlay than earlier planned and
make way for additional "economic pump-priming."
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine Airlines may get a portion of the country's
1.4-billion-U.S. dollar new borrowings from Japan's
30-billion-dollar Miyazawa plan, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaya:

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textile Producers Face New Opportunity at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China will rely more on
domestic sources for clothing materials this year to reduce its
dependence on imported fibers, the State Administration of
Textile Industry's China Textile News reports.
</P>
<P>
It says that the State Economic and Trade Commission plans to
cut a billion U.S. dollars worth of imported fibers this year, a
tenth of the country's fiber imports to help domestic fiber
suppliers add one percentage point to their sales.
</P>
<P>
This will mean an increase in domestic fiber sales of 1.6
billion meters and returns of 5.4 billion yuan (650.6 million
U.S. dollars). Chinese analysts say manufacturers need to
increase efforts to improve design, reduce shrinkage, and monitor
new fashion trend.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also says that profit margins in the garment
business are as low as 2.46 percent, and 24 percent of the
enterprises are running in red. And because of a price increase
in raw materials and in production costs, textiles of mediocre
quality are oversupplied.

HEFEI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, an agricultural
giant in east China, turned out 63.99 billion yuan worth of grain
crops in 1998, up 2.3 percent from the previous year.

<P>
According to statistics from the Provincial Agricultural
Department, per capita annual income for farmers in the province
increased by 2.8 percent from 1997 to 1,860 yuan.

Last year, the acreage of high-yield grain crops increased by
two million mu (15 mu equals one hectare) last year; the
prevention of insect pests saved 1.5 billion kilograms of grain

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Claim Lewinsky Helpful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors
brushed off Democratic fury and interviewed Monica Lewinsky,
former White House intern, on Sunday, a move that triggered fresh
partisan convulsions in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Following an interview of nearly two hours here, all three
prosecutors said the session was productive.
</P>
<P>
"I believe she would be a witness that would help them
determine the truth," said lawmaker Asa Hutchinson. Bill McCollum,
another lawmaker, said Lewinsky "might be a very helpful witness
to the Senate if called."
</P>
<P>
The House impeachment prosecutors were followed to the podium
in front of Washington's Mayflower Hotel by Lewinsky attorney
Plato Cacheris.
</P>
<P>
Cacheris, said his client "was candid, forthright and extremely
truthful" and "added nothing to the record that is already sitting
before the Senate right now."
</P>
<P>
He urged the prosecutors to tell their colleagues that it is
unnecessary to call Lewinsky as a witness, so that her "long
nightmare'' could come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The House prosecutors were set to meet Monday, the deadline for
submitting a witness list to the Senate. Senators then will debate
whether to call witnesses before taking two votes: first on a
motion to dismiss the case and then on the decision to take
depositions of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Three Republican senators said they want a swift end to the
case and two of them expressed hope for a conclusion this week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. At the moment, no one believes
there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Market to Take Favorable Turn: Council Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The world gold market is
bound to take a turn for the better as the tide of large-scale
gold selling brought about by the Asian financial crisis has
ended, according to a senior official of the World Gold Council.
</P>
<P>
Western investors now have more interest in gold; the central
banks shave adopted the right policy toward the slumping gold
market; and Asia's economy shows signs of recovery, said Kerr
Cruikshanks, president of council's Far East region, said
recently at a gold-promotion event in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The world demand for gold decreased at the end of 1997 and the
beginning of 1998, and this drop reached 46 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 on a yearly basis, but was only five percent and
nearly two percent in the second and third quarters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of last year, the world's total
demand for gold fell by 418 tons from the same 1997 period, but
in the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand that drop was
489 tons.
</P>
<P>
Cruikshanks said that China's gold market has been only
slightly influenced by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1998, China's gold demand exceeded 200 tons
annually, and this demand decreased by only nine percent in the
first three quarters of 1998. Moreover, the Chinese government
placed the opening of the gold market on its agenda to stimulate
demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Gold Council program calls for intensified
efforts to push forward reform of the gold market and encourage
the sale of gold.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Concerned with Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers issued a
communique at the conclusion of their meeting Sunday to express
alarm and worry over the use of force against Iraq which
victimized Iraqi innocents.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique of their day-long meeting here, the
ministers called for diplomatic means in carrying out the United
Nations Security Council resolutions related to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the communique fell short of Iraq's demand to condemn the
four-day U.S.-British air campaign against Iraq in mid-December
and to denounce and break the crippling U.N. economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab ministers called on the Iraqi government to
cooperate with the U.N. Security Council in implementing the
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Arab ministers voiced support for Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity and rejection of any intervention in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
They expressed solidarity with the Iraqi people in efforts to
end their sufferings, calling for international efforts to help
lift the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions will not be lifted until the U.N. arms
inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the Arab foreign ministers rejected Iraq's
recent belligerent stands, which they said offend the principles
of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
They asked the Iraqi government to take necessary steps to
prove good intentions towards Kuwait and other neighboring states
in deeds and words.
</P>
<P>
The ministers convened the meeting in a bid to reach a unified
Arab stance on Iraq following the U.S.-British attack. But they
failed to attain the goal as Iraq disagreed to the communique and
withdrew from the meeting in protest.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf walked out of
the meeting Sunday evening to protest the failure of the
communique to condemn the U.S. and British for their attack.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions of the wording of the communique,
al-Sahhaf called for the attacks to be denounced as "aggression on
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, however, insisted that Iraq's demand be conditional on
official and public apology for its 1990 invasion of the Gulf
sheikdom and a final recognition of the borders between the two
countries.

JERUSALEM -- Announcing his decision to leave the ruling Likud
party and join a centrist party, outgoing Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday the policy of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has failed and he has to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
He made the widely-expected announcement at a nation-wide
broadcast news conference in Tel Aviv, at the same hotel where
Netanyahu announced the removal of the defense minister from his
post Saturday night over alleged disloyalty to the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he joined the Likud in 1996 in a hope that
Netanyahu would bring Israel peace and security as he had
promised in the elections, but was disappointed that the prime
minister ran away from the line and was controlled by extremist
groups.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two and a half years, Mordechai said, the
security situation in Israel has deteriorated. Peace talks with
the Palestinians have stalled and the relations with Arab
neighbors worsened, he said. (1st LD Writethru Israel-Mordechai)

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Interview Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors
brushed off Democratic fury and interviewed Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, informally Sunday -- a sudden turn in
President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial that triggered new
partisan convulsions and led to a barrage of efforts to end the
case.
</P>
<P>
"We would be derelict in our duty... if we didn't talk to her,"
said Republican lawmaker William McCollum, one of the 13 House
prosecutors presenting the case for Clinton's removal from office
to the Senate. "We've never even met her."
</P>
<P>
Three House prosecutors, lawmakers Asa Hutchinson, Ed Bryant
and McCollum arrived in midafternoon at Washington's stately
Mayflower Hotel. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, came earlier.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The House prosecutors said they wanted to ask substantive
questions of Lewinsky about her relationship with Clinton.
McCollum said he wanted to question her about "her current state
of mind on the grand jury testimony that she gave." In that
testimony, the former intern said Clinton never asked her to lie
about their affair.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered
Lewinsky to submit to an interview with prosecutor Kenneth Starr
to assist the Senate impeachment trial against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Johnson ruled that House prosecutors had no right under
Lewinsky's immunity deal with Starr to force her to submit to
their questioning. But Johnson ruled that Starr could force
Lewinsky to answer questions from his staff and allow the House
prosecutors to attend.
</P>
<P>
The House has urged the Senate to allow witnesses in Clinton's
impeachment trial, a controversial issue that could be fought out
next week along sharp partisan lines. Most Republicans have backed
the call for witnesses and virtually all Democrats have opposed
live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. At the moment, no one believes
there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.
