<HEADLINE> Arbitration Should Consider Social-Economic Profile:  India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan said Thursday that international arbitration should
consider social-economic conditions of the countries concerned
while dealing with a dispute to arrive at a just solution.
</P>
<P>
Opening a conference here organized by the International
Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA), Narayanan said the
arbitrating authority, without being partial, should strike a fair
balance between the countries in dispute so that "justice is
reached with cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the old arbitration system once prevalent in India,
he said: "Today, even in India this old system of arbitration is
being overtaken by the review by courts, making matters one of
endless litigation."
</P>
<P>
Expressing his hope that the conference would suggest ways to
end the never-ending process of litigation before the "old common
arbitrator" steps in, Narayanan said international arbitration
must bear in mind that there were great inequalities between
contesting parties from different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore even commercial organizations and corporate entities
in developing countries are, inherently, at a disadvantage vis-a-
vis their counterparts in the developed world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The practice of arbitration in international commerce has to be
guided by an empathetic attitude towards the developing world and
their level of development, the Indian leader said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, international arbitration has certain merits.
"The method of arbitration creates understanding between
disputants as it resolves the disputes through compromise and
cooperation without leaving an intolerable trail of bitterness
behind."
</P>
<P>
Narayanan was quick to add that it "should be a futility of
monstrous proportions if the arbitration process instead of ending
litigation were to commence new litigation or perpetuate it."
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering of over 400 delegates from more than 30
countries that New Delhi recognized the significance of the model
law and rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law in establishing a unified legal framework for the fair
and efficient settlement of disputes arising in international
commerce relations.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets French Consul to Mend Strained Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met
with the French consul in Jerusalem Friday in an apparent move to
mend the strained ties with France after the stoning incident of
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Ramallah, the West Bank, Arafat and consul
Denis Pietton discussed bilateral relations and the peace process,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was pelted with stones by Palestinian students and got
slightly injured during a visit Saturday to the West Bank
university of Birzeit.
</P>
<P>
The students were angered by Jospin's remarks which branded
Hezbollah guerrilla attacks against Israeli occupation troops as "
terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
Jospin, on the second day of his four-day visit in Jerusalem,
said Thursday "France condemns Hezbollah's attacks, and all types
of terrorist attacks which may be carried out against soldiers or
possibly Israel's civilian population."
</P>
<P>
The students regarded Jospin's remarks as hostile and
inconsistent with the French claimed policy of supporting Lebanese
sovereignty and the French role in the committee overseeing
conflicts between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee, grouping representatives from the United States,
France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in August 1996 under
an understanding reached between Hezbollah and Israel after a
massive Israeli attacks on Lebanon, killing 200 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
spearheading Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation of
southern Lebanese border areas where Israel carved out a buffer
zone with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, greatly embarrassed by the incident, ordered the closure
of the university for three days. About 120 students were
reportedly arrested and some 30 are still in custody in the West
Bank town of Jericho.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Supports for Convening Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh reaffirmed Friday that his country firmly supports the
convention of an Arab summit to promote Arab solidarity on regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after touching down at the Amman
international airport from a three-day official visit to Yemen,
where he attended the eighth session of a high-ranking joint
committee between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Jordan had been persistent in its call
for an Arab summit to wipe out differences between Arab countries
and to reach consensus on issues confronting the Arab World.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was held in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of his visit to Yemen, Rawabdeh said the meeting
of the joint committee would further consolidate political,
economic and cultural ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed eight agreements to promote
bilateral cooperation in trade, cultural and investments, he added.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been an active player in the Middle East peace
process as well as regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
It took peace and cooperation as a strategic option in its
foreign policies after it signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994. Jordan was the second Arab country to strike a peace deal
with the Jewish state after Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Jordan`s call for an Arab summit was mainly aimed at addressing
issues facing the Arab-Israeli peace process, ending the crippling
sanctions on Iraq in place since the 1990 Gulf Crisis, and
promoting economic and political cooperation in the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fails in Dumping Charge Against Foreign Steel Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling means the United States will not carry out plans to
impose punitive duties on more than 590 million dollars worth of
cold-rolled steel, used in products ranging from automobiles to
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The decision, while a major victory for the six countries, was
a blow to cash-strapped U.S. steel makers and workers, who had
asked the International Trade Commission to rein in the import,
alleging they were dumped in the United States at below fair
market value.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had been under pressure from steel
makers to crack down on low-priced imports and the Commerce
Department had already set duties ranging from 16.65 percent in
the case of South Africa to as high as 80.67 percent in the case
of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But all those duties will not take effect because of the
decision from the International Trade Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government will provide
 humanitarian aid worth about three million U.S. dollars to the
flood victims in southern and central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made here on Friday by Belgian Secretary
of State for Development and Cooperation Eddy Boutmans, who said
that part of this package is to arrive in the Mozambican capital
city of Maputo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of a meeting with Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano, Boutmans said that he took the chance
to convey to Chissano a message of solidarity from his country
with the victims of the worst flooding registered in the past 50
years in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"We want to say that Belgium will do its best to minimize the
effects of the disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Mozambican presidency said that Boutmans will
overfly Xai-Xai, the capital of the southern province of Gaza, and
the town of Chokwe, also in Gaza, on Friday, to assess the damage
there caused by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Delegation Arrives in Rwanda Over Trade Normalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan delegation arrived in
Rwandan capital Kigali on Friday in an effort to normalize the
chaos reported in the transportation sector of Rwanda as far as
Kenya's road policy is concerned, Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ephraim Rutaboba, Secretary-General in the
Rwandan Ministry of Transport and Communications, as saying on
Friday evening that the visit is intended to find a solution to
the alarms caused by Rwandan importers using Kenyan roads.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, together with their Rwandan counterpart, will
try to facilitate the setup of a railway network connecting Kenya
and Rwanda so that the transportation costs on the goods imported
from Mombasa to Rwanda may be minimized, Rutaboba said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan delegation arrived in Kigali amid amounting
controversy caused by a hike in petroleum prices in Rwanda which
has drastically increased the inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Business people in Rwanda attributed the situation to
constraints relating to axle road limitations imposed on Rwandan
transporters by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, although it is alleged
that the increase in petroleum prices was sparked off by the
reduction in goods imported by road from Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Faces New Flood Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Central Weather
Forecast Office said in Pretoria on Friday that Cyclone Gloria is
expected to hit the Eastern Mozambican Channel late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau said it is not possible to accurately
forecast Gloria' s path beyond 48 hours. However, the cyclone may
re-intensify as it hits the channel, it said.
</P>
<P>
The prediction has raised fears of new flooding in Mozambique
where foreign aid agencies are stepping up their appeal for more
aid to the victims.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimated that between 800,000 and one
million Mozambicans have lost their homes and were in urgent need
of help following the worst floods in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. aid agencies, they have received more than 32
million U.S. dollars in financial contributions to help the
millions of flood victims in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
But the International Red Cross said the present donation is
not enough to help the refugees and the organization will double
its appeal for aid to Mozambique and other southern African
countries hit by the flood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 101 people have died in the floods in South Africa's
Northern Province since February 2 and at least 40,000 people were
believed to have been affected by the torrential rains, which
caused about 1.1 billion rand (about 180 million U.S. dollars)
damage to infrastructure in the province.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Turkey Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
will start a two-day official visit to Turkey Tuesday to discuss
the latest developments in the Middle East peace process and seek
ways to boost bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said Abdullah and his delegation will
meet Turkish politicians and businessmen. According to the semi-
official Anatolia News Agency, water is expected to top the agenda
of Abdullah's talks with Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Water from Turkey's Manavgat River, which is planned to be sold
to Israel, can be transferred directly or indirectly to Jordan and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Turkey may make its due contribution to the
Middle East peace process by helping solve one of the most
thorniest issues - water, said the new agency.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of his visit, Abdullah is scheduled to meet
Turkish businessmen in Istanbul to get first-hand information about
Turkey's experience in privatization which is believed to be
valuable for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The resource-sparse kingdom is also undergoing a privatization
process to lift the country from economic stagnation which was
featured in high unemployment rate and heavy foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will also take advantage of the visit to woo Turkish
investments and to encourage businessmen of the two countries to
tap the vast potential in bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah's visit is believed to promote Turkish-Jordanian
ties on various domains, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old monarch assumed the throne after his father King
Hussein died of cancer in February last year, who was an
influential personality in the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has been working to continue his father's legacy and
improve the country's economic situation. He also stated on many
occasions that Jordan will maintain peace with Israel, a close ally
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will be accompanied by Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh, Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib and Minister of
Water and Irrigation Kamel Mahadin and other high-ranking officials
on his visit.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for More World Efforts to Seek Elimination of All Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday called on the international community to start
talking new and effective measures at once to seek the elimination
of all nuclear weapons in the world.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here through his spokesman, said
that "in order to achieve the ultimate objective of a world free
of nuclear weapons, the international community should immediately
start talking new and effective measures to achieve the inherently
linked goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to seek the elimination of all nuclear weapons must
remain a high priority," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement came on the eve of the 30th anniversary of
the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which entered into force on March 5, 1970.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general hopes that all parties to the NPT will
rededicate themselves to unceasing efforts to implement all of
their obligations under the treaty," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years ago, on March 5, 1970, the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons entered into force," the
statement said. "The event was acclaimed then as the most
important international agreement in the field of disarmament
since the start of the nuclear age and a major success for the
cause of peace."
</P>
<P>
"The treaty has since become and remains the cornerstone of
the global nuclear non-proliferation regime," the statement said.
"Its membership has steadily grown to 187 States parties today."
</P>
<P>
The State parties are scheduled to gather at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York for the 2000 NPT Review Conference from
April 24 to May 19.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming conference "would be an excellent opportunity
for all parties to reaffirm their commitment to the treaty," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, nuclear-weapon states agree not to provide
nuclear weapons to other countries and to pursue nuclear
disarmament; non-nuclear weapon states agree not to develop or
obtain nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
A major step in advancing non-proliferation was taken in 1995,
when a review conference extended the treaty indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Britain Maintains Position on Zimbabwe's Land Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The British High Commission in
Harare Friday repeated its wishes to see Zimbabwe's land
redistribution program being carried out in a fair and transparent
manner, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The current farm invasions by the country's former guerillas in
the liberation war would sent wrong signals to the international
community, an official with the high commission was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the law should prevail and discussions
between the two governments should continue until a common
understanding is reached.
</P>
<P>
"The invasions are scaring away foreign investors and add more
problems to Zimbabwe's troubled economy," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Scores of farms have so far been invaded by war veterans and
land-hungry peasants who have defied the government's call for
everyone to be patient while the finer details of the land program
are mapped, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has announced that the government would
take most white-owned commercial farms for free and only
compensate for infrastructural developments on those farms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has given a 30-day notice of its
desire to amend the British-authored Lancaster House constitution
of 1979 to include a clause from the rejected draft constitution
which gives it power to compulsorily acquire land for resettlement
without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, a country whose economy is agro-based, has 70 percent
of its 12. 5 million people crowded in the rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African Air Force
Helicopters operating in the flood-stricken districts of Chokwe
and Chibuto in the southern Mozambican province of Gaza has
rescued 6,600 people over the last four days.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the National Disaster
Management Institute (INGC) of Mozambique on Friday, the South
African pilots also recovered two bodies that were floating in the
water, and one that was found in a tree.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39.6 tons of humanitarian aid has been flown to the
accommodation centers at Bilene and Magul for people who have
escaped from Chokwe and Chibuto, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Aid has also reached flood victims in Govuro and Machanga
districts near the mouth of the Save River, the release said,
citing 80 "food kits", two tons of grain and 60 boxes of biscuits.
</P>
<P>
According to the INGC, several of the flooded rivers are now
subsiding. The peak of the Limpopo flood appears to have passed,
and on Thursday the river dropped 13 centimeters. The Save and the
Buzi rivers are also slowly dropping.
</P>
<P>
But there are still concerns over the Shire River, a major
tributary of the Zambezi. Water is pouring down the Shire River
from Malawi, posing a threat to parts of Tete and Zambezia
provinces.

SANAA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdah on Friday condemned the "ongoing Israeli
aggression" of Lebanon and reaffirmed Jordanian support to the
Lebanese people.
</P>

BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and First Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on Friday left here for home
after winding up a two-day visit to Lebanon in a show of support to
the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the crown prince held talks with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on the current
situation in Lebanon which is under Israeli threats of further tit-
for-tat attacks against the country.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also met with a delegation of Hezbollah, or Party of
God, which has been spearheading a guerrilla war in south Lebanon
to oust Israeli troops from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a proclaimed aim of protecting its north from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides inked an agreement under which
Saudi Arabia will grant Lebanon 130 million U.S. dollars to help
the country implement a number of vital projects.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the last stop of Abdullah's three-leg Arab tour which
also took him to Egypt and Syria to highlight Arab solidarity with

<HEADLINE> Toronto Health Orders Six Restaurants Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- In a 14-week inspection blitz, the
health department of Toronto has ordered six restaurants out of
business with another five being charged with minor infractions.
</P>
<P>
"The results continue to be horrendous," health board chairman
John Filion said Thursday in the second week of blitz, which was
launched after 11 people became ill and complained about a dinner
at a seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
On the second week of their blitz, inspectors went to 105
eateries and found infractions at 89, a rate even higher than last
week when 53 of 74 were determined to have health issues.
</P>
<P>
Only those restaurants with immediate health risks were closed,
according to the health department.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors are concentrating on the old city because most of
Toronto's restaurants are located there and enforcement was lax,
Filion said.
</P>
<P>
The health department intends to go through 3,360 of the more
than 7,000 restaurants in the old city of Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Try Cold Virus for Cancer Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists are developing
a gene-therapy by using cold virus to fight cancer, the Toronto
Sun newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Center are
working on a way to insert the normal p53 gene into women who have
the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of women who develop ovarian cancer have an
abnormal p53 gene.
</P>
<P>
Its normal function is to stop tumors from growing; but when it
becomes defective, cells can grow into cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
The scientists are trying to use the common cold virus as a
taxi to carry the good gene to infect the patient's cancer sites
in the hope that the defective gene could be replaced by the good
one and the cancer cells would stop growing.
</P>
<P>
"This study is at the forefront of cutting-edge gene-therapy
medicine and it's been quite an accomplishment to get this far,"
said Dr. Al Covens, who is leading the Toronto part of the study.
</P>
<P>
Ovarian cancer is usually detected at a late stage, making it
one of the most deadly forms of cancer. In Canada, almost 2,500
women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer and 1,400 die
from this disease.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Totally 1,647 Servicemen Died in North Caucasus Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's main spokesman on Chechnya
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Friday that Russian federal forces have
lost a total of 1,647 men with 4,661 wounded in the North Caucasus
since Chechen rebels' incursion into the neighboring republic of
Dagestan last August.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry units in particular lost 1,127 servicemen with
2,890 injured and the interior troops and police registered 520
dead and 1,771 wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of all the casualties, 1, 420 were killed and 3,869 injured
in the anti-terrorist operation in the breakaway province of
Chechnya, said Yastrzhembsky, adding that the Defense Ministry
lost 1,009 with 2,606 wounded, while the Interior Ministry and
other law enforcement agencies lost 411 with 1,263 injured.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, as many as 161 federal servicemen died
and 374 got wounded in Chechnya, he said. Among them 121 were from
the Defense Ministry, 37 from the OMON special police and three
from the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"This dismal statistics includes the latest losses of the
Russian OMON riot police unit near Grozny," said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the Russian military reported that 16 soldiers
of a Russian OMON elite unit from the Moscow region were killed
and other 21 injured Thursday in a rebel ambush attack outside the
Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian joint forces' staff in the North Caucasus
later said that the death toll of the Chechen ambush had reached
37 because some of the wounded died at hospital, where now there
are still 12 of them lying on bed.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the Russian federal forces in the North
Caucasus were quoted by the news agency Interfax as saying that
some 80 persons had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of
involvement in the Thursday attack on the Russian special police
unit.
</P>
<P>
The majority of detainees are Chechens who were staying near
the attack site, said the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Russian interior troops are continuing their
pursuit of the rebels who attacked the policemen, while the pro-
Moscow Chechen militia leader, ex-mayor of Grozny Bislan
Gantamirov, arrived in the city Friday to convene outstanding
public and religious figures as well as pro-Moscow members of the
separatist parliaments for a Chechen national reconciliation and
consolidation conference, said the military.

<HEADLINE> FAO Calls for Emergency Aid for Mozambican Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has called on the international
community to provide 2.5 million U.S. dollars in emergency aid for
300,000 Mozambican farmers and their families suffering from
floods.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated in Lusaka Friday, FAO Director
General Jacques Diouf said that "around 2.5 million dollars are
needed to help Mocambique's farmers get back to farming as quickly
as possible so the country will be able to produce enough food to
feed its people."
</P>
<P>
The cyclone-charged floods will have a long-term effect on
Mozambique. Due to the floods, some 200 people have reportedly
died and more than 150, 000 others have lost their homes and are
receiving emergency food aid from the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Flooding in the southern and central provinces of Mozambique
has caused tremendous loss to crops and livestock, according to
FAO.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates indicate that over 100,000 planted
hectares have been destroyed or seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
FAO said that flood damage to the country's infrastructure has
been considerable and many towns are isolated because the floods
have washed out roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diseases are threatening the survivors because of
contaminated water, malaria and cholera are feared in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
FAO will dispatch teams to Mozambique as soon as the flood
waters recede and the roads are passable to organize the
distribution of seeds and farm tools as well as veterinary support
provided funds are made, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Assist Ugandan Orphans, Street Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
signed a country program with the Ugandan government here Friday
to assist orphans and street children in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The program, at a cost of 1.16 million U.S. dollars to the food
agency, would provide 1,865 tons of food to a total of 3,000
orphans and street children in the districts of Kampala, Mpigi and
Jinja in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government, which contributes some 400,000 dollars
to the program, as well as some non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) will be involved in the program okayed by WFP Executive
Board at its second regular session last May.
</P>
<P>
This project would enable young children and expectant and
nursing mothers to meet their special nutritional and
nutrition-related health needs and also to enable poor households
to invest in human capital through education and training.
</P>
<P>
It will directly benefit 3,000 orphans and street children a
year by providing them with dietary and nutritional support,
marketable skills, and access to other forms of support.
</P>
<P>
The activity will be coordinated by the Ministry of Gender,
Labor and Social Development through a steering committee
comprised of district officials, WFP and NGO staff.
</P>
<P>
Three leading agencies -- World Vision, Feed the Children and
International Care and Relief -- will be responsible for
implementing the activity through their own facilities and through
local NGOs with which they have formed long-standing partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Many street kids, with no access to work skills, resort to
violence for life.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.9 million children in Uganda have been orphaned by AIDS
alone since early 1980s. They constitute a considerable
proportion of the marginalized group.

The remaining 20 million Euro will be delivered shortly,
Nielson said, adding that the assistance will help those homeless
and facing serious nutritional, hygiene and health problems.
</P>
<P>
"One must not forget those who are now without shelter, food,
clean water and health care," said Nielson, who has visited some
flooded areas in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone-charged floods have reportedly caused some 200
deaths and displaced some one million people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioner stressed EU's short, medium and
long-term commitment to the people of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Nielson said EU will release an initial amount of at least 21
million Euro to help the Mozambican people start getting their
lives back to normal once the floods subside.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will follow up immediate humanitarian assistance with
medium and long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that EU will increase its development assistance
to Mozambique to 150 million Euro this year, compared to 100
million Euro for 1999.

<HEADLINE> More Aid Needed for Flood-hit Southern African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, Botswana,
Mozambique and Zimbabwe Friday urged international community to

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Pledges Commitment to Redressing Land Imbalances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday said his government is committed to redress the glaring
imbalances in land ownership in the country.
</P>
<P>
The equitable distribution of land must be speeded to avoid
social unrest, Mugabe told a new-year reception for heads of
foreign missions in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He urged the diplomats to accurately and honestly brief their
respective governments and organizations on the rationale to
empower the Zimbabwean people through equitable land distribution.
</P>
<P>
"Failure on our part to level the economic and social playing
field can only have serious negative repercussions on national
stability," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government this week gave notice of its
intention to amend the constitution and to include a clause that
would empower it to compulsorily acquire land for resettlement
without compensation.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the rejection of the clause together with the
draft constitution in a national referendum last month.
</P>
<P>
Last week, war veterans apparently angered by the rejection of
the draft went on a countrywide white-owned farms invasion spree
to register their disquiet over the government's delay in solving
the land question.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans were Thursday instructed by Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa to leave the farms by Friday because they
were breaching the law and the government had taken steps to
resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
By voting against the draft constitution, people had exercised
their democratic right, Mugabe said, adding that his government
was duty-bound to accept the verdict.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe does not intend to control foreign currency
movement but may be forced to do so by some financial institutions
which are holding substantial amounts in foreign currency
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The president described the year 1999 as a difficult year that
saw the Zimbabwean dollar severely weakened due to shortages of
foreign currency on the local market.
</P>
<P>
"Macro-economic instability also fuelled the inflation rate to
an unacceptable and unsustainable level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Luanda's Population Hits 3.4 Million,Ranking 3rd in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Number of the residents in the
Angolan capital Luanda hit 3.41 million, ranking the third largest
among the African cities, only after the Egyptian Cairo and the
Nigerian Lagos, said here on Friday the national bureau of
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of the residents in Luanda
accounts for some 31 percent of the total population of the
country, which is estimated at 11 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the bureau, the southwest
African harbor city has seen a rapid swell of the population in
the recent 25 years, increasing by 600 percent as compared with
the number of residents in 1975 when the country gained its
independence from the Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The over-concentration of the population in the capital city
is mainly due to the increasing number of the war-displaced
persons and the over- centralization of the country's economic
activities, said local analysts.
</P>
<P>
Luanda lodges over half of the country's commercial activities
and one third of the industrial entities, which offer many
opportunities for the new-comers.
</P>
<P>
The large population has exerted great pressure on the
municipal administration and the city planning while 50 percent of
the residents are living in the shanty towns, which were built by
the displaced persons with plastic material and sticks.
</P>
<P>
 Power cut, water shortage, traffic jams, low-efficient
garbage treatment and the employment are also listed by the
analysts as headache problems disturbing the local government.

<HEADLINE> Regional Food Security Program Launched In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A regional food security program
aimed at improving food security by strengthening the capacity of
public, private and voluntary sectors was launched in Harare
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture remains the mainstay of economic activity in almost
all the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries,
Kumbirai Kangai, Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister, said
at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
But over the past 10 years, total external commitments to
agriculture have been declining, Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
Because of such trends as well as other factors like droughts,
floods and low investment in the agricultural sector, the SADC
agricultural growth rate has been very low, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, the persistence of hunger and malnutrition in SADC
countries provide a strong role for the food program to urgently
increase food production.

<HEADLINE> Contacts with Iraqi Officials Positive: Turkish Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Edip Safter
Gaydali, who led a delegation to Iraq for an official visit, said
on Friday that his contacts with Iraqi officials were positive.
</P>
<P>
Gaydali was in Baghdad to attend the 12th Turkey-Iraq Joint
Economic Commission (JEC) meeting, together with 34 Turkish
officials and 200 businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He denied on Friday the news that he faced problems while
entering and leaving Iraq regarding visa and passport controls.
</P>
<P>
"We experienced no trouble both entering and leaving Iraq. We
were not stopped at the border and we were not asked to show our
passports or visas," Gaydali told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish delegation was received friendly and
attentively in Baghdad, adding that they searched for ways to
increase trade between Turkey and Iraq during his contacts with
Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
Gaydali said he had a meeting with Iraqi Deputy President Taha
Yasin Ramadan and several ministers in Baghdad, during which
Turkish and Iraqi businessmen inked a trade agreement worth of 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Turkey's export to Iraq will reach 700
million dollars. Turkey wants to get a bigger share from the "oil-
for-food" program in which Iraq is allowed to crude oil to buy
basic supplies for its 22 million people, Gaydali stressed.
</P>
<P>
There have been only two JEC meetings held with Iraq since 1990.

<P>
HURRIYET (Freedom):
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Rises in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The nation's unemployment rate
went up to 4.1 percent in February but still remained at a 30-year
low as 43,000 workers found jobs, the fewest in nine months, the
Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's jobless rate followed January's 4 percent rate,
the lowest since 3.9 percent in January 1970. Many analysts had
expected February's unemployment rate to hold steady.
</P>
<P>
The 43,000 new jobs created in February were the weakest
showing since 28,000 jobs were added in May 1999. Jobs growth was
restrained in part by sluggish growth in the service sector,
normally the engine behind job creation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The service sector added 62,000 jobs in February, the fewest
since August 1997, when 10,000 jobs were added.
</P>
<P>
February's overall payroll number was significantly lower than
the 228,000 range many analysts were forecasting. The small gain
followed a surge of 384,000 jobs added to the nation's payrolls in
January.
</P>
<P>
Retailers added 33,000 jobs in February, while business
services added 6,000. Manufacturers added 5,000 jobs with the
largest gains reported in electrical equipment, automobile
production and industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, which lost 248,000 jobs last year, are
recovering from the effects of a global financial crises that
struck in 1997 depressing overseas' demand for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
But 26,000 jobs were lost in construction, which had posted big
gains in January due to the mild weather. The government said the
largest employment declines occurred in weather-sensitive
industries, such as heavy construction, concrete, and masonry and
roofing trades.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the report, employment declined at agricultural
services, amusement parks and recreation services, also all
weather sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose by 0.3 percent to 13.53 U.S. dollars in February, on target
with most analysts' expectations. In January, wages grew by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists always keep a close eye on wage and job growth.
Given the outlook for continued strong economic growth, many
economists widely expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates again on March 21. The central bank has raised interest
rates four times since June to slow the rip-roaring economy and
keep inflation at bay.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After two weeks of increasingly harsh, long-distance warfare,
George W. Bush and John McCain toned down their rhetoric Thursday
night in their last debate before Super Tuesday, but still
pointedly disagreed over campaign finance reform and the conduct
of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
-- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean leader who spent
16 months under house arrest in Britain fighting extradition to
Spain, flew home Thursday night after British authorities ordered
his release on humanitarian grounds and whisked him to a swift
departure aboard a waiting Chilean air force plane.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Maria Hsia, a longtime political fund-raiser for Vice
President Al Gore, was convicted on Thursday of all five felony
counts against her for her role in arranging more than 100,000
dollars in illegal donations to the Democratic Party and its
candidates in 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli forces killed three Palestinian terror suspects in a
clash that began with a raid on a house in an Arab town, Taibeh.
Officials said at least five Islamic militants from the Gaza Strip
were preparing explosives for use in Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasd and Big Board have discussed merging as a way to
preserve a central role in equity markets, according to people
with knowledge of the talks. While a deal at this point appears
unlikely, such talks indicate how much technological changes are
threatening the dominance of NASDAQ and the NYSE. Meanwhile,
electronic-trading systems Instinet and Datek have held merger
discussions that since have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Central Bank kept key interest rates steady,
despite the weak euro. But the bank's president signaled that
rates will rise soon.

<HEADLINE> Protection Urged for Cliff Paintings in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists and government
officials of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are
worried about the safety of ancient cliff paintings which provide
a look back in time at the life of ethnic minority people.
</P>
<P>
Renowned archaeologist Gai Shanlin believes there is a belt of
at least 100,000 cliff paintings stretching through Inner Mongolia,
half of which have been discovered. But the precious relics may be
ruined by nature and man if no measures are taken to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minority people living on the grassland of Inner
Mongolia painted on cliffs and rocks to record their activities,
Gai said. They started in the Neolithic Age (BC 10,000 to BC 4,000)
painting through to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
The paintings provide invaluable information for the study of
ancient nomadic people, Gai said.
</P>
<P>
But the historic testimony is very likely to disappear from the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the cultural relics protection department of the
region say the majority of the cliff paintings, scattered
throughout remote areas, have suffered heavy damage. The situation
is worst in Yinshan Mountain, west of the region, where the
greatest concentration of cliff paintings is located.
</P>
<P>
Apart from serious wind erosion, people's disregard and
ignorance account for the loss of the paintings. Many of the
stones with paintings on them are used by farmers to build sheds
for flocks and herds.
</P>
<P>
"Without any protection, the paintings will one day be gone,
and it is a shame," Gai said.
</P>
<P>
Gai, who is also a vice chairman of the Inner Mongolian
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), submitted a bill to the committee, in which he
suggested the cliff paintings should be registered on the World
Natural and Cultural Heritage list of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The cliff paintings in the Inner Mongolia deserve to be
included in the list, said Gai, because they are so widely
distributed, diversified and rich in content.
</P>
<P>
China is home to more cliff paintings than any other country,
and is one of the first places in the world to produce the rare
historic art.

<HEADLINE> HK Phone Companies Launch Another IDD Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's major telephone
companies are launching another round of IDD price war to win a
larger share of the lucrative IDD market.
</P>
<P>
New T&AMP;T, an IDD phone operator in Hong Kong, is offering
subscribers free calls to Australia and Canada during specified
off-peak hours. The free rates are valid from March 4 to 31.
</P>
<P>
The decision of New T&AMP;T on free rates is directed against its
rival phone companies New World and CTI, both of which offered a
promotional rate of 5 HK cents (about 0.6 U.S. cents) per minute
to call the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain our position as the price leader," said
Tony Cheung Tung-lan, consumer market director of the company. He
admitted that there is a price to pay in doing this, but he
believed it is worthwhile in order to build a customer base.
</P>
<P>
The costs of IDD calls to Canada and Australia are between some
40 and 60 HK cents per minute. New T&AMP;T has prepared 30 million to
40 million HK dollars (3.8 million to 5.1 million U.S. dollars)
for the price war, Cheung revealed.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a short-term loss, but we would gain in the medium
or long term," he said, noting that every time when the promotion
ended, some 80 percent of the customers would remain. He ruled out
the worries that there would be a sharp fall in income after the
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Since New T&AMP;T's launch of its free call program, the response
from the customers is good, Cheung said, adding that the number of
new customers has increased considerably, but he declined to
reveal the exact figure.
</P>
<P>
In response to New T&AMP;T's promotion, CTI Chairman Ricky Wong
said that his company will not further reduce IDD rates and that
CTI is confident about its market share.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the cost of 3 HK dollars (38 U.S. cents) for an hour's
IDD call does not make much difference from free call, he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for New World, however, announced the possibility
of further IDD rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
There has been fierce competition on the IDD market in Hong
Kong since the Hong Kong government liberalized the market last
year. The first round of IDD price war started last November, when
New T&AMP;T and CTI both cut the rates of calls to the United States
and Canada to 7 HK cents (less than 1 U.S. cent).
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Telecommunications Authorities issued licenses to
12 companies in January, allowing them to operate satellite-based
external telecommunications facilities and thus leaving room for
further reductions in the rates of IDD calls.
</P>
<P>
CTI's Wong estimated that the market may have losers in three
to six months and said his company has witnessed increases in the
calling volume and customer number in the past three months.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Support for Pullout from South Lebanon Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Six out of 10 Israelis want the
government to pull out troops from south Lebanon with or without a
peace agreement with Syria, said an opinion poll published here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Gallup poll for the Ma'ariv daily showed that 61 percent of
the Israelis questioned backed a unilateral withdrawal from the
security zone in south Lebanon, up from 56 percent three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to bring the Israeli boys
back from south Lebanon by July, but prefers to do so after
reaching a peace agreement with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 670 Israelis, conducted on Wednesday, found that 31
percent of the respondents opposed a unilateral withdrawal, while 8
percent had no opinion. It did not give the margin of error.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-styled security zone in 1985 with the
proclaimed aim of protecting the security of its northern border.
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting against Israeli
occupation along with other Lebanese military groups since then.
</P>
<P>
Situation has worsened in south Lebanon since the beginning of
this year, as seven Israeli soldiers were killed in Hezbollah
guerrillas attacks in the security zone.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Peace Process Needs a Real Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Friday that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is presently
frozen and a real push should be given to restart it, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Speaker
Avraham Burg in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat said both
Israelis and Palestinians should work together with U.S., Egyptian
and the European Union envoys to advance the deadlocked talks.
</P>
<P>
Burg stressed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is
committed to the peace process and will try his best to reach peace
treaties with both Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Burg's spokesman said his meetings with Arafat and
other senior Palestinian officials were aiming at establishing
direct channels of communications between them.
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting was the first between Arafat and a senior
Israeli political figure since his summit meeting with Barak last
month failed to resolve differences over Israeli troops withdrawal
map from 6.1 percent of the West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also missed a February 13 deadline for a framework
agreement on final peace as stipulated by the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arafat reportedly had ordered a halt to official
meetings with the Israeli officials at senior levels.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake Jolts Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of
about 3.9 on the Richter scale rocked Legaspi City, 16 kilometers
away from the Mayon Volcano in the central Philippines Friday
night, the state-run Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said in a bulletin that the quake was tectonic in
origin and its epicenter was located near the Albay Gulf, east of
Legazpi City.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which occurred at about 6:53 p.m. local time, was so
weak that it did not cause any damage to nearby infrastructure,
although it caused fear among residents who thought Mt. Mayon's
explosive eruptions had resumed.
</P>
<P>
But the institute said the quake had nothing to do with Mt.
Mayon.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Mt. Mayon had ceased its violent activity since
about two days ago, after nearly two weeks of violent explosions.
</P>
<P>
The eruptions were said to be the strongest so far in the
vocano's recent recorded history of eruptions, forcing 83,000
local people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The recent blasts, however, did not claim any casualty, as the
evacuees have fled into the safety of some 53 evacuation centers
throughout Albay Province, which is located on the southern tip of
the Luzon island.
</P>
<P>
The eruptions also reportedly inflicted more than 100 million
pesos (2.5 million U.S. dollars) in damage to agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Patiently Awaits Implementation of OAU Peace Plan: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki
said that Eritrea has been patiently waiting for the
implementation of the peace plan put forward by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when talking with OAU envoy
Ahmed Ouyahia, the Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a
news release issued in Asmara Friday.
</P>
<P>
Isaias assured the OAU envoy that his government is committed
to peace and would continue to cooperate with the biggest African
organization, despite Ethiopia's rejection of the Technical
Arrangements, a key component of the OAU peace package.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy informed Eritrea that after six months of
efforts by the organization and its partners in the peace process,
Ethiopia has not yet accepted the Technical Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Although Ethiopia, as Eritrea, had given its prior consent to
the OAU, the Technical Arrangements are"not open to amendment",
and the OAU would continue its search for peace, according to the
new release available here.
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia expressed his confidence that Eritrea, which had
formally accepted all three components of the peace plan initiated
by OAU, would continue to cooperate with the organization's
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea promptly accepted the Technical Arrangements as the OAU
 presented it to the two parties in early August last year, while
Ethiopia has now finally rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia started war over the ill-defined boder in
May 1998. Since then tens of thousands of soldiers from both
sides have died in the conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Tanzania Sign Road Transport Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Zimbabwe and
Tanzania signed a road transport agreement in Harare Friday, which
is expected to promote growth of the sector in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to promote free flow of goods and
passengers by simplifying administrative requirements for both
countries.
</P>
<P>
It would ensure the development of a strong and competitive
road transport sector where truckers from the two countries can
compete fairly while ensuring the recovery of road user charges
from road users in a non- discriminatory manner.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Transport and Energy Deputy Minister Zenzo Nsimbi
said there were problems of uneven toll charges and unpredictably
documentary requirements which were affecting smooth flow of
goods.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement should constitute a forum for thrashing out
differences and averting crises that may emanate during the
implementation stage," said the deputy minister who signed the
agreement on behalf of the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
"This would reduce unwarranted documentation delays and
excessive government control, thereby affording the transporters
the initiative to fairly compete and cooperate within the
parameters of market force dictates, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Communications and Transport Minister Enerst Nyanda,
who signed the agreement on behalf of the Tanzanian government,
said that this agreement should strengthen cooperation between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
"The success in expanding trade and economic relations in our
two countries has to be spearheaded by efficient transport,"
Nyanda said.

 Chinese Leaders Meet with Russian Deputy PM
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today that it has
been proved time and again that the Sino-Russia strategic
partnership of coordination is a wise choice and it is of historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told visiting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov
that there are bright prospects for the Sino-Russian cooperation
as the leaders of the two countries support the forging of the
strategic partnership of coordination, pushed forward the
bilateral exchanges and cooperation, promoted the multi-
polarization process and enhanced the international standings of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the close attention paid by Russian
Acting President Vladimir Putin to the Sino-Russian ties, and
asked Klebanov to convey his greetings and regards to Putin.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov passed Putin's regards to Jiang. He said that his
current visit is an important mission in preparation for the China
visit of the new Russian president to be elected in the upcoming
general election.
</P>
<P>
Russia will firmly support China's principled stand on the
Taiwan issue, and will spare no efforts to push forward the multi-
polarization process, the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said today during his meeting
with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov that the
establishment and expansion of the Sino-Russia strategic
partnership of coordination is in the interest of both countries,
and will have an impact on maintaining global strategic stability
and promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"China agrees to develop all-round cooperation with Russia and
hopes to further this cooperation through concerted efforts and in
line with mutual compromise and mutual understanding," the Chinese
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to Russia for its support to
China's principled stand on the Taiwan issue, and reaffirmed that
China will also give its unswerving support to the efforts made by
Russia to safeguard its own national unity.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov conveyed Putin's greetings to Zhu, and said that Putin
has time and again expressed the thought that Russia advocates the
creation of a multi-polarization world. He said the acting
president firmly believes that Russia should protect its own
national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of China and Russia will hold a summit
meeting this year, and the prime ministers of the two countries
will hold their fifth regular meeting. Klebanov said that Russia
is already preparing for the meetings. "We should take action to
consolidate the basis of our bilateral relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission (CMC), met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov this morning. They discussed bilateral relations as well
as regional and international security issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Sino-Russian strategic coordinative partnership
of equality and trust has been further promoted and friendly
cooperation between the armed forces of China and Russia has been
good. "China is confident that military relations between the two
countries will develop further in the new century."
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said that Sino-Russian cooperation is an integral part
of the strategic partnership. "Sino-Russian cooperation enjoys
good relations, because it is established on the principles of
respecting sovereignty, mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit",
he added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Poaching Police Cremate Dead Wild Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's Yunnan
Province today cremated hundreds of dead wild animals they
confiscated from poachers to illustrate the government's hard line
approach toward poaching.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of skins, carcasses and bones of rare animals and
birds such as giant lizards, bears, boa constrictors and leopards,
as well as products made from them, were tossed onto a pile,
estimated to weigh eight tons, on the outskirts of Kunming city.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them were confiscated from border-crossing dealers who
brought animals and animal parts into the country," said Ma Sheng,
an officer with the Yunnan Department of Forest Police. "The
action shows our firm attitude against poaching."
</P>
<P>
With an abundance of wild animals, Yunnan unfortunately has
become a hotbed of poaching and other illegal activities involving
rare animals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The country launched its largest-ever crackdown against the
practice in January in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangdong and
Fujian provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ruling Parties's Amendment Bill to be Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Parliamentary Interparty
Compromise Commission (PICC) convened on Friday to discuss a
proposal on constitutional amendment put forward by ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The ruling parties' proposal demands the next president be
elected directly by the people for two consecutive terms with each
lasting five years.
</P>
<P>
Even though the the Turkish Parliamentary Constitutional
Commission (PCC) could accept the proposal, the ruling coalition
decided to submit it to the PICC for discussion in order to ensure
the main opposition parties support it in the upcoming voting.
Earlier, the PCC rejected, by 13 votes to 9 in a clear partisan
line, a proposal on constitutional amendment submitted by the main
opposition Virtue Party (FP) and True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Nejat Arseven, the Acting Parliament Speaker and Chairman of the
PICC, said they will discuss the ruling coalition's proposal, put
forward by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and backed by his coalition
partner parties, the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the Nationalist
Movement Party (MHP).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which suggests a reduction of the current seven-
year single presidential term to a five-year term but allows a
second term in office, will be appended with two articles that make
closure of political parties more difficult and increase salaries
and pensions of deputies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the appendents, favored by ruling parties, attempt
to woo the opposition parties and ensure two-thirds majority of
votes to make the proposal pass the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Arseven said the PICC will make a statement after their meeting
later this afternoon, adding "we'll examine the proposals and give
a clearer decision."
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is reached in the interparty commission,
analysts said the ruling coalition proposal is likely to be passed
by the parliament after the PCC accepts and submits it before March
9.
</P>
<P>
If not, as the parliament has only one more working week before
the March 11-20 break for the Muslim holiday of Feast of Sacrifice,
it is almost impossible to establish a consensus among the parties
on an amendment package and have it passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PCC rejected, by 13 votes to 9 in a clear partisan
line, a proposal on constitutional amendment submitted by the main
opposition Virtue Party (FP) and True Path Party (DYP).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Strike South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters on Friday
unleashed a dozen missiles against the positions of the Iran-backed
guerrilla group Hezbollah in south Lebanon, the Israeli military
said.
</P>
<P>
The jet fighters conducted three air raids Friday morning and
targeted several villages and hills on the northern edge of the
security zone, the military added.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military gave no reasons for the conducting the
airstrikes, which generally followed Hezbollah attacks on Israeli
troops or allied militia outposts guarding the security zone, which
Israel set up in 1985 with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting
its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Hezbolah, or Party of God, killed five members of the Israeli-
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) and wounded three others in two
separate attacks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters bombed three Lebanese power stations on
February 8, causing widespread power outage and wounding at least
20 local civilians.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, seven Israeli troops have been
killed in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to withdraw the
Israeli troops from south Lebanon in July with or without reaching
a peace agreement with Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Two More Palestinians Found Dead in Taibeh Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police Friday morning
uncovered the bodies of two more Palestinians in the debris of an
apartment building in the Israeli Arab town of Taibeh, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two Palestinians, involved in a 14-hour clash with Israeli
security forces on Thursday, were reportedly buried to death
overnight when the apartment building was demolished by an Israeli
Defense forces (IDF) armored bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
It brings the death toll of the suspected terrorist group to
four. Another member of the group was under arrest immediately
after he surrendered. A sixth member, though, may be still at
large.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's clash started after Israeli security forces besieged
the building in line with an information that Palestinians with
large quantities of weapons were hiding inside and preparing
explosion devices.
</P>
<P>
An exchange of gunfire and an explosion occurred when two
Palestinians tried to leave the building, which they rented on
Wednesday night as a hideout. It was reported that one of them
carried a suitcase of explosives, which blew up in the shootout and
killed the two.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the gun battle, the operational commanders decided
to demolish the building for fear that some "terrorists" might
still hide in it with additional explosive devices and will
endanger the soldiers if they stormed the building.
</P>
<P>
The caution paid off as the captured Palestinian confessed in
the interrogation that there were still some members unaccounted
for.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources believed that these Palestinians, which
reportedly belong to the Islamic militant group Hamas, had been
preparing a large-scale suicide bomb attack in a major Israeli
city, which could cause very heavy casualties and inflict potential
catastrophic effect on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud faction's Knesset (Parliament) members
already urged the Israeli government to close up the safe-passage
route from Gaza to the West Bank, as it was reported that the "
terrorists" traveled to Taibeh through the route with forged
permits.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion will surely meet objection from the Palestinian
National Authority as the route is regarded as one of the major
peace fruits since Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power
last July.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over a permanent peace have
been deadlocked since early February over the dispute on an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have warned of a new wave of anti-Israel
terrorist acts stemming from the stalemate as Palestinian militant
groups, like Hamas, reportedly have made a "strategic decision" to
renew its bombing campaign to foil any chance of progress in the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Chief Vows to Improve Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police (PNP)
chief Panfilo Lacson Friday vowed to improve logistics management
by imposing stiff sanctions on police commanders found to
misappropriate government resources, especially those intended for
police operations.
</P>
<P>
Lacson made the vow at a conference held in Camp Crame, the PNP
headquarters, and attended by 1,733 police chiefs from various
towns and cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said that under the newly-adopted PNP logistics
management policy, only 15 percent of command resources must be
retained at the headquarters level.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of 85 percent of these resources must reach the
operating units down the line, the PNP chief said.
</P>
<P>
Lacson noted that the most common issues and problems
confronting the police stations were fuel allocation, operational
funds and manpower shortage.
</P>
<P>
Lacson assured the local police chiefs that the PNP leadership
has placed high priority on the improvement of logistics,
particularly fuel, supplies and operational funds for the police
stations.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Health Situation Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The health situation in
Cambodia is one of the poorest in Asia, but improvements have been
made in recent years, according to figures released in the
government's Public Investment Program.
</P>
<P>
A number of public health programs have made significant
progress, the figures show.The contraceptive prevalence rate
increased from 7 percent in 1995 to 16 percent in 1998 while the
rate of deaths caused by malaria was reduced from 0.7 percent to 0.
4 percent at the same time. And to date, leprosy has posed no
significant public health problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, poliomyelitis eradication appears to have been
accomplished with the last case detected in September 1997. The
Western Pacific Regional Committee of the World Health
Organization has recently confirmed that poliomyelitis has been
eradicated in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality rate has also been reduced by about 20
percent from 115 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 89.4 per 1,000
live births. The under-five mortality rate came down from 181 per
1,000 live births in 1993 to 115 per 1,000 live births in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But the figures are still much higher compared with other Asian
nations. It was reported that the death rate of under-five
children is fewer than 40 per 1,000 live births in Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, certain communicable diseases, such as HIV/
AIDS,malaria and tuberculosis remain major health problems for the
Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
In face of this situation, the government recently published a
public investment program for 2000-2002 which gives high priority
to health. Under the program, the allocation to health is the
largest,amounting to almost 332 million U.S. dollars or nearly 24
percent of the total planned public investment in the medium term.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Vehicle Sales Rise in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Total vehicle sales increased
by 17.7 percent in February compared with the same month last
year, South Africa's National Association of Automobile
Manufactures said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The association said a total of 26,785 automobiles were sold in
February, of which passenger vehicle sales were 17,748, a rise of
22.6 percent, and light commercial vehicle sales 8,173, an
increase of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Toyota captured 23.4 percent of the total market with 6,273
sales followed by Volkswagen with 4,033.
</P>
<P>
Johan van Zyl, Marketing Managing Director of Toyota South
Africa, said: "Interest rate reductions are now filtering through
into the marketplace with a higher level of activity among private
buyers."
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive.
Tax reductions announced in the new budget will put more money in
buyer's pockets and we can expect that this will add further
support to the vehicle market later in the year," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaffirms Backing of IMF Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
reiterated on Friday its unanimous support for its candidate for
the post of managing director of the International Monetary Fund (
IMF).
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate the (European) Commission's support for the
European candidate for this post," said EU spokesman Jonathan
Faull.
</P>
<P>
"There is no suggestion that the commission or anybody else is
abandoning its support, in fact there is unanimous support for
this candidate."
</P>
<P>
There was indication that Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy
finance minister, will not win unanimous IMF board member support
for the post of managing director.
</P>
<P>
At a European Council meeting on Monday, EU finance ministers
unanimously agreed to back Koch-Weser for the post as IMF managing
director.
</P>
<P>
The German deputy finance minister declared his bid three
months ago to replace the outgoing Frenchman Michel Camdessus at
the IMF helm.
</P>
<P>
Competing with Koch-Weser for the top IMF position are two
other candidates -- the IMF's acting managing director Stanley
Fischer of the United States and senior Japanese diplomat Eisuke
Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier said that it would not support the EU
candidate because the German lacks the necessary experience or the
right qualifications for the post.

<HEADLINE> EU to Grant Mozambique 25 Million Euro in Flood Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Friday
announced a 25-million-euro (24 million U.S. dollars) flood aid to
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The emergency assistance, announced by EU Humanitarian Aid
Commissioner Poul Nielson, included 4.15 million euro (3.9 million
dollars) in emergency food and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will ensure that humanitarian organizations can
continue their relief work, bringing much needed help to those who
have lost their homes and livelihoods and are now facing serious
nutrition, hygiene and health problems, said Nielson who has just
returned from a fact-finding trip to the African country.
</P>
<P>
Continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African
region, aggravated by the cyclone Eline, have led to displacement
of large numbers of people. There has been considerable damage to
housing and the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks of flooding have left 1 million people homeless and
the situation is likely to get worse as weather forecasters warned
new storms to threaten the flood-ravaged country, where an
estimated 10,000 people were feared to be still stranded on trees
and house roofs.
</P>
<P>
Nine of Mozambique's 15 rivers are still swelling from water
coming in from neighboring countries such as South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Nielson also said that the 15-nation EU will follow up
immediate humanitarian assistance with medium and long-term
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. "The remarkable
progress made in Mozambique in recent years cannot be washed aside
by what is a disaster of a monumental scale," he added.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian and American medical
experts opened a two-day symposium in Toronto Friday to discuss
the role of nutrition in prostate cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Symposium sessions will highlight the importance of natural
foods such as soy products and lycopene, a key component of
tomatoes, in prostate cancer prevention, according to organizers.

<HEADLINE> EU Financial Head: Euro Possibly an Example for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of the Economic
and Financial Committee of the European Union Jean Lemierre
suggested today that last year's successful launch of the Euro
could set an interesting precedent for Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Lemierre, who is here as head of the French treasury at the
invitation of the Chinese Finance Ministry, delivered a lecture
titled The Monetary Cooperation: the Situation in the Euro Zone
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
His speech focused on lessons drawn from the European economic
and monetary integration experience and the possible implications
for Asia.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Euro may be a useful benchmark for Asia
which is looking for greater monetary stability, adding that the
European experience has provided a guideline for Asia as it moves
to standardize its monetary system without blocking necessary
adjustments between different economies.
</P>
<P>
The interdependence of the Asian economies suggests that
relatively stable exchange rates may be desirable, considering the
weight of intra-regional trade and keen competition between Asian
economies in a third market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Figure of STDs on Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Facing the rapid spread of
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), China's public health
authority plans to regulate medical treatment services which have
nearly been ruined by quack doctors.
</P>
<P>
The amount of reported STD cases hit 836,000 last year, a rise
of 30 percent over 1998, an official with the Ministry of Health (
MOH) said today, also citing specialists' estimations which put
the real figure between six to eight million.
</P>
<P>
"STD has become a major infectious disease threatening the
people's health. More seriously, the outbreak of STDs will fan the
flames for the spread of HIV/AIDS," said Chen Xianyi, deputy
director of the MOH's Department of Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
The number of carriers of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus
which leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), exceeds
400,000 in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen admitted that medical services available for STD
patients have been exploited by quack doctors, who run illegal
clinics and post eye-catching but misleading advertising for STD
treatment in every corner of the country. The majority of the
patients would rather risk going to those clinics because they
fear being identified if they go to public hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is chaotic. Lots of so-called 'famous doctors'
lack basic medical knowledge," said an investigative report
released by the National Center for STDs and Leprosy Control.
</P>
<P>
Of 800 employees of STD clinics in south China's Shenzhen city
who took a written exam on medical knowledge, only 23 percent
passed.
</P>
<P>
"Some patients have lost their family fortune to pay for
treating the disease, but failed because the doctors use fake
medicine," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The MOH will work out standards for STD treatment this year,
focusing on regulating clinics and doctors," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and Roche Pharmaceuticals in Shanghai today
announced a joint project of regulated prevention and treatment of
STDs.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project will help train medical professionals
for STD treatment, conduct health education seminars among
patients, set up model clinics, and sponsor international and
domestic academic changes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see that the Chinese government is willing to
tackle this problem and determined to solve it. The objective and
scientific attitude from the government is much more important to
prevent and treat diseases like STDs," William Keller, general
manager of Roche Pharmaceuticals, said at today's signing ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Cranes Spent Winter at Yangtze River's Mouth to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A flock of the world's most
endangered cranes species, the hooded crane, were spotted
wintering on Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River
after a disappearance of eight years.
</P>
<P>
The 125 cranes migrated from northeast China and Siberia, and
make up the largest flock found so far in China, said zoologists
from the biological department of Shanghai Normal University.
</P>
<P>
The rare cranes first appeared 15 years ago on Chongming Island,
the third largest in China near the country's economic hub
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"There were over 200 hooded cranes at that time," said Yu Kuai,
a professor of Shanghai Normal University who discovered the birds
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"The number dropped sharply at the beginning of the 1990's as a
result of large-scale reclamation of the tidal land at the Yangtze
River's mouth to the sea," said Yu, adding that the cranes
disappeared about eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a bird protection zone covering more than 100 square
kilometers was set up on the island, and the living environment
for birds has been greatly improved, said Du Dechang, director of
the wildlife protection station in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Du said the improved environment on the island has inspired the
cranes to come back.
</P>
<P>
However, zoologists pointed out that the ecological environment
on the island has not been basically improved and the cranes are
still endangered.
</P>
<P>
The reclamation affected growth of water grass, the major food
of the wild birds. Ongoing fishing and hunting continue to
threaten the birds, zoologists said.
</P>
<P>
There are now less than 10,000 hooded cranes in the world, with
no more than 1,000 living in China. The bird is under State-level
protection in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, zoologists are still looking for some 3,000 swans,
which disappeared with the cranes at the start of 1990's as a
result of deteriorating environment on the island.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Election of NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the National People's
Congress (NPC) are members of the highest organ of state power in
China and are all elected in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
All citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached
the age of 18 have the right to vote and stand for election
irrespective of nationality, race, sex, occupation, family
background, religious belief, education, property status, or
length of residence, except persons deprived of political rights
according to law.
</P>
<P>
According to Electoral Law, county- and township-level people's
deputies are directly elected by voters, while deputies to
people's congresses above the county-level are elected by deputies
to people's congresses at the next lower level; deputies to the
NPC are elected by people's congresses in provinces, autonomous
regions and centrall-administered municipalities. The armed forces
conduct separate elections.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the NPC should be elected by secret ballot, and the
number of candidates should be greater than the number of elected
deputies by between one fifth and a half. All parties and people's
groups may jointly or separately recommend candidates for NPC
deputies, and more than ten people's deputies may recommend a
candidate. People's congresses above the county level, in electing
deputies to people's congresses at the next higher level, may
elect people other than their deputies.
</P>
<P>
The number of deputies to the NPC should not exceed 3,000, and
the distribution of the NPC deputies should be decided by the NPC
Standing Committee. The number of NPC deputies in Hong Kong and
Macao special administrative regions and electoral procedures
there should be subject to regulations made separately by the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The election committee should collect and publicize a namelist
of candidates for NPC deputies 20 days before the election, and
publicize a namelist of formal candidates five days before the
election. Electors may vote for, against, abstain from voting or
elect deputies other than, the candidates. Candidates who stand
for election as deputies to a people's congress can be deemed
elected if they receive more than half of the votes cast by
electors or deputies present. If the number of candidates who
receive more than half of the votes cast exceeds that of deputies
to be elected, only those with the greatest number of votes should
be deemed elected.
</P>
<P>
Results of the election should be declared valid or invalid by
the presidium. Expenses for the election should be paid by the
State Treasury, and election is to be presided by the NPC Standing
Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The audience, including top
Chinese leaders, burst into applause when Chairman Li Ruihuan
announced that 2,000 members of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were
attending the committee's annual session, matching the year 2000,
coincidentally.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a total of 2,207 members of the Ninth National
Committee of the CPPCC have registered for participating in the
annual conference, which has made the session the largest ever of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members are quite active at this

closely connected with the development of the economically
backward western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The members have also presented over 380 written speeches, much
more than the average 100 or so for previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1,379 local and foreign journalists have applied for
covering the event, including 262 reporters from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan and 382 correspondents from foreign countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Media and relevant government departments have tried their best
to provide the participants with sufficient data about China.
Earlier, the National Library announced it would open to CPPCC
National Committee members 24 hours a day, while the on-line
version of the People's Daily has set up a special data bank for
surfers.
</P>
<P>
Once again, the State Statistical Bureau has opened a pavilion
at the session venue, the Great Hall of the People, to inform
people of various kinds of data and information.
</P>
<P>
The number "8", which means luck for the Chinese, pops up
frequently at the current CPPCC session.
</P>
<P>
Eight local hotels in the national capital have been designated
for accommodating the convening members, while "Hanyu", or Chinese,
and seven languages used by Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, Kazak,
Korean, Yi, and Zhuang ethnic minorities are official languages
for the session.

from both China and overseas have been registered at the press
center for the third sessions of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to cover the

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: People's Congress System, NPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The people's congress system is
the fundamental political system of the People's Republic of China
(PRC), the organizational form of the state power of the Chinese
people's democratic dictatorship, and the political form of
government of China.
</P>
<P>
The system is the most direct reflection of the nature of the
PRC, indicating the status of the Chinese people of various
nationalities as masters in the country's political life.
</P>
<P>
The NPC is the highest organ of power through which the Chinese
people exercise their state power.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, China held people's congresses at different levels. In
1954, the First National People's Congress was convened, which
marked the establishment of the people's congress system.
</P>
<P>
The NPC exercises legislative power, amends the Constitution
and supervises its enforcement, formulates and amends basic
statutes and other laws; elects and decides on leading personnel
of state-level administrative, judicial, procuratorial and
military bodies, and has the right to recall them; examines and
decides on fundamental, long-term and key issues.
</P>
<P>
All administrative, judicial, procuratorial and military organs
and other state-level institutions are responsible to the NPC and
supervised by it.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee, the executive organ of the NPC, is
elected by the NPC and exercises state legislative power together
with the NPC. Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Ye Jianying, Wan Li and Qiao Shi
served as chairman of past NPC Standing Committees. Li Peng is
chairman of the current NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine terms of the NPC, eight have special committees
except the Fourth NPC which was in sessions during the "Great
Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC has established nine special committees: the
Ethnic Affairs Committee, Law Committee, Committee for Internal
and Judicial Affairs, Financial and Economic Committee, Education,
Science, Culture and Health Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee,
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Environment and Resources
Protection Committee and Agricultural and Rural Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
These committees are permanent bodies under the leadership and
supervision of both the NPC and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is
known as "the NPC Delegation". On December 8, 1983, the Third
Meeting of the Sixth NPC Standing Committee decided to join the
IPU. In April 1984, the IPU Council's 134th meeting made an
official announcement to accept the NPC Delegation as its member.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Delegation's motto is to promote mutual understanding
and friendly exchanges with parliamentary members of different
countries, develop friendship and cooperation with peoples of
different countries, and safeguard world peace.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Urges U.S. Cooperation in Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government said Friday
that U.S. cooperation is essential in fighting against narcotic
drugs in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The key point for the success of eliminating the narcotic
drugs is cooperation rather than scapegoating from the United
States which is the world's biggest market for almost all kinds of
narcotic drugs," the government said in its Information Sheet
released here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement, directed at the U.S. State Department which has
again put Myanmar on the uncooperative country list, came after
Myanmar has recently conducted a joint annual opium-yield survey
together with the United States for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
It called on the United States to put aside its political
agenda and work together with the world community seriously and
sincerely in the global fight against the narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts to eliminate narcotic drugs cannot and must not be
pushed on the shoulders of other nations while the nation itself
with the biggest drug market including the organized criminal
syndicates and major commercial banks which are running the money
laundering making fortunes is self-exempted from any kind of blame,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar believes that the U.S. government should also shoulder
its share of responsibility in the drug fight, the statement said,
adding that giving out some funds to certain countries while
scapegoating others will not solve much of the drug problem today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government announced last month that it
would continue its broad sanctions against Myanmar, saying it will
maintain such action against Myanmar until it sees movement toward
democracy,respect for human rights and cooperation on counter-
narcotic efforts.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Likely to Upgrade India's Credit Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service, a
leading international credit rating agency, is likely to upgrade
its sovereign credit rating for India from the present "stable" in
view of the budget of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the approach of the budget has been realistic and
objective and this will find a positive reflection in the rating
review of India, which will be carried out in about 12 to 18
months time," John Rutherford, president of Moody's Investors
Service, said in Bombay on Friday, according to the Press Trust of
India.
</P>
<P>
There was a 50-percent chance that the rating review would be
for the better, he said on the sidelines of an international
conference on strengthening the financial sector through the
markets.
</P>
<P>
Moody's undertook a review of India's sovereign rating in
October last year, he said, adding that for a country of India's
size it took on an average four to six weeks to carry out the
rating review process.
</P>
<P>
Aspects of the budget, which were significant from Rutherford's
view, include the government's intention to reduce its holding in
public-sector banks to 33 percent and its exit policy for the sick
public-sector enterprises.

NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Friday
hinted at a cut in the bank rate in the forthcoming credit policy
to bring down the interest rates in an effort to boost investments

a conducive atmosphere for propping investment by cutting lending
rates, Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
By cutting the general provident fund and public provident fund
and other small savings interest rates by 1 percent, the

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Denies Military Setback in Southern Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of Angola Friday
denied a report claiming that the government troops are facing
military troubles in the southern province of Cunene.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) said in the report that their forces have attacked
and then occupied the town of Chiede, 35 kilometers east to the
city of Ongiva in Cunene Province.
</P>
<P>
Such report is only a trick of propaganda by the rebels, an
official military source said. "There is neither attack, nor
occupation."
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of Angola is continuing to pursue the armed
rebel troops, which has scattered into small groups, the source
said, adding that the rebel groups are dedicating themselves to
robbing civilians of their goods and attacking some isolated
villages.
</P>
<P>
But some western media said the UNITA rebels claimed that it
had killed 464 government soldiers and policemen in the recent
combats in 11 of the 18 provinces of Angola and vowed to continue
fighting until the Luanda government accepts negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But the UNITA did not mention the casualties on its own side.
The rebels movement also urged the United Nations to name new
peace promoters for replacing the current "troika" - the United
States, Russia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA accused the current "troika" of being selfish on the
issue of the Angolan civil conflicts, saying that that U.S.
exclusively wants Angolan oil.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Plans to Turn Nacala Air Base Into International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
considering a plan to transform part of an air base in its
northern Mozambican port city of Nacala into an international
airport, Mozambique News Agency reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The necessary paperwork is being analysed at the relevant
institutions, namely the ministries of defence, and of transport
and communications, the report quoted Major Jose Caetano in Nacala
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Caetano said the negotiations are at an advanced stage, but a
deep study on the future implications of building such an airport
stills needs to be undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Developing an airport would also be in the context of the
Nacala Development Corridor -- the line of rail from Nacala to
Malawi. Traffic at the Nacala air base has been increasing lately,
and it was necessary to rethink its role, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Monteiro, provincial director of the Transport and
Telecommunications, confirmed the government's intention to
transform the airport, saying that the documentation is currently
being analysed at the highest level of the two ministries.
</P>
<P>
The air base runway is 2,450 metres long, which makes it the
longest of all the northern region's runways.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
ambassador to South Africa Micheal Laidler defended on Friday that
EU has committed millions of U.S. dollars to Mozambique, hitting
back at criticism of EU's slowness of reaction to the
flood-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
Laidler said that in the past three or four days EU has donated
five million rand (about 800,000 dollars) to Mozambique for
immediate relief and another 25 million rand (about four million
dollars) will be deployed in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
EU is also expected to offer 125 million rand (20 million
dollars) over the next year for Mozambique's long-term
rehabilitation, Laidler added.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be channelled through non-governmental
organizations who are currently working in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that between 800,000 and one million Mozambicans

<HEADLINE> Angolan Separatists Warn of Instability in Enclave Cabinda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Separatists in the Angolan
northwest enclave province of Cabinda have alleged that political
and military instability will mount up within "the next few days",
according to information reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate response from the Angolan government to
the separatists' allegation.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the separatist Renewed Cabinda Enclave
Liberation Front warned all foreigners to leave Cabinda as soon as
possible and also warned truck drivers not to transport government
soldiers for "ensuring the security of their vehicles."
</P>
<P>
The separatists claimed a recent but unspecified victory over
the Angolan government troops, saying that the battle caused over
10 deaths.
</P>
<P>
They said that on February 18, the Angolan government troops
attacked the village of Viedi, a base of the separatists located
some 170 kilometers northeast to the provincial capital Cabinda.
</P>
<P>
The enclave of Cabinda is separated from the rest of Angola by
a 40- kilometer strip of territory belonging to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Cabinda is the richest province in Angola, mainly due to the
abundant oil reserve. Annually, Cabinda produces 53 percent of
the Angolan petroleum.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, there are many Western oil companies operating
in the province, including the U.S. Cabinda Gulf Oil Company
(CABGOC), the French ELF and the Italian AGIP.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan-Rwandan Relations on Track Again: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Uganda and
Rwanda have been put on track again, a senior Ugandan Foreign
Ministry official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no misunderstanding between the leadership" of the
two countries, James Baba, Director for Regional Cooperation in
the Ugandan Foreign Ministry, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been trying to clear misunderstanding between
Kampala and Kigali since the Kisangani incident, Baba said, adding
that tremendous progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda will set up a permanent joint commission to
discuss bilateral trade relations and cooperation in other fields,
he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"The Kisangani incident is very unfortunate. It was the
reckless army commanders to blame," the Uganda official said.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Ugandan and Rwandan troops, who began to support
different factions of Congolese rebels in April 1999, exchanged
fire and both sides sustained heavy casualties in the northern
town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both countries met in time to stop escalation of
the shoot- out.
</P>
<P>
Baba admitted that the Kisangani issue really sent bilateral
ties into an all-time low, but said that it would not destroy
their relations because the two countries need each other.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic about Uganda's relations with neighboring
countries like the DRC and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
With incoming of U.N. peace-keepers, the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement for the DRC would be better implemented by all the
parties. "All people are tired of fighting," Baba noted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been close allies since 1994. Both of
them are backing rebels fighting to topple the DRC government led
by President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Army Denies Report of Car Robberies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) has denied media reports that it had been involved in
rampant car robberies in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement signed Thursday night by the Deputy Army
Commander, the UPDF accused the authors of such reports of
having malicious intention of portraying the army and the
government as having abdicated their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper, the leading daily in Uganda,
reported Thursday that some government army officers had been
implicated in four- drive vehicle robbery in the capital city of
Kampala and they were accused of using army planes to transport
the stolen vehicles to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said:"The UPDF would like to protest in the
strongest terms against your lead story of Thursday March 2, 2000
tilted "Stolen Cars Flown out of Entebbe", adding that the army
does not exonerate any individual and other related acts, it
cannot conduct or any way condone such acts of organized crime
within its ranks.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said that the planes which were used to
ferry the stolen cars would bring back timber and other things
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Ugandan army reacted so strongly to
such allegations. There used to be reports alleging that some
senior army officers were smuggling from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into the DRC soon after the civil war broke
out in August of 1998. The Ugandan troops have been deployed in
the eastern part of the DRC to back up rebels fighting the
Kinshasa government.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Continue to Back Sudanese Rebels: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya has said
that his country would not abandon moral support to the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when appearing before a parliamentary
committee on presidential and foreign affairs Thursday, the New
Vision reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He described SPLA soldiers, who have been fighting the
Khartoum government over the past 17 years, as brothers and said
that Uganda supports the SPLA in order to help solve the southern
Sudanese problem.
</P>
<P>
If that problem was not solved, there could be no peace in the
region, he said. The senior Ugandan official also justified
SPLA's last year meeting in Kampala, saying the idea was to work
out a solution for the southern Sudanese problem.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan have been accusing each other of backing
rebel activities on their respective soil. They signed a peace
accord in Nairobi, Kenya, last December in an attempt to cease
hostility and restore full diplomatic ties suspended since April
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugandan President has on several occasions expressed
 dissatisfaction with Khartoum's progress in implementing the
agreement and ministers from both countries are meeting in
Nairobi to map out better strategies for improvement of bilateral
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) will
continue to list Africa as its focus in food aid delivery
operations, WFP African Bureau Director Mohamed Zejjari said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
WFP will continue to strengthen operations in Africa by
assisting the people in fighting against food shortage and
poverty, Zejjari said, noting that special assistance will be
given to children and women on the continent.
</P>
<P>
More food aid would be delivered to Africa, especially to those
affected by war and natural disasters like drought and floods, the
WFP official said.
</P>
<P>
He urged WFP partners to cooperate more closely with the U.N.
food agency in helping lift Africans out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zejjari admitted that WFP's food resources are far from enough
and they are experiencing a food aid crisis as before. In
addition to the donated food, WFP should buy more food to feed
Africans suffering from chronic food shortage, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by WFP, it delivered a total of
3.3 million tons of food to people in need worldwide in 1999 and
about one- third of the food was delivered to Africa.
</P>
<P>
WFP would react in time to emergencies like wars in the Great
Lakes region and the flooding in Mozambique, the official said.
</P>
<P>
But due to transport problems, most of food deliveries were
conducted by airlift, making the cost of food delivery in Africa
account for 50 percent of WFP's total expenses in this aspect
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of 102 WFP operations approved in 1999, 53 are for
Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have unearthed eight
ships dating back to 1,200 years in the city of Huaibei, in east
China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The ships, belonging to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), were
discovered five to six meters underground, on the southern side of
an ancient route of the Grand Canal, in the historical town of
Liuziji in the city.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists found white, green, yellow chinaware,
pottery and ironware in the damaged and carbonized ships, believed
to submerge in accidents. Several ships can still be restored.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also found a cargo harbor of Song Dynasty (960-
1279) in Liuziji. This is the first ancient cargo harbor
discovered along the 1,794-kilometer canal which extends from
north China's Beijing to east China's Hangzhou City in Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Historians said that the discoveries have resolved disputes
over the route of an ancient river, Bianhe.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Canal was built first in the fifth century B.C. and
later extended in the Sui (581-618) and Yuan dynasties (1271-1368).

<HEADLINE> Abducted Polish Ambassador in Good Health: Yemeni PMM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-
Iryani said on Friday Polish ambassador to Yemen Krzysztof
Suprowicz who was abducted Wednesday night is in good health.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government is negotiating with the kidnappers for the
release of Krzysztof, he said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who belong to the Khawlan tribe, are demanding
the release of a jailed tribe member.
</P>
<P>
Khawlan is among the biggest and most powerful of the hundreds
of tribes in the small and poor country on the tip of the Arabian
peninsular. It has been known for its habitual abduction of
foreigners as bargaining chips when it was in disputes with local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Krzysztof was abducted outside a medical clinic in southern
Sanaa by armed tribesmen and was taken to a mountainous area 60
kilometers east of the Yemeni capital. Government troops have
sealed off the area.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time an ambassador has been kidnapped in
Yemen, where kidnapings of foreigners, including less senior
diplomats, by tribesmen were common in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen often used the hostages, mostly Westerners, to
squeeze the government or foreign oil companies to meet their
demands. The kidnapped were usually released unharmed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Put Forth Masterplan on K-Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is scheduled to come
out with a masterplan on K-economy (economy based on knowledge) in
six months, Deputy Finance Minister Shafie Mohd Salleh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This move demonstrates the government's effort to intensify the
development of information technology (IT) and hence, the people
must now make a paradigm shift from an economy based on production
(P-economy) to one based on knowledge (K-economy), he said in
Cyberjaya near here.
</P>
<P>
"We see Malaysia transforming slowly from P-economy to K-
economy along with the growth in the country's IT industry and the
acceptance of IT by the people at large," he told reporters after
a function.
</P>
<P>
He said the Finance Ministry would sign a memorandum of
understanding with the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies (ISIS), Malaysia to outline the details of the terms of
reference for the masterplan.
</P>
<P>
The masterplan would, among other things, seek ways on
including knowledge and information as a component of the
Malaysian economy's total factor of productivity (TFP), he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said K-economy could be expected to
contribute positively to enhancing prosperity and infrastructure
as well as improving the country's per capita income.
</P>
<P>
Noting that K-economy could only be achieved with higher usage
of the personal computer (PCs), he said the usage of PCs among
Malaysians need to be increased.
</P>
<P>
At present, the computer penetration rate in Malaysia is only 1.
5 percent among its 22-million population.

Palestinian people of their inalienable rights.

the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment
of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State.
</P>

support for the exercise of the Palestinian people of its
inalienable right.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which

for the Middle East peace process, must be adhered to," said the
Declaration, adding that "the United Nations should grant full
membership to Palestine to enable it to participate fully in the
United Nations Millennium Summit to be held on September 6, 2000."

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Taliban Plane Returns to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A jet of Afghanistan's Ariana
Airlines, which was hijacked on a domestic flight and flew to
London last month, returned to Afghanistan Friday,said the Afghan
Islamic Press (AIP).
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 landed at Mazar-i-Sharif airport in northern
Afghanistan at about 12:10 p.m. local time (07:10 GMT), AIP quoted
an Ariana operations official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the plane had been due to land at the Afghan
capital of Kabul but was diverted because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was hijacked on a flight from Kabul to Mazar-i-
Sharif in early February and was forced to fly through Central
Asia to London. After the peaceful solution of the hijacking case,
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime has repeatedly urged the
British authorities to turn back the plane and the passengers.
</P>
<P>
Britain, however, said Wednesday that it will give refugee
status to eight of the passengers while turning down asylum
requests from a further 27 people and their five dependents.
</P>
<P>
British police have charged 14 people in connection with the
hijacking. More than 70 passengers returned to Afghanistan last
month.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Agrees not to Run for Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour has accepted the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party's
decision to bar constitutional amendments which would allow him to
contest for an unprecedented third term of presidency, Tanzanian
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in public for the first time since the CCM National
Executive Committee (NEC) made the decision last Saturday, the
president, who is also vice chairman of CCM (Zanzibar), told the
party elders in Zanzibar's South Region that the party's code
required them to respect the decision because it was final.
</P>
<P>
He called on CCM members and followers to unite and map out
strategies to win the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The NEC meeting held last week said the proposals to change the
Island's constitution to enable the president to vie for a third
five-year term would be discussed at a later date after the
general elections to be held on mainland Tanzania and the Island
in October.
</P>
<P>
This means the incumbent president, who has been holding the
presidency since 1990, will not run for the post again.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say CCM made the decision because it views Salmin's
move as a risk to the Union. The largest opposition party Civic
United Front, which is based in Zanzibar and strives for
independence of the island state, strongly opposes the
constitutional amendment plan.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
It became a semi-autonomous state in Tanzania, with its own
government and parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has seen the
establishment of 11,500 enterprises funded by companies from
elsewhere in the country, with total registered capital of more
than 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises generated a combined 30 billion yuan in
output value last year, contributing nearly one percent to
Shanghai's 10.2 percent GDP growth rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing flow of domestic investment into Shanghai is due
to the city's introduction of favorable policies for domestic
investors in loans, housing, citizenship, and education for their
children.
</P>
<P>
Legend Group, a Beijing-based computer giant, realized 700
million yuan in output value in Shanghai in 1997, as much as 1.2
billion yuan in 1998, and up to 2 billion yuan last year.
</P>

Domestic enterprises have been focusing their investment in
Shanghai in such sectors as services, agriculture, stocks, real

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Changchun, the capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province, has cashed in on the unusual
cold winter, the coldest in more than a decade nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The city's tourism festival featuring ice and snow, which

<HEADLINE> HK Government Publishes 2000-01 Spending Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government Friday published its draft
estimates of expenditure for the fiscal year 2000-01, which sets
the total government spending at 244 billion HK dollars (31
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total government expenditure has reached the target set by
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who announced last year in his
budget speech that the government would contain the growth in
government spending in 2000-01 to 3 percent in real terms over the
original estimates for 1999-2000, said Denise Yue, Secretary for
the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
According to Yue, the total spending includes 194 billion HK
dollars (24.9 billion U.S. dollars) for the recurrent expenses of
existing and new services and 50 billion HK dollars (6.4 billion U.
S. dollars) capital expenditure including major infrastructural
works and various loan assistance schemes.
</P>
<P>
The growth in recurrent spending in 2000-01 has been held down
to 2.5 percent in real terms over the original estimate, but
because of the substantial savings in 2000-01 the growth over the
revised estimate for 1999-2000 would reach 5.7 percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
Within this overall growth, Yue said, recurrent spending on
social welfare would grow by 9.2 percent to nearly 30 billion HK
dollars (3.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000-01, over the revised
estimate for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Though the growth rate in recurrent spending on social welfare
had been contained to single-digits, she said welfare spending
still showed a real growth of 88 percent over five years. As a
result, welfare spending as a share of total public recurrent
expenditure would increase from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 14.2
percent in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
"Much of this increase is needed to meet increased demand under
our various social security schemes; particularly an increase in
cases under the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme."
She said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Security sources warned that the potentially deadly bombing
attack by a Palestinian terror squad thwarted early Thursday
morning in the Israeli Arab town of Taibeh is a sign of Hamas'
renewed intention to carry out massive terror attacks to destroy
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the operation by a combined force of police, security unit
and army, three members of the squad were killed and another
believed to be buried in the rubble of the destroyed house. A fifth
was captured. Israeli Army Radio reported a sixth member of the
gang is being sought.
</P>
<P>
The assault began Thursday morning when security personnel
surrounded the house, and ended in a sustained burst of gunfire
some 13 hours later, as an Israel Defense Forces armored bulldozer
was in the process of demolishing the building.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As he watched events unfolding in Taibeh, Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the widespread practice of
Palestinians living illegally in Arab villages inside Israel must
be stopped. He said he had called a meeting on the issue in his
office to seek solutions to this problem.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said the dialogue with the Palestinian National
Authority must be expanded to make new efforts to prevent terror
attacks against Israelis. Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu
Meddein said the PNA will help Israel investigate the Taibeh
affair.
</P>
<P>
Security officials are checking whether the terrorist squad was
helped by any Israeli Arab citizens in the Arab town.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Security sources believe that the armed Palestinians in the
Taibeh incident were members of Hamas, the Islamic militant group,
on their way to launch several suicide attacks in the Sharon and
Dan regions on Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Friday is the fourth anniversary of the bomb attack on a
Jerusalem bus, and the sixth anniversary of the massacre in the
Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, in which innocent Arabs were
murdered by Israeli extremists.
</P>
<P>
Saturday is also the fourth anniversary of the Dizengoff Center
bombing in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- According to experts on Hamas, the Taibeh operation had been
very carefully planned and would have involved coordination between
Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, which is an unusual event.
</P>
<P>
Senior security sources said the terrorists might travel to
Taibeh using the safe-passage route from Gaza to the West Bank with
forged permits. After reaching Hebron, it is believed, they
continued their journey to Tulkarm, where they received explosives
from another Hamas group, and from there crossed the Green Line to
Taibeh.
</P>
<P>
One source said they were likely trained by arch-bomber
Mohanmmed Deif, the No. 1 fugitive believed to be operating in
Gaza. According to the source, the decision for a "strategic"
attack came from the Hamas leadership, including Khaled Mashaal in
Qatar, Imad Alami in Damascus, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Russian Mafia May be Linked to Disappearance of Saudi Millionaire in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' police have suspected the
disappearance of a Saudi millionaire from his residence in
Limassol, southwest Cyprus, may be linked to a Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
Rakan Khalied Hathleen, 52, have been missing since early
February and Cyprus' police have been on his trail, local
newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interpol has already mobilized to track down the
man's whereabouts, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Ambassador to Greece is reportedly on his way here to
be briefed by Cyprus police on the case.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Justice Minister Nicos Koshis hinted a criminal ring may
be behind Hathleen's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
A Russian woman, who was reportedly living with Hathleen at the
time of his disappearance, has also vanished.
</P>
<P>
Koshis confirmed both the woman and her 20-year-old son have
left the island and Interprol has been notified.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 70,000 U.S. dollars from the Saudi man's bank
account has gone missing and authorities have frozen the account.
</P>
<P>
Hathleen's brother and son have arrived from Saudi Arabia to aid
in local investigations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Approves Economic Recovery Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's efforts to restore
economic stability are set to begin soon after the cabinet
Thursday approved an 18- month economic recovery program, The
Herald newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the National Economic Planning Commission Richard Hove
said Thursday the approval will ensure that the program kicks off
with the implementation of measures to bring down inflation and
interest rates to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
The program is also aimed at stabilizing the value of the
Zimbabwean dollar and resolving the persistent foreign currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean economy has been in a precarious position with a
growth rate averaging 0.6 percent during the last three years
against a population growth of around three percent, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year inflation averaged 59 percent, a dramatic rise from
18.8 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Some Nigerian States Likely not to Suspend Sharia Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Sani, governor of Nigeria's
northern State of Zamfara, has assured non-Moslems of safety, but
making no mention of suspending the controversial Islamic law of
Sharia in his state, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The state which was the first to adopt Sharia in Nigeria in
January, reiterated in the radio broadcast on Thursday that Sharia
had nothing to do with non-Moslems, saying the riot in northern
city of Kaduna and other areas was not caused by religion.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Christians and Moslems who demand introduction
of Sharia left hundreds of people dead in Kaduna last week, and
prompted the riot in southeastern city of Aba.
</P>
<P>
Governors of Nigeria's 36 states decided in an emergency
meeting in capital Abuja on Tuesday to stop the implementation of
Sharia in a bid to check the violence.
</P>
<P>
But the governors of the three northern states of Zamfara,
Kebbi and Sokoto met on Wednesday and agreed to go ahead with
implementing Sharia, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
The Niger state, however, on Wednesday withdrew all the bills
on Sharia recently passed by the state's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"If suspending Sharia is the sacrifice some of us have to make
to sustain the nation's unity, I abide by it," said Niger State
Governor Abdulkadir Kure, who announced last month that his state
would follow Zamfara's suit to adopt Sharia early May.

<HEADLINE> 16 Russian Soldiers Killed in Rebel Attack Near Grozny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen soldiers of a Russian elite
unit were killed and 21 others injured on Thursday in a rebel
ambush attack outside the Chechen capital of Grozny, said the
press center of the Russian joint forces in the North Caucasus
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the exact casualties figure in a latest official
release, the press center said a federal auto column of OMON (
special task police unit) was caught in a sudden attack mounted by
rebels near a checkpoint in the settlement of Pervomaiskoye, a
Grozny suburb.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fired at them with submachine guns and grenade-
launchers from an ambush position in foothills. Sixteen OMON
servicemen were killed and 21 injured with two trucks burned in
the fighting, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Some of the attackers, estimated at 20, were killed, while
others were scattered by Russian retaliating fire.
</P>
<P>
The OMON unit was assigned to Chechnya from Sergiyev Posad, a
town in the Moscow region, and was entering Grozny as a
replacement, according to the press center.
</P>
<P>
It was the first clash reported by the Russian military near
Grozny, since the city was seized by Russian troops several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov predicted in an interview
with U.S.-funded Radio Liberty on Thursday that the war in
Chechnya between the rebels and the Russian troops would be a long
one and that his fighters were still resisting Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov also said he was ready for peace talks, but Acting
Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking to reporters, quickly
dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
Russia's main spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
the only people in Moscow who would talk with Maskhadov were
prosecutors and the police and that Maskhadov must answer charges
of fomenting rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian military is still combing shattered
buildings for mines in Grozny and keeps the town largely shut,
said the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russia claimed seizure of Shatoi, the last major
Chechen stronghold in the Argun gorge, south of Grozny, and
announced an end to the five-month anti-terrorist war.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev was quoted by
Russian news agencies as saying that between 1,500 and 3,000
rebels were at large and warned his troops against relaxing to
avoid loss in possible surprise rebel attacks.

<HEADLINE> China Grants Yuan Business Licenses to Seven Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (BOC),
the country's central bank, announced here today that it has
granted licenses to seven foreign banks to engage in yuan business
in China.
</P>
<P>
The banks are the Shanghai branches of the Commercial Bank of
Germany, the ANZ Banking Group, the Asahi Bank of Japan, and the
Korea Development Bank, and the Shenzhen branches of the Sanwa
Bank and the Fuji Bank, among others.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the BOC said this move marks the further
opening of China's financial sector and will bring new
opportunities and challenges to the Chinese economy and its
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
China opened yuan business to foreign banks in early 1997, when
the BOC approved nine foreign banks to engage in this business on
an experimental basis in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
To date, the BOC has given yuan licenses to 32 foreign banks,
including 24 in Shanghai and eight in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The opening of China's financial market has been a gradual
process over the last two decades, from coastal areas to the
interior, and from foreign currency to the yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, restrictions on the operations of
foreign banks and their business range and customers category have
been improved remarkably.

<HEADLINE> China Completes 4 Million Hectares of Afforestation In 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest statistics
from the State Forestry Administration, China completed 4.05
million hectares of afforestation last year.
</P>
<P>
Mountain passes were sealed to create 5.7 million hectares of
forest, and 514,000 hectares of farmland was turned into woodlands.
</P>
<P>
Many local governments, including Hebei and Shanxi provinces,
held forestry work conferences and put afforestation into effect
by signing contracts with relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 million man-hours were used in the voluntary planting
of 2.2 billion trees, while donation from enterprises and
individuals helped create 19,000 hectares of afforestation.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the country's strategy of developing the
western regions, the central government allowed preferential
policies for afforestation of areas at the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River and the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Now, raising the quality and design of forests and spreading
drought-defying technology have become focal points in the work of
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Also, to encourage farmers to plant trees, many local
governments employed joint-stock and joint management systems for
afforestation in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Expanding Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian National Police (Polri)
chief Gen. Roesdihardjo on Friday expressed the hope that the
country would achieve a ratio of one policeman to 800 citizens.
</P>
<P>
Roesdihardjo issued here a statement to this effect in response
to President Abdurrahman Wahid who wants to expand the police
number to 600,000 personnel from the current strength of 212,299.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the police force on Thursday, the president said
that he'll never be satisfied until the Polri staffing levels
reach 600,000, or around 3 percent of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
"It should be kept in mind that Polri number is now very small,
amounting to less than one percent of our 210 million population.
They should be at least 3 percent of the population," Wahid said,
adding that the figure of 600,000 was set after considering the
serious challenges and responsibilities to be faced by the Polri
in future.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that expanding the police force will entail
financing difficulties, Roesdihardjo said he believed that the
government would be able to come up with the fund so that the plan
to enlarge the force could materialize soon.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo has said that the
government has agreed to increase special allowance for
operational activities of the Polri which will be included into
the new state budget for the fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Incumbent President Leads in First Round of Senegal's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAKAR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Senegalese President Abdou Diouf led
in the first round of the presidential election with 41.33 percent
of the vote, but fell short of an outright win, according to
provisional official figures released here.
</P>
<P>
The president's main rival, Abdoulaye Wade, got 30.97 percent
of the vote, Dakar's Court of Appeal said in its latest statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, Diouf, leader of the ruling Socialist
Party, received 690,886 votes, against 517,642 for Wade.
</P>
<P>
Since both failed to get the 50 percent necessary for election,
the nation will see a second round of voting on March 19 this year,
the first run-off election since the country won independence from
France 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president and his arch-rival will now square off in the
second round while the other candidates have been kicked out.
</P>
<P>
Out of 2,741,940 registered electors, 1,694,828 took part in
the first round of the election.
</P>
<P>
The run-off election between Diouf and Wade will take place
shortly after the official proclamation of the first round results,
which are expected to be around March 15 at the latest by the
Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
International observers spoke highly of the elections, saying
that scattered violence and logistical problems did not tarnish
the voting.
</P>
<P>
Senegal, one of the most stable countries in Africa, has never
had a military coup and has been holding multi-party elections
since the mid-1970s.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Bioenvironment along China's 3rd Largest River Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A National People's Congress (NPC)
deputy from south China's Zhuang Autonomous Region, said he will
submit a motion to the 3rd Annual Session of the 9th NPC as he is
filled with anxiety for deteriorating bioenvironmental conditions
along the Pearl River, China's third largest which runs through
the region where he lives.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, Yang Caishou will suggest greater efforts be
made for the protection of bioenvironment along the river, and
that local poverty-stricken population be financed by the
government for returning some of their farmland to forests.
</P>
<P>
Environmental conditions along the Pearl River delta, with
south China's largest industrial city of Guangzhou as the center,
have been increasingly deteriorating due to bustling human
activities. Timber felling went rampant in his home town and
forests gave way to reclaimed farmland, which had caused severe
soil erosion and frequent flooding.
</P>
<P>
To halt unrestricted tree-cutting is the basis for protecting
local environment but, to curb rampant deforestation has to rely
on the efforts to resolving the problems of feeding and clothing
local needy fellow farmers in the area where the river rises, Yang
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC deputy, Baise and Hechi prefectures are
major source areas for the river, where there are 19 abject
poverty-stricken counties with a combined population of over 7.3
million needy people, and 85 of whom belong to ethnic minority
groups, who have only an average of 0.07 ha of cultivated land per
person.
</P>
<P>
Yang suggests the central government pay great attention to
bioenvironmental problems in the river valley, adopt similar
policies that have been worked out for the upper and middle
reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow river areas, in a bid to end
food shortage for local needy families and enable them to turn a
new life after they return farmland to forests.

CPPCC National Committee, electing some new members to the CPPCC
National Committee's Standing Committee, and deliberating and

</P>
<P>

delivered a report on the work of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth CPPCC National Committee at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>

Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the third and
fourth plenary sessions of the 15th CPC Central Committee,
earnestly exercised its functions and made important contributions

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Continues in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus had a heavy fall of rain
and snow recently but it is unlikely to bring much relief to the
island's shrinking water reserves.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, precipitation averaged 16.5 millimeter over a 24-
hour period. In the plains, rainfall ranged from 7 to 15
millimeters, while 30 to 40 millimeters fell in the mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>
Even with this welcome precipitation, Cyprus is still much drier
than it should be. Rainfall for February was only 86 percent of the
usual amount, with 70 millimeters of the usual 81.6.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological Service statistics show the total rainfall in
Cyprus since October is only 61 percent of the normal amount for
the autumn and winter seasons.
</P>
<P>
Current water levels in the island's reservoirs are only about
half of what they were at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Water Development Department show the
island's dams hold a total of 35.8 million cubic metres of water.
Last year the amount was 58.6 million cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Nicosia's Water Board Financial Director Nicos Zambakides said
Thursday night water cuts will become stricter in the coming months
with water flowing to households only twice a week instead of three
times at present.

<HEADLINE> More Filipino Women Practice Family Planning: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of Filipino women
who are using methods of family planning has increased from 46.5
percent in 1998 to 49.3 percent in 1999, according to the result
of a survey available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office said after the accomplishment of
the survey that the increase of new acceptors and users of family
planning methods indicates that there is an increasing number of
women and couples who aspire to have well-planned families.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to reach out to women and couples
who want to practice family planning but do not have information
on and access to the methods, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 28,306 women aged 15 to 49 were interviewed in the
family planning survey.From 1998 to 1999, the contraceptive
prevalence rate increased for both modern and traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the annual birthrate in the
Philippines has risen to 2.3 percent, one of the highest rates in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that if the pace is not dramatically reduced,
the country's population, now 75 million, will exceed 100 million
by 2009.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Travel Rescue Insurance Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a travel rescue
insurance policy to offer timely aid to the travelers in trouble
on the trips.
</P>
<P>
The insurance policy features low charges, and broad coverage,
which will ensure the travelers to get services as hospitalization,
change of hospitals, return to home country, and body or ashes'
return to home country, said Liu Jinglun, the president of the
China Taikang Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The insurance policy was jointly designed by the China Taikang
Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and the rescue center of the China
International Tourist Service.
</P>
<P>
The round-the-clock service hot line is 008610-66013028. And
the insurance is an at-once payment when accidents happen, instead
of the usual means of paying compensation afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Records show that more accidents have happened as the number of
tourists from and to overseas has increased steadily in the past
few years. And the usual accident insurance will not provide
sufficient and immediate help to the travelers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of overseas travelers to China
in 1998 was about 63.47 million, and 8.43 million Chinese went
overseas for travel purpose.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Confident about Growing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that China's
Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) dipped a little in January
but most consumers are optimistic about healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of consumer confidence released today
by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the ICE stood at 95.2
points, 0.1 point lower than the previous month.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of those surveyed said they expect the
national economy to grow faster this year than in 1999, and 61
percent foresee a sustained boom over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey also reveals a weakening confidence in
family economic status, as concerns about employment, education,
medical care, insurance and housing weigh heavily on the budgets
of many families.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of consumers said they believe this is the
right time to buy household appliances, according to the Index of
Consumer Sentiment (ICS), which rose a bit higher compared with
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
 Consumer indexes, including the ICE, ICS, and Index of
Current Economic Conditions (ICC), are used internationally as
indicators of the overall economic situations and consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bureau said that worry about insufficient
income hinders future consumer spending, thus making the
stimulation of domestic demand more difficult.
</P>
<P>
They called for greater efforts aimed at developing a sound
social security system while increasing salaries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's related departments are
enhancing efforts to protect foreign trade marks and fight against
counterfeit products to improve the investment environment and
safeguard foreign investors' rights and interests in China.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce said that China handled 1,810 cases
involving violations and the counterfeiting of foreign trade marks
in 1999, up 43.6 percent from the previous year. Penalties for
these illegal activities were more severe than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bai Dahua, deputy director of the administration, said China
will further increase the penalties this year, and stricter
supervision will be carried out nationwide on a number of famous
brand names.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the Trade Mark Protection List of Key
Enterprises drafted last year will be revised, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the revision of the Trade Mark Law,
which was promulgated in 1994, is progressing steadily. The
revision will include regulations for solving problematic trade
mark cases and conflicting cases involving enterprise trade marks.
</P>
<P>
The administration also plans to cooperate with the European
Union on protecting property rights. A nationwide network on trade
mark protection will be established by August this year, providing
technological backup to local law enforcers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up efforts to
develop offshore natural gas in the country's coastal areas in a
bid to adjust energy structure and increase the supply of clean
and high-quality energy for the developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and
Jiangsu are the most economically vibrant coastal regions in China,
and they need an increasing amount of clean and high-quality
energy, according to a senior official with the China National
Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
Their combined energy demand will top 470 million tons of
standard coal by 2005, and 610 million tons by 2010, said the
official, stressing that developing offshore gas is important for
the region's sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is very rich in offshore gas reserves, and
the country has developed a group of important gas production
centers in the South China Sea, Bohai Sea, and the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that the western South China Sea is a
key gas source, and four gas fields and 15 gas-bearing structures
have been found there.

Foreign enterprises with investments in China have also formed
alliances to protect their interests. The Quality Brands
Protection Committee (QBPC) under the China Association of Foreign-
Funded Enterprises was unveiled yesterday to fight counterfeiting.
This coalition was formed by 28 multinationals with a total
investment of over 6 billion U.S. dollars, including Coca-Cola and
Adidas.
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to cooperate with Chinese government
agencies to advocate legal and enforcement reforms and raise the

<P>
"Counterfeiting is a serious impediment to multinational's
current business and future investment in China," said Joseph

</P>
<P>
He hopes that "the collaborative approach will bring more
experience, expertise, and resources" to the protection of
property rights in China.
</P>
<P>
The powerful mass media are also lending a hand, trying various
ways to inform the Chinese public about trade marks and promote "
brand name consumption". They also utilize public channels such as
TV, newspapers, and the Internet to release news on crackdowns on
trade mark violations and counterfeiting.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua)-- The reduction of fixed charges for
telephones and mobile phones have brought a fortune of 38.7
billion yuan in revenues to China's telecommunications industry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Strictly Punish Officials Violating Land Use Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation has been issued
jointly by the ministries of supervision and land resources
concerning the punishment of governmental officials who violate
the country's land use law.
</P>
<P>
This was the first regulation signed by Tian Fengshan, the
newly appointed minister of land resources. The new regulation
will help ensure the implementation of China's strict land use law.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wensheng, vice-minister of land resources, said that the
revised land use law which went into effect in 1999 stipulates
that governmental officials involved in dealing in land or the
illegal use of land will receive administrative sanction.
</P>
<P>
However, this law does not pinpoint the standards for the
sanction, said Sun, adding that the new regulation will make
punishment more feasible.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an increasing number of officials in local
governments have violated land use laws and regulations to gain
instant economic benefits. But most of these officials were not
punished because of the lack of specific sanction regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinbao, vice-director of the bureau of law enforcement
and supervision under the Ministry of Land Resources, said the
bureau received 4,049 letters reporting land use infractions last
year, and 57.9 percent of them involved government officials.
</P>
<P>
Only five percent of the cases involving officials violating
the land use law have been settled, said Zhang, and the
punishments were only forfeits or fines.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, officials violating the law
will be demoted or fired, added Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, the illegal use of land by officials and
local governments has been one of the major factors decreasing the
amount of China's arable land.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Knowledge Publishing
House plans to publish its second novel on the Web entitled "We
Met In 1999" in April this year following its first web novel "
First Intimate Encounter" published last December.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Defang, the chief editor said that publishing literature
on the web provides a new space to develop literary works."
</P>
<P>
Websites now provide writers the opportunity to flex their
literary muscles. It also gives publishing houses the opportunity
to scout around in cyberspace for literary talent.
</P>
<P>
Writers and readers alike can exchange all kinds of views on
the Net and even discuss plots. However, reading serial novels on
the Net may sometimes be hard to satisfy all readers because
unlike books, they have to wait for the next installment, said
Zhai.
</P>
<P>
"First Intimate Encounter" tells of a tragic love story between
the two leading characters, "Disreputable Cai" and "Flying Dance".
The novel sold extremely well when it came out last year. Zhai
said that 60,000 copies have been sold and another 20,000 will be
published.
</P>
<P>
"The layout of the novel is quite unique and combines
expressions peculiar to the net and Taiwanese Mandarin. The novel
gives readers a sense of freshness, humor, and charm," said Zhai.
</P>
<P>
" I fell into tears when I read the novel, not because I share
similar experiences, but it made me realize how hard to find one's
true love. We should never turn away from love when it finally
comes to us," said Bobo in an email to the Taiwan writer Cai
Zhiheng (pinyin pronunciation).
</P>
<P>
The Knowledge Publishing House will publish a series of novels
on the Net. The China Social Sciences Publishing House issued
another on-line novel entitled "Goodbye to Wei'an" in January.
Three or four other publishing houses in China have also shown
great interest in publishing on-line novels.

The strategy of sustainable development is a basic state policy
of China and an important topic for the CPPCC to participate in
deliberation and administration of state affairs. Over the past
few years, the CPPCC National Committee has conducted quite a
number of fact-finding and research projects on the implementation
of this strategy in many areas, which yielded important results.
Last year, the issue of environment and development was put on the
agenda of the sixth Standing Committee meeting. At the meeting,
Chairman of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee Li Ruihuan
delivered an important speech entitled, "Questions Concerning
Afforestation in China," and Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao of the State
Council delivered a report entitled "Following a Strategy of
Sustainable Development to Promote Balanced Development of the
Environment and the Economy." Members of the Standing Committee
had thorough discussions on environmental protection in China. On
the basis of the suggestions put forward at the meeting and the
findings made by each special committee, members worked out the
Proposals for Certain Questions Concerning Environmental
Protection in China. The proposals covered 14 aspects, including
the protection of water resources, prevention of land
desertification, control of air pollution, increase of investment
in environmental protection, intensified research on environmental
science and improvement of environmental laws. Leaders of the CPC
Central Committee and relevant departments took the proposals
seriously.

State-owned enterprises are the pillar of China's national
economy. Their successful reform is crucial to the establishment
of a socialist market economy. Following the arrangements made by
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the Standing
Committee of the CPPCC National Committee concentrated on the
study of this issue. The Committee for Economic Affairs submitted
the Proposals for the Establishment of a Modern Enterprise System
in Large and Medium-sized State-owned Enterprises and the
Proposals for Strategic Adjustments in the Distribution of the
State Sector of the Economy. These proposals provided valuable
ideas for the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central
Committee in its discussion on the reform and development of state-
owned enterprises. The CPPCC National Committee held its seventh
Standing Committee meeting following the Fourth Plenary Session of
the 15th CPC Central Committee. The members conscientiously
studied the Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Major Issues
Concerning Reform and Development of State-owned Enterprises
adopted at the plenary session, listened to a report delivered by
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo of the State Council entitled "Program for
Promoting Reform and Development of State-owned Enterprises."
Members had a heated debate on the topic and put forward many
insightful comments and suggestions on instituting and improving a
modern enterprise system, expediting technological upgrading in
enterprises, supporting medium-sized and small enterprises in
their development, making adjustments in the structure and
strategic distribution of the state-owned sector of the economy,
improving the social security system and establishing a new
relationship between banks and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The basic principle of managing state affairs put forward at
the 15th National Congress of the CPC is to run state affairs
according to law and build a socialist country under the rule of
law. This is of great concern to members of the CPPCC National
Committee. They put forward their comments and suggestions on the
implementation of the principle of managing state affairs
according to law at various meetings of the CPPCC. Special
committees under the CPPCC National Committee conducted
investigations concerning legislation, law enforcement and
judicial affairs. For instance, the Committee for Handling
Proposals, the Committee of Population, Resources and the
Environment and the Committee of Social and Legal Affairs
conducted investigations and put forward their comments and
suggestions on legislation concerning population and family
planning, on a draft revision of the Marine Environment Protection
Law of the People's Republic of China, on a preliminary draft
revision of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the
Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and on the reform of the
judicial system. In September and October 1999, President Xiao
Yang of the Supreme People's Court and Procurator-General Han
Zhubin of the Supreme People's Procuratorate briefed their work to
CPPCC National Committee members residing in Beijing, listening to
their opinions and discussing relevant issues with them. The CPPCC
National Committee members who attended the briefing affirmed the
practice of briefing the work to the CPPCC National Committee
members. They held that this helped implement the principle of
managing state affairs according to law and that this helped the
CPPCC National Committee members gain a better understanding of
the work of the two organs and enabled them to better perform
their duties.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee attaches
great importance to going deep into the realities of life to
conduct investigations and offering constructive proposals and
suggestions on the central task and has been working hard to
improve the quality of special investigations. Last year, the
CPPCC National Committee conducted 43 special investigations,
compiled 37 reports on these investigations and submitted 27
special proposals to the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council, of which 13 received written comments from the leaders of
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The special
committees strengthened coordination during their investigations
to utilize the advantages of the CPPCC as a whole. Many CPPCC
National Committee leaders joined in the investigations of the
special committees, giving a boost to the work. The special
committees also strengthened their links with the relevant
departments of the State Council, the central committees of all
democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, research institutions and local CPPCC committees. There
was constant improvement in the quality of investigation reports
thanks to the better mutual support and closer coordination
between the special committees and other organizations. Quite a
few opinions and suggestions included in the reports served as
valuable ideas for the Party and government in making major policy
decisions, while others were used in formulating measures for
carrying out the work of government departments. Take for example
the report entitled Investigation Report on the Development of
Medium-sized and Small Enterprises submitted by the Committee for
Handling Proposals. Premier Zhu Rongji spoke highly of the report,
noting that the CPPCC made a very good proposal which deserved the
close attention of the relevant departments under the State
Council and the state-owned commercial banks. Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo also made a comment on the report. The Committee of
Economic Affairs submitted to the State Council the Proposal to
Allow Funds of Insurance Companies to Indirectly Enter the Stock
Market via Securities Investment Funds, on which Premier Zhu
Rongji, Vice-Premiers Li Lanqing and Wen Jiabao made written
comments respectively. The proposal helped introduce a plan for
allowing funds of insurance companies to enter the stock market.
Other reports and proposals that drew the close attention of
leaders of the State Council and relevant departments include:
Investigation Report on Serious Desertification in China and
Proposed Prevention and Control Measures and Investigation Report
on China's Water Resources and Sustainable Development prepared by
the Committee of Population, Resources and Environment;
Investigation Report on Cable Television in Liaoning and Sichuan
Provinces, Proposal for Improving Children's Health and Physical
Education and Suggestions for Making Compulsory Education
Universal in Poverty-stricken Areas in China prepared by the
Committee of Education, Science, Culture, Health and Sports;
Report on the Situation in Fighting Poverty in Qinghai Province
and Suggestions prepared by the Committee of Social and Legal
Affairs. In addition, the General Office of the CPPCC National
Committee compiled three volumes of Proposals on State Affairs,
which included selected speeches delivered at the sessions of the
CPPCC National Committee and the meetings of its Standing
Committee and investigation reports. To help CPPCC members offer
constructive proposals and suggestions, the General Office also
compiles a newsletter entitled Developments of Participation in
Deliberation and Administration of State Affairs, which comes out
as needed and publishes a journal entitled the CPPCC of China,
which is available to the public and combines the CPPCC Monthly
and Reference Materials for Studies. These publications provide a
new venue for CPPCC members to air their views. The CPPCC National
Committee cooperated with local CPPCC committees and stepped up
its efforts to sort out a great deal of stored cultural and
historical data.

3. We will further strengthen democratic supervision.
Democratic supervision carried out by the CPPCC mainly in the form
of consultation, discussion, criticism and suggestions is an
essential requirement for and important component of the
development of socialist democracy. This practice has its own
strong points and its role to play. In our effort to develop the
democratic tradition of the CPPCC and make full use of and improve
the existing democratic forms, including regular meetings,
proposals, inspections and information, we should take the
initiative to explore effective means of strengthening democratic
supervision under the changed conditions to make democratic
supervision more effective. Issues to be monitored should be
selected from matters of special concern to the Party and the
government and those reported on widely by the general public.
Care should be taken to coordinate monitoring activities in other
fields, report opinions and suggestions provided by people of all
walks of life concerning lightening the burden of the farmers,
promoting the reform of state-owned enterprises, improving public
order and strengthening the efforts to combat corruption and
building a clean and honest government, take best advantage of the
overall role of democratic supervision and gradually establish a
standardized, orderly and truly effective mechanism for carrying
out democratic supervision.
</P>
<P>
4. We will work to enhance unity and safeguard social stability.
As an organization of multiparty cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the CPC, the CPPCC should
strengthen ties with all democratic parties, prominent persons
without party affiliation, mass organizations and representatives
of various ethnic groups and circles of society participating in
the CPPCC, listen to their criticism and suggestions and report on
their opinions and requests. We should adhere to the principles of
holding consultation on the basis of equality, seeking common
ground while reserving differences, cooperating and pulling
together in times of trouble, and work constantly to consolidate
and develop the patriotic united front. As changes are taking
place in economic structure and social relationships, the CPPCC
should make full use of its strong points, such as extensive
contacts and unhindered channels of information, to go deep among
the masses, find out the situation and exchange ideas with the
broad masses in order to be able to promptly and accurately report
on social conditions and popular sentiments. This assists the
Party and government authorities in coordinating relationships,
resolving conflicts, promoting unity and safeguarding social and
political stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said the CPPCC made great
contributions to the country's overall economic and social
development in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC took various steps to participate in discussing
matters of vital significance, and raised many important and
valuable proposals and suggestions, Ye said in his report on the
work of the CPPCC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of a sustainable development strategy is one of
China's state policies, and is also an important area where the
CPPCC can have a role, Ye said, adding that a proposal on the
country's environmental protection the CPPCC put forward last year
aroused great concern from state leaders.
</P>
<P>
Good performance of state-owned enterprises (SOE) is of vital
significance to the establishment of a socialist market economic
system. Therefore, CPPCC members presented some proposals on the
establishment of a modern enterprise system as well as on large
and medium-sized SOEs' strategic restructuring, a good preparation
for the ensuing 4th Plenum of the 15th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, which focused on SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
Governing the country according to law is a basic principle
adopted at the 15th Party Congress, and the CPPCC National
Committee members are very much concerned about this and have done
many related research and investigations, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee conducted 43 special

leaders. A CPPCC suggestion, for example, played a role in
channeling insurance capital into the stock market via securities
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Ye spoke highly of the CPPCC's role in reflecting public
opinions and maintaining national unity and social stability. "The
CPPCC will assume more important responsibilities this year as
China faces an arduous task in realizing its grand objectives in
reform and opening-up set for the new century," he said.

BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Friday morning
raided suspected targets of the militant Lebanese resistance group
Hezbollah in the west of the Bekaa valley and fired eight missiles
at them, security sources said.

<P>
There was no immediate report of possible casualties in the
attack.

<P>
The assault was possibly in retaliation for the killing of five

a roadside bomb inside the so-called security zone in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> News Corp Becomes Biggest Company in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has
overtaken the communications giant Telstra Corp as Australia's
biggest company.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday night's Australian share market, News Corp' ordinary
shares added 0.73 U.S. cents to 15.77 U.S. dollars, while its
preferred scrip rose 50.94 to 13.66 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Just four months ago, the Telstra chief executive said that his
company was twice the size of New Corp. However, since the
beginning of the year, the value of News Corp has jumped 25.80
billion U.S. dollars and until Thursday night up to 61.06 billion
U.S. dollars, compared with Telstra's 59.80 billion.
</P>
<P>
The investment community began to revalue the company's global
satellite assets and fund managers dump everything else to buy its
share.
</P>
<P>
In late 1990, News Corp shares were worth the equivalent of
about 50 U.S. cents and the value of the company was about 125
million U.S. dollars. Murdoch had to restructure his multibillion
dollar debt.

<HEADLINE> India Lifts Ban On Futures Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has lifted
a 30-year-old ban on forward trading in securities, saying the
changed financial environment made the prohibition on forward
trading irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
The government has also delineated for Security and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the
central bank of the country, the areas of responsibilities to
promote an orderly development of the market, according to an
official statement released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official notification lifting the ban was issued Wednesday
while another notification delineating for SEBI and RBI the
responsibilities of futures trading was issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed in 1969 to curb certain unhealthy trends
that had developed in the securities market in the country and to
prevent undesirable speculation.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's government notification said the contracts for sale
and purchase of government securities, gold-ralated securities,
money market securities and securities derived from these
securities and ready forward contracts in debt securities will be
regulated by the RBI.
</P>
<P>
However, such contracts, if executed on stock exchanges, will
be regulated by SEBI in a manner that is consistent with the
guidelines issued by RBI.
</P>
<P>
The government said the lifting of the ban on forward trading
would pave the way for derivatives trading in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has worked out a plan to
withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) and will execute it once the United Nations peacekeeping
force is deployed, the daily Herald reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing regional defence chiefs who gathered here Thursday
to review the DRC war, the Zimbabwean Defence Minister Moven
Mahachi said Zimbabwean troops are now ready to pull out of the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
"We went into the DRC as part of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Allied Forces to help restore peace,"
he said. "Once the U. N. peacekeeping force moves in, we will pull
out."
</P>
<P>
He said there is need for regional defence forces to formulate
and develop common strategies and a culture of helping each other
in times of need.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said the region has been hit by the devastating
effects of Cyclone Eline. The armed forces would be expected to
play a leading role in relief operations, hence there is the need
for common procedures.
</P>
<P>
"Common procedures will not only foster a spirit of
understanding, but improve the efficiency and coordination during
joint-operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces comprising of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola
have been deployed in the DRC since August 1998 to help DRC
President Laurent Kabila
fight the rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall in Tokyo, Nikkei Closes Below 20,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Friday,
dragged down by a decline in high-priced information and
technology issues, with the key Nikkei index closing below 20,000
for the first time in three trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 137.57 points, or 0.69
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 19,927.54.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 31.99 points or 1.86 percent to 1,
686.49.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 717.35 million
shares from Thursday's 801.70 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sanyo Electric was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Selling in leading information and high-tech issues was stirred
after the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index in New York
turned downward Thursday, losing 29.57 points to 4,754.51.
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology issues also moved down due to selling after the
recent gains, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Continued unwinding of corporate cross-shareholding ahead of
March-end book closings was another factor dampening share prices,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, paper manufacturers, marine transportation firms and
nonlife insurers drew active buying.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 726 to 541, while 129 issues closed unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Publishing Houses Eye on Web Novels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Knowledge Publishing
House plans to publish its second novel on the Web entitled "First
Intimate Encounter". The first novel "We Met In 1999" went on-line
in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Defang, the chief editor said that publishing literature
on the web provides a new space to develop literary works."
</P>
<P>
Websites now provide writers the opportunity to flex their
literary muscles. It also gives publishing houses the opportunity
to scout around in cyberspace for literary talent.
</P>
<P>
Writers and readers alike can exchange all kinds of views on
the Net and even discuss plots. However, reading serial novels on
the Net may sometimes be hard to satisfy all readers because
unlike books, they have to wait for the next installment, said
Zhai.
</P>
<P>
"First Intimate Encounter " tells of a tragic love story
between the two leading characters, "Disreputable Cai" and "Flying
Dance". The novel sold extremely well when it came out in December
last year. Zhai said that 60,000 copies have been sold and another
20,000 will be published.
</P>
<P>
"The layout of the novel is quite unique and combines
expressions peculiar to the net and Taiwanese Mandarin. The novel
gives readers a sense of freshness, humor, and charm," said Zhai.
</P>
<P>
" I fell into tears when I read the novel, not because I share
similar experiences, but it made me realize how hard to find one's
true love. We should never turn away from love when it finally
comes to us," said Bobo in an email to the Taiwan writer Cai
Zhihen (pinyin pronunciation).
</P>
<P>
The Knowledge Publishing House will publish a series of novels
on the Net. The China Social Sciences Publishing House issued
another on-line novel entitled "Goodbye to Wei'an" in January.
Three or four other publishing houses in China have also shown
great interest in publishing on-line novels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Since last May, more than 2,000
residents of Beijing have registered at receiving stations to
donate their bodies for teaching and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
In May 1999, the local Red Cross Society established stations
to receive donated bodies at Beijing Union Medical College,
Beijing Medical Sciences University, and Capital Medical Sciences
University.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 2,000 people have registered, the eldest 89 and
the youngest 18, and most of them are well-educated, said
officials at the stations. Thus far, 30 bodies have been received
at the three facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cao Chenggang, chief at the station at Beijing Union Medical
College, said body supply is important to medical students, and
thanks to these donation, four students at his medical college can
share a body during the teaching of dissection.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that such stations are also available in some
other cities in China, including Shanghai, Nanjing and Yangzhou.

SHENYANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- As spring approaches, 6.8 million
residents in Shenyang usually have their heating systems turned
off.
</P>
<P>
But this year the government has decided to introduce a gas
heating meters practice. Each household will have a gas meter
installed in three to five years. Heating meters are still rare in
China, unlike in most western countries.
</P>
<P>
It will be necessary for new buildings to be installed with gas
meters, otherwise construction plans will not be approved.
</P>
<P>
Liu Delong, the director in charge of introducing gas meters in
cities, said that heating supply factories will merged into
several bigger ones to reduce costs, save energy, and cut down on
pollution.

<HEADLINE> Report on Work of Standing Committee of 9th CPPCC National Committee (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
Committee of the CPPCC, I now submit a report on the work of the
Standing Committee for your examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 was very unusual in the course of development in
China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China, smoothly resumed the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao and scored new achievements in our socialist
modernization drive. The national economic development reached the
set targets, industrial and agricultural production increased
steadily, reform of the state-owned enterprises and other reforms
continued to deepen, fresh progress was made in promoting cultural
and ethical progress and strengthening democracy and the legal
system, and the people's living standards further improved. In
addition, the Chinese people launched three political struggles:
protesting against the brutal US-led NATO bombing of the Chinese
embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, opposing the
fallacious "two-state theory" dished out by Lee Teng-hui and
exposing and denouncing the Falun Gong cult. These struggles
helped safeguard our national sovereignty and dignity and maintain
our national unity and social and political stability.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The CPPCC
National Committee organized a series of commemorative activities,
making the public more aware of the system of multiparty
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, enhancing the Chinese people's national
spirit of unity and struggle and stimulating patriotic enthusiasm
in Chinese people both at home and abroad. In his important speech
made at the celebration meeting, General Secretary of the CPC
Central Committee Jiang Zemin reviewed the glorious course
traversed by the CPPCC over the past 50 years, fully affirmed the
important role the CPPCC has played in China's political, economic
and social activities, summarized the basic experience gained in
the course of the CPPCC's work and defined the guiding principles
for the CPPCC's work in the next century. He hoped that the CPPCC
would make use of its advantages, exercise its functions, improve
its work and constantly optimize its organizational structure in
accordance with the requirements of the two major themes of unity
and democracy. His speech provided important guidelines for
efforts to strengthen the CPPCC's work in the new century,
mobilize the whole Party and people throughout the country to
ensure success in all fields of endeavor and promote the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Through
various ways including forums and symposiums the CPPCC National
Committee organized members from various circles and the staff
members of its organs to study the spirit of the speech delivered
by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and called on CPPCC committees at
all levels and the participating organizations of the CPPCC to
study Deng Xiaoping Theory and the speech of General Secretary
Jiang Zemin and apply them to their work so as to promote the
development of the CPPCC's work.

<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- In 2000, the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will consolidate and
develop the patriotic United Front and work hard to promote the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the CPPCC Ninth National
Committee, made the remark at today's opening meeting of the
committee's third session.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the CPPCC strengthened ties with people from
various circles in Taiwan, made extensive contacts with
businessmen from Taiwan and did everything possible to help them,
Ye said. The CPPCC National Committee strongly rebutted Lee Teng-
hui's "two-state theory" and denounced attempts by the Taiwan
authorities to split the motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader hailed the return of Hong Kong and Macao to
the motherland as "important milestones in the great cause of the
peaceful reunification of the motherland". Now the work of
settling the Taiwan question and achieving the complete
reunification of the motherland stands out as a sacred mission for
all Chinese people, including their compatriots in Taiwan and
overseas Chinese, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ye stressed that the parties, organizations and representatives
of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life participating in
the CPPCC completely endorse and support the principles expounded
in the white paper entitled, "the One-China Principle and the
Taiwan Issue", which was jointly published by the Taiwan Affairs
Office and the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They firmly oppose separatist activities of Taiwan separatist
forces represented by Lee Teng-hui and firmly support the just
stand of, and all measures taken by, the Chinese government for
promoting the reunification of the motherland and safeguarding
China's state sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to
the CPPCC chairman.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC should continue to publicize the principle of "one
country, two systems" and the eight-point proposal put forward by
President Jiang Zemin for developing relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits and promoting the peaceful
reunification of the motherland, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the CPPCC should work to expand
contacts and exchanges with various parties, organizations and
persons in Taiwan on the premise that there is only one China to
promote mutual understanding and trust and reach a consensus of
opinion.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC should study and find new ways and means for carrying
out the work of maintaining friendly contacts abroad under the new
circumstances with a view to promoting the great unity of Chinese
people both inside and outside China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee should maintain close ties with
persons from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macao, give full
play to the role of Hong Kong and Macao members of the CPPCC
National Committee and work hard to safeguard the long-term
stability and prosperity of the two regions, he said.

<HEADLINE> 96.3 Percent of Motions Submitted to CPPCC National Committee Handled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- As of February 20 this year, 3,004
proposals, or 96.3 percent of the total number of motions raised
since last year's Second Annual Session of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political consultative
Conference (CPPCC) had been dealt with, according to an advisory
body leader.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tie'nong, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
while addressing today's opening of the session, disclosed that 2,
542 proposals, or 84.6 percent of the total, have been disposed of
or subjected under plans for handling.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of
the CPPCC National Committee made a resolution to resume the
practice of holding hearings on the handling of proposals set
forth since the previous session, which was abandoned at the
Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC in
1989. The practice has been proven conducive to the early handling
of the proposals or motions raised by CPPCC National Committee
members.
</P>
<P>
The motions raised by non-Communist parties, people's
organizations and CPPCC National Committee members after the
Second Annual Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee
covered a wide range of issues involving economic, social and
political fields, which are useful and of great importance for the
economic and social progress of the country, according to the
CPPCC vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
As the Communist Party and government departments at all levels
have attached great importance to the CPPCC motions and proposals,
the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee is making
still greater efforts to uphold the proposal-raising system in an
effort to constantly improve the quality of CPPCC proposals, Zhou
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-Philippines Joint Commission Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Friday both Malaysia and the Philippines
should be creative in charting new directions to further enhance
the existing level of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Problems which surfaced from time to time between the two
neighbors should not mar their overall bilateral ties, he said in
his opening remarks at the fourth Malaysia-Philippines Joint
Commission meeting (JCM) here.
</P>
<P>
"It is our duty and responsibility to ensure that these
problems are appropriately handled and managed so that they do not
become an impediment to our relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister said the JCM would discuss a large
number of issues including border cooperation, cooperation in
trade and investment, commodities, tourism and culture,
agriculture, health, education, information and the environment.
</P>
<P>
He said what is important is that the true spirit of goodwill
and understanding among neighbors be translated into real and
tangible progress.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the present JCM presented opportunities
for the two countries to review their cooperation and explore
avenues to bring it forward.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon who is
the Philippine delegation leader to the meeting hoped that
Malaysia would look at the many economic opportunities that the
Philippines has to offer, "especially in the Mindanao region where
our close social and cultural ties as well as common Malay
heritage are most pronounced."
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the ministerial-level Friday was preceded by
preparatory discussions of senior officials headed by Malaysia's
Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary-General Abdul Kadir Mohamad and
Philippine Undersecretary for Policy Lauro Baja.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Capital Endures Acute Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Kenya's capital
Nairobi are enduring an acute shortage of water due to a prolonged
dry spell in the city and other parts of the country.
</P>

schools relied on transportation of water by tanks.
</P>

The People daily Thursday quoted Nairobi City Council water and
sewerage committee chairman Joseph Gichuri Gichuri as saying that
the current water problem was serious with the water level at the
Sasumua dam dropping drastically and the Kabete waterworks not
getting enough water.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat to U.S. Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban envoy Jose Imperatori
returned home from Canada Thursday, after days of hunger strike
protesting the expulsion from the United States on alleged spy
charges.
</P>
<P>
He was welcomed by Cuban President Fidel Castro and other
government officials at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said in a statement that Imperatori came
back after an arrangement was made for his possible re-entry into
the United States to attend the trial on his alleged spying during
his stay there.
</P>
<P>
Imperatori, 46, former vice-consul at Cuba's Interests Section
in Washington, was taken into custody by the U.S. authorities and
flown to Montreal Saturday night before arriving at the Cuban
embassy in Ottawa, where he continued a hunger strike to force
return to the United States in order to face his accusers and
clear his name.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "the victim of a major slander" and the
accusation brought against him "is absolutely false."
</P>
<P>
Washington declared Imperatori a "persona non grata" and
ordered his departure within a week on February 19, one day after
the FBI arrested an American immigration official for spying for
Havana through Imperatori. The Cuban envoy then quit his office
and gave up diplomatic immunity while starting a protesting hunger
strike, in order to stay in the Unites States to prove his
innocence.

<HEADLINE> No Change in China's Policy on Taiwan: Chinese Ambassador  By Liu Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United States Li Zhaoxing said here Thursday it is not right to
say that the Chinese government has changed its policy on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks when asked by Xinhua if the white paper,
entitled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue," signals a
major change in China's policy on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"The white paper can help international community better
understand our One-China principle, and some in the media have
gained a deeper appreciation of the efforts of the Chinese
government and people for the 'peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems' policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
But others in the media as well as some political figures in
the United States have mistakenly concluded that China has changed
its Taiwan policy, and this is perhaps because "they have not read
the full text of the white paper, and a few may have had an axe to
grind by cashing in on this opportunity," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in an important speech on Tuesday, Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen denied the foreign press allegations that
China's policy on Taiwan has been changed.
</P>
<P>
The white paper clearly states that there is no change in the
policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems,"
nor is there any change in the eight-point proposition by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, he quoted Qian as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said as to the point that the solution of the Taiwan
issue cannot be delayed indefinitely, "this is our consistent
position, not anything new."
</P>
<P>
The late Deng Xiaoping said in October 1984 that "we adhere to
seeking the solution of the Taiwan issue by peaceful means, but we
have never given up the option of using non-peaceful means, and we
cannot make such a commitment. What can we do if the Taiwan
authorities never talk with us? Can we abandon national
reunification?" Qian said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li stressed that China has made it clear that there
should be no indefinitely delaying in the solution of the Taiwan
issue, because "we want to see headway in the cross-straits
relations and to prod the Taiwan authorities to sit down to
negotiate with us."
</P>
<P>
Li quoted the white paper as saying that within the framework
of one China, any question can be discussed between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits, including the various issues that are of
concern to the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
The resolve of the Chinese government and people to fight
separatism and "Taiwan independence" and to uphold the basic
principle of "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems"
is "firm and consistent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the One-China principle, he added, it is entirely
possible to find a suitable modality of cross-Straits talks on an
equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li advised friends from the media here "to read
carefully" the eight-point proposition by President Jiang Zemin
and the full text of the white paper before making any serious
comments.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Allow TU Rights in EPZs in Phases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official sources hinted the government is likely to make a
commitment before Bill Clinton's visit to Dhaka on March 20 to
protect the labor laws in phases in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the government will also assure the major
investors, mainly from South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, that the
investments in the EPZs will remain unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the government at this stage was actively
considering middle road of allowing a Sri Lanka-style tripartite
committee for welfare of workers.
</P>
<P>
At the initial stage, the labor representatives will be allowed
to bargain their recognized rights, but they will not have any
option for rallies, processions, or wild demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the fourth largest investor in the EPZs
after South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, but it is the largest
market for Bangladesh's exports. So the U.S. pressure really
matters to the Bangladeshi government.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, however, are strongly opposed
to trade union in the EPZs, apprehending that it will seriously
affect their business operations in the exclusive economic zones.
But they do not oppose welfare-committee system.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya to Fight Mosley in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Oscar De La Hoya, who was
beaten by Felix Trinidad of Puerto Rico last year, plans to fight
Shane Mosley in June in Las Vegas, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Oscar called me Monday and said he wanted to make the Mosley
fight," promoter Bob Arum said Thursday. "The contracts are not
signed, but it's made."
</P>
<P>
Arum said the fight would be held on June 10 in Las Vegas or on
June 17 if it is held in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
De La Hoya reportedly will be guaranteed $7 million and Mosley $
4 million.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad defended the IBF welterweight title and won the WBC
gold belt on a majority decision over De La Hoya September 18.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad will challenge for the WBA super welterweight title
Friday night when he fights David Reid outdoors at Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
Arum said it's possible that De La Hoya and Trinidad could
fight in September.
</P>
<P>
Mosley, a fromer IBF lightweight champion with a 34-0 record
with 32 knockouts, has won twice since moving up to welterweight.
</P>
<P>
If Trinidad beats Read and relinquishes his welterweight titles,
the De La Hoya-Mosley fight would be a title match. De La Hoya
would be recognized as WBC champion on the strength of his seventh-
round technical knockout of Derrell Coley in their bout last
Saturday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Underground Ancient Palace Found With High-Tech Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and German archaeologists
have discovered an underground tomb structure of an ancient palace
of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) in northwestern Shaanxi Province
with the aid of high-tech magnetic probes.
</P>
<P>
The ruins of the 18,000 years-old palace, located in the site
of Wazigang 20 kilometers northwest of Qianxian County in Shaanxi,
was found by Chinese archaeologists back in the 1980s in the
vicinity of Qianling Mausoleum named after the county of Qianxian
in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The ruins are close to burial ground of the Emperor Gaozong and
Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) to the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
The German archaeologists, named Becker and Fasbmder, have
undertaken numerous archaeological excavations in countries around
the world using remote sensing technology. They used a set of high-
sense magnetic probes to detect an area of 47 sq km around the
palace ruins. A drawing of underground structure of the palace was
made possible with the aid of a sophisticated computer.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhen Guangquan, chief engineer of the Cultural
Relics Protection and Restoration Center in Xi'an, the provincial
capital, who had worked along with the two German specialists,
magnetic probing is highly efficient and does not cost much. "The
most important is that magnetic probing doesn't do any harm to
cultural relics," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He and his colleagues would possibly continue to use magnetic
probing to detect valuable archaeological treasures and protect
these priceless ancient cultural valuables better still, Zhen said.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Reform to Be Discussed in S. Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talks on March 9 (next Thursday) will be attended by the
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Chairman Karu Jayasuriya and
General Secretary Gamini Atukorale, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Wickremesinghe on Thursday, President
Kumaratunga of the ruling People's Alliance (PA) invited him and
three other party representatives to discuss burning national
issues.
</P>
<P>
"Proposals endorsed by the People's Alliance and the Tamil
political parties as well as those of the UNP are expected to be
reviewed at this meeting," said Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The invitation came amid a fresh opposition campaign against
the government over statements allegedly made by Minister of
Sports S.B.Dissanayake that the government will seal the Courts
and Parliament to ram through its constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe led a demonstration in Colombo on Wednesday
saying it was the first in a series of demonstrations against the
dictatorial conduct of the government.
</P>
<P>
However, government sources said that whatever differences were
between the government and the opposition it was vital that the
ongoing effort to bring constitutional reforms should continue.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reform is needed to devolve powers to
regional councils in a bid to end Tamil Tiger rebels' separatist
war which had engulfed the nation since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The talks scheduled for March 9 had been earlier fixed for
February 22. However, Wickremesinghe had scrapped the meeting
claiming that he did not have sufficient time to study the
government's proposals.
</P>
<P>
He had, however, suggested a rescheduling of the meeting and
forwarded the proposals of his party to the president.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Inflows From Overseas Filipinos Up 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Dollar remittances inflows to the
Philippines from overseas Filipino workers (OFW) have lately
increased by more than 50 percent, the Manila Standard reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted figures provided by the Central Bank of
the Philippines (CBP) as saying that by the end of December of
1999,dollar inflows from the OFW were projected to have soared to
8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
OFW remittances were already up by more than 44 percent as of
end-October, when total inflows amounted to 5.86 billion dollars,
the press report said, adding: the year-ago level was 4.06 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
CBP data showed that Filipinos working in the United States
were the biggest source, with more than 4.3 billion coming in from
January to October.
</P>
<P>
Europe-based Filipino workers sent a total of 361.4 million
dollars, the bulk of which (114.4 million dollars) came from Italy.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, overseas contract workers in Japan accounted for the
biggest remittance of 218.57 million dollars followed by Filipinos
in Hong Kong, 140.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
No letup in the rate of remittances is expected for the first
quarter of 2000, central bank officials added.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Assists Vocational Training in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this week, the OPEC Fund for International Development
signed a 7.43 million U.S. dollars loan agreement with Sri Lanka
to help improve vocational education, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring project, the vocational training system
will be developed to be more responsive to economic demand and
linked directly to employer needs.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has over 1,000 vocational training centers. But
training facilities are often inadequate, teaching materials
incomplete and curricula out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
Many courses are designed without considering business and
industrial needs, leaving students trained in areas inappropriate
to current market demand and unable to enter the workforce. As a
result there is a shortage of skilled labor and a high number of
unemployed graduates.
</P>
<P>
To help resolve these issues, the project covers a broad range
of activities including skills training, administrative capacity
building and special programs to assist disadvantaged students,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that facilities at almost 250 vocational training
centers will be upgraded, including 52 institutions where over
half the enrolled students come from low-income families.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns NATO for Military Exercise in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government
reiterated its strong opposition to the NATO plan for military
exercise in Kosovo later this month.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing Thursday for foreign diplomats, deputy Foreign
Minister Miroslav Milosevic said the move represented the Western
military bloc's continued infringement on Yugoslav sovereignty and
territorial integrity in the name of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He also protested the failure of the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to halt the increasing
ethnic violence against Serbs in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) announced the March
19-April 10 exercise on Monday, saying its aim was to demonstrate
the alliance's resolve to maintain a secure environment for Kosovo
and its inhabitants and to reinforce the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces there if necessary.
</P>
<P>
As part of the operation, NATO will deploy over 2,000 troops,
including soldiers from non-NATO members Argentina and Romania, in
Kosovo next month. NATO said, however, this was not in response to
the recent rise in tension in the ethnically divided northern town
of Kosovska Mitrovica or in Kosovo's eastern border area
neighboring Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Serbia on Monday denounced the NATO exercise as an
encouragement to "Albanian terrorists to commit new crimes in
Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> Albanian Terrorists Attack Serbs Outside Kosovo: KFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanian terrorists have
launched attacks in several Serbian areas bordering Kosovo
recently, a KFOR spokesperson said in the Kosovo capital of
Pristina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said Albanian terrorists launched attacks in
Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, three towns bordering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A Serb police officer was killed and three others were injured
when terrorists attacked a Serb police patrol vehicle on Saturday.
An Albanian also died in the clash. A UN employee was shot and
wounded on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Belgrade, Kosovo Albanian terrorists infiltrated
into the three towns and formed the Liberation Army of Presevo,
Medvedja and Bujanovac (UCPMB).
</P>
<P>
The uniforms and the patches of the UCPMB closely resemble
those of the illegal Kosovo Liberation Army, which had fought for
the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The KFOR spokesperson said the terrorist activities could cause
the already tense situation in Kosovo to deteriorate. He also
warned that Kosovo risks losing international financial support
because of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of the Republic of Serbia, which together
with the Republic of Montenegro forms the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched months-long air strikes on Yugoslavia last year
allegedly to prevent humanitarian disasters in Kosovo. Ironically,
the air strikes caused hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
to flee home and the ethnic division in the region remains the
same today.
</P>
<P>
Serb forces were forced to withdraw from the province at the
end of the air strikes and the KFOR international peacekeepers and
UN administers now control the province.

<HEADLINE> SOEs in NE China Paying More Attention to Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, is pressing hard to make its
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to become more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The Benxi Iron and Steel Group, the largest SOE in the province,
has set up sales companies across the country. About 40 percent of
the sales come from these companies.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, 40 percent of the large and
medium-sized SOEs in the province have set up sales companies
responsible for their own profits or losses, to replace their
previous sales sections. Within two years, Liaoning's SOEs have
established 271 sales networks at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The kind of SOE managers we are scouting for should be
marketing experts," said Chen Zhenggao, provincial vice-governor
in charge of industry. "The province will continue reforming its
SOEs and eventually revamp old production and managing systems."

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Revs Up Development of Medicinal Herbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China
has decided to step up development of its pharmaceutical industry
by combining its rich abundance of natural herbs with modern
technology.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Party Secretary Linghu An told reporters recently
that conditions for developing herbal medicine are ripe. "Herbal
medicine will become a major industry of the province in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 6,500 out of the 11,000 kinds of
medicinal herbs in China are grown in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
To support the development of herbal medicine, the local
government has injected more funds into a natural herbs laboratory
and a bioengineering center. Three other herbal medicine research
centers are also being built.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is home to famous brands of herbal medicines popular
among Chinese at home and abroad, including Yunnan Baiyao (
hemostasia powder) and Yunnan Sanqi (a herb used to improve blood
circulation) series products.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruchang, a medical researcher with Yunnan Natural Herbs
Laboratory, said Western medicines often create their own immunity
in the human body if used over a long period of time, and there
are lots of side effects.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are turning to herbal medicines for a
number of chronic ailments and diseases with little or no side
effects."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Contracted investment in Myanmar
from 24 countries and regions reached 7.154 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of October 1999, according to a report of the local
Business Journal.
</P>
<P>
But foreign investment in the country has shown a trend of drop
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Of the investment, that injected into oil and natural gas
sector constituted the largest value with 2.3 billion dollars or
32.19 percent, followed by manufacturing with 1.492 billion or 20.
86 percent, hotels and tourism with 1.042 billion or 14.57 percent,
real estate with 997 million or 13.94 percent and mining with 522
million or 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five leading investors are Singapore, Britain, Thailand,
Malaysia and the United States in serial with investment amount of
1.5 billion dollars, 1.371 billion dollars, 1.252 billion dollars,
587 million dollars and 582 million dollars, accounting for 21
percent, 19 percent, 17 percent, 8 percent, 8 percent of the total
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar informed sources, the actual brought-in
foreign investment accounted for 30 percent of the contracted
figures.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar attracted 2.3 billion dollars of foreign investment in
1996, 1.256 billion dollars in 1997, 248 million dollars in 1998
and 37.553 million dollars in the first 10 months of 1999, falling
by 84.8 percent over the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons of the sharp drop is due to the impact
of the Asian financial crisis. Myanmar authorities admitted that
the direct investment from member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations fell sharply by 70 percent after the
outbreak of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Canadian Drug Trafficker Detained in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian pilot charged
for cocaine trafficking by his own country has been detained in
Colombia and will be repatriated soon, Colombian security forces
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian national was identified as Jean Raymond Boulanger,
54, an international pilot. He was detained in Tame, Arauca
department, in eastern Colombia on Wednesday and was transferred
to the capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Boulanger was charged with smuggling to Canada 3,919 kilograms
of cocaine with a street value of about one billion U.S. dollars
in collaboration with three Colombians after his light aircraft
was intercepted by Canadian Air Force fighter planes in November
18, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian, whose life was described as "like a novel", had
traveled to Colombia on several occasions, the latest on January
16 this year in a private flight to Medellin, the capital of the
Antioquia department.
</P>
<P>
Security Administrative Department (DAS) officials said
Boulanger and his Colombian partner Joaquin Torres Solano arrived
in Tame on January 28, where they were held by a rebel movement
called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) allegedly
for "not paying the necessary money to be authorized to transport
drugs abroad".
</P>
<P>
The DAS learned about the release of the two men by the FARC
and captured them.
</P>
<P>
Boulanger will be deported to Canada soon, security officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Government Protests Overshadow Famed Vienna Opera Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 people took to Vienna's
streets Thursday in a mass anti-government protest, casting a
shadow over the glamour and chic of Austria's annual Opera Ball.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators hurled firecrackers and chanted slogans in
protest against the far-right's entry into the ruling coalition as
they rallied in front of the magnificent State Opera House, which
was heavily protected by more than 1,000 police.
</P>
<P>
Before the ball started, a man dressed as Adolf Hitler, with
everything from toothbrush mustache to a full Nazi uniform,
emerged from a white Rolls Royce pulling up at the opera house and
raised a "Heil Hitler" salute. He was taken away by police as he
tried to force his way through the entrance.
</P>
<P>
The glittering social event was snubbed by foreign leaders and
artists in the wake of Austria's political isolation since the far-
right Freedom Party joined with the conservative People's Party in
the government on February 4.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio, whose country now holds the
rotating EU presidency, sent his regrets after he was invited as
guest of honor to the ball. Many other foreign dignitaries also
canceled their attendance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Joerg Haider resigned as leader of the
Freedom Party in an attempt to appease the anger expressed at his
former praise of Waffen SS veterans and the Nazi regime. The far-
right party's inclusion in the government has led to political
sanctions against Austria by its 14 EU fellow members.

<P>
ZAGREB, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's former deputy prime
minister and foreign minister Mate Granic decided Thursday to quit
the former ruling party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) to create
a new one amid disputes within HDZ ranks.
</P>
<P>
Joined by Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, who also left the HDZ and its
post of vice-president recently, and former Minister of Justice
Miroslav Separovic, Granic announced that the inaugural assembly
of his new party, the Croatian Democratic Center (HDC), will be
held on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Granic's move came after he was defeated as HDZ's presidential
candidate by Stipe Mesic, a People's Party figure.
</P>
<P>
Croatian media said that disputes started between its moderate
and hard-line wings within the HDZ following the death of the
party's founder Franjo Tudjman on December 10, 1999, and worsened
by the failure of Granic's bid for the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Agricultural Exports to Mercosur Drop 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Argentine
agricultural exports to the Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
member countries in 1999 dropped for the first time in a decade,
down 22 percent over the previous year, according to an official
report.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Interamerican Institute of Cooperation for
Agriculture (IICA) released Thursday shows the exports, amounting
to 2.563 billion U.S. dollars, decreased due to the drop of
agricultural product prices resulting from the devaluation of the
Brazilian currency and the economic recession of Mercosur member
countries, which include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
However, the report forecasts that "this adverse circumstance
will be reversed during the year 2000," when Brazil -- which used
to receive 86 percent of the region's exports -- resumes growth
with stability.

BRASILIA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will create an investment
fund for small and medium national exporting enterprises,
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fund will provide venture capital for the enterprises, said
Roberto Giannetti da Fonseca, executive secretary of the Brazilian
Foreign Trade Chamber of Commerce (CAMEX). CAMEX is an entity

Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Giannetti said Brazil has a great export potential and could
reach a target of 100 billion U.S. dollars in sales abroad by the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
He said the country aims at a trade surplus of between 4 and 5
billion dollars this year, which demands an export growth of about
15-20 percent, and a reduction of imports from 13 to 6 percent.

<P>
ZAGREB, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian government said
Thursday that it will give priority to facilitating refugees
return home and to cooperating with the International Criminal
Tribunal as part of its efforts to gain access to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Under a two-month-long plan adopted at a meeting Thursday, the
government will work to enact legislation guaranteeing all the
Croatian refugees return without discrimination and their right to
property.
</P>
<P>
It disclosed that it will use money from the national budget to
resettle more than 16,000 refugees within 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Croatians, mostly minority Serbs, fled
home in the years-long Bosnian war in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The government also promised to cooperate with the
International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia based in The
Hague, and to improve ties with its neighboring Balkan nations.
</P>
<P>
Resettling the refugees, cooperation with the international
tribunal and better ties with its neighbors are the three
prerequisites the EU set for closer ties with the former Yugoslav
republic whose strategic goal is EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Crime, Corruption Remain Serious in Italy: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Criminal activity and political
corruption remain the greatest threats to society in Italy, said a
study released Thursday by the Italian think-tank, Censis.
</P>
<P>
Although mafia-related murders have dropped dramatically from
719 cases in 1991 to 208 in 1998, other forms of organized crime
such as extortion and arson, and attempts  to dynamite buildings
and other structures have increased, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that an inefficient judicial system also remains
a major problem.
</P>
<P>
"Exasperating slowness with which cases go to trial" has caused
distrust in the legal system, Censis said, noting that 42 percent
of first-time cases and 72 percent of appeal cases take more than
three years to complete.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Enjoy 2nd No-Car Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Following the success of last month's
one-day ban on cars in almost 150 Italian cities, the no-car
initiative will be repeated this Sunday, with vehicles and mopeds
strictly forbidden in urban centers.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Environmental Ministry said cars and scooters will
be banned in 145 cities from 10:00 to 18:00 local time (0900 to
1700 GMT) on March 5, to give urban dwellers' lungs a much-needed
rest from potentially lethal doses of exhaust fumes, as well as to
encourage them to use public transport as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, some 90 percent of the Italians
said they were in favor of the no-car Sunday initiative, and some
80 percent said they would like to see it once a week, which was
surprising for such a car-loving nation.
</P>
<P>
"These figures reveal the great success of these ecological
Sundays with the public," Environment Minister Edo Ronchi said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the levels of benzene in the air in Milan
dropped by 40 percent during the first no-car day on February 6,
while in Turin, pollution fell by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ronchi noted that the government will put aside 140 billion
lire (about 70 million U.S. dollars) for cities willing to join in
the ban.
</P>
<P>
"This money will finance other projects which will make cities
more compatible with the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two other no-car Sundays have been penciled in on the calendar:
April 9 and May 7, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 15,000
people die in Italy every year because of car exhaust fumes,
compared to a total of 80,000 deaths across Europe.

President of the Senate Marcelo Stubrin and Eduardo Menem,

Pinochet left Britain for home Thursday after a 16-month-long
detention in London following a British government ruling that he
was not physically or mentally fit to be extradited to Spain for
trial.
</P>
<P>
Spain requested an extradition on the grounds that Pinochet had
prosecuted Spaniards during his iron fist rule from 1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> Gansu to Turn More Farmland to Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
plans to invest 48.9 billion yuan (5.89 billion U.S. dollars) to
turn two million ha of farmland into forests and grassland in the
next 11 years.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province plans to turn 53,000
ha of farmland to forests and grassland this year in the initial
phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
When the work is finished in 2010, the area of forest and
grassland in Gansu will increase to 5.3 million ha, they added.
</P>
<P>
The government will compensate farmers who give up their land
by offering them grain, they said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive reclamation and logging in the past has caused
serious soil erosion in the province known as a "land of plenty"
in history. Today, 500 million tons of soil is washed into the
Yellow River a year, with a total of 111,200 square kilometers of
land eroded along the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Gansu has made tremendous progress in building
irrigation projects, planting trees and growing grass.
</P>
<P>
As a result, soil erosion has been initially brought under
control in an area of 66,000 square meters and a 1,200-kilometer
green belt has been established along the Hexi Corridor, a major
grain production base of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, the provincial capital, has built 93,333 ha of forests
on the formerly barren Southern Mountain and Northern Mountain as
part of the effort to clean the environment.
</P>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Guangdong
Province in south China has sent the final warning to industrial
polluters in the city, ordering them to meet the state discharge
criteria before the end of the year or risk being shut down.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation carried out in February, 88
percent of the 2,941 industrial plants that cause pollution in the
city met state requirements for waste discharge, but 206 polluters
failed to meet the target.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the municipal People's Congress and related
government departments have repeatedly warned the plants to treat
their pollution discharges. But the managers turned a deaf ear
only for making profits.
</P>
<P>
The latest government warning said that the polluters who fail
to meet the deadline will be punished in accordance with the new
environment law.

<HEADLINE> FIBA Challenge Court's Clearance of Former NBA Player to Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- FIBA, the world governing body of
basketball, contests  a German court ruling that cleared former
Philadelphia 76ers center Stanley Roberts to play in Europe,
according to a spokesman in Munich Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Munich court granted an injunction Tuesday that allows
Roberts to play in Europe, although he was kicked out of the NBA
in November after testing positive for what the league called an "
amphetamine-based designer drug."
</P>
<P>
NBA players who were previously kicked out of the league under
the drug policy, including Roy Tarpley, Richard Dumas and Micheal
Ray Richardson, faced no restrictions when they moved overseas to
resume their careers, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But FIBA has since amended its rules to cover NBA players
kicked out by the league for drug violations.
</P>
<P>
FIBA banned Roberts for two years, the length of time before
he can apply for reinstatement in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Roberts signed to play for Efes Pilsen in Turkey after being
kicked out of the NBA, but FIBA banned the move in December.
</P>
<P>
FIBA's Appeals Commission heard the case in January and
rejected Roberts' plea to be allowed to play.
</P>
<P>
Roberts filed for an injunction with a Munich court on
February 23. FIBA is based in Munich.
</P>
<P>
The German court ruled that FIBA's drug-related sanctions have
to be paid down in its bylaws and that its regulations were not
specific enough regarding NBA players.

The eccentric Ivanisevic had to struggle with his dismal
blunders which far outnumbered his sublime shots. His normally

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Gets World Bank Loan to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank recently gave the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China a 50 million U.S.
dollars loan to support the local poverty-elimination effort.
</P>
<P>
The money is supposed to help 635,000 farmers and herdsman in
the region to promote production and get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jianxin, chief director overseeing the loan, said this loan
is a part of the World Bank's loan of 160 million U.S. dollars to
assist the development of west China, which also covers Gansu and
Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the money will be used over a five-year period, from
1999 to 2005, mainly for land development, irrigation, road
construction, electricity supply, public health, and township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries of the loan are the people living in the
foothills north of the Yinshan Mountain, and those in the Horqin
desert, west of Inner Mongolia, which is one of the most arid and
poverty-stricken areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
People there earn an average annual income below 1,000 yuan (
120 U.S. dollars) in 1998, much lower than that in other poverty-
stricken counties of the country. The local government will use
the loan to raise people's income to about 1,600 yuan (193 U.S.
dollars) per year, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, with a population of 23 million, is an
underdeveloped area in China. Partly because of the location's
adverse climate and barren land, around 1.7 million people still
live below the poverty line, although millions have been lifted
from poverty in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Suspended for Three Games  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Middlesbrough midfielder Paul
Gascoigne has been suspended for three games and fined 5,000
pounds for his elbow on Aston Villa's George Boateng.
</P>
<P>
The toughness of the punishment reflects the FA's tough new
stance on violence and is harsher than any previously handed out
for a similar offence.
</P>
<P>
The former England star recently returned to training after
breaking his arm in the challenge. Boro lost the 14 February match
4-0.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne did not defend himself against the charge. The club
sent a letter on his behalf to the hearing in Preston admitting
the incident.
</P>
<P>
But the player insisted the challenge was "clumsy and careless"
rather than malicious and said he had personally apologised to
Boateng.
</P>
<P>
The ban, effective from 20 March, is likely to affect the
midfielder's planned return to Premiership football.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne still has an outside chance of being fit enough to
play against Sunderland on 18 March and continues to train with a
light cast on his arm.
</P>
<P>
He will definitely miss Boro's clashes with Sheffield Wednesday
on 25 March, Tottenham on 3 April and Manchester United on8 April.
</P>
<P>
Assuming that manager Bryan Robson wanted to use him, he could
return to face Coventry away on 15 April.

LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal was virtually assured of a place in the quarter-finals of
the UEFA Cup on Thursday when they crushed Spanish league leaders
Deportivo Coruna 5-1 in a totally one-sided fourth round, first
leg match at Highbury.
</P>
<P>
Goals from skipper for the night Lee Dixon (5), Thierry Henry (

thoroughly deserved victory against the visitors who had Brazilian
striker Djalminha sent off after 61 minutes for a foul on Gilles
Grimandi.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian was shown the red card seven minutes after
scoring Deportivo's lone goal from the penalty spot -- but
television replays appeared to show Flavio had dived to earn the
spot-kick.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, even without Bergkamp for the second leg -- his fear
of flying will prevent him travelling to Spain -- and the
suspended Martin Keown, would have to suffer a massive reversal to
be knocked out after totally dominating the opening leg.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Close British Spying Bases on Its Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said on Friday that his country does not intend to ask
the British government to pull out its military bases on the island
and stop their surveillance activities.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark at a meeting of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee which reviewed reports on the surveillance
equipment at the two bases that Britain has retained since Cyprus
gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Britain are friendly," he said, noting that
Cyprus has been making efforts to gain Britain's support for its
accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The House meeting was held to discuss a proposal by the left-
wing AKEL party which called on the government to curb the British
bases' activities of monitoring telephone conversations, radio and
other forms of communication.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, AKEL deputy Andreas Christou presented documents
and expert reports which showed "without any doubt that the British
bases in Cyprus were being used all these years to spy and gather
information of all kinds, not only from Cyprus but from other
countries too."
</P>
<P>
In defending his argument, the foreign minister expressed the
hope that the EU will put an end to human rights violations
incurred by the rapid development of technology.
</P>
<P>
However, the government does not intend to raise the British
bases issue from a political perspective, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AKEL General Secretary Demetris Christofias sent a
letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair in "strong protest"
against the fact that Cyprus is being used for spying purposes.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, "is against the interests of the countries of the
region and particularly of the Republic of Cyprus, the sovereignty
of which is being violated."
</P>
<P>
He called for Blair's "intervention for the immediate closure"
of the spy systems.

<HEADLINE> Russia Regrets Attack on Latvian Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday expressed regret over a Friday morning attack by
unidentified persons on the Latvian embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Describing this incident as "rascaldom," the ministry said "the
unlawful actions against the Latvian embassy are being
investigated."
</P>
<P>
This message was sent to Latvian ambassador Imants Daudis, who
conveyed a protest note against the attack to the ministry earlier
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A group of unidentified persons broke windows and splashed
paint on the front of the embassy building early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Latvian embassy press secretary Vilmar Henins said "significant
damage was done to about one third of the building," calling it
the most violent attack against the embassy in several years.
</P>
<P>
A flammable substance was splashed on embassy walls carrying
such an acrid stench that one can only enter many of the rooms
wearing a gas mask, according to the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
There is some special reason behind the incident: Monday, the
Kurzem district court in the Latvian town of Liepaja started
examining the criminal case of former Soviet KGB officer Yevgeny
Savenko.
</P>
<P>
The 85-year-old Liepaja resident is charged "with crimes
against humanity and with genocide," which by Latvian legislation
is punishable by prison terms from three to five years or by life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in January, Latvia's Riga (Capital) Court sentenced a
former Soviet anti- fascism guerilla member with Russian
nationality to six years in prison on a charge of "killing
civilians."
</P>
<P>
These cases have provoked strong dissatisfaction and anger
among some Russian citizens, first, among those old ex-Soviet
soldiers who took part in the World War-II.

<HEADLINE> Chile Receives Pinochet with Acclaims and Sorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 300 persons, among them relatives, friends, political
leaders, legislators and high-ranking officers, welcomed Pinochet,
who flew in on the "Aguila" plane of the Chilean Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, boarded a helicopter that took him to the
military hospital.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 sympathizers of the former army chief were gathered
outside the hospital to give support to Pinochet, who was detained
503 days in London.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities released Pinochet for humanitary
reasons and suspended the legal procedures to extradite him to
Spain, where a judge wanted to try him for crimes against humanity
during his 1973-1990 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enthusiasm Pinochet's release generated among
his supporters stood in stark contrast to the frustration of his
opponents-- especially relatives of alleged victims of Pinochet's
regime.
</P>
<P>
``It is disappointing, but we should not be sad,'' said Viviana
Diaz, president of an organization of relatives of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
 Chile's President Alfredo Frei did not attend the welcome
ceremony. He said in a nationally broadcast address that "no
Chilean citizen is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes, who worked for Pinochet'
s release, said the former dictator should not remain active in
politics. But others insisted that is something for Pinochet to
decide.

CARACAS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 Venezuelan oil

failure of a contract negotiations between labor unions and
Venezuela's state-run oil company.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges to Strengthen Energy Security, Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin on Friday urged to strengthen national energy security and
stressed that Russia's oil and gas sector is extremely important
for the state to expand cooperation with the external world.
</P>
<P>
"We are expanding Russia's oil and gas export potential and
will continue to do so," Putin told an all-Russia energy
conference in Surgut, West Siberia. He said the nation will work
to boost crude oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector needs new technology, Putin said,particularly
for boosting refinery product yield from crude. That is one field
for cooperation with the West, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia needs good will on the part of politicians in order to
expand energy trade and cooperation with the rest of the world,
first with China, Azerbaijan and Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without good will on the part of politicians, it will be
impossible to develop business. The duty of politicians is to
facilitate the development of business and not to hinder it. We
understand that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin ruled out any slump in world oil or natural gas prices in
near future but insisted that Russia should "always be ready" for
such an eventuality.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is in Russia's strategic interests to
supply more fuel to the domestic market and export more processed
oil product but less crude oil abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said "the energy export is essential to national economy"and
"any restrictions on the export of fuel by our companies should be
carefully considered and decisively curbed."
</P>
<P>
He called for more constructive and effective international
cooperation in fuel production and trade. The programs on building
new Baltic and Black Sea ports, the laying of a pipeline to China
and the cooperation with Azerbaijan and Turkey are very important
projects to Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin arrived in the city of Surgut on Friday for a national
conference on the development of Russia's fuel and energy complex.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Putin, accompanied by Russia's
biggest gas enterprise Gazprom chief Rem Vyakhirev and Russian
Unified Energy Systems head Anatoly Chubais, visited the
Surgutneftegaz oil and gas enterprise and an exhibition of oil
production equipment, addressed a seminar on regional problems.

<HEADLINE> UK's House Prices Down By 0.9% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) - House prices in Britain fell in
February by 0.9 percent according to the latest figures from
Halifax, the UK's largest building society.
</P>
<P>
But they are still much higher than a year ago, up by 15
percent. In January prices had risen by 2.4 percent, giving an
annual increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax said that following those big jumps, February's
fall could indicate that the pace of house price growth was
beginning to slow.
</P>
<P>
While the price of the average house in February was 4.2
percent higher than three months earlier, this was" significantly
smaller than the 6 percent increase recorded between April and
July last year", it added.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax doubted that last month's fall was the start of a
downward trend, saying "economic conditions remain good and we
expect continued above trend growth in activity throughout this
year."

<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) - The number of people wanting to work
in Britain may be as high as four million, according to a research
for the Trade Union Congress(TUC).
</P>
<P>
The figure is far higher than the figure of just over one
million quoted by the Office for National Statistics in February.
</P>
<P>
The report released Friday suggests that in some regions
joblessness is five times greater than official figures.
</P>
<P>
It showed that in south-east England, just under 10 percent of
the population were jobless and wanted to work, rising to 17
percent in the north-east.
</P>
<P>
TUC general secretary John Monks described the report as "
uncomfortable reading", saying that "those who say there is no

whether the United States intends to lead the global economy in
the new century or retreat from it," Donohue said in a keynote
address to the Pacific Northwest International Trade Association.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out granting China PNTR will not determine whether
China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO), but will
determine whether American businesses, workers and consumers can
reap the benefit of the trade agreement worked out late last year,
or whether the U.S. surrenders new jobs and trade opportunities to
competitors abroad.
</P>
<P>
"All-in-all the agreement would boost annual U.S. export annual
U.S. exports by roughly $13 billion in five years and increase
agricultural exports by $2.2 billion per year," Donohue said. "All
Congress must do is to grant, on a permanent basis, something it
has done every year since 1980 anyway -- which is to grant China
normal trading relations status."
</P>
<P>
Donohue called on the Clinton administration to submit to
Congress "a clean bill unencumbered by language tying free trade
to other issues." He also pleaded to the major U.S. presidential
candidates to show what kind of president they would be "by
supporting the China trade deal and standing up to the political
heat."
</P>
<P>
He noted that increased trade around the world raises living
standards, opens up closed societies, and generates the wealth
needed to pay for social programs. "Using trade as a weapon will
not only reduce our influence, but actually hurt the working
people, farmers and businesses of our own country," he added.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor to Visit Switzerland in Late March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang
Schussel will visit Switzerland at the end of March, according to
Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
That will be making the new Austrian chancellor's first
official visit abroad since he took office. He is expected to be
in Berne on either March 29 or 31.
</P>
<P>
The visit is in line with tradition, according to which a new
Austrian chancellor makes his first foreign visit to Berne.
Switzerland has made it clear that it wants to respect the
tradition and maintain good neighborly relations, despite
international criticism of the new coalition in Vienna, which
includes the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 European Union partners have frozen bilateral
relations with Vienna in protest at the party's presence in the
government. However, Swiss ministers have repeatedly maintained
that the composition of Austria's government is an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss authorities have declined to comment on a date and
agenda for the visit by Schussel.
</P>
<P>
On March 8, Austria's Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner
will be making her first official visit to Switzerland. She is due
to meet her Swiss counterpart Joseph Deiss but it is not yet clear
whether she will also meet Swiss president Adolf Ogi.

<HEADLINE> Senegalese General to Head U.N. Peace-Keeping Mission in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A Senegalese military
officer, Major-General Mountaga Diallo, will command a 5,500-
member U.N. peace-keeping mission in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), the United Nations announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
His appointment was approved in an exchange of letters between
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the president of the 15-
nation Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Observer Mission in DRC, known as MONUC, was approved
by a February 24 Security Council resolution to monitor the shaky
peace process in the Central African country. A cease-fire accord
was signed in July last year by warring parties in the many-sided
conflict.
</P>
<P>
MONUC includes some 5,000 peace-keeping troops to protect 500
military observers and to provide logistics. The U.N. mission is
also mandated to supervise the disengagement and redeployment of
the opposing forces.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year Diallo has been serving as inspector general of
Senegal's armed forces. Before that he was deputy chief of the
general staff.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Yavlinsky Vows Faster Economic Growth for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Yabloko party leader,
presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky on Friday vowed to
achieve fast economic growth and life improvement if he wins the
presidential election due on March 26.
</P>
<P>
In an address on Radio Rossii, Yavlinsky said the absence of
stable economic growth is very dangerous to Russia. "A financial
pyramid will emerge again and it may possibly collapse again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, a famous liberal economist who gathered a noticeable
percentage of votes in 1996 presidential polls, thinks that
current Russia's economic growth is sickly as a result of the
August 1998 devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
An improved employment situation would point to stable economic
growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky criticized a possible referendum for partial land
privatization. "The constitution has resolved all these issues,let
's implement them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The constitution should stipulate a general "federal level"
decision, while regions should "take into consideration local
particularities to make suitable decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Chechnya, Yavlinsky insisted on both the elimination
of guerrilla formations and a political settlement. "One cannot be
dealt with in the absence of the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is unacceptable to throw around money" like what
was done when resolving Chechnya's socioeconomic problems in 1995
and 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky confirmed that he will not withdraw from the Russian
presidential race anyway.
</P>
<P>
"I am taking part in the elections and do not intend to
withdraw my candidacy under any condition. That is what I want to
tell my voters," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called it "a good idea" to nominate a single democratic
candidate in the elections. He said he was discussing with another
presidential hopeful, Yevgeny Savostyanov, "what can be done to
pool all the votes together."

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply On Employment Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose sharply
Friday as the government's report eased investors' concerns about
a sharp rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 202.28 at 10,367.20.
The blue chip index ended the week with a gain of 505.08 points.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 27.41 at 1,409.17 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 160.28 at 4,914.79, surpassing the record
closing high of 4,784.08 set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the U.S. Labor Department reported
that 43,000 new jobs were created in February, well below analysts
' expectations and the weakest since May. The nation's
unemployment rose to 4.1 percent in the same month from 4 percent
in January, still at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
The data were seen by investors as a sign that inflation is
well under control after the Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates four times since last June in reasons for the tight labor
force. Investors believe that the Federal Reserve would raise
rates again this year but the rates hike would be moderate.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed his
worries about the low unemployment rate because the tight labor
force would trigger inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.97 at 610.47 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 10.21 at 1,013.71. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 13.84 at 597.88.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,715 up, 1,271 down and 527
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.14 billion shares from 1.18 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.
