<HEADLINE> UNCTAD, Israel Sign MOU to Promote Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Israeli government signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) here Tuesday to help developing
countries and economies-in-transition in their national and
regional development efforts.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to combine their professional and operational
resources, UNCTAD and the Center for International Cooperation
(MASHAV) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel will
undertake joint research and training in the fields of investment,
science and technology, and enterprise development for the benefit
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero said that Israel had undertaken excellent work, not only
through official government policies, but also with local
communities, in active investment promotion and in support of the
development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Israel's experience in identifying new enterprises and in
targeting investment promotion would be extremely valuable,
Ricupero said.
</P>
<P>
MASHAV, created 40 years ago, has set up some 150 training
programs, for example, in crop diversification, irrigation
savings, combating desertification and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over 4,000 professionals attended MASHAV training
courses in Israel.

<HEADLINE> France Views Milosevic's Commitment as Insufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- France on Wednesday said the
promises made by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to resolve
the Kosovo crisis were insufficient.
</P>
<P>
"The commitments made by President Milosevic in the wake of his
meeting with (Russian) President Yeltsin only answer in an
incomplete manner the requests formulated by the ministers of the
Contact Group (on former Yugoslavia)," said French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that Milosevic's refusal to withdraw federal troops
from Kosovo, as requested by the United States, France, Britain,
Germany, Italy and Russia, showed that he failed to yield to a
principal demand by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"His declarations on the army and the formulation of his
communique linking the withdrawal of security forces to the end of
terrorist actions (by the Albanians) show that on this central
aspect the progress made remains insufficient," he said.
</P>
<P>
If an atmosphere of confidence was not established between the
Serbs and the Albanians, it would be difficult for the two sides
to resume talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will rapidly consult with our partners of the Contact Group
to evaluate the situation in Kosovo and the stand to be maintained
toward the Yugoslav authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin would
discuss with U.S. President Bill Clinton the situation in Kosovo
when they meet on Thursday in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Suggested to Increase Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Committee on Banking
Disclosure released a report Wednesday recommending wide-ranging
changes for banks to increase their transparency.
</P>
<P>
The committee attached high importance in its report to
enhancing disclosure standards and reforming current practice,
saying that the "Asian crisis highlights the need for greater
transparency and information disclosure to maintain confidence in
the banking system."
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up by the Financial Sector Review Group
chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and was assigned
to review and evaluate disclosure standards and practice in
developed and other Asia-Pacific countries and then made
suggestions on changes.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Elizabeth Sam, Deputy President of
the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp., recommended disclosures in
eight areas.
</P>
<P>
On top above all, the committee called for a stop in the
current practice of maintaining hidden reserves and recommended
that Singapore banks disclose the market value of investment.
</P>
<P>
On changes in profit and loss account, the committee said banks
should provide details of other principal sources of income like
profit from securities trading and gains on disposal of fixed
assets.
</P>
<P>
Banks should also disclose specific provisions for loan losses
and general provisions, it said.
</P>
<P>
The team proposed to the government encouraging the build-up of
bank reserves through tax incentives, like making loan loss
provisions fully tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
The committee also recommended changing the current practice of
provisioning on a line-by-line basis for dealing with securities
to provisioning on the basis of the entire portfolio.
</P>
<P>
But it would be status quo for the current practice of
valuation for dealing securities, it noted.
</P>
<P>
On off-balance sheet items, the team asked for a disclosure of
all contingent liabilities, commitments and financial derivatives.
</P>
<P>
But the committee viewed suggestions of quarterly results
announcement as inappropriate for Singapore banks and recommended
the continuation of the current practice of half-yearly
announcement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Farmers Told to Grow Less Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
(ZTA) Wednesday advised local tobacco growers to reduce their
plantings by 10 to 15 percent this year to avoid unnecessary
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 38th ZTA annual congress, out-going President
Robert Webb said Simbabwe's tried and tested auction system was
under threat despite extensive consultations with manufacturers
and merchants both here and abroad, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
''My plea is that you do not over extend yourself by growing
more tobacco than you can handle efficiently,'' he said, adding,
''consequently, we recommend that platings be reduced by 10 to 15
percent from last year which should result in a crop to satisfy
all stake-holders.''
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's tobacco industry has not done very well
lately due to a number of factors including high import duties,
surcharges, sales tax, the five percent levies and a slump in
prices this marketing season.
</P>
<P>
''United States litigation is adversely affecting us in
Zimbabwe, the buying pattern has changed, we are becoming
uncompetitive due to unnecessary taxes and levies and our
viability is perched on a knife edge,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
The tumble in the Southeast Asian economies, leading to delays
and cancellation of tobacco orders had also impacted badly on the
tobacco industry, the country's biggest foreign currency earner.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States will keep
warships and jets near Kosovo in case the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) decides additional military action is needed,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the forces will remain in the region and will be
prepared to follow through with any military action, should any
ever be called for and agreed to," Cohen was quoted as saying by
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks at the end of a tour of Europe marked
throughout by the crisis over Yugoslav government attacks in the
restive Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters on his aircraft returning to
Washington, Cohen said a NATO decision to consider the use of
force could come speedily.
</P>
<P>
While NATO members may be divided about the legal basis under
international law for taking military action, such a debate will
not go on indefinitely, Cohen warned.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a continuation of the killing, I think there will
be a very strong tendency to reach a consensus quickly, rather
than engaging in an endless debate," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that there's the fear the conflict in Kosovo
would spread much faster and further than Bosnia and therefore
requires more immediate attention.

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies Make Joint Statement on International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Heads of United Nations agencies
made a joint statement here Wednesday to underline the need for an
international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
"The current crisis in Sierra Leone is a brutal reminder to the
delegations now meeting in Rome of the urgent need for an
effective International Criminal Court to provide justice for the
appalling violations of human rights in that country and
elsewhere," they said in the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Those who signed on the statement are Executive Director of the
U.N. Children's Fund Carol Bellamy, U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadako Ogata, Special Representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict Olara Otunnu,
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson and U.N.
Emergency Relief Coordinator Sergio Vieira de Mello.
</P>
<P>
"A standing International Criminal Court empowered and
resourced to take action when national systems are either unable
or unwilling would provide a credible deterrent," they said. "We
believe that much of the criminal violence in armed conflicts and
rebellions is the result of impunity."
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer sufficient for humanitarian and human rights
officials to denounce atrocities while unable to prevent their
recurrence," they said. "The International Criminal Court is
intended to be the first effective weapon against the culture of
impunity which has fuelled cycles of violence in every part of the
world over the past decades."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the brutality in Sierra Leone is a harsh reminder
that the diplomatic exchanges in Rome have flesh and blood, life
and death consequences for people living in fear in many parts of
the world, the five urged the delegations now meeting in Rome "to
study carefully the situation in Sierra Leone and to ensure that
the Statute they adopt will result in a court able to combat
impunity, bring justice and contribute to a lasting peace in this
country".

</P>
<P>
Commending on the just-concluded EU summit held in Cardiff,
Britain, Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said "the EU
conclusions relating to Cyprus are positive in that they reaffirm
once more that Cyprus' accession course will proceed unhindered
without any pre-conditions."
</P>
<P>
The EU summit stressed that "each of these candidates (for EU
membership) will be judged on the basis of the same criteria."
</P>
<P>
Last week, a French president spokeswoman noted that it would
be difficult for a divided Cyprus to join the EU, hinting that
France may ask for a suspension of accession negotiations with
Cyprus during the June 15-16 summit.
</P>
<P>
And French President Jacques Chirac also said at the summit
that Cyprus should be considered as a special case in the entry
talks.
</P>
<P>
Expressing surprise at the remarks, Stylianides said "Cyprus is
not a special case at all, it remains in the same group of
candidate countries and proceeds with its accession course without
any problem."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "wrong" for France to have adopted this approach.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started accession talks with the EU in March.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Cypriots walked out of talks last summer to protest
against the EU's decision to begin accession talks with Cyprus --
not their strong supporter Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Presidents Call for Stronger Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Presidents George
Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford have jointly urged the
Congress to work for a stronger relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the three former presidents, together with
eight former secretaries of state, five former secretaries of
treasury, six former secretaries of defense and five former
national security advisors, signed an open letter to the Congress,
urging the legislators to approve the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN)
status for China.
</P>
<P>
"American foreign policy cannot succeed if it fails to engage
China," said the letter, which was published Wednesday in The
Washington Post, The New York Times and other influential
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing strong, enduring ties with China has been a
principal objective of American foreign policy since President
(Richard) Nixon's historic visit in 1972, and has been supported
by all subsequent administrations of both parties," the letter
read.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton's upcoming visit to the People's Republic of
China is a continuation of that policy. It is also an affirmation
of the importance of constructive Sino-American relations at a
critical moment in Asia," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"It is thus necessary that the visit take place as scheduled,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, alleging China of human rights violations and
accusing the administration of transferring high-techs to the
country, asked Clinton to postpone or even cancel the trip, which
would be the first presidential visit to China in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Last week, in a major speech on his China policy, Clinton also
defended his trip by emphasizing that engagement with China is in
the interest of the U.S. while isolation will make the U.S. itself
isolated.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of the strategic relationship is underscored by
current developments in the region, particularly Asian financial
crisis and the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. It is likewise
in the vital interest of the United States that China continue to
open and reform its economy and improve the quality of life of its
citizens," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"We can advance that vital interest by continuing to extend
normal trading relations to China," it added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton decided early this month to extend the MFN trade status
to China for another year. However, the Congress has a right to
debate and vote on the decision within a month while some
lawmakers oppose it.
</P>
<P>
"The price for a failure to forge a strong, consistent policy
towards China will be paid in a weakened American ability to shape
international events in ways that serve our interests and support
our values," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"China is destined to become a great economic and political
power in the 21st century. The United States should neither fear
nor oppose this development," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. policy should instead proceed from the premise that our
vital national security interests are best served by a China that
appreciates America's basic values and becomes a full participantt
in the international system and institutions which the United
States has taken the lead in creating since 1945," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Leadership, engagement and commitment on our part are
essential to helping China assume such a role," the letter said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Criticizes Israeli Call for Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
refuted the Israeli call on Egypt to pressure the Palestinians to
make further compromise on Israeli troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobeih, permanent delegate of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to the Arab League based in Cairo, told reporters
Wednesday that Egypt would not intervene in the decision-making
process of the PNA on such crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian leadership is very keen that the Palestinian
leadership takes its own independent decisions and is keen to
realize a just, durable and overall peace in the region on the
basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy," Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih, also secretary general of the Palestinian National
Council, was commenting on a statement by Israeli Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Tourism Moshe Katsav, who said that
Israel has asked Cairo to persuade the PNA to accept a 10 percent
pullback in the next Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far refused to endorse the U.S. proposal for a
13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal, although the PNA has
accepted. The PNA has ruled out any further compromise on the 13
percent pullback plan, saying it had already made a big concession
on its original demand for a 30 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will never accept this," Sobeih said. "Egypt has not, at
any stage, exercised any pressure on the Palestinians to influence
their decisions."
</P>
<P>
"The entire world highly appreciates the Egyptian leadership's
wisdom, far-sightedness and its keenness to work according to
international law and Israel should be aware of this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, is a
strong advocate of the Palestinian cause. PNA President Yasser
Arafat is a frequent visitor here to coordinate stances with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the PNA's dealing with the
Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkish Warships' Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Wednesday launched a strong
protest against the visit by five Turkish naval warships to
Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern part of the island, describing
it as an "illegal action."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters that
the Cypriot government condemns the move and will make relevant
representations.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish submarines, a destroyer and a frigate docked in the
Turkish-controlled eastern port of Famagusta early Wednesday and
another warship at the northern port of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
The warships, part of an announced Turkish naval exercise, came
a day after four Greek F-16 fighters and a C-130 military
transport plane landed at a newly-completed air base near the
western coastal town of Paphos in the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south.
</P>
<P>
Greek aircraft's arrival, the first since the base was
completed in January, has drawn strong protest from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Ministry said "the move by Greek warplanes to
begin to use the Paphos military air base is a very worrying and
provocative development, aimed at damaging peace and stability on
the island."
</P>
<P>
It warned that, as a guarantor power, it will take all
necessary measures to stop development.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Greece and Britain were guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of the Cyprus
Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Stylianides Wednesday refuted that "it is grotesque
that a guarantor country which violated the unity of the Cyprus
state has been an occupation force since 1974 to lecture Cyprus on
sovereign rights and defense agreements which are based on
international law."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept 35,000-strong armed forces in northern Cyprus
with the claimed aim to protect Turkish Cypriots, who unilaterally
declared a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The breakaway republic is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government and its strong supporter Greece signed a
joint defense pact in November 1993, under which Greece will
provide military assistance if Cyprus is attacked.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Killing of Palestinian Farmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Wednesday strongly condemned the killing of a
Palestinian farmer near the West Bank city of Hebron, calling it a
"hideous crime."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that the
killing was not acceptable and he would take actions against such
violence. The perpetrators will be brought to court within the
full range of the law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian farmer, Abdel Majid Turki, was beaten to death
on Tuesday when he was attacked by several Jewish settlers with a
wooden bat near the Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai, south of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Three Jewish settlers, two of them minors, have been arrested
suspected of being involved in the killing. One of the suspects
said that they beat Turki just for "playing a prank."
</P>
<P>
The police have not given a motive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the cabinet secretary of the
Palestinian National Authority, said Wednesday in Gaza that the
killing was a crime against Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the murder proved that peace could not be
achieved with the existence of the Jewish settlements on the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened in the sensitive Hebron area, where the
Jewish settlers have engaged in frequent clashes with Palestinian
residents in recent years. In the bloodiest case in 1994, a Jewish
settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers in a Hebron mosque.

agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, the former first vice-prime minister, is Chairman of
United Energy Systems of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky quoted the decree

choice for the president's envoy to Russia's talks with

of government in dealing with international financial
organizations."
</P>

on Wednesday expressed welcome to French investments and pledged
sufficient legal guarantee to them, Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Diplomatic Efforts on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran stated on Wednesday that it
welcomes the recent international diplomatic efforts to resolve
the Kosovo crisis, calling for a peaceful solution to it.
</P>
<P>
"Sensitivity of the world community and a general conviction
on part of the Balkan states to put an end to the crisis can pave
the way for return of calm to the region," the Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remark after the Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed on Tuesday to accept the West's main
demands for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Milosevic
promised to stop actions against civilians in Kosovo and resume
talks with Kosovo Albanians, who fought for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic insisted that there is no reason for the
pullout from Kosovo of the Yugoslav federal army as demanded by a
number of countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced Tehran's concern
over the Kosovo situation and the tide of refugees caused by the
crisis, saying that Iran is of the belief that any military move
by other countries will deepen the crisis in the sensitive Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran, as the chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, once again calls for a peaceful solution to
the crisis and the refraining from repressive moves against the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Direct negotiations between Belgrade and the local Kosovo
leaders as well as the realization of commitments by the Yugoslav
government, will be a good beginning for putting an end to the
unrest," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dramtic Equaliser Saves Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic equaliser at the
injury time again saved Austria in the match against Chile.
</P>
<P>
Salas punched in a rebound after Zamorano's header was blocked
by Austrian goal-keeper Michael Konsel at the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian team, which forced Cameroon to a 1-1 draw thanks to
a last-minute equaliser in their first group match, didn't give up
and this time it was Ivica Vastic who came to the team's rescue.
</P>
<P>
Vastic chipped home the ball to savage the draw for Austria at the
injury time and that left the two teams with two points each from as
many games.
</P>
<P>
The first half of the match was boring with both teams nervous
on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
But the Chilean team took an upper hand in the second half when
Salas and Zamorano combination posed greater threat towards the
Austrian goal.
</P>
<P>
At the 53rd minute, Austrian goal-keeper Konsel blocked a
Zamorano header but Salas punched in the rebound with his leg to
give Chile the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Zamorano had the golden chance to secure the victory for Chile
but his shot was tipped off by Konsel at the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian team, knowing the remaining time was limited, still
kept their pace and built up their attacks patiently. Their efforts
finally paid off when second-half substitute Vastic got the
equaliser.
</P>
<P>
Later on Wednesday, Italy will play Cameroon at Montpellier in
the other Group B match.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests France Over Anti-Iran Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Human Rights
Commission (IHRC) on Wednesday sent a note to the French Embassy
here, protesting the broadcast of an anti-Iran film on a French
private television.
</P>
<P>
The protest was directed at the French TV Channel 6 for its
Monday night's screening of the movie "Not Without My Daughter," a
1989 production by American Jews which painted a negative image of
Iran and its leadership.
</P>
<P>
Iran believed that the film insulted the sanctities of Muslims
and the Iranian nation's traditions by presenting a backward
picture of its capital city Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the movie was broadcast during the ongoing soccer's
World Cup in France in which an Iranian team is participating, the
IHRC called the move "a violation of Iranians' rights and also
detrimental to the morale of the Iranian football players in the
World Cup matches."
</P>
<P>
It said that France should put emphasis on sports as an
instrument to enhance understanding and compassion among peoples
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The commission demanded an official apology from France to the
Iranian nation as well as its athletes, adding that the parties
responsible should be punished.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Iranian Football Federation Mohsen Safaie Farahani
and members of the Iranian national football team had earlier
handed a protest note to the World Cup Organizing Committee and
the world soccer's governing body, the International Football
Federation (FIFA).
</P>
<P>
The angry Iranian team briefly considered pulling out from the
World Cup in protest, but finally decided to stay on. The team
will play against the U.S. and German teams as scheduled.

LUXEMBOURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker met on Wednesday Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC), the country's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg prime minister recalled his pleasant stay not
long ago in Beijing on his way to a visit in Mongolia and his
fruitful talks in Beijing with Chinese NPC Chairman Li Peng and
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said: "The visit by Chinese legislators will positively
boost the development of bilateral relations between Luxembourg
and China."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese NPC vice-chairman said that it is the common wish
of the Chinese and Luxembourg peoples and governments to build up
bilateral ties on the existing sound foundation.
</P>
<P>
China and Luxembourg, Jiang said, should complement each other
with their respective strengths, broaden cooperation in economy
and trade, enhance exchange and cooperation in finance and create
better conditions for the cooperation among small and medium-sized
enterprises of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The NPC vice-chairman added that the visit by senior Chinese
lawmakers was an important component of the effort to enhance
bilateral ties and the four-day visit to Luxembourg helped to
deepen mutual understanding and cement friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lawmakers delegation left here late on Wednesday
for Strasbourg for an official visit to the European Parliament
that is seated in the French city.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Peace Process Takes Turn for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Representative
to Angola, Blondin Beye, asserted Wednesday that the crisis in
Angola will be over as the peace process will soon take a turn
for the better.
</P>
<P>
Beye made the remarks after holding talks with Angolan
President Eduardo Dos Santos, the visiting Beninese Speaker of
Parliament Bruno Amossou and delegates from the United States,
Russia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the process out of the current stalemate, Beye
said he went to the central city of Andulo Tuesday to meet with
Jonas Savimbi, President of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for talks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Savimbi promised to turn UNITA
headquarters of Bailundo and Andulo as well as two other
"sensitive" areas, Mungo and Nharea, over to government control,
Beye disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader agreed to allow a working team to start work
Wednesday in these areas to make preparation for the
reestablishment of local administrations.
</P>
<P>
Beye said Savimbi is opposed to the June 12 U.N. Security
Council resolution on imposing sanctions on UNITA, considering
that "it's unfair and goes too far, so it is unable to play a
positive role in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. representative pointed out that through the
efforts by all parties, the Angolan peace process is getting on
the right track again and the situation is turning better.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process hit snags after UNITA refused to
turn the so-called sensitive areas over to the governance of the
government and allegedly continued to keep a large armed force.
</P>
<P>
In order to compel UNITA to comply with the peace accord
reached by the two warring sides, the U.N. Security Council
decided last Friday to impose the third sanctions on the
opposition UNITA movement, including freezing its deposits in
foreign banks and curbing its exports of diamonds.

<HEADLINE> Romania Tries to Restore the Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 17 (Xinhua) -- From today on, securities
companies with a nominal capital below 35,000 U.S. dollars are not
authorized to operate as intermediaries on the Romanian capital
market.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, which come into effect on Wednesday, are
meant to strengthen the financial power of the operators and to
increase the confidence in Romanian capital market, stated Stefan
Boboc, President of the National Securities Commission(NSC).
</P>
<P>
Stefan Boboc appealed for more measures to be taken to restore
the local capital market. "The constitution of a national fund for
guaranteeing investments in securities made by individuals, like
the one constituted for guaranteeing the bank deposits, would lead
to the development of investment funds and would stimulate
individuals to invest in shares", he said.
</P>
<P>
This way, in case of bankruptcy of a securities company, the
individuals who had invested through the respective company would
be able to recuperate the money they invested, or least a
percentage of the money, the President of NSC added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present downfall of the Romanian capital
market, Stefan Boboc said that this situation has foreign causes,
mostly the distrust of foreign investors in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening the financial power of the National Agency for
Compensating, Discounting and Depositing is compelling, perhaps
even through a merger of this agency with the independent
shareholders registers, Stefan Boboc stated. In his opinion, this
merger would lead to the constitution of a genuine securities bank
which would offer the shareholders and issuers much more financial
services.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Attack Village, Killing 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight civilians were killed and 18
others wounded in northern Sierra Leone Tuesday when rebels loyal
to the ousted military junta attacked a village near the northern
provincial capital Makeni.
</P>
<P>
The attacked village Kasanba is about 24 miles from Makeni and
has soldiers of the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG based
there, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A witness was quoted by the report as saying that heavily-armed
rebels attacked the village at 6:00 a.m. and began shooting
indiscriminatingly.
</P>
<P>
When ECOMOG troops tried to engage the rebels, they found that
they were outnumbered and had no alternative but to retreat, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Eight fleeing civilians, including a four-year-old girl, were
hacked to death by the rebels, while 18 others wore severe
gunshot wounds, the report added.
</P>
<P>
When villagers came out of the bush Wednesday, they found that
almost all the houses in the village were set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to the military junta of Major Paul Johnny
Koromah have been engaged in fierce fighting against ECOMOG in
eastern and northern Sierra Leone since mid-February, when they
were chased out of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources said earlier that the rebels are now in a
desperate situation as they have run out of food and other
logistic supplies.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season, however, has prevented ECOMOG from a quick
success in its efforts to mop up all the rebels, the sources
said.

<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) announced Wednesday that it
would list certain bond futures onto its Automated Pit Trading
(APT) system for daytime trading.
</P>
<P>
Previously, these contracts have traded on LIFFE's floor during
the trading day.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, as from August 3, 1998, APT will be the sole trading
platform for the contracts of BTP future, Bund future and Five
Year Gilt future.
</P>
<P>
By moving these bond futures contracts onto APT, LIFFE is
responding to strong Member demand for using screen-based systems
for trading particular bond futures.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of LIFFE Connect for Financial Futures in
Q2 1999, it was announced LIFFE will migrate the relevant bond
contracts from APT onto this new electronic trading platform.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hodson, LIFFE's Chief Executive said: "By providing
daytime screen-based trading for the BTP, Bund and Five Year Gilt
futures on APT, LIFFE is responding to growing Member demand for
electronic trading of particular bond futures contracts."
</P>
<P>
"It is part of LIFFE's flexible strategy to list its products
on the preferred and most effective platform," he added.

<P>
Vastic's chipped shot beat the Chilean goal-keeper in the injury

know what happened." Acosta said.
</P>
<P>
Vastic, who replaced Mario Haas at the 73rd minute, said after

second half for both teams but in the last minute we got the goal
and the whole team is happy."

PARIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- When France meet South Africa in the new
Stade de France in Saint-Denis on Thursday, the hosts are facing the
pressure no less than that in their opener with several injury
worries.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Aime Jacquet's main concern is again the lack of
finishing power in front of goal with Stephane Guivarc'h ruled out for
knee injury. Even his replacment David Trezeguet, hit by a strained
ankle, is also doubtful.
</P>

Among the defenders, Franck Leboeuf also has thigh muscle injury.

Midfielder Zinedine Zidane said, "You want to win any match but
this one is important as it will qualify us and we will not have to
face Denmark in our last group match under a lot of pressure."
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Saudi Arabia's coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was
still savoring their 1-0 loss to Denmark in their Group B opener.

"I think we lost the game in a moment when we should not have lost.
I think the boys were brave enough. They did their best."

Parreira said his team may surprise the hosts although France were
still the cup favorite here.
</P>

He warned his players against corner kicks that might come of the
Frenchmen.

"I asked them to look out for the corner kicks. A lot of goals have
been scored in the competition on corner kicks," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Exploration for Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has begun exploration for
uranium, a raw material for the production of nuclear energy, in
Kogi State in the central part of the country, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development was
quoted as saying that officials of the ministry's Geological
Survey Department were currently carrying out exploration work
for uranium deposits in parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official hinted that occurrences of the mineral
had also been reported in parts of Gombe State in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, a company might be invited to
undertake the production of nuclear energy once the occurrences
of the mineral in commercial quantities were established.
</P>
<P>
In its effort to exploit the vast potential of the energy
sector, the Nigerian government has established the Nigerian
Uranium Mining Company in partnership with a French company,
under the supervision of the Nigerian Mining Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The project was stalled because the French partners withdrew
at a stage when they feared that a recorded fall in the price of
uranium in the world market meant bad business, the report said,
but did not say when this took place.
</P>
<P>
However, ministry officials were reportedly optimistic that
the uranium mining venture might be reactivated in view of
current development.

The four leaders, accompanied by OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim, will make a similar trip to Eritrea with a view to

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts U.S. Paper for Fabrication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Defense Ministry
official on Wednesday attacked the U.S. newspaper Washington Times
for publishing "fabricated reports" on Iran's cooperation with
other countries to develop its arms programs.
</P>
<P>
The officials news agency IRNA quoted the official, Keyvan
Khosravi, as accusing the daily of making "a desperate attempt to
create a hypothetical enemy."
</P>
<P>
"Printing fabricated reports by the press affiliated to the
international Zionism cannot divert the public opinion from the
Israeli nuclear arms stockpiling," said Khosravi.
</P>
<P>
He said that arms production in Iran is in line with the
requirement of its armed forces, and merely for defense purpose.
</P>
<P>
Frequently accusing Iran of seeking weapons of mass
destruction, the U.S. and Israel have been exerting tremendous
efforts to prevent Tehran from acquiring missile and nuclear
technologies. Israel regards Iran as its leading enemy in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also blasted Israel for taking advantage
of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan last month to launch
extensive efforts to stockpile nuclear arms. Israel is believed to
be the only country in the Middle East that has acquired the
nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
Khosravi said that equipping modern submarines with nuclear
arms was Israel's new practice of developing non-conventional
weapons.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Israel's stockpiling of nuclear arms is
supported by certain segments of western mass media, which are
seeking to ease the pressure exerted on Israel by the world
community.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the U.S. for continuing to bear Israel's
huge burden of military expenditure despite the world objection to
the Israeli nuclear program.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Heading for Pullback Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Both supporters and opponents
are now of the same view that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is heading for a long-overdue agreement on Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, remained tight-lipped on whether such a
deal was forthcoming. In an interview with Israel Radio Wednesday,
he only confirmed reports that some progress has been made in the
last few weeks to prepare the ground for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Significant gaps remain between Israel and the Palestinians, he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader promised that he would work "continuously
and tirelessly" in order to "achieve an agreed and negotiated
solution which will give Israel the security it deserves and will
give us the Palestinian compliance which they promised."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there will be an agreement by the end of the current
Knesset (Parliament) session on July 29, Netanyahu said it depends
on the Palestinian side. He urged Palestinians to adopt "a
realistic attitude, an attitude of keeping their commitments" in
order to accelerate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But several Cabinet ministers, for or against a redeployment
agreement, said Wednesday they were certain that the prime
minister is definitely moving toward a deal with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani of the centrist party
The Third Way, which has been pressing for an agreement, said
Netanyahu's biggest problem now is how to persuade the far-right
National Religious Party (NRP) to accept the deal. The NRP has
threatened to quit the coalition if Netanyahu accepts a major
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
NRP's Minister of Transportation Shaul Yahalom said Netanyahu
has made up his mind on the issue and will not stop it. He
expressed hope that the settlers, traditional political supporters
of the current government, would prevent Netanyahu from carrying
out such pullback.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a recent decision taken by the Council of
Jewish Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on launching an
all-out campaign against major pullback through mass street
protests.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Netanyahu has accepted the U.S. proposal for a
13 percent second redeployment, but the sticking point now is the
scope of the third and last pullback as stipulated in the signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior political source as saying that
Netanyahu is waiting for answers from the United States and the
Palestinians to his proposal on the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, about 4 percent of the Israel-controlled
territories in the West Bank, or Area C, will be designated as
Area C-, where Israel has security control but Palestinians will
exercise broader civil powers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Netanyahu was trying to postpone a
decision on the second pullback till the end of the Knesset
session in an attempt to avoid being brought down by the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied he is counting on the opposition Labor Party's
help to push through his redeployment agreement when it is brought
to the Knesset for vote. But he urged the Labor to support him,
saying "if they are for peace, they should vote for us."
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party is divided over whether it should provide a
"safety net" for the government during the Knesset vote on the
redeployment agreement.
</P>
<P>
Some Labor lawmakers insist that Labor should support Netanyahu
because the broad peace goal should come above the narrow party's
interests, while others argue that the Labor should topple the
incumbent hard-line government at any costs in order to take its
place.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, the government should step down to pave
the way for new elections if 61 members of the 120-member Knesset
vote against it. The Netanyahu-led coalition now holds a
blade-thin 61 majority in the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Number of Abandoned Babies Rises Sharply in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is facing a
dramatic rise in the number of abandoned babies, and child
welfare agencies have appealed to the public for help in
providing homes for the foundlings.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Welfare does not keep records of the number
of babies abandoned, but officials estimate that between 3,000
and 4,000 babies were abandoned across the country last year,
South African Press Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Lynette Schreuder from the National Council of
Child Welfare, the number of children abandoned between April
1997 and April 1998 doubled that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Schreuder said 931 abandoned babies were reported by the
council's 173 affiliates around the country last year. The figure
for 1996/97 was 452.
</P>
<P>
In Johannesburg alone, Johannesburg Child Welfare received 25
cases of abandonment in the first 10 days of June.
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are definitely increasing, each week we record
between 10 and 15 new abandoned babies on our register," said
Shereen Patel, social worker at the organization.
</P>
<P>
Patel said the situation had reached crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
"We are desperately seeking foster homes for these babies,"
she said. "We are facing a crisis situation. There is a
tremendous need for adoptive parents, as well as temporary foster
homes."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the total number of babies abandoned to Johannesburg
Child Welfare was 197 and the agency has managed to find homes
for 52, Patel said.
</P>
<P>
This year the Johannesburg Child Welfare is receiving up to 50
cases a month and Patel estimates that one in three of the babies
are HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Exempt Tax on Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Rwanda has
decided to exempt local trucks importers from
paying import duties for one year as a strategy of revitalizing
the war-torn transport sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a notice issued by the Commissioner of Customs
Murangira Appolinaire last Thursday, all customs collectors were
instructed that "all lorries and trailers, pick-ups, buses and
bulldozers were exempted with immediate effect from paying import
duty," the Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed at boosting transport sector as a primary
necessity as well as to promote inter-regional transportation in
the country for servicing production sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the said exemption does not include sales tax
commonly known as ICHA (imp sur le chiffre d'affaires).
</P>
<P>
In Rwanda, import duty for imported vehicles are calculated
at varied rates from 20 to 50 percent of the basic price plus the
transport cost, depending on the type and size of the car.
</P>
<P>
"Businessmen welcome the decision as most were being
discouraged by rate of taxing which was very high compared with
neighbouring countries," said the secretary of information in
Rwandan Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Some local transporters are opting to import trucks and
register them in Tanzania where heavy and light trucks are
exempted from paying tax for seven years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Opposes Impeachment of Interior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
opposes the impeachment of his Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri,
government spokesman Ataollah Mohajerani said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has praised Nouri as among the "capable and outstanding
personalities" and criticized the impeachment timing as improper
after 31 Majlis (parliament) hardline members called last week for
impeaching Nouri, the official news agency IRNA quoted Mohajerani
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers accused moderate Nouri of creating tensions in
society, making provocative statements and appointing
inexperienced people to managerial positions in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment session is scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani dismissed the allegations by impeachment promoters
that Khatami would change his mind about Nouri once he heard the
lawmakers' report on his performance, saying that it was
impossible Khatami had been unaware of the performance by his most
important cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
"Abdollah Nouri is capable of defending his principled stands
as well as matters relating to the interior ministry," said
Mohajerani, who is also the Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman further criticized the timing of the impeachment
motion which coincided with the visit of Kuwaiti Interior Minister
Sheikh Mohammad Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries warmed up after Khatami
took power last year.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment came at a time when relations between the
moderate government and hardliners in judiciary and parliament
were tense arising from the arrest and trial of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was also a loyalist of the president.
</P>
<P>
Moderate factions have described moves launched by hardliners
as attempts aimed at weakening Khatami's government.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Harassment Cases Reduce in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cases of sexual harassment
against women have drastically dropped in Zanzibar last year, a
senior Zanzibar official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the President's Office responsible
for Women and Children Affairs Asha Bakari told the House of
Representatives that only 10 cases of harassment had been
reported in the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba in Zanzibar
during the year 1997, compared to 31 cases in the previous year,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Four cases had been recorded in Pemba and six cases in Unguja
in 1997 against 13 cases booked in Pemba and 18 in Unguja in
1996, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state attributed the slump of the sexual
harassment cases to the educational program launched by the
government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) against
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
She proposes that the government should harshly punish the
culprits in a bid to fight the offence mostly committed by
adults.
</P>
<P>
She also said the courts have prohibited the mass media to
show the suspected offenders on television screen or announce
their names through radio or newspapers until they were proven
guilty.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a person was innocent unless proved guilty by
the court, she stressed.

<HEADLINE> Blair Warns Hooligans to be Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Wednesday sent a tough warning to soccer thugs that they should
expect the sack if convicted of hooliganism in France.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the parliament, he urged employers to take "strong
action" against the "mindless minority" involved in soccer
violence.
</P>
<P>
The government could not carry on the fight against the
hooliganism alone, he said. "We also...have to encourage employers
to take strong action against those people that are convicted of
football hooligan offenses abroad."
</P>
<P>
He said public service and the armed forces particularly should
target any of their employees involved in hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly (in the case of) anybody who may be employed by the
public service or the armed forces who are convicted of football
hooliganism, I hope very strong action is taken indeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also admitted the British police database of known
hooligans had proved inadequate to deal with supporters who caused
havoc in the French city of Marseille, where England played on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The intelligence that we have about these football hooligans
isn't as great as we need it to be, though we have the most
extensive database on it anywhere in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair had already apologized for the drunken destructiveness of
English fans to French President Jacques Chirac when the two met
at the European Union summit in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
More people had been placed under restriction orders to stop
them travelling to France, and cooperation between the two
countries' police forces had been closer than ever.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Close Turkish-Iranian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Wednesday that Turkey is
willing to develop good relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Iranian Deputy Interior Minister
Gholamhossein Boladian, Sezgin said the exchange of ambassadors in
January showed that the diplomatic ties had been put back on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin said he was glad that the two countries were making
joint efforts to combat organized crimes, terrorism and drugs
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Referring to their diplomatic row last year, the Turkish
official said that such dispute should be prevented in the future.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Turkey declared then Iranian Ambassador to
Turkey Muhammad Reza as "persona non grata" after he attended a
radical religious rally and allegedly attacked Turkey's secular
system.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Tehran asked Turkey to recall its Ambassador to
Iran, sending their relationship to the freezing point.
</P>
<P>
Boladian, for his part, said Iran would make energetic efforts
to further enhance its cooperation with Turkey in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Boladian and his delegation are visiting Ankara to discuss
security issues with their Turkish counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting a separatist war
against the government since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Handheld Devices To Overtake PCs for Net Access, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Cheap devices for mass-market
Internet access will supplant desktop computers within the next
six years, according to a U.S. information technology market
researcher.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Tuesday, International Data Corp. (IDC)
predicted demand for handheld devices will nearly triple in annual
volume from 1997 to 2002, and exceed PC unit sales by 2004 or
2005.
</P>
<P>
In a previous report, IDC said that 1998 should be a banner
growth year for the smart handheld device market as unit shipments
are expected to hit 8.2 million worldwide. The projected growth
represents a 61 percent increase over estimated 1997 unit
shipments of 5.1 million units.
</P>
<P>
Without hinting that the PC will fade away, the Tuesday report,
however, indicated that as prices of simple devices like handheld
units, Web-enabled phones or set-top boxes fall below 100 U.S.
dollars, they will become more popular than PCs.
</P>
<P>
Some industry watchers say that the low-cost Internet device
will replace the PC simply because PC these days provide more
computer power than most people need. But they predict that cheap
access devices will proliferate until people find more compelling
reasons to browse the Internet.
</P>
<P>
An IDC analyst said that even at a low price under 1,000
dollars, people won't have three, four or five PCs around their
houses. People want to go online without having to go to the PC
room -- they want to use it wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
IDC predicts PC makers will eventually get into the low-cost
Internet device market, or risk missing a passing wave.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a new wave of technologies and designs has resulted in
more and more smart handheld devices. Apart from letting users
cruise the Internet, they can keep phone number lists and
calendars and send and receivers e-mail. Most handheld devices
weigh less than a pound and fit into a jacket pocket. But the
keyboards on most units are too small to comfortably write much
more than a short message. In addition, improvements are also
called to make the screens brighter.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Majlis Speaker Urged to Control Radicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis Speaker
Nateq Nouri was urged on Wednesday to use his influence on the
right (conservative) faction to prevent political tensions
"through controlling its radical elements."
</P>
<P>
Making the call, Majid Ansari, chairman of the left-wing
Hezbollah Assembly at the Majlis, said that people such as Nouri
should move to prevent tensions between the left and right
factions.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Ansari as
criticizing the right faction for demanding the impeachment of the
moderate Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, saying the motion was
not helpful to unity.
</P>
<P>
Ansari termed Nouri as the most important minister in the
government of President Mohammad Khatami, stating that any move
against Nouri constitutes a move against Khatami's administration.
</P>
<P>
Some impeachment promoters were those who from the very
beginning had tried to block the Majlis confirmation of some of
Khatami's ministers, said Ansari, a Majlis deputy from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one Majlis deputies called on last Wednesday for
impeachment of the interior minister with charges of creating
tensions in the country, making provocative statements and using
inexperienced people at managerial posts at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the moderate faction and Khatami himself showed strong
support for Nouri, believing that Nouri has the capability to
defend his performances during the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The moderates accused the conservatives of attempting to weaken
the government through the impeachment motion.
</P>
<P>
Some even warned that even if Nouri fails to pass the vote of
confidence at the Majlis session on Sunday, another strong figure
will be nominated to continue his policies.

JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat on Wednesday praised as "important
and crucial" the European Union's call on Israel to recognize the
Palestinian rights to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the blood department in Nasser Hospital in
Gaza, Arafat said the EU's call is helpful for achieving peace in
the region, according to the East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news
service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's information advisor Nabil Abu-Rodaineh also called the
EU's appeal constructive.
</P>
<P>
The EU in its final communique adopted Tuesday at its summit in
Cardiff, Wales, expressed grave concern about the lack of progress
in the Mideast peace process, warning that this could pose great
threat to the stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The communique also urged Israel to recognize the right of the
Palestinians to self-determination, without excluding the option
of a statehood.
</P>
<P>
It meanwhile called on the Palestinians to reaffirm their
commitments to the legitimate rights of Israelis to live within
safe and recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
March last year when Israel broke ground for a new settlement in

<HEADLINE> Thirty Percent Canadian Households Communicate By Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three out of 10 Canadians
households had at least one member who used a computer every month
to communicate, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics agency's survey done last October,
35 percent of households in Alberta had at least one member who
had used some form of computer communication each month, the
largest proportion of any Canadian provinces.
</P>
<P>
Communicating by computer, whether it was for e-mail,
electronic banking or surfing the Internet, was more common in
households with young people.
</P>
<P>
At least one person used a computer regularly to communicate in
38 percent of households in which there was someone under the age
of 18, compared with only 25 percent of households in which there
was no one under 18.
</P>
<P>
Canadians were most likely to use a computer to communicate at
their workplace, which was followed by the home, schools and
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
Of those households that typically used computer communications
every month, 84 percent reported using this modern tool to search
for information on the Internet, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 83 percent said they used them for e-mail.
About one third had someone using computers to communicate from
home for employer-related business.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that 15 percent of households used
the Internet from home in a typical month of communicating,
compared with 14 percent in May, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Support to Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday that he would offer support to the Japanese yen after
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had pledged "aggressive"
financial system reform and other economic steps.
</P>
<P>
"I was very encouraged by the prime minister's statement that
he intends to pursue aggressive reform of their banking
institutions and intends to do the things that were necessary to
get their economy going again," Clinton said in response to a
reporter's question during a White House Rose Garden appearance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke to Hashimoto by telephone Tuesday night after
being briefed by top administration economic and national security
officials.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is very important to the world, especially to the United
States, and to the efforts we're making to support an economic
recovery in Asia, which is very important to keeping our own
economic progress going," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a chance to turn that situation in Asia around
before it gets any worse," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Treasury Department instructed the New York
Federal Reserve to spend an estimated 2 billion dollars to bolster
the sagging yen, selling dollars for the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Rober Rubin said the intervention took place
"in the context of Japan's plans to strengthen its economy" and
said the United States was ready to continue the action if needed.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time U.S. authorities intervened on behalf of
the yen since February 1992 and economists said it indicated how
concerned Washington has become about the slumping Japanese
economy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wanted to "send a clear signal to the markets
that the Untied States supports Japanese reform, and believes the
Japanese people can pull out of this economic slump and restore
growth and opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also dispatched Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to head a high-level U.S. delegation to Japan to discuss
the country's economy and financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the decision was made
after Clinton was briefed by Treasury Secretary Rubin, National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, White House Chief of Staff Erskine
Bowles and others.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the intervention came at a critical moment for
Japan. "The president and the United States government obviously
believe that this is an important moment for Japan to deal with
the challenges that it faces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Japan are prepared to continue to
cooperate in currency markets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces 40 Mln Dlr After-School Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday announced 40 million dollars in grants for 315 rural and
inner-city schools in 36 states to provide safe places for
students to learn after school, on weekends and during the
vacations.
</P>
<P>
The after-school programs are the way to keep kids out of
trouble, said the president. "These grants will give now thousands
more children a safe place to go before and after school and good
things to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Congress to expand the grants in order to reach
up to 500,000 children annually, still a fraction of the 5 million
to 15 million children left home alone after school, according to
administration estimates.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked Congress to increase spending on the program from
40 million dollars this fiscal year to 200 million dollars in each
of the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Opening the announcement at the Rose Garden, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton outlined the stakes for school-age children whose
working parents leave them unsupervised in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Young people are most likely to commit a crime or become a
victim of crime between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. after they leave school
and before their parents get home, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of permitting parents to worry... or seeing these
after school hours as a time to fear, we should see them instead
as a window of opportunity," Mrs. Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The justice and education departments reported that many
communities that have adopted after-school initiatives have
experienced lower juvenile crime rates and lower tobacco, drug and
alcohol use among young people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Boost Iraq's Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States plans a new
effort, funded by Congress, to build up a political opposition to
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, a senior U.S. official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will be launching an effort to help them organize and
coordinate their case against Saddam Hussein," Assistant Secretary
of State Martin Indyk told a group of journalists at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
He said there were 73 opposition groups outside of Iraq and
"now we're going to get behind them and try to help them," he
said. "They represent an alternative vision for Iraq to Saddam
Hussein."
</P>
<P>
"I don't place a high probability on their ability to overthrow
Saddam but it's important they demonstrate there is a different
way of life for the Iraqi people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans proposed spending 38 million dollars
to help Iraqi opposition movements overthrow Saddam after a crisis
earlier this year over an Iraqi crisis on weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Militant Group Ready to Join PNA: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading Palestinian militant
organization that opposes peace with Israel announced Wednesday to
join the Palestinian self-rule government, an offspring of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad (Holy War), headed by Abu Samra, made the
announcement in Gaza on the second day of the ongoing political
consultations held by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) with
opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was carried by Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center, an East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news
service. The report, giving no details, has not been independently
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat is holding the consultations as
part of his preparation for the reshuffle of his PNA cabinet,
following strong criticism by the Palestinian Legislative Council
for corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The parties that participated in the political dialog also
include the leading militant group Hamas, or Islamic Resistance
Movement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the
Democratic Front of the Liberation of Palestine and the People
Party.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Arafat-led Palestine Liberation Organization
recognized Israel and began the current peace process since 1993,
Hamas and Islamic Jihad have refused to join the process and have
vowed to destroy Israel in order to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have gained fame in the past years through
launching attacks against Israel, killing hundreds of Israelis in
a series of suicide bombings of Israeli buses and markets.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Cut Import Tariff on 213 Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is to cut
import tariffs on 213 groups of items in a program of tariff
reduction for access to the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 6.6 percent of the number of products
liable for import tax, the Saigon Times newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tariff-cutting program is part of the effort by the
nine-member ASEAN to facilitate trade and investment
liberalization in the region.
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the bloc -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- have agreed on an
average cut of 5 percent or less under the AFTA program by the
year 2003 at their summit in Bangkok at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar joined the group in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade is preparing a program to lift non-tariff
barriers to increase the competitiveness of local products, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Official Calls for Establishment of Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The nuclear tests in South Asia
underscores the necessity of establishment of a zone free from
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East,
said an Iranian official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Conference on Disarmament, Iran's deputy
foreign minister Javad Zarif called on the international community
to "exert every pressure on Israel to immediately abandon and
dismantle its nuclear weapon programs".
</P>
<P>
"Un-safeguarded nuclear facilities and clandestine nuclear
programs of Israel pose an imminent threat to the peace and
security of the region," Zarif said.
</P>
<P>
"A mistake should not be repeated twice," Zarif said, referring
to the nuclear tests by India and then by Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
"Anything less would but encourage Israel to continue enhancing
its nuclear arsenal, which will undoubtedly have grave
consequences for regional and global peace and security," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official urged Israel to accede without any
precondition to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and accept
unconditionally the safeguards system of the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Markets Surge After Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 (By Xu Haijing)
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock and currency markets across
Asia on Thursday responded warmly to the joint efforts made by the
United States and Japan to bolster the plummeting yen.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index
rocketed 22.21 points, or eight percent, to close at 295.15, only
one step from regaining the 300 psychological level.
</P>
<P>
Transactions are active as some 559 million shares worth 4.35
billion baht (1.08 billion U.S. dollars) changed hands, about six
times and four times higher than that of the bearish days last
week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock markets in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and
other major cities in Asia all recorded great gains from four to
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Back in Japan, the center of the recent financial earthquake,
the Nikkei index gained 646.16 points, or 4 percent, closing above
the 15,000 level.
</P>
<P>
In the currency market, the yen quickly climbed from a nearly
eight-year low of 146 yen to the U.S. dollar to above 136 yen to
one dollar, pushing other Asian currencies higher.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the Thai baht rose to 41.00/41.50 to the
greenback from 42.95/43.33 one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
on Wednesday, the United States put 2 billion dollars into the
market, selling dollars and buying yen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, japan's parliament passed a special 4.65 trillion
yen (32.7 billion dollars) supplementary budget which is part of a
record 16.65 trillion yen (396.4 billion dollars) economic
stimulus package announced in April.
</P>
<P>
The moves had immediately been proved effective as the yen
surged, triggering rallies in stock markets across the United
States and Europe on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the yen's surge reflected a rather
psychological reaction of the market toward the intervention.
</P>
<P>
They said whether the yen can hold on at a favorable level
depends on the effectiveness of the Japanese government's measures
to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Japan is now in the eighth year of the post-bubble era. The
world's second-largest economy has never really recovered from
that big blow.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the country registered negative growth of its gross
domestic product (GDP) in the recent two consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
Demands at home are low, while scandals from financial
companies can be often heard.
</P>
<P>
All these domestic problems in Japan took a toll of economies
in southeast Asian and east Asian countries, since they are
desperately relying on Japan, a so-called "engine" of Asian
development.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest investor in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) while remaining the biggest debtor.
</P>
<P>
Taking Thailand as an example, about 55 percent of the
country's debts are owed to Japan. Meanwhile, Japan is among the
three biggest export markets of Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the yen will deeply hurt the export
industries of Thailand, other ASEAN countries and south Korea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the currency fluctuation triggered by the yen
devaluation is very likely to cause the second round of the Asian
crisis to break out.
</P>
<P>
As the markets welcomed the yen surge after the intervention,
Asian leaders preferred to maintain a clear mind as the
fundamental problems have not been solved.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had pledged to make
every efforts to restore the banking system to health, to achieve
domestic demand-led growth, and to open and deregulate the
Japanese markets.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
Thursday, Asian countries must keep an eye on the development of
the situation in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Chubais: Russia Needs Much Financial Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) - Russia needs up to 15 billion
U.S. dollars of financial assistance to stabilize its financial
market, Anatoly Chubais, the newly-appointed president's special
envoy for finance, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, chairman of United Energy Systems of Russia, was
appointed Wednesday President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for
liaison with international financial agencies in the rank of
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Chubais as saying that the
current economic situation was complicated, and serious
consideration was being given to the idea of attracting additional
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, Russia would not accept financial aid "on
just any conditions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that although borrowing from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) was the cheapest, the organization puts very
tough conditions on its credits.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said he recently had talks with Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov on possible
additional financial aid from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Chubais stressed that Russia should determine its position on
the issue of accepting loans. "There are conditions on the
provision of loans which we would not accept from any financial
organizations," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic said Thursday that the Bosnian war should be a
patent lesson to the parties involved in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,
Plavsic said that hostilities and clashes between the parties in
Kosovo must come to an end and individual rights and democratic
freedoms had to be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Kosovo, a province of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, has been escalating due to ethnic Albanian's demand
for independence.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic and Pangalos agreed to make efforts to maintain peace
in the Balkan region and in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians comprise
90 percent of the province's nearly two million population.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the situation in Bosnia, the
implementation of the Dayton peace agreements and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic arrived in Greece on Monday at the invitation of the
non-governmental organization, Greek Solidarity Caravan, which
undertakes humanitarian missions to crisis areas and has been very
active in sending economic assistance to orphans of the war in
Bosnia.

MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signalled further changes to his government on Thursday, saying
the the cabinet was still being formed and would include "new
figures."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Yeltsin
said that "we have not solved all issues finally" and "the
appearance of new figures is possible."
</P>
<P>
The president stated that the cabinet line-up had "nothing to
do" with the preparation of the anti-crisis program which will be
presented to the government on June 23.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said, "Everybody in the government has his own
duties, and if one does not cope with them, then changes are
possible."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two men discussed government efforts to
stabilize the financial markets, the payment of wages to public
workers, the coal industry, and the upcoming cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
On the anti-crisis program announced by the premier in St.
Petersburg on Wednesday, Yeltsin said shortly before meeting with
Kiriyenko that the main component was "a clear system of control
over its implementation."
</P>
<P>
He said the program would be approved at a cabinet session on
June 23, which he will attend.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Said Not to Attend ASEAN Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will not be able to attend
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to be held in Manila next month
because of the opposition of its arch-rival, India, Philippine
Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who met Indian Minister of State for External Affairs
Vasundhara Raje Wednesday, told reporters that India did not favor
the proposed participation of Pakistan in the upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said earlier several members of the ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum had proposed that
Pakistan be invited to the ARF meeting which is expected to
include the nuclear non-proliferation issue in its agenda.
</P>
<P>
India is a regular ASEAN dialogue partner in the ARF. Pakistan
has a pending application with the forum but has not been admitted
in yet.
</P>
<P>
"Neither did India agree to have Pakistani representative
invited to the ARF dinner following their meeting on July 27,"
Siazon added.
</P>
<P>
According to Siazon, since the ARF works by consensus, the move
to get Pakistan to the Manila meet is dead.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said India has asserted that their problem with Pakistan
is "an internal affair between them" and is inclined to discourage
outside intervention into it.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador to Manila C.P. Ravindranathan said that
instead of ARF bringing India and Pakistan together, "it would be
better if they should first be given ample time and opportunity to
resolve their bilateral differences."
</P>
<P>
Ravindranathan added that discussing their India-Pakistan
bilateral problems in the forthcoming ARF meeting in Manila may be
premature.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Backs Interior Minister against Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- As Iran's factional struggle waged
on, President Mohammad Khatami again came to the defense of his
interior minister Thursday, who faced impeachment by hardline
members of the Majlis (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The absence of Abdollah Nouri in the cabinet would "entail
massive damage for the government and the country," Khatami said
while speaking to a group of staff members of the Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It was the strongest-ever response to a call raised by 31
Majlis deputies last week for the sacking of Nouri on charges of
creating tension in the country, making provocative statements and
using inexperienced people at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The moderate faction believes the impeachment, following the
trial of Tehran mayor who is a close ally of the president, is yet
another move by the conservatives aimed at weakening Khatami's
government.
</P>
<P>
The underdog conservatives who lost the battle to the moderates
in last year's presidential election, insisted that they should
exercise their constitutional rights and prevent the ministers
from "going too far."
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Khatami
acknowledged that the conservatives have the freedom and right to
do so "as defined in the constitution."
</P>
<P>
"I and my administration are highly serious about this
principle; of course it has costs which must be paid, just like
building a bridge or a factory which entails expenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami spoke highly of Nouri, saying that appointing him as
interior minister was "because of his bright record before and
after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and also that "I trust his
piety and the fact that he was trusted by the late leader (Imam
Khomeini)."
</P>
<P>
Nouri once served as Khomeini's representative in the elite
Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, and as member of the State
Expediency Council and interior minister in the government of
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Khatami persuaded the hardliners to "give a vote of confidence"
to Nouri, "in the light of sensitive conditions of the country and
difficult tasks ahead of the government," to allow "the
administration to carry on with its duties and strengthen the
bonds between the Majlis and the government."
</P>
<P>
"Nouri is one of the strongest ministers in the cabinet and his
presence and opinions in all fields are source of blessing for
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's political analysts are pessimistic that Nouri
would be able to survive a vote in the conservative-dominated
Majlis, as he has been singled out as a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
Khatami warned that the conservatives should heed three key
points in the process of impeachment: the constitution, policies
of the system, and the president's program of action approved by
the public in the course of elections and subsequently by the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won the presidency in May last year by a landslide over
his rival, the Majlis speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri. He was
overwhelmingly supported by the young people, women and
intellectuals who were eager for changes in the society.
</P>
<P>
However, it is the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has
the final say in many a critical issue in the country. This time,
it may also up to the reportedly conservative-leaning leader to
finally mediate a solution to the power-wrestling.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- To achieve Compaq Computer's
vision of being the world's best computer company, Compaq Greater
China will integrate the main business of Compaq, Digital and
Tandem to offer the best technologies to customers, it was
announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philip H. Yu, the newly-named president of the Division, with
his headquarters in Beijing, said that the organization and
management teams would be in place by July while the
implementation of policies and processes was expected in the three
months to come.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the company aimed at enhancing business
growth and integrating products, solutions and services from all
the three companies for the benefit of the customers, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the restructuring was for Compaq Greater China to
increase its revenue to 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion U.S. dollars by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Compaq will be the company's master brand. Compaq Greater
China will help its channels and customers to manage a smooth
transition to the single brand while the existing brands "Digital"
and "Tandem" will continue to be used for some products, according
to Yu.
</P>
<P>
For computer and related services, China stands as a giant
market with very positive prospects. Confronted with heated

HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The official gifts from the
inland area, now on display to mark the first anniversary of Hong
Kong's return to China, have grasped the interest of more than
10,000 visitors over the last few days, the organizer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An average of 2,300 Hong Kong people toured the "More than

organized by the Provisional Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was opened at the Council's Sha Tin Town Hall

A Council spokesman attributed the enthusiastic response to
the public anxiety to view these precious items and to feel the
passion and blessing from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The 16 gifts on display are selected from the full collection
presented to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) by
the Central People's government, 31 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Batistuta Says Argentines to "Get Serious" against Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Striker Gabriel Batistuta said his squad
would "get serious" when they meet minnows Jamaica at the Parc des
Princes here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think tings are going to get serious at the next match against
Jamaica," said the Fiorentina forward in l'Etrat near Saint Etienne.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remember the goal we scored against Japan. It was our
first in this World Cup and it's always good for team morale to star
off such a competition with a victory," said Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
He said he would expect better performance from the former World
Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
"We need to follow things up much better because we are still
aiming to be first. We need to convince ourselves that we're going to
be the champions and live up to the reputation of favorites," added
Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
As for himself, he hoped to score at least one goal at each game.
</P>
<P>
"I am the goal scorer (in the game against Japan) and I intend to
be exactly that for every match. The injury is not bothering me any
more."
</P>
<P>
Teammate Roberto Sensini called for the Argentine squad to look out
for Croatia, which they will face in their last group match on June
26.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of pressure on me as I've been made to feel that
I'm vital in the line-up. Without Maradona, I've got even more
responsibilities," said the Parma defender who is playing his third
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia seems very dangerous. They are very strong both
technically and physically. It won't be easy to beat this team," he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Institute Clarifies Reported Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- To reinforce official denial of
reports that Israel conducted a secret nuclear test, the
Seismological Institute (ISI) said Thursday it did not detected
any seismological evidence of such a test.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, ISI's head Abbi Shapira
categorically rejected the claim that a nuclear device was
detonated in the Gulf of Eilat in southern Israel on May 28.
</P>
<P>
He said the institute's seismographical instruments, which he
described as "very sensitive," did not pick up any signals of such
a test.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials earlier firmly denied reports that an
earthquake that jolted the area in late May was caused by a secret
nuclear explosion by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ISI confirmed that there was indeed an earthquake on May
28, but it's epicenter was in the west of Egypt's Mediterranean
port Alexandria and it was a result of natural seismological
activity.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli opposition lawmakers, Rafi Elul of the Labor Party
and Abdul Wahab Darawshe of the Democratic Arab Party, said in the
Knesset (Parliament) Wednesday that they have received information
from the International Atomic Energy Agency about the nuclear
testing. They demanded Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom
clarify on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Shalom gave no immediate answer to the question. But in a
statement issued later, he dismissed the two lawmakers' charges as
"baseless," noting that Israel abides by the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty which it has signed.
</P>
<P>
Ephraim Asculai, spokesman for the Israeli Atomic Energy
Commission, also said Israel has never carried out a nuclear
test. He said his commission had detected only natural
seismological activity instead of signs of a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the safety of the nuclear reactor at the Negev
Nuclear Research Center in Dimona in the south, Shalom said
regular examinations showed that it is safe and "there is no
reason to stop its operation."
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only country in the Middle East that has acquired
nuclear capability. Although western intelligence reports claimed
it has about 200 nuclear warheads, Israel has neither confirmed
nor denied that it has any nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The series of nuclear tests conducted in May by India and
Pakistan, the two arch rivals in south Asia, have got on Israeli
nerves. Calling the Pakistani explosions as the first "Islamic
Bomb," Israel is worried that nuclear weapon technology could soon
be transferred to its enemies in the region like Iran.

<HEADLINE> "Key" Used By AIDZ Virus Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have
discovered the three-dimensional shape of the "key" that the
AIDZ virus uses to unlock and enter cells, The Washington Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say this is an advance that could speed the
development of new drugs and a vaccine against HIV.
</P>
<P>
Scientists already knew a lot about the key, a complex
protein called gp120 that sticks out from the AIDZ virus like
dozens of spikes. But the new work exposes far more detail about
its defenses and its potential vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
The work is reported by Sodroski, Wayne Hendrickson of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Columbia University in New
York, and other scientists.
</P>
<P>
The gp120 spikes on the AIDZ virus bind to two protein sites,
one after the other, on the surface of a cell. That essentially
unlocks the cell for the virus to enter. The first site called
CD4, has a chemical finger that fits precisely into a hole on gp 120.
</P>
<P>
The new work reveals details of that hole, which might allow
scientists to design drugs that essentially plug it, and thus
prevent infection. The researchers also exposed other sites on
gp120 that are crucial for infection, and so might be targets
for an interfering molecule.

<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Hamburg-Berlin high-speed train was
slowed down, but not derailed, Wednesday afternoon after hitting
gravel deliberately placed on the tracks near the northern German
town of Buechen, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-City Express (ICE) passed through the gravel on a
50-meter stretch of track at a speed of about 150 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the noise, the driver slowed the train to 120
kilometers an hour and continued to Berlin where the train was
inspected.
</P>
<P>
According to an Interior Ministry report last week, Germany has
registered 40 attempts to sabotage rail traffic this year so far.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident also came just two weeks after another ICE
train derailed and crashed into a road bridge near the northern
German town of Eschede, killing 100 people and injuring 88.
</P>
<P>
Police, however, have not linked the tragedy to any deliberate
attack. A broken wheel caused by metal fatigue or material defect
is believed to the cause of the derailment.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Pledges Support in Reviving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President and
President-Elect Joseph Estrada on Thursday committed the
Philippines' support to all efforts that will be taken by its
neighbors in Asia in reviving the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Estrada said "we support all measures that
will be taken by Japan and other OECD (Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development) countries to strengthen the yen,
revive the Japanese economy."
</P>
<P>
Experts said the recovery of the economies of Asia from the
currency turmoil that hit the region last year rests heavily on
the Japanese economy's ability to survive the recession it is
presently facing.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who will take his oath of office on June 30, said his
government will also support "the Asian economies that have been
adversely affected by the regional financial economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the commitment even as he admitted that the
Philippines will "take longer to achieve economic growth with
equity and prosperity for all."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "we are strongly committed to economic
policies and programs that will promote and finance exports,
maintain fiscal discipline and micro-economic stability."
</P>
<P>
He particularly cited the plan by his administration to
counteract the Philippine economy's reaction to the fall of the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Among these are moves to "strengthen the banking system,
continue expanding the liberalization of foreign trade and the
peso, privatize government corporations and increase global
competitiveness of domestic firms."

brotherhood," etc.
</P>
<P>
Since the Indian government conducted five successive
underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, various political
parties and mass organizations have accused the government of
conducting the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In their resolution adopted at the rally, the marchers appealed
to all nations in the world, including those that are already
nuclear power states, "to come together and work towards banning
further development of nuclear weapons as well as the destruction
of those that already exist in those nations."
</P>
<P>
Similar protest demonstrations were held in New Delhi, capital
of India, as soon as the government conducted nuclear tests last
month.

<HEADLINE> "India Today" Reveals Nuclear Test Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A 100-strong core team of
nuclear experts participated in India's recent nuclear tests, said
the latest issue of India Today magazine in a cover story on the
country's five underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
The team members donned army uniforms to avoid raising
suspicion among locals over their frequent visits to Pokhran range
and kept the decision to go ahead with the tests top secret, the
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
So detailed was the planning that scientists were even given
army ranks according to their seniority.
</P>
<P>
For example, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram
was code-named Major General Natraj whenever he visited Pokhran
during preparations for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Scientific adviser to the Defense Minister and Defense Research
and Development Organization Chief A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was known
as Major General Prithviraj.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the transport of plutonium fissile material cores,
the magazine said that 10 days before the blasts, an air force
transport An-32 aircraft took off from Mumbai's Santa Cruz airport
at night with the materials.
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, a convoy of trucks lined up to meet the
aircraft and half-a-dozen wooden crates were placed inside one of
them.
</P>
<P>
To make it seem a routine movement, no extra security was
provided as they sped to the range under the cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
Inside those crates, protected by metal shield, were perfectly
shaped spherical balls of explosive grade plutonium, with each
ball weighing between five and 10 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Once in Pokhran, the crates were moved into makeshift
laboratories where other packages containing conventional
explosives, detonators and triggers had been flown in and
scientists began constructing the devices, the magazine said.

ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange

There were 45 gainers, 49 losers, while 31 Scripps remained

The KSE-100 Index went down Thursday mainly because of the two

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to Record High in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot up
to a record high of 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in April, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the deficit was 9.5 percent higher
than the March imbalance of 13.2 billion dollars, the previous
record. The growth is largely blamed on the Asian currency
devaluations which help Asian exports, pushing down the U.S. sales
abroad.
</P>
<P>
While imports declined a slight 0.9 percent after hitting an
all-time high the month before, U.S. exports fell even more
sharply, dropping 2.6 percent as the deepening recession in many
Asian markets cut into U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of this year, the U.S. deficit in
goods and services signalled an annual rate of 149 billion
dollars, on track to set a record, far surpassing last year's
imbalance of 110.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan edged down 6 percent in April to 5.4
billion dollars but is still running 13.3 percent ahead of the
same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the entire Pacific Rim region, which includes South Korea
and other countries and regions hard hit by the currency crisis,
the U.S. trade deficit in the first four months of this year
totalled 48.7 billion dollars, 38 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In April, the 2.6 percent drop in the exports of goods and
services pushed them down to 77.1 billion dollars. Exports of
goods fell to 55.3 billion dollars, the lowest level since
February 1997. Exports of the U.S. farm products dropped to 3.8
billion dollars, the lowest level since September 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the export categories declining were sales of commercial
aircraft which fell 926 million dollars to 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services, which hit a record high of 92.4
billion dollars in March, slipped 0.9 percent in April to 91.6
billion dollars, but still the second-highest level in history.
</P>
<P>
The 14.5 billion dollar deficit was the highest since the
government began tracking goods and services on a monthly basis in
1992. For goods alone, the deficit of 21.5 billion dollars was
also the highest in the U.S. history.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Moves Higher on Yen in Tokyo After Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar moved slightly
higher on the Japanese yen in Tokyo Thursday as market players
returned to dollar buying in the absence of follow-up intervention.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 136.87-90 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), up from 135.70-75 yen at 9 a.m., and from 136.45-55 yen
late Wednesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the dollar fell to 135.50 yen at one point, its
lowest level in Tokyo in almost a month.
</P>
<P>
Market players pushed the dollar higher against the yen, albeit
less aggressively than in recent days, in the wake of the
intervention by the United States and Japan early Wednesday in New
York, which sent the dollar from 142 yen to 137 yen.
</P>
<P>
Japanese insurers, institutional investors and importers showed
solid dollar-buying interest during the day, which pushed the
dollar to higher levels against the yen, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
But concern that the Bank of Japan would enter the market
during the Tokyo dealing helped keep the dollar from climbing too
fast, they said.
</P>
<P>
Market players avoided aggressive dealing during the day ahead
of the expected arrival of U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers to Japan, and his meetings with Japanese monetary
officials.
</P>
<P>
A Group of Seven (G7) meeting of finance ministers' deputies
Saturday in Tokyo also gave participants reason to be cautious,
dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Thursday vowed to step up efforts to resolve the
bad-loan problem of Japanese banks so as to stimulate the domestic
economy and restore market confidence.
</P>
<P>
"To spark a rebound in the stalled economy, I will do my best
to help write off bad loans, achieve growth driven by domestic
demand, open Japanese markets further and promote deregulation,"
Hashimoto said at the end of the regular 158-day Diet (parliament)
session.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he thought the joint Japan-U.S. intervention to
support the yen Wednesday "won high marks from the markets."
</P>
<P>
"To maintain their appreciation, we need to put in our best
effort to wipe out anxieties about the future of the Japanese
economy in a way that can produce visible results," he said.
</P>
<P>
For that purpose, nonperforming loans held by financial
institutions had to be disposed of so that confidence in the
country's financial system would recover, Hashimoto stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said his government would take drastic measures to
resolve the bad-loan problem, which has been dragging economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks' bad loans have amounted to 27 trillion yen
(197.5 billion U.S. dollars), according to a government estimate
unveiled in January.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also reiterated his government's intention to lower
income tax rates as a step to spur economic recovery and to reduce
corporate tax rates from 46.5 percent to about 40 percent to match
the rates seen in most major industrialized countries as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
On the July 12 House of Councillors (upper house) elections,
Hashimoto expressed his resolve to lead his Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) to victory.
</P>
<P>
Japan's 142nd ordinary Diet session closed early Thursday,
setting the stage for campaigns officially beginning June 25 for
the upper house.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Pleased with Yeltsin-Milosevic Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria on Wednesday welcomed the
pledge by Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to continue
negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders from Kosovo, but called
for the promise to be kept.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Milosevic during his two-day visit to Moscow this week was
encouraging, Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov
said.
</P>
<P>
The next task was to implement the agreement and observe the
requirement to stop the use of force by Belgrade against Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic has agreed to resolve the Kosovo crisis by political
means and cease repressive action against civilians -- demands
drawn up by the Contact Group on Yugoslavia comprising the United
States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The group has urged the Yugoslavian government to grant
meaningful autonomy to Kosovo and demanded progress in talks with
the ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman restated Sofia's commitment to carefully
monitoring the Kosovo situation and remaining in contact with its
partners in the Balkan region in a bid to find a lasting solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has been escalating since February when Serbian
police clashed with ethnic Albanians seeking independence from
Belgrade and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has stripped the autonomy of the ethnic Albanians
since early 1990s and strongly opposed any external intervention
into the crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes thundered across the skies just outside
Yugoslavian airspace on Monday in a show of strength intended as a
deterrent to the use of force by the Yugoslavian government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xiangshun, a prominent
Chinese scientist, has called for legislation for basic
scientific research in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the call at the Second Meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
applied mathematics research institute, said China needs to give
more support to scientific research in the way developed countries
do and should allocate more funds for the natural science
foundation, national research institutes, and university research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 5,000 research institutes with about
700,000 people, who have long been underpaid and gotten by with
scant research funds, he said, so the country needs a law to help
institutes get adequate funding and better pay for researchers.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jingpei, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and vice president of Nankai University,
shared Zhang's opinion. He said that fund shortages have seriously
hampered basic scientific research at universities.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the government needs to put more into basic
research if it wants to keep up with global scientific and
technological development.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Launch Program to Raise Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
immediately implement an agriculture program in a bid to increase
the country's husked rice production and reduce rice imports, a
minister said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The crash program will cover 500,000 hectares of rice fields,"
Agriculture Minister Soleh Solahuddin told reporters after a
meeting with President B. J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to double or triple the yields of rice fields,
especially those with irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics has announced that the year's
first harvest season will yield only 48 million tons of husked
rice, 2.5 percent less than the 51 million tons produced in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The second harvest season is expected to yield even less with
43 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The crash program aims to add at least 2 million tons to this
or match the first harvest season's 48 million tons," he said.
</P>
<P>
A further decline in forecast rice production will oblige the
country to import more rice, he said. It was reported that
Indonesia would import at least 3.1 million tons of rice this
year.
</P>
<P>
On the decline in the country's rice production, Solahuddin
said one of the factors that caused this is that farmers used up
only 28 percent of the seedlings provided by the Agriculture
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the lack of tractors, he said, citing that
there are only 60,000 tractors across the country, which are only
13 percent of the actual demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the 60,000 tractors, only about 40 percent are
functioning.

The establishment of such a partnership requires strategic and
long-term vision when reviewing and handling Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are two of the world's most
influential countries. The kind of Sino-U.S. relations to be
brought into the 21st century will not only affect the immediate
interests of the two countries, but also peace and stability
of the whole world, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
A sound and stable development of Sino-American relations can
be achieved as long as both sides keep the whole world in view and
look into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such a Sino-American partnership also
requires actively seeking and expanding common ground on the part
of the two sides. China and the United States have different
social systems, but they also share extensive common interests.
</P>
<P>
The world today is not all peace. Armed conflicts erupt one
after another. The nuclear arms race in South Asia is worrisome.
As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the
United States share the same interests and responsibility in
safeguarding regional and world peace.
</P>
<P>
In such global issues as environmental protection, the war
against drugs, and international terrorism and crime, prospects
for the two countries' cooperation will expand rather than shrink,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the economic globalization, the two
countries' cooperation to stablize Asia's economy, especially
Asia's finance, is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
Economically speaking, China and the United States are mutually
complementary, with great potentials and bright prospects for
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In short, the two counties' common ground are larger than their
differences. As long as both countries adopt positive attitudes to
expand their common ground and narrow their divergences,
favorable conditions will be created for the development of
bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
To establish a relationship of strategic partnership, China and
the United States need to handle their differences properly. When
doing that, the principles of mutual respect and seeking common
ground while reserving differences should be observed.
</P>
<P>
There is no denying that China and the United States still hold
different opinions on such issues as Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has always advocated that dialogue be held in an
appropriate manner on the basis of equal consultation so as to
reduce or even iron out these differences. Those which cannot be
settled right away should be laid aside for the time being, rather
than being allowed to pose obstacles to the overall situation of
the development of China-U.S. relations, the commentary adds.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Liquidates Fifty-Five Nonviable Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean government commission
Thursday announced a list of 55 nonviable companies, including 20
belonging to the nation's top five conglomerates, for liquidation
in the first big step toward economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that Daewoo
Group had five companies listed for liquidation, followed by
Hyundai, Samsung and LG groups each with four and SK Group with
three.
</P>
<P>
"The selection of 55 ailing companies is just the beginning of
corporate restructuring. We will continue to weed out nonviable
companies, big or small, without mercy," said the commission.
</P>
<P>
The ailing companies will be immediately cut off all fresh
loans and enter into proceedings for liquidation or takeover.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the need to restructure the industries with
overlapping investment was inevitable in order to raise
competitiveness and dispose of bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The commission's move is in line with South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung's demand for the drastic and swift restructuring of
large conglomerates, which are blamed for the ongoing financial
crisis, to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerates are reportedly strongly opposed to the
government's attempt to arrange "big deals", which are aimed at
disposing of their unprofitable companies to raise the
competitiveness of their products in the international markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has decided to advance its bank
extension of 12 trillion won (9.2 billion U.S. dollars) in special
loans to small and medium-sized companies to prevent bankruptcies
in the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it will start the second selection of more
ailing companies for liquidation while speeding up disposal of the
55 firms' assets and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Korea signed an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for a loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars
tied to strict conditions, including economic restructuring and
mass layoffs.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission approved
on Thursday an emergency aid package of 1.5 million ECU (1.65
million U.S. dollars) for refugees fleeing Kosovo and for host
communities in neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
The package, to be managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office, will enable United Nations institutions and
non-governmental organizations to deliver aid in the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
The funding will be used to help distribute the essentials,
such as food and medicine, to refugees and to host communities as
well as to reception centers which are preparing to accept more
refugees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,000 people are estimated to have fled their homes
in Kosovo and more than 10,000 have crossed the border into
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 15-nation European Union decided
early last week to impose new sanctions on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in an effort to force it to stop the indiscriminate use
of force against the civilian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The new sanctions include a ban on all new European investment
in Serbia and the freezing of Belgrade's state-held funds in EU
member countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government protested
on Wednesday against an alleged Yugoslavian military violation of
the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Albanian Telegraphic Agency, Yugoslavian
frontier guards shot dead an Albanian who was on Albanian
territory on Tuesday, then crossed the border to pull the body
across to Yugoslavian soil.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Belgrade's charge d'affaires ad interim to
Tirana, the Albanian Foreign Ministry warned that the dangerous
incident constituted an escalation of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government strongly urged Belgrade to stop
immediately violations which could lead to serious consequences,
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
On an inspection to the Albania-Yugoslavia border Wednesday,
Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani said his country was determined
to protect its boundary.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Tirana has officially acknowledged border
clashes with Yugoslavia since the Serbian province of Kosovo
descended into a bloody military conflict in February.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in the
province and separatists are seeking independence.

England is bidding for the 2006 World Cup along with Germany but

<HEADLINE> Housing Reform Embraces Popular Support (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At present, there are still more than 3 million urban
households in China with a per capita living space of less than 4
square meters. They are as eager as Wang Liang to improve their
dwelling conditions.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that 45 percent of Beijing families plan to buy
homes in the next five years, and want to get banking support.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Zigang, manager of the credit department of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the housing reform will
help improve the mortgage business of banks, which will in turn
help turn the home-buying wishes into real purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
He expects a mortgage spree will be in full swing in the fourth
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai and Fujian Province, where mortgage loan service is
considered sound, more than 80 percent of the newly built housing
has been sold to individual buyers.
</P>
<P>
Popular support for the housing reform has also been triggered
by people's discontent with the old welfare housing allocation
practice.
</P>
<P>
Under such a practice, the state can hardly recover its
investment in housing from the low rents they receive from tenants
and thus have inadequate money for new construction.
</P>
<P>
Because the supply falls short, housing allocations have to be
based on seniority and rank, thereby producing unfairness.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can buy houses with the money we earn, we feel fairer,"
said Zhang Ping, a young government employee.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe the crux of the matter lies in the
affordablity to ordinary home buyers. They called for the
governments at various levels to aim more for the mid- and
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the government has already worked out the principle
of letting urban residents buy homes with 20 or 30 percent of
their income in the coming 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
To win wider support, the government has also decided to
continue to provide low-rent housing to low-income families.

<HEADLINE> FM: Turkey to Take Measures Against Any Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said here Thursday that Turkey will take and is taking all
kinds of measures in response to any attack and preparations
directed against the security of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks at a press conference concerning the
landing of four Greek F-16 fighters and a C-130 cargo plane at the
Phaphos Military Air Base in Cyprus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six Turkish F-16 fighters arrived at the Gecitkale Military
Air Base on the Turkish Cypriot side Thursday in retaliation for
the landing of the Greek planes in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will be directly liable for all the developments which
can be caused by this dangerous escalation of tension, which has
been started by the Greek side on Cyprus," said Cem.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey has carefully evaluated the action taken by
Greece and Cyprus, which upsets the strategical balances on Cyprus
and in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding that this kind of action
has prompted Turkey to take necessary measures.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that the attack plans of Greece
on the Greek Cypriot side in Cyprus, the military doctrine
implemented jointly by Greece and the Greek Cypriot side and the
(Russian-made) S-300 missiles, which they try to deploy on the
island, show clearly that southern Cyprus will be a springboard in
case of a possible attack against Turkey from southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, the S-300 missiles are not an element of
defense, rather an important part of a possible attack and plan
against Turkey," added Cem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
missiles worth 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000-50,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the
northern part of the island with the claimed aim of protecting the
security of the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in
1983 a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" there, which is
recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Power to Be Self-supplied in S. Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cabora Bassa Power Plant in
Mozambique's northern Tete Province will soon supply electricity
to the southern part of the country, Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi has said.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said this after he held talks with visiting Portuguese
State Secretary of Treasury and Finance Fernando Teixeira Dos
Santos, exchanging views on issues concerning the power plant,
the Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican premier said the operation of the Cahora Bassa
electricity generation plant will not affect the domestic
institutions but instead, it will have influence on the budget
and large potential investors.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the capital city of Maputo, Gaza and Inambane
Provinces in southern Mozambique are using electricity supplied
by South Africa. For this, Mozambique has to pay 1.2 million
U.S. Dollars each month to its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi noted that after the Cabora Bassa Power Plant begins
supplying electricity to southern Mozambique, his country can
save between 800,000 and 900,000 U.S. Dollars every month.
</P>
<P>
He added that direct negotiations on payment will take place
between the two share-holders of the power plant, as Portugal
holds 82 percent of its shares while the Mozambicans have 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
A successful cooperation between the two sides on this issue
will set a good example for other cooperative projects between
the two countries, Mocumbi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the Privatization of the plant is possible but it
should be carried out in the context of the integration of
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Cahora Bassa Power Plant was set up in the late 1970s with
a capacity of 2.075 million kilowatts. The major buyer then was
South Africa. It was out of service for long because of civil
war.
</P>
<P>
However, the plant and its cables were rehabilitated by the
end of last year. But so far, it does not supply electricity to
South Africa due to disagreement on power prices.

<HEADLINE> Four Indonesian Banks Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Four more private banks in
Indonesia, Bank Mashill, Bank Jaya, Bank Ciputra and Bank Media
are merging, the official Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four banks last Wednesday signed a memorandum of
understanding on their merger, the report quoted a statement of
Bank Mashill as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new bank is to be called Bank Mashill, with assets of more
than 3.6 trillion rupiah (240 million U.S. dollars), an equity of
536 billion rupiah (35.7 million dollars) and 129 branches across
the country.
</P>
<P>
None of the four banks had obtained liquidity support from the
central bank or has been listed under the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA), the statement said. The merger aims
to improve the banks' competitiveness by raising their liquidity
and capital to gain more customers, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has called on private banks in the
country to merge in a bid to improve the banking system and the
efficiency of private banks.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has about 200 private banks and most of them are
facing financial problems. More than 10 private banks have gone
into merger since October last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Trip to Further Ties With China: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton's
forthcoming visit to China, the first by a U.S. president in 10
years, will certainly push Sino-U.S. relations forward, says a
commentary in China's leading newspaper the People's Daily on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commentary describes Clinton's China tour from June 25 to
July 3 as another major event in Sino-U.S. relationship following
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful state visit to the
United States last year.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit last fall, the two leaders reached
consensus on the orientation and framework for the development of
Sino-U.S. ties, deciding to make joint efforts to establish a
constructive strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The agreement indicated that the relationship between the two
counties has entered into a new stage of development, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Since Jiang's U.S. tour, a fine momentum of development has
appeared in relations between the two countries, with exchange of
visits at high levels increased, consultations becoming more
frequent, and cooperation on bilateral and international issues
obviously enhanced, it notes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, exchange of visits by military leaders and
cooperation and exchanges in the military field have also
increased or expanded.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a steady growth in exchanges in the
economic, trade, scientific, technological, legislative,
educational, cultural and military fields. The bilateral agreement
on the peaceful use of nuclear energy has begun with a smooth
start, and the agreements and contracts on large projects signed
during Jiang's visit are being gradually implemented.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, U.S. leaders have reiterated on several
occasions that the United States will stick to the "One-China"
policy and adhere to the principles as contained in the three
Sino-American joint communiques, not supporting the concept of
"Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan," nor Taiwan's independence
or entry into the United Nations or other international
organizations composed of sovereign states, the commentary recalls.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tourism Hit by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's tourism industry was
hit by another fall in number of visitors from Asia in May, led by
an almost 80 percent plunge from South Korea, official figures
revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only 3,900 South Koreans and 3,300 Thais came to Australia in
May, down 78.5 percent and 59.3 percent respectively from the
numbers in May 1997, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
preliminary figures show.
</P>
<P>
Tourist numbers from Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia plunged
19.6 percent and 11.3 percent respectively last month, compared
with May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Overall tourist arrivals fell by 1.8 percent to 283,900.
</P>
<P>
But there were rises in the arrivals from the United States,
New Zealand and Europe, and there was a 2.2 percent rise from
Japan, Australia's largest tourist source.
</P>
<P>
The increases went a long way towards filling the gap left by
Asia's spiraling economic downturn, the Tourism Task Force (TTF)
said.
</P>
<P>
TTF chief Christopher Brown said there were too many other
problems over which Australia had no control, like the Asian
economy, which added complications caused by independent MP
Pauline Hanson's anti-Asian immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Council Australia said the overall fall showed the
Asian crisis was continuing to affect the industry despite good
growth out of the United States and Europe.

Music Festival to be held from Sunday to Monday, said the local
governor of the Herault region Daniel Constantin on Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Asian Bankers Optimistic About Regional Economy  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior bankers from China,
Thailand and several other Asian nations today expressed their
confidence in the regional economy, which has been severely hurt
by a financial crisis since last July.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic foundation of Asia is good and the
financial crisis has not damaged the fundmentals for the region's
economic growth, said Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank
of China, the central bank, at the 4th annual meeting of the
Association of Development and Industrial Banks in Asia (ADIBA).
</P>
<P>
"The Asian development mode still has considerable vigor," Dai
told the meeting, saying that Asia will prosper again after two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Asia will remain one of the economically most
dynamic places in the world in the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz Mokhtar, chief executive officer of Bank Bumiputra
(Malaysia) Berhad, said Japan's economic recovery is crucial as it
will be the keystone for the recovery of the whole of the Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook on the region may remain bleak for another year,
but as many economists believe the miracle still lies in Asia for
many years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, which has snarled a number of
countries and regions including Malaysia, the Philippines,
Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Japan,
has left a grave impact on the economy of the region, resulting in
massive currency devaluations, mounting unemployment and economic
recession.

<P>
Some economists have pointed out that the Asian economy has
touched bottom for the first time in 20 years, with per capita
income of several countries having dropped to the level of 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial crisis has been largely brought under
control and the regional economy will soon recover, although
economic growth is widely expected to slow down significantly this
year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and the Republic of Korea are now on their way to
stabilizing their currencies while Indonesia has pledged to the
International Monetary Fund to commit to the new economic reforms
signed in early April, and these developments have helped to
restore confidence in the region, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that signs of turnaround in some of the Asian
financial markets has actually begun as early as the beginning of
this year," Mokhtar said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's meeting were bankers from Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore
and India.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1995, ADIBA is an organization of policy-oriented as
well as industry-oriented financial institutions of Asian
nations. It is designed to bolster economic ties among the major
economies in Asia and thereby contribute to Asia's economic
growth. Currently, it has nine member countries.

<HEADLINE> Housing Reform Embraces Popular Support (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Housing Fund
Management Center has been crowded with local residents these days
seeking consultations and filling out forms.
</P>
<P>
What they can acquire from the center is low-interest mortgage
loans they badly need to buy back from their working unit the
housing they may have lived in for decades because the ongoing
housing reform will put a halt to the 50-year-long welfare housing
allocation practice.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the China Construction Bank, the center has
issued more than 2,000 batches of government-subsized housing
loans since October.
</P>
<P>
"Though preconditions for requiring the loan are quite
involved, the demand is strong as well," said Li Chiying, the head
of the center. "We plan to expand the credit scale to 1 billion
yuan (120.48 million U.S. dollars) or more next year, from this
year's 600 million yuan."
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economy, government departments and state
enterprises allocate low-rent housing to their employers. Now the
reformist government wants to sell the houses to the occupants in
a bid to improve people's living standard and invigorate the
housing market. Chinese people are enchanted by the government's
slogan: "Let the people possess their own home."
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, buying a home has been considered one of the
hottest topics for Chinese urbanites, while the media have been
bombarded with housing advertisements.
</P>
<P>
This month, Wang Liang, who had been living with his parents
since marriage, bought a two-room flat in eastern Beijing with
100,000 yuan of personal savings and 200,000 yuan of
mortgage. "Owning a home gives me a real sense of independence,"
said the 30-year-old Wang, who has to pay back the loan within 20
years.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sponsors Workshop for Nepali Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A workshop financed by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) for 25 lawyers from the Nepali Ministry of
Law and Justice will open here Friday, the bank said in a press
release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which focuses on the preparation, negotiation and
implementation of international financial transactions, is a first
step toward long-term support by ADB for institution building in
the Nepali ministry, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the workshop will be led by Gabriel A. Moens, professor
of the Law School of the University of Queensland, and Martin
Klapper, a partner with the law firm of Clarke and Kann in
Brisbane, Australia.
</P>
<P>
At a preparatory meeting on Wednesday, Tirtha Man Sakya,
secretary of the Nepali Ministry of Law and Justice, highlighted
the importance of the workshop for Nepal and the need for lawyers
to receive continuous training to keep abreast of the rapid
international developments affecting Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Madhab P. Ghimire, joint secretary at the Finance Ministry of
Nepal, said this workshop is the first of its kind in Nepal and
should be viewed as a building block which will hopefully result
in tangible benefits for the administration of justice and the
Nepalese people.
</P>
<P>
Marshuk Ali Shah, resident representative of ADB in Nepal, said
that while Nepal has liberalized its trading practices in line
with international developments, the ADB is keen to support
further development of the Nepalese legal framework in which
further liberalization will take place.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is part of a project financed by the ADB which
aims to train lawyers in the Nepali Ministry of Law and Justice in
international financial agreements, international commercial
arbitration and legal data retrieval using the Internet, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the first training session on Friday will be
followed by more in September and December. A second group of 25
lawyers will receive intensive training in legal research using
the Internet, including hands-on training using personal computers
purchased under the project, the bank said,
</P>
<P>
The ADB is financing the project under a technical assistance
grant of 150,000 U.S. dollars for capacity building of the Nepali
Ministry of Law and Justice.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Opening of 14th National Congress of CYLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be published on
Friday's People's Daily hails the opening of the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
The congress, held at a crucial stage of China's reform and
opening-up drive, is of great importance to an all-round
advancement of the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century, the editorial states.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the five years since the convocation of
the 13th National Congress of CYLC were the extraordinary years in
Chinese history, which have demonstrated that the Chinese younger
generation is a promising generation and is capable of shouldering
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese younger generation should take pains to study hard
on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and especially the Deng
Xiaoping Theory, the editorial says. The study of the theory
should be aimed to solve practical problems cropped up during the
course of China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
As the younger generation are at a critical period of fostering
their correct world outlook, and outlook on life and value
concept, they should have a good grasp of these theories, which is
very helpful for them to achieve success in a complex domestic and
international environment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the younger generation should learn and work hard at
modern science and technology, which have been increasingly become
the powerful motive force for social development, the editorial
notes.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that young people are full of creativity, it says
that many major discoveries, inventions and creations in history
have been accomplished by them and international contests are, in
a sense, competitions between the creativities among the young
people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the building of socialist market economy is an
unprecedented cause, the younger generation of the Chinese faces
an arduous but glorious task which is also a golden opportunity
for them to establish themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the younger generation should work hard and
assiduously in the course of building, developing and improving
socialist market economy, and the relatively complete socialist
market economic system will be built mainly through this
generation's efforts, and all younger people with aspirations and
lofty ideals should tamper themselves and perform outstanding
deeds for the accomplishment of this cause, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> China to Help More Unemployed Women Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China will help 1.68 million
unemployed and laid-off women find jobs within three years,
according to an official with the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to provide professional training for 800,000
unemployed and laid-off women each year during the 1998-2000
period, and help 70 percent of them find new jobs, said Liu Yazhi,
vice-minister of Labor and Social Security, at a symposium here
today on the follow-up actions to the Fourth World Conference on
Women.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese women are facing great pressure to keep their jobs in
textile and other light industries, which have more women
employees than men," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The country has had an overall increase in the number of
unemployed and laid-off workers. Statistics show that, by the end
of last year, there had been 5.768 million jobless people who had
registered with their local governments, about 53 percent of whom
were women, while more than half of the 10 million laid-off
workers in China were women.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that more than 20 provinces and municipalities in
China have issued favorable policies for laid-off women to find
jobs, and special centers have been established across the country
to provide professional training and job opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
The departments of labor and social security have also expanded
their insurance coverage for women on labor leave, with 24.8
million people benefiting from the insurance system in more than
1,200 cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation has also launched a project to
help the government give professional training to one million
laid-off women and provide jobs to 470,000 women.
</P>
<P>
With women accounting for 46.4 percent of the country's 696
million employed people, China is one of the countries with the
highest employment rate of women in the world. enditem

The introduction of the song is evidence that the information
industry of China, in which Microsoft is a significant player,
places importance on utilizing various channels to promote public
awareness of copyright laws, as well as legal leverage to confront
the infringement, said an official with China's State Press and
Publications Administration.
</P>
<P>
Combining efforts from the software and music industries, both
of which are greatly concerned with copyright protection, is
creative and should be appreciated, he said.
</P>
<P>
To help promote the use of authorized software among individual
computer users, Microsoft has signed pre-installation agreements
with major Chinese personal computer manufacturers such as Legend
and Great Wall to ensure customer access to both computer name
brands and authentic Microsoft operating system software.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Microsoft has brought the Chinese market into a
global action. Microsoft OEM System Builder Program, according to
Wu Shihong, general manager of Microsoft (China), and computer
manufacturers of all sizes, hardware sellers and computer
assemblers will benefit from the authentic software promotion
program.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that these moves have been helping
contain unauthorized duplication of software, and strengthening
the position of genuine products by bringing about convenient
technology support and after-sale service to customers.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program to Help Anhui's Anti-Poverty Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) of
the United Nations has agreed to provide 3.3 million U.S. dollars
worth of food to help east China's Anhui Province implement its
poverty-eradication program in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed today in Beijing between
the WFP and China's Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Else Larsen, WFP representative to Beijing, said the assistance
will be used in five impoverished counties in Anhui, mainly to
help local women with educational and technical training.
</P>
<P>
Some 120,000 rural households are expected to benefit from the
WFP assistance, she said.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Wan
Baorui thanked the WFP for its donations during the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
"China is carrying out its poverty-elimination programs and
governments of all levels have increased investment in the field
this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wan told Larsen that the Chinese government wants the
international organizations to continue their assistance to China.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, since 1979 WFP has joined 60
food assistance projects in China with a total value of 780
million U.S. dollars. WFP has been the largest donor for China
among all U.N. organizations.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Leung Devoted to Faithful Implementation of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Having sat in the office of the
first Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative region (SAR) for nearly one year, Elsie Leung
Oi-sie felt no regret for her devotion to the public service after
giving up her 30-odd-year legal profession.
</P>
<P>
"The year after the handover is a critical period, and somebody
must come forward to do this challenging and significant job,"
said Leung, who, a new face in the secretariat-rank officials, is
the first Chinese and also the first woman to head the legal
department in Hong Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the Secretary for
Justice said the top priority on her agenda is how to faithfully
implement the Basic Law within the framework of "one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
When the Basic Law came into effect on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong
for the first time had a detailed written constitution. At the
same time, almost all the 600 ordinances that were in force before
the handover were adopted as laws of the SAR, except for 24 that
contravened the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted: "We need to go through an initial exploratory
phase for local laws to be aligned with the Basic Law, which
contains fundamental provisions rather than fine details."
</P>
<P>
She and her colleagues have enacted more than 50 pieces of
legislation since the handover, and some of them have given rise
to misconceptions, criticism and even court challenges.
</P>
<P>
"It is a healthy sign of a society established under the rule
of law," she said. "Individuals have the right to challenge laws
and procedures that they consider to be inconsistent with the
Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
"They are able to challenge the power of the government, and it
is up to the court to decide whether the government is right or
wrong," she observed.
</P>
<P>
Leung is confident that with accumulation of precedents and
wider public understanding of the Basic Law, Hong Kong will be
able to develop an authoritative body of jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
Adoption of law is hard and meticulous work Leung and her
department have undertaken and will continue. Colonial terminology
needs to be removed from Hong Kong laws. For instance, references
to the "Governor" are replaced by references to the "Chief
Executive", and the word "Crown" is replaced by the word "State".
</P>
<P>
Leung explained: "The adoption preserves the substance of the
law and reflects the resumption of sovereignty, and the new status
of the SAR."
</P>
<P>
She continued that the "one country, two systems" concept has
given Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and a unique status,
particularly in concluding international legal arrangements.
</P>
<P>
So far, the SAR has signed with foreign governments about 50
agreements on air services, investment protection and promotion,
the surrender of fugitive offenders, mutual legal assistance and
the transfer of sentenced persons. Negotiations on these subjects
are still going on with concerned foreign states.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary for Justice said that her duty is, through
enacting laws, to guarantee the social stability, protect the
public interests of the 6.5 million Hong Kong people, and ensure
the smooth operation of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
She pledged to safeguard the rule of law and an independent
judiciary, the cornerstone of Hong Kong's stability and success.
</P>
<P>
Leading the Department of Justice through the SAR's first year,
Leung said: "I believe that we are moving in the right direction.
We must look forward and stand firm."

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Discuss Science, Tech for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- African Ministers of Science
and Technology and private sector actors started here Thursday a
two-day dialog on importance of science and technology to African
development, particularly in the area of food security.
</P>
<P>
The two-day dialog is organized by the food security and
sustainable development division (FSSDD) of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), responsible for raising
awareness on the nexus issues -- population, environment and food
security.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show while Africa's population continues to rise,
food per capita is on a steady decline. Moreover, recurrent
drought and degradation of the environment have made it an
imperative for African countries to harness new technologies to
break the vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, K. Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of
the ECA, expressed the U.N. organization's support for
development of science and technology in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said ECA recently established a board-based network of
science and technology for African development and called for
active participation and partnership support as well as logical
and material backing from member states.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the ECA has already developed a number of
networks including one by FSSDD and another by the development
information services division.
</P>
<P>
The first one is a network of science and technology databases
for food security and sustainable development while the second is
the African information society initiative (AISI).
</P>
<P>
During the two-day dialog, the participants will understand
more of their perspective on the new thrust of ECA science and
technology program, raise their awareness on how global trends
and national policies affect technology development in the
private sector and exchange ideas between ministers and private
sector participants.
</P>
<P>
They will gain a perspective on the activities that the ECA
needs to undertake to address the concerns of member states, and
gain an insight into the ministers' perception on general science
and technology issues of importance to the continent.

<HEADLINE> Photo Show Opens in Macao to Commemorate Zhou Enlai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition opened here
Thursday to commemorate the centenary of the birth of China's late
Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which attracted large numbers of visitors in
Beijing and Hong Kong, displays more than 200 pictures and
daily-use articles once used by the late premier, who died in
January 1976.
</P>
<P>
In particular, there are several pictures showing Zhou being
with well-known compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Lee Shing Chun, director of the Macao Daily News, which
co-organized the exhibition, praised Zhou as an outstanding leader
of the Communist Party of China and of the People's Republic of
China as well as a main founder of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
He said Zhou is remembered by the people in Macao because he
had shown special concern for Macao residents. The late premier
had instructed Guangdong provincial leaders to build a reservoir
to supply drinking water to Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition will help us know more about him and China's
contemporary history," he said in a speech at the opening
ceremony. "It will also help increase people's confidence in the
policy of 'one country, two systems' and Macao's better future."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last until June 21.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange closed broadly higher Thursday as sentiments
were boosted by a stronger Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar
but gains were trimmed by profit taking in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said the stable Japanese yen helped the local
equities market to extend its gains while news that the Malaysian
government will spend an additional 7.031 billion ringgit (about
1.793 billion U.S. dollars) on key infrastructure projects to pull
the economy out of the current economic slowdown was seen as a
positive move.
</P>

points higher at 471.82, the all-share Emas Index added 3.95
points to reach 120.81, the Industrial Index rose 33.8 points to
920.8 and the Second Board index was up 1.15 points to 104.7.
</P>
<P>
Gainers overwhelmed losers 417 to 160 with 136 counters
unchanged, 207 not traded and 23 others suspended.

<P>
The day's turnover soared to 210.331 million shares valued at
470.541 million ringgit (about 119.124 million dollars) from
132.368 million shares worth 290.435 million ringgit (about 73.527
million dollars) on Wednesday.
</P>

Main board volume jumped to 201.78 million valued at 456.337

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Japanese, U.S. Intervention to Buy Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong said here today that China welcomes the move taken by
the Japanese and U.S. governments to intervene on the currency
markets to buy Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up," Dai said at the 4th annual meeting of the
Association of Development and Industrial Banks in Asia, which
opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The yen was quoted at 135.70-75 to the U.S. dollar in early
trading in Tokyo today after Japan intervened on the currency
markets to buy yen. The U.S. Federal Reserve also bought yen on
behalf of Tokyo, pushing the currency back from its heavy decline
during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dai reaffirmed that the Chinese yuan will not be devalued.
"It's unnecessary to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that some countries and regions in Asia are
experiencing a hard time in restructuring, and that the continued
depreciation of the value of Japanese yen would increase financial
instability.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the move that related countries and regions will
gather in Tokyo to study measures for further stabilizing the yen,
and we hope Japan, the United States and other countries will make
continuous efforts in this respect," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has taken a responsible attitude
toward the Asian currency crisis by maintaining a stable rate for
the Renminbi (RMB) and by giving fund support to the countries and
regions suffering from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The economic fundamentals of Asian countries and regions remain
solid, he stressed. Within three years the region should be able
to shake off the consequences of the crisis and embark on a new
round of prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dai assured participants at the meeting that China will remain
open to development and industrial banks in Asia, and Chinese
banks will increase credit to foreign-funded enterprises both in
RMB and in foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Free Moshood Abiola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has Urged the
Nigerian government to immediately release Moshood Abiola,
detained politician and believed winner of the annulled June 12,
1993 presidential election, so that Abiola can contest in fresh
elections under the transition program.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, was quoted by local media as saying this in a program on
the U.S. Public Broadcasting Corporation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have long called for his (Abiola) release and we still
think that's fundamental step along with every other prisoner in
opening up a very genuine and credible democratic process. We do
hope that he'll soon be released, and he and everybody who may
wish to compete in the upcoming election would be allowed to do
so," Rice said.
</P>
<P>
She continued: "We see positive early sign in the release of
nine political prisoners, including very prominent political
prisoners and we hope this will be followed by the release of all
political prisoners without conditions and steps must be taken to
make this transition real."
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the European Union (EU) urged the Nigerian
government to take steps to resolve the case of Abiola, in a
statement by the British High Commission in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current president of the EU, said, "The next
important step will be the resolution of the case of Chief
Abiola..."
</P>
<P>
The release of nine political detainees, including former head
of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, by the Nigerian government
Monday has been widely welcomed both in and outside Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Gidado Idris, the Secretary to the Government of the
Federation (SGF), Wednesday promised that all political prisoners
will be released, but in batches.
</P>
<P>
Moshood Abiola was widely believed to be the winner of the
1993 presidential election held under the transition to civil
rule program of the then military government of General Ibrahim
Babangida, but the election was annulled by Babangida before the
final results were out.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis caused by the annullment led to the
formation of an interim government headed by Chief Earnest
Shonekan. On November 17, 1993, General Sani Abacha took over the
power and began another transition program in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moshood Abiola was arrested and put into jail by Abacha on June 23,
1994, when he announced himself the president of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
After the sudden death of Abacha on June 8, Abiola's
supporters now demand that the new government led by General
Abdulsalam Abubakar abandon the transition program of Abacha and
give the power to Abiola.
</P>
<P>
The new government said it will continue with the transition
program.

ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Six Turkish F-16 fighters landed on
the Turkish Cypriot side in Cyprus on Thursday in retaliation for
Greece's landing of fighters at a air base in Cyprus, according to
the semi-official Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the F-16 jets belonging to the Turkish Air
Force arrived at the Gecitkale military air base on the Turkish
Cypriot side Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek F-16 fighters and a C-130 transport plane landed on
the air base in the western coastal town of Phaphos in Cyprus on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the landing of the Greek planes, Turkish
Foreign Ministry Tuesday issued a statement to protest against
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the utilization of the air base by
Greek planes is an extremely grave and provocative development,
directed at breaking security and stability on the island in the
region."
</P>

"As a guarantor state of Cyprus, we condemn the move and
emphasize that we will take all the necessary measures that this
situation may require," the statement added.

<P>
Turkish media reports said that it is the first time that Greek
planes have landed at the air base since its completion in
January.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000-50,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the
northern part of the island with the claimed aim of protecting the
security of the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in
1983 a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" there, recognized
only by Turkey.

NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A stranded foreign ship loaded
with 2,800 tons of fuel oil was towed by an Indian coast guard
ship to the harbor of Chennai in southern India Thursday morning,
official sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The ship, registered in Dubai, was found adrift since June 12.
It was operating between Singapore and Chennai, capital of Tamil
Nadu, when it started drifting.
</P>
<P>
The ship had reportedly developed engine troubles and
propulsion and power failure problems. It had also suffered a leak
and water had entered the engine room, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds and rough sea hampered the towing operation and it
took three days to bring the ship to Chennai harbor.

<HEADLINE> American Writer Regrets Showing of Her Movie in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Betty Mahmoody, the Iranian-American
author of "Not Without My Daughter," said on Thursday that it is
regrettable that the film based on her autobiography was shown on
French television during the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has protested the showing of the film by
the M6 private television channel of France on Monday, which
Teheran said was aimed at destabilizing the Iranian national
football team.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily "L'Est Republicain" from
her home in Michigan, Mahmoody said that all what she told in her
autobiography was "strictly true."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the French government is not over anything and
had not deliberately planned it," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Not Without My Daughter" tells about the experience of Betty
Mahmoody in 1984, when she went to Iran with her Iranian husband
but was denied the right to leave the country without her
husband's permission.
</P>
<P>
She finally fled Iran with her four-year-old daughter to
neighboring Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Strong German Exports in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's exports continued their
double-digit growth to reach 83.4 billion German marks (46.8
billion U.S. dollars) in April, up 13.7 percent over April 1997,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office expected that German exports could keep the strength
to hit a new high this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, German imports rose by 12.9 percent to 72 billion
marks (40.4 billion dollars), leaving trade surplus at 11.4
billion marks (6.4 billion dollars), compared with 9.6 billion
marks (5.4 billion dollars) a year before.
</P>
<P>
From January to April, German exports increased by 15.3 percent
to a record 318.2 billion marks (178.6 billion dollars), while
imports reached 276.1 billion marks (154.9 billion dollars), up
12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's trade surplus was 42.1 billion marks (23.6 billion
dollars) for the first four months, compared with 31.7 billion
marks (17.8 billion dollars) during the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The office reported that the country's four-month current
accounts -- the sum of visible trade, services and transfers --
showed a deficit of 3.9 billion marks (2.2 billion dollars)
despite a surplus of 2.4 billion marks (1.3 billion dollars)
registered in April.
</P>
<P>
But the four-month balance was improved considering the 7.3
billion marks (4.1 billion dollars) deficit during the same period
of 1997, according to the office.

<HEADLINE> Australian Oil Industry Profits Fall in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Net profit from Australia's oil
refining and marketing industry dived to just 81 million
Australian dollars (49 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, compared
with 358 million Australian dollars (218 million U.S. dollars) in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for 1998 are no better, a national survey
released in Melbourne Thursday found.
</P>
<P>
Included in the bottom line was a 79-million-U.S.-dollar stock
(working inventory) loss arising from fluctuations in the price of
crude oil over the 12 months, according to the Ernst &AMP; Young
Downstream Oil Industry Financial Survey.
</P>
<P>
The industry's employment declined further last year to 7,814
people, 29 percent lower than the 1993 tally of 10,972 workers.
Indirect employment in retail- and wholesale-related sectors also
suffered.
</P>
<P>
The survey blamed the profit decline on competitive market
conditions domestically and internationally, stock losses from
falling crude oil prices and the impact of new entrants and
imports in the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
Imports, mainly from Singapore and Thailand, were able to take
advantage of an international oversupply of gas, particularly in
the Asian region, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the profit fall came despite lower operating
costs and stronger sales in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered the big four Australian refiner/marketeer
companies of BP, Caltex, Mobil and Shell, which account for
between 90 and 95 percent of all fuel sold in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Petroleum Jim
Starkey described the industry's 1997 profit performance as a
disaster, adding that falling profits could eventually force one
of the big four players to exit the Australian arena.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Urges Milosevic to Keep Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Thursday called on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to hold
on to his promises made earlier this week to end the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait to see with great interest and not without
scepticism whether he holds on to his promises. If it just leads
to a delay, that is unacceptable," Kohl said in a government
statement made to parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor also praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin for
his efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Yeltsin and Milosevic in Moscow on
Tuesday, the Yugoslav leader offered to meet some Western demands,
including resuming political dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kohl noted that the European Union summit in Cardiff, Wales,
had again made concrete demands on Belgrade to cease military
action against civilians in Kosovo, to allow international
monitoring, to facilitate the return of refugees and to start a
dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Kohl also warned that Bonn would back a
military action if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"If these demands were not met immediately, we would have a
comprehensive catalogue of counter measures which also include a
military intervention," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Germany supported the British
initiative to seek a preceding approval by the U.N. Security
Council to this effect.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor also warned of a new immigration wave to
Germany in case of an escalation of the Kosovo conflict and called
on other European nations to share the possible burden.

SINGAPORE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
rebound on the Singapore market Thursday as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index (STII) rose by 25.71 points to close at
1,133.41, higher but off their peaks after a volatile session.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said buying was encouraged by the spectacular rally
seen in regional currencies after joint intervention by the United
States and Japan overnight.
</P>
<P>
They also partly attributed the gains to a large number of
funds that tried to cover short positions in the market. However
the advance was expected to be short-lived as the fundamentals
have not changed from those a week ago, they added.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume soared to 318.75 million units, valued
at 493.45 million Singapore dollars (about 299.06 million U.S.
dollars). Advances led declines by 248 to 81 while 258 other

DBS Land remained the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 25.03 million units. It was followed by
RHB Cap w99 which had 14.44 million shares traded. M Res was next

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Suggest Extension of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
have suggested the extension of the military government's
transition to civil rule program deadline from October 1 to a
date not exceeding June 1999, local media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the recommendations the parties made to the
new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar in their meeting in Abuja
Wednesday, which is the second of its kind since the death of
late leader General Sani Abacha last Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Alhaji Abdullahi Magaji, the National Chairman of
the National Centre Party of Nigeria (NCPN), who spoke to
reporters after the meeting, the parties suggested that the
time-frame for the conclusion of the transition program should be
between three months to one year.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this means that the parties would not be opposed to
any move that would amount to an extension of the October 1
hand-over date, the chairman said: "The whole thing we are saying
(is that) if they hand over in a situation where you don't have a
stable polity, it is as good as not doing anything because it
will collapse.
</P>
<P>
"What Nigerians want is to ensure that what the military is
handing over is something concrete, something that will stand the
test of time, not something that will collapse after a few
months. That's what we're after.
</P>
<P>
"We are more anxious than anybody to take over from the
military. But we want to take over something that is going to be
viable," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the parties also suggested the cancellation
of the results of the state and national assembly elections held
on December 6, 1997 and April 25 this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two moves were reportedly opposed by the United Nigeria
Congress Party (UNCP), which won both elections by an
overwhelming majority, but the party may have been forced to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
The parties also demanded the government stopping interfering
in political affairs and sacking officials accused of doing so.
</P>
<P>
They also recommended an overhaul of the National Electoral
Committee of Nigeria "in order to remove the bad eggs there to
ensure a free and fair election," Magaji said.
</P>
<P>
The parties, however, refused the suggestions by some sectors
of the society that they should be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
"If you dissolve the parties, it will take you more time...you
will have to dissolve all the structures on the ground... which
will entail a longer period of stay for the military," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has promised to study the parties'
proposals critically before making decisions on the transition
program, reports said.

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Spain can afford no more defeat
when they meet Paraguay in their second group match here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 loss at the hands of Super Eagles Nigeria has been a major
blow to the Spaniards, who are second in the FIFA rankings behind
Brazil and have been regarded by many as one of the favorites of the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Spanish media has piled blames on coach Javier Clemente and
goal-keeper Andoni Zubizarreta after the shock defeat.
</P>
<P>
Clemente was slammed for fielding a team without a real striker
while Zubizarreta was blamed for letting in three goals in just one
match.
</P>
<P>
Clemente will have to make changes to his starting line-up but
he insisted that Zubzarreta would contiune in goal.
</P>
<P>
"We were jolted by the defeat but we've had a few days to
collect ourselves," said Clemente, "We didn't play so badly really
and if we win our two remaining matches we are through."
</P>
<P>
Paraguay, who forced Bulgaria to a 0-0 draw, will be in full
strength as tough defender Francisco Arce and striker Miguel Angel
Benitez have recovered from injuries they sustained in the first
match.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's Brazilian coach Paulo Cesar Carpegiani pinpointed
Arce as their key man in the match against the Spaniards,"Arce is
fundamental to our plan as he breaks things up and holds the line
superbly." said Carpegiani.
</P>
<P>
But the Paraguay goal-keeper Jose Luis Chilavert, a penalty and
free-kick expert, would as usual took the limelight of the match.

<HEADLINE> China Pursues Dialogue on Human Rights Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China believes that divergence on
the human rights issue can be resolved through dialogue instead of
confrontation, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that new China has placed great importance on human
rights since its founding in 1949, especially in the reform and
opening-up drive launched in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has made great efforts to improve the human
rights of its people.
</P>
<P>
China also recognizes the universality of human rights, Zhu
said. "However, different countries, with different conditions,
can take their own ways to achieve the same goal of human rights,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that China and the United States, two nations
with different political systems, ideologies and at different
economic development levels, hold different views on this matter,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that divergence on human rights can be resolved on the
basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On a recent report delivered by the Amnesty International on
the human rights conditions in China, Zhu said that the view held
by the Amnesty International on China has always been
"biased". "We will never accept any form of interference from
anybody in China's internal affairs," Zhu stated.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher Thursday as the United States came to the rescue of the
laboring Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar received a bounce of 2 U.S. cents after
the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan joined hands in
lifting the yen in overnight trade.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed at 61.21 U.S. cents, from 59.24 U.S. cents
in Sydney late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said the yen would quickly deflate again
unless Wednesday night's foreign exchange intervention was
followed by some positive policies by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The market is eagerly awaiting a meeting soon to take place
between U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Japanese
finance officials and other deputy finance ministers of the G-7
nations.
</P>
<P>
"People are looking to take profits and if we don't see
anything concrete from Japan we will start to see more selling of
the yen again," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
That would in turn be expected to flow through to the
Australian dollar and the fall of the local currency to an
all-time low of 57.1 U.S. cents was not out of the question, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The currency earlier this week touched a new 12-year low of 58
U.S. cents but stopped short of testing that level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the cross rates, the Australian dollar was also
buying 83.77 Japanese yen from 84.9 yen at Wednesday's close and
at 1.0936 German marks from 1.0642 marks.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Bulgaria to Play Crucial Match at Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Super Eagles Nigeria and last World
Cup semi-finalists Bulgaria will play a crucial group match at Parc
des Princes Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
To the Nigerians, they will be fresh in their minds with the
memorable 3-2 victory over Spain as they prepare for the clash with
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
As to the Bulgarians, the Paris stadium holds great memories for
striker Emil Kostadinov who scored a last-gasp winner to shatter
France's qualifying hopes for the World Cup finals in the United
States four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"That memory will be with me all my life," said Kostadinov, "I
hope that Friday brings me and Bulgaria even more happiness."
</P>
<P>
The two teams are familiar with each other as four years ago at
Dallas, Nigeria trounced Bulgaria 3-0 in the group stage with Daniel
Amokachi netting twice.
</P>
<P>
Amokachi is expected to get a berth in the starting line-up as
he has recovered from an injured knee which ruled him out of the
Nigeria-Spain match.
</P>
<P>
Another Nigerian star Nwanko Kanu, who plays for Italian club
Inter Milan, is also available following a stomach complaint.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will be without midfielder Anatoli Nankov who got the
first red card of this World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev warned his team:"To beat the
Nigerians, we have to be very disciplined, very concentrated and
every player has to be at their best."

<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government examined on Wednesday a draft law which
will constitutionalize a parity system in participation in
government between men and women. The Socialist group at the
National Assembly has also deposed a motion which aims to adopt the
parity system in the next regional elections in 2003.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced on Wednesday that they would act in
concert to stop the collapse of the Japanese yen, which was
threatening to trigger a new round of financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Federal Reserve Board decided on Wednesday to save
the Japanese yen by selling the dollar. This is the first time since
1992 when Washington intervened in the exchange market to support
the Japanese authorities. This decision marked a sudden turn of the
U.S. government, which was warried about the recession in Japan and
its consequences on the already weakened Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
-- A poll conducted in April among 12,000 people of 12 European
Union countries which will join the monetary union showed that
Germans are the most rebellious against the single currency euro,
while the Italians are the most ardent support of it. Women are
more sceptical about the single currency than men, said the poll.

<HEADLINE> China's Role Constructive in Asian Financial Turmoil, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China has played a constructive
role in curbing the financial turmoil sweeping the Asian continent.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made
the remark at the regular press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"China faced risks and paid a price in the crisis," he said,
adding that it has been widely acknowledged that China has
contributed its due efforts to stabilizing the Asian financial
situation. "The Chinese government has committed itself not to
devalue the renminbi yuan and has provided 4 billion U.S. dollars
in assistance to other Asian nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the resurge of the Japanese yen on the international
monetary market, Zhu said that the policy adopted by some
countries could be considered as one of the main factors behind
the rebound.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto recently held talks and reached
consensus on curbing the further slide of yen. The yen was quoted
at 135.75 to one U.S. dollar in early trading in Tokyo today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu welcomed the move which he described as "necessary."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that "the negative impact of devalued yen on the
Chinese economy is obvious for it imposed new pressure over China
and other economies in the Asian continent."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the countries concerned practically fulfill their
obligations and responsibilities and properly handle their
difficulties and problems so as to make their due contributions to
the economic stability and growth in Asia," he stated.

PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A top English Premiership referee
critized his counterparts at the World Cup finals, saying they

</P>
<P>
David Elleray, one of the best referee in the Premiership
League, said:"The sad fact is that the first week (of the World Cup
finals) has been notable for increasingly weak officiating that has
failed to protect the skilful players and promote attacking play."
</P>
<P>
"Since the Italy-Chile match, the overall standard of refereeing
has gone steadily down," said Elleray.
</P>
<P>
Elleray said:"Many outrageous tackles and offences that should
have had yellow cards have gone unpunished."
</P>

FIFA president Sepp Blatter and French Organising Committee
President Michael Platini had already critized the refereeing of the

<P>
XI'AN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
is engaged in extensive efforts to strengthen a series of key
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The list of projects includes harnessing the loess plateau,
constructing the state-level Yangling High-Tech Agriculture Zone,
and completing the Xi'an-Ankang, Shenmu-Yan'an and Xi'an-Nanjing
railways.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianguo, secretary of the Shaanxi Committee of the Communist

<HEADLINE>   U.S. Company Begins Human Tests of Cervical Cancer Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An American company has begun
the first human test of a possible vaccine against cervical
cancer, Merck &AMP; Co.'s chief scientist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Merck &AMP; Co. has begun phase one testing of the vaccine, made of
"virus-like particles" (VLP), in women following successful
experiments in animals, said Dr. Katherin Jansen, Merck's chief
scientist.
</P>
<P>
The aim of phase one is testing the vaccine's safety in women,
she said, adding that the goal of phase two, scheduled by the end
of the year, is to see if the vaccine can produce immune cells
that kill the virus.
</P>
<P>
Merck's goal is to vaccinate girls around age 10, before they
have sexual contact that puts them at risk of catching human
papilloma virus (HPV), she added.
</P>
<P>
Merck's genetically engineered VLP can induce the immune system
to produce potent antibodies, immune cells that target and kill
the virus, Jansen explained.
</P>
<P>
Up to 40 million Americans are infected with one of 80 strains
of HPV, the nation's most common sexually transmitted virus, and
untold millions people in the world also are infected. Scientists
found that the virus is harmless to the vast majority, but a few
dangerous strains of virus can possibly cause cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
Every year, half a million women worldwide get cervical
cancer. That includes almost 16,000 Americans, 5,000 of whom have
died, according to statistics released by the American Cancer
Society.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Can Use Air Base in N. Cyprus: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has the right to use the
air base in northern Cyprus if it wants to do so, a senior
official with the Turkish Cypriot authorities has said.
</P>
<P>
Some necessary steps should be taken (by Turkey) as a response
to the latest military movements of the Greek warplanes in the
Greek Cypriots-controlled south, Turkish Daily News quoted Dervis
Eroglu, "prime minister" of the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" self-declared in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots, as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot authorities "will allow the Turkish Air
Force's use of the Gecitkale Airport as a military base if Turkey
makes such a request," said Eroglu.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek F-16 fighters and two C-130 transport planes landed
at the newly completed air base near the western town of Paphos on
the divided island on Monday and Tuesday, prompting strong
protests from Ankara and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"Reciprocal steps should be taken, and will be taken," Eroglu
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkish Cypriots were ready to solve the
differences with Greek Cypriots through negotiations, but at the
same time were determined to face all unexpected changes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the small island
following a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is recognized only
by Turkey.

the museum in 1981 and 1985 respectively. Nixon compared the
awesomeness of terra cotta figurines to the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagon became the first incumbent U.S. president to
visit the museum in April, 1984. Reagon was accompanied to the
museum by an entourage of over 600 staffers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
He exhibited great curiousity and requested permission to touch
a figurine. Reagon stroked the tail of a nearby horse and suddenly
withdrew to humorously question whether or not the "horse" would
kick.
</P>
<P>
He approached a headless terra cotta warrior and jokingly
suggested his head would look good on the figurine. Reagon
approached closer on to find that the figurine was much taller.
</P>
<P>
Just prior to leaving, Reagon turned to the "warriors" and
barked the command -- "Dismiss!"
</P>
<P>
The "warriors and horses" became the rage of the western world
as a result of Reagon's humorous improvizations, and the number of
tourists visiting the attractions has since grown by 20-30 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
The museum has also displayed the "warriors and horses" in 20
countries, attracting well over 10 million people.

<HEADLINE> Terra Cotta Warriors Attract 100 Heads of State (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 million people from both at
home and abroad have viewed the terra cotta warriors and horses,
the "underground army" of China's first emperor, since the
attraction opened to the public in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The visitors have included more than 100 heads of state and
government, according to the figures released by the Museum of
Terra Cotta Warriors and Houses, located 37 kilometers east of
Xi'an. The museum houses over 7,000 life-sized terra cotta
warriors and horses unearthed since 1974, along with tens of
thousands of pieces of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the museum ranks second after Beijing's
Palace Museum, or the Forbidden City, in terms of the number of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Known as the eighth miracle in the world, the terra cotta
warriors and horses were made over 2,200 years ago during the Qin
Dynasty (221 BC -- 207 BC). The purpose of lifelike "soldiers and
horses", located less than a mile from the emperor's tomb, was to
maintain and protect the living glory for time immemorial.
</P>
<P>
Qin Shihuang was the first man to unite China. He founded
the Qin Dynasty and assumed the name "Shihuang", a Chinese word
meaning first emperor.
</P>
<P>
The "most splendid archeological finding" in this century was,
in fact, accidentally discovered in 1974 by a local farmer while
he was digging a well.
</P>
<P>
The museum housing the terra cotta treasures opened to the
public on October 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The world first learned of the terra cotta warriors and horses
from an unprecedented 17-page story carried in the April 1978
issue of National Geographic. During a September visit that
year, Paris Mayor and future French President Jacques Chirac
referred to them as "the eighth miracle in the world" equal
to Egyptian pyramids.

<HEADLINE> First Automobile Works Develops New Natural Gas Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's First Automobile Works
(FAW) recently introduced a new series of natural gas engine
components for urban shuttle buses and heavy-duty vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The new CA6102N engine components, the first of their kind in
China, will greatly improve power generation systems on refitted
buses, with the motive power index basically reaching levels for
gasoline-fired vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Refitted buses fueled with natural gas, or so-called "Green
vehicles" which have not as yet been refitted with replacement of
engines, operate with 20 percent power reductions when compared to
gasoline-fired vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Retrofitting automobiles with natural gas engine components is
a major part of China's efforts to curb urban pollution. China had
4,600 vehicles equipped for natural gas by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
FAW initiated research of the engine components in 1992 and
their introduction is expected to significantly reduce production
costs and emission levels.
</P>
<P>
Company officials noted that the engine components can also be
adapted to LPG and gasoline-fired vehicles.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Flourishing Campus Industries to Support Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The lack of educational funding
has forced China's one million middle and primary schools to
develop campus industries as a self-supply channel.
</P>
<P>
So far, 738,000 school enterprises have been established
nationwide. Their output reached 120 billion yuan (14.5 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, with most of the profits used to make up
insufficient educational funding, the Ministry of Education
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The investment problem has long been hindering the development
of China's educational sector, according to the ministry. The
central government's educational allocation was 160 billion yuan
(19.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, accounting for less than 3
percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Middle and primary schools, which have 200 million students and
the main part of China's educational system, are faced with
extremely great challenges, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many schools have to seek various ways to raise funds. In some
middle and primary schools, half of their funding is collected by
running factories and carrying out other social activities.
</P>
<P>
Campus enterprises have been engaged in a wide range of
industries such as computers, machinery, food, drink, clothing and
entertainment, and some of the firms are foreign-invested joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Most of the enterprises are small- or medium-sized, but there
have already been 29 big companies able to make profits of more
than 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that children are not allowed to work
in campus enterprises, and the firms' operations have not
disrupted classroom activities.

<HEADLINE> Key to China's Summer Grain Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China is looking forward to another
good summer grain harvest, and the plastic sheeting technique has
played a role.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, Shandong and Henan provinces, for example, expect to
reap 1.5 billion kilograms of wheat on 330,000 hectares of
farmland, using the technique.
</P>
<P>
By using the new cultivation technique, farmers can reap 1,500
kilograms of wheat per hectare more than otherwise.
</P>
<P>
China imported the method in the 1970s and has expanded its
application to growing vegetables, corn, rice and other crops. In
1994, the country began to use it on wheat fields with good
results.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture increased efforts to
spread the use of the technique. As a result, the acreage rose
sharply to nearly 600,000 hectares this year involving 14
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The new practice also brings 1,500 yuan more per hectare to
growers, and has proven especially effective in fighting drought
in north China, agronomists said.
</P>
<P>
The farmland that is good for this wheat cultivation method in
north China totals 10 million hectares. And if the technique is
applied on 1.33 million hectares of wheat by the end of the
century, it could add two billion kilograms to the nation's wheat
production, said Shi Zhicheng, deputy president of the Chinese
Association of Agro-Science Societies.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fixed Asset Investments Fall 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Fixed asset investments for
Shanghai, China's major economic and financial center, fell by
nearly 10 percent for the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the city's fixed asset investments
totaled 39.26 billion yuan for the January-May period, down 9.8
percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
A further breakdown shows that investments in technical
renovation projects dropped nearly 30 percent to 7.06 billion yuan
during the period, with investments in basic construction falling
4.8 percent to 18.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the significant slowdown for investments in
technical renovation to sluggish demand and sales, as well as the
poor performance of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate the number of loss-making state-owned
enterprises in Shanghai jumped from 630 to 804 during the
January-April period.
</P>
<P>
However, negative growth trend for investments in urban
infrastructure reversed during the first five months, with the
total volume rising by 3.4 percent to 9.84 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
industrial investments rose slightly to 13.56 billion
yuan and investments in real estate fell by 6.1 percent to

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Rises Sharply in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus in
May surged by 66.6 percent from a year earlier to 1,219.3 billion
yen (about 9.3 billion U.S. dollars), thanks mainly to a sharp
import decline, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's imports in May fell by 16.3 percent from a year before,
the largest since February 1987, when imports posted a 28.3
percent monthly decline, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports in May edged down by 1.5 percent from the
previous year to 4,041.9 billion yen (about 30.6 billion dollars)
for the second straight month of decline, while imports came to
2,822.6 billion yen (about 21.3 billion dollars), down for the
fifth consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with the United States surged by 41.0 percent
from a year earlier to 455.4 billion yen (about 3.4 billion
dollars), up for the 20th consecutive month, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with Asian countries fell by 28.3 percent,
while that with the European Union jumped by 94.2 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The average foreign exchange rate used for the May report was
132.29 yen to the U.S. dollar, compared with 124.09 yen a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
On the future trend, an economist at a private financial
institution said Japan's trade surplus would continue to grow at
least for one year, as the yen has much depreciated against the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Attracts Investment to Reclaim Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
the Northwest, possessing 10 million hectares of arable wasteland
which accounts for one-third of China's total, has become a magnet
for investors in the reclamation of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
An official of the autonomous region said that, in addition to
a large investment by the central government in the past decade,
about 3 billion yuan (361 million US dollars) has been drawn for
reclaiming wasteland in Xinjiang, which resulted in an increase of
600,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the regional land administration department in
Xinjiang shows that there are 12 investment forms in reclaiming
land. Among them are developing the state-owned cotton base,
comprehensive agriculture, and agriculture cooperation among
interior provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that since the contracts on forming cotton
and beet bases were signed in 1988, China has put in 2.47 billion
yuan (297.6 million US dollars) to reclaim 300,000 hectares of
wasteland in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 on, 18 provinces and cities, as well as Hong Kong,
have signed agreements for 128 projects to reclaim wasteland in
Xinjiang for 1.97 billion yuan (237 US dollars) involving 120,000
hectares of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that more than 10,000 peasant-farmer
families in the autonomous region each possessed more than 10
hectares of arable land through reclaiming wasteland at a cost of
more than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Through 1997, there had been 105 non-agriculture companies
involved in reclaiming arable wasteland in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
A autonomous region official underlined that high return rates
are the main reason for attracting investors. Xinjiang was given a
series of preferential policies by the central government, as well
as being listed as the state's largest cotton production center.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, 560,000 hectares of wasteland in Xinjiang
has been reclaimed, local officials said. Further efforts will
also be taken for environmental protection during the activities
to reclaim wasteland in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> 17 Kenyans Die, 40 Hurt in Road Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people were killed and
at least 40 others injured when two buses crashed head on in
central-western Kenya, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among them fifteen died instantly on the scene, including the
two bus drivers, according to the report by the Daily Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The survivals narrowly escaped death soon afterwards when a
runaway tanker slammed into a breakdown lorry called to the
scene, sending it careering into one of the wrecked buses.
</P>
<P>
It also hit a police Land Rover into which bodies from the
original accident had been loaded for the journey to the
mortuary.
</P>
<P>
The buses collided after one of them swerved into the path of
the other while trying to avoid a lorry which had broken down in
the middle of the road. Police said the driver of the stalled
lorry had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The force of the collision sent one of the buses flying off
the road and through a muddy ditch before it finally stopped.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on a hilly section of the Nakuru to
Eldoret highway, 48 kilometers from the Nakuru town, which is
Kenya's fifth biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Although the crash was on Tuesday night, three passengers were
still trapped in the buses the following morning on Wednesday.
And it took the police about 14 hours to remove the bodies.
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Provincial Traffic Enforcement Officer Duke Okemwa
said it is the worst road accident in the area in recent years.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States should
first sign an agreement on no-first-use of nuclear weapons ahead
of detargeting missiles to each other, said Zhu Bangzao, spokesman
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in response to a question on whether China
will sign an agreement with the United States on missile
detargeting during President Bill Clinton's coming China visit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the purpose for China to develop nuclear weapons
is for self-defence, adding that China from the first day of
owning nuclear weapons has undertaken not to use such weapons
first.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is more important for China and the United
States to first sign the no-first-use pact," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Insulin 'Sniffing' Breakthrough in Treating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Insulin-dependent diabetics will
enjoy a "revolution" in treatment in two years, when insulin in
powdered form becomes available for "sniffing" via the mouth into
the lungs instead of most injections, the Jerusalem Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Itamar Raz, head of the Israel Diabetes Association, Wednesday
confirmed foreign reports on the technique's efficacy. The new
method will be a boon to those diabetics who are dependent on
insulin, some of them injecting themselves regularly, he was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are also many diabetics who avoid insulin injections
because they're afraid of them. The inhaled-insulin approach will
be very convenient," he said, "and it's been shown to be as
effective as injections."
</P>
<P>
Success of the first clinical trials using inhaled powdered
insulin was disclosed at a meeting of the American Diabetes
Association in Chicago this week. Dr. William Cefalu of the
University of Vermont, who led one of the studies, said that
"these studies present the first evidence that there are true
alternative ways to administer insulin."
</P>
<P>
The technique, in which the life-saving hormone is sucked
through the mouth into the lungs and rapidly absorbed into the
bloodstream to control blood sugar levels, was called a
"breakthrough" by diabetes experts. Developed by Inhaled
Therapeutic Systems of San Carlos, California, the United States,
it has been shown no harm to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
The final phase of the trials on 1,000 patients will begin in
the United States this fall, and the product can be on the market
in two years, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Insulin can not be swallowed because it is destroyed by acids
in the digestive system. Sniffing through the nose causes dosing
problems, irritation in the nasal passages and erratic absorption
of the hormone -- especially if the patient has a cold.
</P>
<P>
But the new system, using a small device that allows the user
to suck the controlled-release fine powder through the mouth into
the lungs, just requires normal breathing. Besides avoiding
needles, the powder can be kept anywhere, unlike injectable
insulin, which has to be refrigerated.

<HEADLINE> China to Loosen Controls on Infrastructure Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior banking official said
here today that, with the progress of China's market-oriented
economic reforms, the financing of infrastructure and basic
industries will be increasingly diversified.
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhongmin, vice-governor of the State Development Bank (SDB)
of China, told the 4th annual meeting of the Association of
Development and Industrial Banks in Asia that the Chinese
government will further relax its monopoly and control over
investment in infrastructure and basic industries, which will draw
more social funds into financing activities.
</P>
<P>
Government financial fund investment and policy bank credit
financing will continue to play important roles, Yao said, and the
proportion of project direct financing will be further increased.
</P>
<P>
Yao said that presently the proportion of direct financing in
the entire infrastructure and basic industries is low.
</P>
<P>
"Some production enterprises in infrastructure and basic
industries with high economic returns can raise capital through
joint-stock company restructuring and issuance of shares, or raise
funds through issuing enterprise bonds and conducting project
financing abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming industrial investment fund will become a low-cost
fund-raising tool for China's infrastructure and basic industries,
he said, and foreign capital utilization will be further
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The SDB is mainly involved in fixed-asset lending activities
and guaranteeing funding for key state construction projects. The
SDB plays an important role in promoting China's infrastructure
and basic industrial development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the SDB was established in 1994 it
has raised 360 billion yuan for 643 key construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced its plan of investing 1
trillion U.S. dollars in the coming three years in infrastructure
and basic industries, indicating that the country's infrastructure
and basic industries will have a fairly rapid development period.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Economists: Moderate Growth for U.S. in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street economists believe
that the U.S. economy will grow at a moderate and smooth pace in
1999, a survey conducted by Bank of America said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-year assessment of the U.S. economy in 1999, the
consensus view of 18 Wall Street economists is that gross domestic
product will down-shift to a modest, sustainable growth rate of
2.5 percent next year from a projected growth rate of 3.4 percent
in 1998, the San Francisco-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
The panel also believes that inflation will pick up somewhat to
a rate of 2.3 percent in 1999 from 1.6 percent this year. The
growth rate of consumer disposable income will fall to 2.8 percent
next year from 3.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Individual estimates of real economic growth in the United
States in 1999 vary widely, said the bank, with forecasts ranging
from a low of 1.7 percent to a high of 3.5 percent. Opinions about
the impact of the Asian economic crisis on the U.S. economy and
the likelihood of continued strength in consumer spending in the
country also vary substantially among the economists.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the bank said, there seem to be two camps forming
among the panel. One is a pro-growth group believing that the
economy will pick up considerable speed in the coming months,
which would force the Federal Reserve to move rates upward to
brake the growth and keep inflation in check. The other camp of
economists thinks that the economy still has plenty of resiliency,
but is expected slow in 1999 to a sustainable pace in the 2
percent to 2.5 percent range, with an inflation rate of about 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the panel, there is a 33 percent probability that
the U.S. economy will be growing moderately one year from now. The
probability that the economy will be slowing down by next June is
likely at about 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel believes there is only a 19 percent
probability that the U.S. economy will be booming a year out. The
chances of a stagnating economy accompanied by rising inflation by
next June have been assigned to a 16 percent probability.

HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) has so far provided some
230,000 conventional telephone lines countrywide, Information,
Posts and Telecommunications Minister Chem Chimutengwende has
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Zimbabwe News Agency Wednesday that the
government was working to ensure that it increased telephones to
a stage where services could be supplied on demand.
</P>
<P>
"There is a current PTC program which will ensure another
250,000 lines by the year 2002 but that will still not fully
satisfy projected demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government was still looking for a
strategic partner for PTC to help in the partial privatisation
process.
</P>

"People have misunderstood and think we have already found a

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: World's Longest Ancient City Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's longest extant ancient
city wall is located in the northwest China city of Xi'an, which
was the world's largest metropolis some 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The wall, which stretches 13.7 kilometers, has attracted over
eight million tourists since 1984, with a long list of foreign
dignitaries including the Japanese Emperor. Xi'an, the seat of
Shaanxi Provincial government, is the major economic and cultural
center in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The city wall, which enclosed the ancient capital city, is now
at the center of the ever-expanding metropolitan area. Tourists
strolling along the massive wall 12 meters high and 14 meters wide,
have an unobstructed view of the so-called "city inside a city,"
as well as many scenic sites found outside.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has won praise for its extensive
efforts to maintain and protect the ancient wall. The
vice-president of an American Urban Planning Society noted that
the strategic step centers on bringing new life to the ancient
legacy by ensuring its protection and constructive use.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization experts designated the wall as a World Cultural
Heritage in 1994.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here for Spain early Thursday on his first visit to
a member state of the European Union (EU) following the EU's
decision to resume ministerial contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio said that Kharrazi would hold talks with his
Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes on bilateral ties and future
dialog between Iran and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-EU relations soured after a Berlin court ruled in
April 1997 that Iranian leadership was behind a 1992 killing of
the country's rebel Kurdish leaders.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Iran and the 15-member organization were
normalized last November when EU members' ambassadors returned to
Tehran. The EU also decided to resume exchange of ministerial
visits and "critical dialog" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
With the diplomatic warming-up, EU politicians, industrialists
and businessmen are rushing to Iran in recent months to seek ways
of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Vice President of the Spanish Congress of
Deputies Enrique Fernadez Miranda visited Iran and held talk with
Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and Vice
President Masoumeh Ebtekar.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Miranda voiced Spain's readiness to
cooperate with Iran in carrying out research in environmental
protection and ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade volume between Iran and Spain stands at
1.6 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Central Bank Stops Further Lending to Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has stopped any further lending to the government which is said
to have reached the maximum borrowing ceiling.
</P>
<P>
"From now on there is no borrowing by the government from the
bank because we have given out the maximum of seven billion
Shillings (about 1.16 billion U.S. Dollars) allowable under the
Banking Act," CBK Chief Banking Manager Reuben Marambii said.
</P>
<P>
Legally, the maximum borrowing from CBK by the Kenyan
government is pegged at five percent of the annual gross revenue
collected, which it has already taken up, Marambii was quoted by
Thursday's East African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The five percent limitation was revised downward from the
original six percent during the 1998/99 budget by Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae who introduced far-reaching changes in
the Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
The CBK action means the government will now not have access
to quick cash whenever urgent need arises, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The only options available to the government to raise cash is
to increase the sale of Treasury Bills and Bonds, raise tax or
make drastic cuts in expenditure, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the Treasury Bills option appears costly, especially
for the short-term maturing ones.
</P>
<P>
Already, as articulated in the 1998/99 budget, the government
intends to phase out the Treasury Bonds having accumulated a
domestic debt of over 150 billion Shillings (about 2.5 billion
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government now is finding this debt difficult to service
as it attracts interest of over 25 percent, the report commented.
</P>
<P>
On the fears that the parliament might at the behest of the
government change the new banking rules to allow it to borrow
more, Marambii said that would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
"It is however, up to members of parliament to genuinely prove
they want to see a recovery in this economy by not engaging in
activities that encourage financial indiscipline," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Export Processing Zones Get Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Companies operating in Zimbabwe's
export processing zones have created more than 6,000 new jobs and
generated over 27 million U.S. Dollars in export earnings since
the concept was introduced 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
At least 38 companies investing 27 million U.S. Dollars are
fully operational while a further 36 are still to implement their
projects, The Herald daily reported Thursday, adding that all the
approved projects are valued at 270 million U.S. Dollars, but a
more welcoming climate could speed investment significantly.
</P>
<P>
Elias Ngugama, chairman of the export processing zones
authority, told the newspaper Wednesday that his organization had
so far received more than 150 applications and was processing an
average of two projects every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the projects' take-off. The program has
made a dramatic contribution to the creation of employment and in
value-adding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The export zone companies produce mainly for export. They are
allowed to sell a maximum of 20 percent of their production to
the domestic market while the balance is targeted for the export
market.
</P>
<P>
The concept was introduced in Zimbabwe 18 months ago to
spear-head the country's export drive and subsequently promote
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ngugama said the current economic problems were stifling
investment into the zones.
</P>
<P>
"The high interest rates are discouraging investment. The
investors prefer the money markets where they get good returns,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Mayors Still to be Elected Indirectly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's mayors will still be
elected indirectly in the forthcoming local government elections
contrary to an announcement made last year, according to Zambia
Daily Mail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper published here quoted Election Commission
Chairman Judge Bobby Bwalya as saying here Wednesday that the
Local Government Amendment Act passed through parliament recently
does not provide for the direct election of the mayors by all the
electorate of a city.
</P>
<P>
He said if the practice has to be implemented, the law will
have to be changed before the local government polls take place.
</P>
<P>
Currently the mayor is elected from an electoral college made
up of councillors elected in the local government polls.
</P>
<P>
"The mayor, deputy mayor, chairman or vice chairman of a
council shall be elected annually at the first meeting of
September in that year," the act stipulates.
</P>
<P>
Judge Bwalya said the Electoral Commission has not received
any instruction to prepare for a mayoral poll.
</P>
<P>
Last year President Frederick Chiluba announced that the
government would introduce a system in which mayors would be
directly elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the move was aimed at making the local
government system more accountable to the people.

<HEADLINE> New Animal Species Discovered in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 new wild animal
species have been discovered in the Three Gorges Area in recent
years, according to a survey by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
The list includes 12 mammal species, 21 bird species, six
species of reptiles and five species of amphibians.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 survey lists more than 360 species of land vertebrates
in the Three Gorges Area, including 81 mammal species, 236 bird
species, 23 reptile species and 27 species of amphibians.
</P>
<P>
Four species in the area are under special state protection --
golden monkeys, the clouded leopards, the spotted leopards
and the golden eagles. Other protected species discovered during
the survey included rhesus monkeys and pangolins.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that the golden monkey mainly lives at the
juncture of Badong County in central China's Hubei Province and
the Shennongjia Forest Area. Experts estimate that some 200 golden
monkeys live in the area.
</P>
<P>
SEPA said the animals will be affected somewhat by the new
reservoir on the Yangtze River. but noted that human activities
pose the major threat to wild animal diversity in the Three Gorges
Area.
</P>
<P>
"Human activities such as lumbering and hunting will affect
biodiversity more than the reservoir," according to the
administration.

<HEADLINE> China Recruits Poverty-Relief Volunteers Among Urban Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's urban young people were
called on today to give up their comfortable lives and high
incomes to spend some time in poverty-stricken areas to assist
local educational, scientific, cultural and medical development.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, carried a huge
advertisement Wednesday, recruiting college-educated volunteers
between 18 and 35 in large and medium cities to go to impoverished
areas for one or two years.
</P>
<P>
The ad said young people could benefit a lot from hard work in
the poverty-stricken areas and could learn how to be steadfast in
the future.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, large numbers of Chinese urban youth
were urged to go to the countryside to engage in physical labor
and receive "re-education" from the farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, the young volunteers with new concepts and good
education from large cities today can offer urban culture, new
thoughts and hope for prosperity to the poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Youth League of China, the initiator of the
poverty-relief plan, promised that they would pay the cost of
living for volunteers who have no income and offer health care and
life insurance during their service period.
</P>
<P>
The Youth League, with a membership of nearly 70 million,
started a project in 1993 calling on young volunteers to provide
various services for society. More than 40,000 young people have
participated in the project since then.
</P>
<P>
Different from part-time volunteers, those participating in the
poverty-relief plan will give up their jobs and change their way
of life for one or two years, said an official of the Youth League.
</P>
<P>
He added that the pattern of open recruitment and rotating at
regular intervals is in line with international practice.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Claims to Have Most Stable Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO. June 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique claims to have the most
stable currency in the last ten years during which the country
has been embarking on a market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Mozambique, the central bank, the
country's currency Metical has remained on a 11543 to 11733 to
one U.S. Dollar level from January to the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The currency devalued about 2.2 percent in 1997 from the 5.3
percent level in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate and that on the free market have
been almost the same with a difference of only about 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique began using its own currency in 1980 after it won
its independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The new currency Metical, though used along with the Portugal
issued Escudo, saw a dramatic devaluation from 450 to one Dollar
in 1988 to 8252 to one Dollar in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The latest stability of the currency is said to be a result
of the low inflation rate which has been kept at 0.5 percent
from January to May this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate was 5.8 percent in 1997 and 16.3
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Technological Cooperation Cements Sino-U.S. Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Scientific and technological
cooperation has been acknowledged as one of the three pillars of
Sino-U.S. relations, along with cooperation in the commercial and
economic fields, according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Commenting during a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, Zhu
Lilan, minister of Science and Technology, said the scientific and
technological cooperation program between China and the United
States has developed into one of the world's leading
intergovernmental programs thanks to "steady, far-reaching and
durable bilateral exchange mechanisms" established over the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics reveal that the two nations have dual-track
exchanges and carried out several thousand research
projects involving thousands of scientists since the first
Sino-U.S. Intergovernment Science and Technology Cooperation
Agreement was signed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement has since served as the guiding document for
related activities and the new five-year tenure agreement ensures
bilateral cooperation well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government departments from the two nations have
signed memoranda of understanding or protocols covering 32
areas, including agriculture, space, scientific information
exchange, environmental protection, seismology and high-energy
physics.
</P>
<P>
Zhu received her ministerial appointment last March during the
First Plenary Session of the the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
She also serves as the co-chairwoman of the Joint Sino-U.S. Science
and Technology Cooperation Committee. "The committee consists of
12 members from each country, including four to five officials at
the vice-ministerial level. We hold alternating biannual meetings
in the capitals of the two countries," said Zhu.

JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is consulting with
American public relations adviser Arthur Finkelstein on the
possibility of putting the West Bank redeployment issue to a
national referendum, a diplomatic source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This disclosure coincided with a senior political source's
contention that Netanyahu tends to favor this idea, even if it
will cause a further delay in the second withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, was convicted
Wednesday of treason for illegally selling chemical and biological
weapons components and knowhow to Iran for 16 million
U.S. dollars. He could receive life imprisonment when he is
sentenced on July 15.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The two 16-year-old minors from a village in the West Bank
settlement of Beit Haggai, who clubbed to death a 48-year-old
Palestinian farmer late Tuesday, said Wednesday that they just
meant to play a "prank" when they hit him on the head with a
wooden club. Netanyahu has condemned the murder.

Zhu described related efforts as "a large-scale program which
has yielded tangible results in wide-ranging fields." She noted
that "projects such as the electron-positron collider and
nationwide digital network for detecting and monitoring
earthquakes rank as world-class achievements".
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the two countries have focused on global issues
in wide-ranging areas such as the environment, energy, the
protection of endangered species and nuclear safety in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The impetus and incentives provided by government departments,
semiofficial and nongovernmental institutions in the two
countries, including Chinese provinces and U.S. states, have
enabled institutions of higher education, laboratories and most
recently enterprises to engage in "fruitful" cooperation,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"Enormous potential remains to be tapped by the two sides,"
said Zhu. She expressed the hope that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's upcoming China visit will enable the countries to expand
consultations related to research and applications of space
technology needed for global studies.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the hope that China and the United States
will implement programs on energy, the environment and the
peaceful use of nuclear energy as outlined in existing agreements,
in addition to enhancing cooperation in the pharmaceutical,
telecommunications and microelectronic sectors, as well as
bilateral nongovernmental exchanges.
</P>
<P>
She said that scientists from the two nations have successfully
cooperated in macro-science projects over the past 20 years and
noted that "cooperation can be expanded to more projects,
including controlled nuclear fusion and mapping human genes."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, "United States' Restrictions to technology
transfers have been a major barrier hindering both economic and
scientific and technological cooperation." She pointed out that
ensuring long-term scientific exchanges and engaging in common
efforts to solve problems in wider arenas should be accompanied by
removing barriers at the earliest possible date."

they probably would have some kind of announcement later.
</P>
<P>
Westphal's pending deal to replace George Karl was reported by
Seattle radio station.
</P>
<P>
Walker and Westphal, a former Phoenix Suns coach, are close to
agreement on a two-or three-year deal worth between one million
U.S. dollars and 1.5 million dollars per season, accoridng to the

</P>
<P>
Walker refused to commment on the decision. Westphal, 47, beat
out Bob Hill, Charlotte Hornets assistant Paul Silas and former
Sonics assistant Bob Weiss for the job.
</P>
<P>
The Sonics waited until after the NBA Finals so they could
speak to Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, but Walker changed his
mind after hearing that Jackson needed more time to decide his
future.
</P>
<P>
Westphal led the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals in his first

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Leaves Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, apparently happy with the result of his talks with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, left Moscow for home Wednesday
night
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Yeltsin on Tuesday, Milosevic promised to
resume negotiations with leaders of ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo
region, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also released a joint statement concerning
various issues in Kosovo, including possible forms of autonomy
for the area.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing now is to persuade -- and this is our
common task -- primarily our Western partners and the leadership
of the Kosovo Albanians to resume talks immediately," said russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, who is in charge of
liaisons with NATO.
</P>
<P>
He added that both Milosevic and Yeltsin have publicly
undertaken very serious obligations which must be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister noted that withdrawal of all police
forces now from Kosovo would mean giving the whole Kosovo
district to separatists and extremists.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo problem should be solved within Serbia and
Yugoslavia," he stressed. "Otherwise, it would lead directly to
secession and war."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic arrived in Moscow on Tuesday on a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Supplementary Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set aside a
7.031- billion ringgit (about 1.793 billion U.S. dollars)
supplementary budget in an effort to generate a real GDP growth
higher than the negative 1.8 percent recorded during the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure was approved by the cabinet at its weekly
meeting Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is
also finance minister, announced here Thursday when simultaneously
opening the Umno (United Malays National Organization) Youth and
Woman annual assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also Umno deputy president, said: "We have to
ensure that the government's supplementary spending will fully
bring about positive effects in generating national economic
growth and boosting the people's general well-being."
</P>
<P>
As such, Anwar said, it is imperative that implementation of
projects under the rehabilitative plan would not lead to an
outflow of national reserves or liquidity.
</P>
<P>
He said that toward this end efforts would be concentrated on
projects that could stimulate high demand for
domestically-produced goods and services within a short period of
time.
</P>
<P>
The focus would also be on projects capable of enhancing the
country's efficiency and competitive edge and of substituting
imports and boosting exports, among other things.
</P>
<P>
"The government will see to it that these projects be expedited
in the second half of 1998 and in 1999 to accelerate national
economic recovery," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
They would include agriculture and low- and medium-cost housing
projects and expansion of skills training and tertiary
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Construction of clinics, bridges and roads especially for the
rural areas, water supply and infrastructure maintenance would
also be considered, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Kills Tobacco Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Proposed legislation to curb
teenager smoking and bring nicotine under federal regulation died
in the Republican controlled Senate of the United States Congress
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The American people "won't like what they see", said President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Following a four-week struggle on the Senate floor, supporters
of the bill failed on two successive procedural votes to gain the
60 votes needed to keep the bill alive.
</P>
<P>
"If this bill goes down today, Joe Camel wins and our kids
lose," said Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat and one of numerous
Democrats who have sought to end Republican blocking action on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the final vote, Clinton said in the White House:
"If more members of the Senate would vote like parents rather than
politicians, we could solve this problem and go onto other
business of the country."
</P>
<P>
A number of Democrats vowed to force the issue back onto the
Senate floor before the mid-term elections, and accused
Republicans of merely doing the bidding of Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi spoke for Republicans
who argued that the measure had become a big government "tax and
spend" bill. "We've lost sight of the original noble cause of just
dealing with teen-age smoking and drug abuse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and the public health groups had sought to give the
government the power to regulate nicotine and take other steps to
rein in the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, said he would try to
revive some form of tobacco legislation, but only a bill "that is
narrowly focused on teen smoking."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes," said
Gingrich in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The development was regarded as a remarkable triumph for the
tobacco industry which spent tens of millions of dollars on an
advertising campaign to oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Wednesday's vote, Clinton appealed for action to
"protect the children and not the tobacco lobby".
</P>
<P>
Of the killing of the legislation, he said: "There can be no
possible explanation other than the intense pressure and the
awesome influence fueled by years of huge contributions of Big
Tobacco," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rejection of the bill is likely to set in motion an
unpredictable chain of political and legal events.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are expected to raise the issue this fall against
Republicans, while tobacco companies would be open to a fresh
round of lawsuits. Left unclear would be the fate of the huge
settlement that several states reached with the tobacco industry
last summer to end their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
That agreement sparked the drive to write legislation in the
Senate, but election-year politics and other forces swiftly
intruded.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies walked away from the bill when it was
expanded beyond what they had agreed on with the states.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to grant limited liability protection to the tobacco
companies was stripped from the bill on the Senate floor as
lawmakers sought a way to show voters they were willing to be
tough on an industry that markets its products to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Democrats, backed by public health groups, sought
to frame the debate as a question of choosing children over
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
"Three thousand kids a day will take up smoking," Senator Tom
Harkin, a Democrat, said. "One thousand of them will die
prematurely."
</P>
<P>
Republicans said the truth was different, that they, too, favor
cracking down on teen smoking, but that the bill had gotten out of
hand.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls for "High Profile" International Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. conference underway here to
create an International Criminal Court (ICC) must strive to set up
a "high profile" court, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
told the delegates Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ICC must be "strong and independent" and
the prosecutor must have "the power to take initiatives" to
achieve a "credible and efficient" court.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Italy has proposed adding state aggression to the
list of crimes the ICC would handle, Dini said the court should
have "the power to intervene first hand" on behalf of "a
sovereignty which is above and beyond national interests."
</P>
<P>
He urged delegates to work for the "immediate signing of a
statute by all nations involved." Membership, he added, should be
as vast as possible because "the universality of a treaty of this
importance is measured by the number of nations adhering to it."
</P>
<P>
Dini said that a Red Cross proposal to give the ICC a police
force "seems like an excellent idea to me because it could bolster
the ICC's actions."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson
said the ICC should not become "a human rights ombudsman."
</P>
<P>
"We must not turn an international criminal court, or its
prosecutor, into a human rights ombudsman open to, and responsible
for responding to, any and all complaints from any source," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson also said the proposal to grant ICC prosecutors
investigative autonomy was "unrealistic and unwise" and would, in
fact, weaken rather than reinforce the court.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Security Council should play a key role in the
ICC "including in the process to start legal proceedings." The
U.S. is a permanent member of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Richardson noted the U.S. remains "cautiously optimistic" over
the outcome of the five-week U.N. conference which started Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ICC is designed to be an international criminal tribunal
where defendants will be individuals, whereas the existing
International Court of Justice at The Hague settles judicial
controversies between sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government Wednesday officially confirmed that The
Hague had been designated to host the ICC. The Dutch city is also
the seat of the International Court for War Crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President to Visit Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem will visit Britain on October 27 to November 1. He is the
first Argentine president to visit Britain since 1982 when the two
countries were engaged in a war, the Argentine Foreign Ministry
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Menem will meet with British Queen Elizabeth
II and Prime Minister Tony Blair. He will also attend a meeting of
British entrepreneurs in Birmingham on November 1.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said Wednesday that
Menem's visit is to help establish mutual trust between the two
nations, because mutual acceptance between them needs to be
improved.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president's trip to Britain was initiated by
former British Prime Minister John Major in September 1995 when
the two governments signed an agreement in New York to jointly
explore the oil and gas resources off the Malvinas Islands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain severed their diplomatic relations in
1982 when they fought a war of sovereignty over the Malvinas
Islands; they resumed diplomatic ties in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, relations between Argentina and Britain have
improved, but the position of the two countries on the sovereignty
of the islands has not changed. The Argentine government has
reaffirmed sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands several times and
has expressed a willingness to negotiate with the British
government to seek a better resolution.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Defends China's Family Planning Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State Family
Planning Commission has criticized comments that Harry
Wu and others made recently about China's birth control policies
at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing, calling them a
distortion of the facts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Wu and others vilified China in
their attack on its family planning policies with these so-called
facts they got from the city of Jinjiang in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that their purpose was to mislead and deceive the
public and undermine the normal development of the relations
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is a developing country with 1.2 billion
people and has chosen family planning as a means of keeping the
population from growing too fast and that this was the correct
choice.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has a limited amount of arable land,
relatively insufficient natural resources on a per-capita basis,
and uneven social and economic development and that it has added
13 million more people to its population annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
It has less arable land than the United States, but has a
higher per unit grain yield than the world average. But, per
capita grain consumption in China is less than a fourth that of
the United States because China's population is five times that of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that if China had not pursued family planning
and had continued with its birth rate of the early 1970s, it would
have a population of more than 1.5 billion now and the
consequences would be disastrous, the spokesman said, so China had
every reason to practise family planning, an inevitable option
that any responsible government would have done.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has a principle of following state guidance and people's
own wishes in family planning and objects to any coercive
measures. It has always emphasized education and the use of
contraception for people of child-bearing ages, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has dealt firmly with any encroachment upon people's
interests, he said, and has protected the legitimate rights and
interests of women of child-bearing age in the Administrative
Procedural Law enacted in 1991, the Compensation Law enacted in
1994, and the Criminal Law, which was amended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that some family planning workers in Fujian Province,
for example, who infringed upon people's legitimate rights and
interests while doing their job in 1996 had been sentenced to more
than two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Before they fled to the United States, Gao Xiaoduan and his
wife borrowed more than two million yuan from local credit co-ops
and villagers and have not paid the money back, the spokesman
said, calling their attack on China the result of base motives.
</P>
<P>
Gao Xiaoduan said that, with few exceptions, Chinese families
are allowed to have only one child, but, in fact, the spokesman
said, 25.68 percent of Chinese women of child-bearing age have
three or more children, 32.5 percent have two, 36.1 percent have
one child, and 5.68 percent have no child, according to the State
Statistics Bureau's 1995 study.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, 1997, in Jinjiang city, Gao's hometown, the
ratio of the women of child-bearing age who had two or more
children is higher than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
Gao claimed that women who were nine months pregnant were
forced to have an abortion and that fetuses were killed by a
lethal injection, but the State Family Planning Commission did an
investigation in Jinjiang and concluded that there were no such
cases at all.

<P>
The spokesman said that Harry Wu had said that a man named Pan
in the village of Yingdun, Yonghe Town, Jinjiang City, had two
daughters and the local family planning office suspected his wife
of being pregnant with her third child, so they repeatedly took
Pan's father into custody for as long as four months. But, the
investigators found that Pan was Pan Rongsheng, whose wife is Wang
Lixuan. They married in 1990 and have two daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that during her pregnancy no one took any action
against her family, nor did they take her father-in-law into
custody, nor did they disturb her house.
</P>
<P>
Harry Wu also said that a man named Lin in the village of
Maping in Yonghe had a wife who was forced to have an abortion
because they had no birth permit or quota. But the investigators
found that the couple Wu referred to were Lin Jiazhong and Yang
Meigui who got a marriage certificate in December of 1997. But
Yang discovered that she was pregnant before they were married and
thought that it was wrong, so she had an abortion in a hospital of
her own free will.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in pursuing the family planning policy,
the Chinese government resolutely opposes any form of coerced
abortion and the adoption of induced abortion as a means of family
planning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government emphasizes that abortions are merely a
means of dealing with contraception failures and must be done
under safe and reliable conditions with the consent of the people
concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said that the family planning program offers information,
consultation, and other services to people of childbearing age and
that there are no quotas and that the use of "birth permits" in
family planning in a few places before the 1990s was changed long
ago.

<P>
The family planning policy accords with the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation, and internationally-recognized
principles on population growth, the spokesman stressed and
population growth still strains economic development, resources
utilization, and environmental protection in China, so China will
continue this policy.
</P>
<P>
It has also been written into the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that carrying out the policy is difficult and
complicated because of regional and urban and rural differences,
but that governments at different levels will make every effort to
solve existing problems and shortcomings, and that, in fact, China
welcomes well-intentioned opinion and suggestions from the
international community and is willing to take them earnestly.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely
oppose vicious slander and attacks on the family planning policy
and interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people respect the American people's views on
childbirth, he added, but the two countries have completely
different population problems because of different national
conditions, their economic and developmental levels, and historic
and cultural backgrounds, so China's measures on the issue of
population are understandably different from those of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we sincerely hope that objective and fair-minded
people will be vigilant against those people who act on the issue
out of ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
He said that because improved Sino-U.S. relations are in the
interest of Chinese people and American people, and conducive to
world peace and development. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Thirty Percent of Chinese Live in Cities, Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A report published by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences today reveals that 30 percent of
Chinese people now live in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The report says that China's urbanization level is quite low --
equal to the world average in the 1950s, 7 percent behind the
average level of developing countries and 45 percent behind
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that China is still a big agricultural
country, despite the quickening pace of industrialization in the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the report forecast that in 2000 China's urbanization
level will reach the world's average in the 1970s, the 1990s level
in 2010, and catch up with other countries around 2020.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that China will bridge the 40-year gap in 20
years, the development is quite fast," said Tian Xueyuan, director
of the Population Institute of the academy.
</P>
<P>
China's urban population will increase by 4 percent annually
between 2000 and 2010, Tian said, and by 3 percent between 2010
and 2025.
</P>
<P>
Besides natural growth, migrants from the countryside will be a
major factor in China's urbanization process, he said. Around
2000, there will be 200 million surplus rural laborers in China,
Tian said.

A player who takes a drug will be suspended with pay for the
first offense. The second time he is suspended without pay, and
the third time he is subject to a lifetime ban.

China's overall national strength will be even more greater by
the end of this century and the changes in the economic system and
economic operations will facilitate economic growth in a long
period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that improvement in infrastructure has bolstered
China's economic growth potential and enabled China to make better
use of domestic and overseas markets and resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has great market potential in urban housing
and transport and in the wide rural areas, Zeng said. He added
that China's sustained and rapid economic growth in the years
ahead will be of significant importance to global economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
He estimated China's imports in the first five years of the
next century at around one trillion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The second of two girls who had
been trapped for 42 days in a cave in southwestern China's Guizhou
Province died here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingzhu, 16, died of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiaofei, 19, Li's classmate, died two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
A doctor in charge of her medical treatment, said Li suffered
from acidosis and a lung infection since her rescue on June 13,
together with Liang.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was unable to save the extremely weak girl despite
extensive medical efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, the doctor said, "it is a miracle that the two girls
had survived 42 days without any food."
</P>
<P>
A party of four explorers stumbled on the girls, and found that
their companions, Huang Yan and Wang Shunrong, had already died of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
The four entered the cave on May 2 without informing anyone of
their whereabouts and got lost when their candles were
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
Their schools reported them missing on May 9.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone
tuned up for their planned wrestling event with some playful
taunting and pushing Wednesday in Burbank of Califonia.
</P>
<P>
The two wrestling fans say they'll square off in a tag-team
match in San Diego on July 12. Rodman will partner with Hollywood
Hulk Hogan against Malone, the Utah Jazz star, and Diamond Dallas
Page.
</P>
<P>
"I called Karl a lot more than a wimp on the court," said
Rodman, the Chicago Bulls' rebounder king. "I don't know how he's
going to beat me in the ring when he can't beat me on the court."
</P>
<P>
Malone looks much tougher than Rodman. He showed off his
muscles in a sleeveless world championship wrestling shirt.
</P>
<P>
Rodman made headlines when he appeared with Hogan for a world
wrestling championship event a day after Chicago beat Utah in Game
3 of the NBA Finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- American superstars Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, Gail Devers and Mary Slaney were given green light
Wednesday to compete in the USA Track and Field Championships
despite without qualifying marks.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, 36, who said this would be her final year of
career, was allowed to compete in the heptathlon in which she
holds the U.S. and world record of 7,291 points. She won the event
in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics and is the five-time national
champion.
</P>
<P>
The multi-talented athlete also will compete in the long jump
in the three-day championships beginning Friday in New Orleans.
She won the event gold medal in 1988 Olympics and owns the U.S.
national record.
</P>
<P>
Devers, 31, who has been plagued by injuries and illness, will
compete in the 100-meter hurdles in which she owns the U.S. record
of 12.46 seconds. She won the 1993 world gold medal but never got
an Olympic laural in that event. The two times Olympic gold
medalist for the 100 meters dare not to run face-to-face against
new American star Marione Jones, the fastest woman in the world
this year.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Slaney, the U.S. record holder for four
distance events, will double in the championships, competing in
the 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the big three stars, the women's competition will
feature 12 U.S. record holders in 20 events.
</P>
<P>
In the men's events, Michael Johnson won't run the 200 meters,
and Dan O'Brien declared to skip the decathlon. Shot putter Randy
Barnes and triple jumper Kenny Harrison also have decided to pull
out the competition. The men will have only nine national record
holders in 20 events.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- With limited purchasing power at
home, Thai real-estate businessmen are eyeing the other side of
the Pacific Ocean, hoping a second housing roadshow could lure
more U.S. buyers.
</P>
<P>
ERA (Thailand) Co., the country's largest real-estate franchise
broker, plans a second housing roadshow in the United States on
August 1-17, the Bangkok Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The roadshow aims to encourage Thai business people living in
the United States to invest in their home country and to attract
those wanting to own a second home in Thailand, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The show will be held in the Thai communities in New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A similar event in April, held in Los Angeles, Chicago and
Washington, generated 150 million baht (3.6 million U.S. dollars)
in residential and industrial property sales.
</P>
<P>
The August exhibition will be divided into three parts:
residential and industrial projects, golf courses, and franchise
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
About 15 local property developers are expected to join the
trip, and 30 golf courses are interested in having ERA organize a
display to showcase their properties.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin-Milosevic Agreement May Ease Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said Wednesday that some signs of improvement have appeared in the
Kosovo crisis but seeking a final solution still remained a
delicate business.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made the remark one day after a talk in Moscow between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued Tuesday with Yeltsin, Milosevic
promised to resume dialogue with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to
end repressive action against civilians there.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to withdraw Yugoslav troops immediately from the
troubled province -- the key demand of the six-nation Contact
Group for ex-Yugoslavia, which groups Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
he believed the Yeltsin-Milosevic statement was an "important step
forward" towards re-opening dialogue between Belgrade and the
ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It must be steady and not sporadic," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed since tensions escalated
in Kosovo in early March. About 65,000 of the 1.8 million
population have fled their homes in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
account for 90 percent of the population. Separatist-minded
ethnic Albanians have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia
since 1981.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Chairman Voices Concern Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The current chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Poland's
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, said here Wednesday that
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity brooks no infringement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Geremek said that the conflict
in the troubled Kosovo province of Yugoslavia is a "test for
Europe."
</P>
<P>
He warned those "tension-makers" among ethnic Albanians that
Yugoslav territorial integrity brooks no infringement.
</P>
<P>
Geremek also said Belgrade should make it clear that it would
respect all criteria of democracy and human rights set by the OSCE
if it wants to be re-admitted to the organization.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's OSCE membership was suspended in 1992 for its role
in the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Geremek also stressed that the OSCE, the European Union and the
six-member Contact Group for ex-Yugoslavia should carry out better
coordination and speak in one and the same voice on the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he placed great hopes on the planned mission by former
Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez as the international
mediator in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo escalated in early March this year when four
policemen and 16 Albanians were killed in an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Separatist-minded ethnic Albanians have been seeking
independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley met with visiting Chief Executive of China's Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa in her
office here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shipley and Tung exchanged views on a wide range of matters,
including cooperation between New Zealand and Hong Kong within
the APEC, the Asian financial turmoil and bilateral trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Later, the chief executive also called on New Zealand Minister
of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don MaKinnon and Finance Minister
Bill Birch.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the meetings, Tung described the
discussions with the New Zealand leaders as "extremely useful".
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong and New Zealand have a very important
bilateral relationship. At present, 3,000 New Zealanders live in
Hong Kong, while tens of thousands of people from Hong Kong have
settled down in New Zealand in addition to thousands of Hong Kong
students studying in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relationship, he pointed out, does not cover
only the areas of trade and investment. It also finds itself in
people to people relations.
</P>
<P>
He felt pleased with announcement by Shipley of visa waiver
arrangement for people from Hong Kong to visit New Zealand. He
believed this will be a great help for Hong Kong, coming
particularly soon after the return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Tung said in the talks with the New Zealand leaders, he also
had the opportunity to explain how well the Hong Kong people are
doing there to successfully implement the principle of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the rebound of the Japanese yen, he said
he is pleased with the rebound and hopes it will sustain.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he noted, the stability of the yen will be
important for Hong Kong and every country around the world as
Japan is the second largest economy of the world.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the Asian financial crisis, Tung said the
impact is serious and Asia cannot underestimate the difficulties
it caused. But the strength of Asia cannot be underestimated
either, as it has a flexible and hard-working labor force, the
willingness to accept new ideas, a very high savings rate and an
indomitable spirit to succeed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa will fly back to Hong Kong from Auckland Friday
after attending a reception hosted by Chinese Ambassador to New
Zealand Chen Wenzhao here Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Bridge Gap with Iran: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that it is time to test the possibilities
for bridging the gap between the U.S. and Iran despite the fact
that the gap "remains wide."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstanding," Albright said at an Asia
Society function in New York. She urged Iran to "consider
parallel steps."
</P>
<P>
Praising Iran for its efforts in bringing peace in Afghanistan,
its achievements in anti-drug combat and and its aid to Iraqi and
Afghan refugees, Albright said Iran would be welcome to make a
"constructive contribution" to world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks came amid the U.S. administration's latest
move to improve bilateral relationships, which include encouraging
cultural and academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, two decades of mistrust cannot be erased
overnight," Albright noted, while accusing Iran of continuing its
"support for terrorism" and making efforts "to develop long-range
missiles and to acquire nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has adopted a policy of isolating Iran since the 1979
Iranian Revolution.

<P>
The cabinet has acknowledged the report submitted by the Board
of Investment (BOI) on easing the conditions, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The decision allows foreigners to enjoy a greater ratio of
shareholding in joint-ventures, especially in projects in the
investment promotion zones.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to help boost liquidity and enable
investors to find more financial sources.
</P>
<P>
There were 48 requests for changing ratio of foreign
shareholding in the first quarter of 1998 and 21 requests in April
and May.
</P>
<P>
Given the growing demand, a total of 77 Thai corporations will
become alien companies with the majority of foreign shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The change of shareholding ratio was mostly found in such
sectors as automobiles, chemical products, paper and plastic,
electronics and electrical appliances, textiles, accessories and
toys, power plants, basic metal industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Taiwan and the United States have the highest increase
in shareholding in joint-ventures in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Guinea Agree to Expand Bauxite Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Guinea reached an
agreement here Wednesday to increase exports of bauxite to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The news was announced by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
following his meeting with the visiting Guinean President Lansana
Conte, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he also talked with his Guinean counterpart on
Ukrainian investment in Guinea's bauxite mining business which
would help accelerate the restructuring endeavor.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the two countries signed a ten-year agreement on
Ukraine's annual purchase of two million tons of bauxite from
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
During their recent talks, both sides indicated their
willingness to expand the bauxite trade with a target of 40
million U.S. dollars compared to the current 28 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president also expressed an interest in joining
the effort to build a 600-700 kilometer railway in Guinea for the
transportation of minerals.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean president voiced his willingness to also cooperate
with Ukraine on building ships.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two trade partners had a trade volume of 52
million dollars. 99.8 percent of Ukraine's imports were bauxite
and alumina from Guinea. Metallurgical products formed half of the
country's exports.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
trade negotiation committee for the creation of the Free Trade
Area for the Americas (FTAA) began here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella

<HEADLINE> India to Explore Possibility of Dhaka Indo-Pak Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Secretary K.
Raghunath is expected to visit Dhaka on June 29 to explore
Bangladesh's offer of hosting an Indo-Pak bilateral summit, The
Statesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during her one-day
visit to India on June 16 had offered to facilitate the dialogue
process by hosting a summit between prime ministers of India and
Pakistan. While India has not yet accepted the offer of a venue
for the bilateral summit, the Indian government has expressed its
willingness to consider the possibility if the logistics of the
proposed summit work out to its satisfaction, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, both India and Pakistan have got themselves into
a bind over the conflicting offers of dates and venue. India's
offer of talks in New Delhi on June 22 was met with a
counter-offer from Pakistan suggesting talks in Islamabad on June
20. Now, neither country is in a position to backtrack without
loss of face. In this context, a summit in Dhaka provides a
neutral alternative.
</P>
<P>
India's openness to the offer also stems from the fact that
facilitation by Bangladesh would be far more acceptable than
intervention by any Western power which would be perceived as a
coercive measure. While Sheikh Hasina's offer stems from her
regional ambitions, Bangladesh poses no threat to India's
self-esteem. The earlier trilateral summit of prime ministers of
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in Dhaka in January this year has
also provided a precedent, enabling India to consider the
proposal, the paper further said.
</P>
<P>
Raghunath's visit on June 29 will follow Sheikh Hasina's
one-day visit to Pakistan on June 24. Pakistan has already
indicated its positive response to the proposal for a summit
between Pakistan and India in Dhaka, but a clearer picture of the
modalities is expected to emerge after Hasina's discussions with
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the paper added.

<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive 70 million
U.S. dollars from Japan as grant for its debt relief under an
agreement, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan would provide Bangladesh with a grant assistance of the
said amount with the intention of producing the same effect as
canceling an international debt, said the exchange of notes signed
between the two sides in Dhaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The grant would enable the recipient country to purchase
commodities and equipment from all member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the notes
stated.
</P>
<P>
Since the grant was to be utilized by the Bangladeshi
government for the import of commodities and equipment for
much-needed investment programs, it would substantially contribute
to development in various sectors of the Bangladeshi economy and
social welfare, it said.
</P>
<P>
It would also contribute considerably to improving the balance

<P>
TIRANA, June 18 (Xinhua) - United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has urged Kosovo Albanians to dialogue with
Belgrade in an effort to solve the current crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Constructive dialogue is the only way the crisis can be solved
politically and permanently, Albright said in a letter Wednesday
to Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano. She hoped that Albania
would deliver this message to Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
She praised Albania's commitment to backing the efforts of
Kosovo's Albanian leaders to solve the crisis peacefully. The
U.S. government is studying ways to deal with the rapidly
deteriorating situation, and to provide Albania with the best
assistance possible, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade must end the violence against Kosovo Albanians that is
endangering the dialogue process, Albright said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. envoy to the region said during a telephone call to
Nano the same day that military intervention is still a
U.S. government alternative on ending the crisis swiftly and

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Urges Milosevic to Fulfill Promise for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 17 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) Secretary General Javier Solana Wednesday urged Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to fulfill his pledge for talks with
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Solana warned that there would "really be big problems" if he
failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Spain's Onda Cero Radio, Solana
said Milosevic made progress in agreeing to negotiate with
Kosovo's Albanians for a political solution to their autonomy
demand after he met Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Solana pointed out, however, that Milosevic's promise "could be
an operation just meant to gain time" in order to avoid military
interference by western countries.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 80 aircraft from 13 NATO members conducted
an exercise in the Balkans to put pressure on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said Milosevic had agreed to mediation of Kosovo
by former Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez Marquez, as
proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Spain was with the European Union, NATO and the
United Nations on the Kosovo issue, he urged the international
community to prevent another Bosnia war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed and about 6,500 made
homeless in Kosovo since early this year when separatist-minded
ethnic Albanians launched a violent independence movement. Ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.

<HEADLINE> Shougang Moves Mill for Capital's Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shougang Corp plans to limit
output, sharply cut back on pollution emissions and move one of
its steel mills out of downtown Beijing, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest steel manufacturers in China, the 80-year-old
Shougang Corp, also known as Capital Iron and Steel Corp, has
decided to cap its steel output at eight million tons per year,
spokesman Huang An of the Beijing-based corporation said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the corporation will have to readjust its
development strategy from expanding its production capacity to
developing new products and improving quality to boost efficiency
while also boosting investment in new technologies.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to improve the capital's
environment. Steel-making is considered a major pollutant.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the corporation has drafted a plan to invest a
total of 3.9 billion yuan (US$469.8 million) in environmental
protection projects during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will be used to build a waste-water treatment
plant capable of processing 55 million tons of waste water
annually.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a large-type production line for steel
residue processing will be built in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The largest among all the new initiatives is to remove its
special steel mill out of downtown Beijing and upgrade the
resettled mill. The special steel mill is a major pollutant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The corporation expects to cut down its industrial dust
emission by 20 to 30 percent, and bring all its industrial
waste-gas and waste-water emission into compliance with State
standards by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Tamils in Canada Fund Sri Lanka's Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Tamil groups in Canada
particularly in the Toronto area are funding Sri Lanka's rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), according to reports
reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are sending over one million U.S. dollars a month to buy
arms and weapons for the LTTE to fight the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
The funds are reportedly being collected by two groups through
threats, extortion, fraud and drug dealing from the 150,000 Sri
Lankan Tamils living in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to Canada Ananda Gunasekera has
been quoted as saying that the Sri Lankan government has been
urging the Canadian government to bar these groups from raising
funds.
</P>
<P>
He said the money collected there is causing a lot of damage in
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), an
umbrella organization comprising ten Tamil groups in Canada, has
been identified by the U.S. State department as one of the front
organizations of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar has recently
said that the bombing of Sri Lanka's Central Bank in January 1996
was funded by money raised in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government believes that the LTTE is raising
funds worldwide posing as religious, cultural, social, educational
and humanitarian bodies.
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, India, Malaysia and the U.S. have taken
steps to control activities of LTTE front organizations, the
reports added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Productivity, Competitiveness Low: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The average productivity of Thai
industrial and service sectors has been at an alarmingly low
level, the Bangkok Post Thursday quoted a study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Low productivity affected the competitiveness of Thai
industries and services in the world market, the study conducted
by Siam Productivity Co. (SPC), said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study are based on field survey and
samplings of over 1,000 companies from a broad range of business
activities.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the Thai economy over the past three
decades had affected local competitiveness, since local
entrepreneurs can always sell their goods whether they are good or
not, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"They (local entrepreneurs) are not interested in improving
production capacity and that has continued to depress their
competitiveness," Paritud Bhandubanyong, SPC executive director,
said.
</P>
<P>
SPC is an affiliate of American-based Productivity Inc., the
worldwide industrial consultant company.
</P>
<P>
Judging by five key indices, SPC found Thai industrial and
service sectors lack efficiency and their productivity are
dramatically low.
</P>
<P>
The five indices are: overall equipment efficiency index
measuring the readiness and efficiency of a company to meet the
requirements of customers: value-added time ratio index, measuring
the level of customer satisfaction: inventory cost index: defect
index, measuring the amount of waste on the production line: and
preparing index, measuring the warming up time before production.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Chinese experts on
cultural relics and historians suggested that the world-famous
imperial garden -- Yuanmingyuan (Garden of 10,000 Gardens) --
should be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a forum on Yuanmingyuan held here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmingyuan, built over a 150-year period from 1709-1859,
covers 330 hectares. It was burned and destroyed in October of
1860 by British and French forces and looted and burned again in
1900 when the Allied Eight Power Force came to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the suggestions at the forum, the ruins of part of
the garden's buildings would be protected as they are to remind
people of the brutal acts of the invaders.
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions included rebuilding some of the garden's
buildings to reflect Chinese classical garden building arts,
establishing a Yuanmingyuan museum, making a study of
Yuanmingyuan, and establishing an academy to study Yuanmingyuan
and conduct cultural exchanges with foreign countries.

<P>
YANGON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's processing and
manufacturing sector achieved a 5.3 percent growth in output value
in 1997-98 fiscal year ending March over the previous year,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the sector was attributed to the extensive

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Spend Less Time on Work, Household Chores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A recent national survey shows
that the expanded use of household electrical appliances and
reform of the labor system have enabled Chinese workers to spend
less time on work and household chores.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau survey shows that urban workers
worked an average five hours and 37 minutes daily during 1997,
compared to seven hours and 19 minutes in 1990. The reduction was
mainly due to the advent of the five-day work week.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that female workers spent three hours on
household chores each day in 1997, down from four hours and 23
minutes in 1990. Male workers, on the other hand, dedicated two
hours and 10 minutes to family duties, compared with an hour and
43 minutes in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong expressed here this morning that China welcomes the move
taken by the Japanese and U.S. governments to intervene on the
currency markets to buy Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen
is picking up," Dai said at the 4th Annual Meetings of the
Association of Development and Industrial Banks in Asia, which
started here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The yen was quoted at 135.70-75 to the U.S. dollar in early
trading in Tokyo today after Japan intervened on the currency
markets to buy yen. The US Federal Reserve also bought yen on
behalf of Tokyo, pushing the currency back from its heavy falls
in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dai reaffirmed that the Chinese yuan will not be
devalued. "It's unnecessary to do that," he said.

BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government Wednesday
showed its support for the joint statement by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on solving
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
An announcement issued by the Serbian Information Ministry said
the government had decided to take concrete measures to fulfil the
tasks set by the joint statement.

Milosevic, who is under threat of NATO military action to call
off the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists, held talks
with Yeltsin in Moscow on Tuesday and gave some guarantees in the
joint statement.

<P>
The announcement said relevant departments were instructed to
take all means to ensure the free passage of Kosovo people in the
province and ensure the safety of their lives and properties.
</P>
<P>
The government would also help people who fled from their
residences to return home and rebuild their houses which, the
statement said, had been ruined by terrorists in the riots.
</P>
<P>
The government would cooperate with the International Committee
of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees on the return and settlement of the displaced.

BONN -- Germany's rail authorities said Wednesday that a broken
wheel has been established as the clear cause for the country's
worst post-war train derailment which occurred earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Bonn Wednesday, officials of the
German Railway company said preliminary investigations showed that
a broken metal wheel tire on the first carriage of the ICE train
had been the triggering cause for the whole derailment.
</P>
<P>
The faulty tire, probably the result of an internal fracture
caused by metal fatigue or material defect, broke about six
kilometers before the crash site and wedged in the undercarriage
of the car.

Making the call, Majid Ansari, chairman of the left-wing

The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Ansari as
criticizing the right faction for demanding the impeachment of the
moderate Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, saying the motion was
not helpful to unity.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An old passenger with no flying
experience landed a small airplane in Indiana on Wednesday with
the help of voices on the radio after the pilot died at the
controls, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Kupferschmid, 81, and friend Wesley Sickle, 52, were
flying from Indianapolis to Muncie to have lunch when Sickle
suddenly slumped in his seat.
</P>
<P>
Kupferschmid grabbed the flight stick of the two-seat Cessna
and got on the radio, asking for help.
</P>
<P>
A nearby pilot, Mike Bowen, who was flying about 30 kilometers
away for a survey of gas lines, heard Kupferschmid's plea for help
and instructed the old man to fly and make an emergency landing at
Mount Comfort, the nearest airport.
</P>
<P>
Also with the help from another nearby pilot, Eddie Merchant,
Kupferschmid successfully landed with little damage to the plane
and no injury of himself.

LIMA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- About 7,000 to 10,000 Peruvians were
found to have been infected with AIDS as of April and 70,000
others were identified as HIV carriers, the Peru Ministry of

At least one thousand new cases of the disease are registered

</P>
<P>
Since the first case of AIDS was reported in the country in
1983, 250 million U.S. dollars have been spent in Peru on the
disease, Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past few years, the Peruvian government has
increased the budget by 400 percent for the AIDS control program.

Arias' clarification answered remarks by U.S. Senator Jesse

<P>
"This only reflects the personal opinion of Senator Helms and
not the position of the United States government," Arias said.

<P>
"Obviously, the position of Senator Helms is a very relevant
and important point of view in the United States, but it does not
reflect the majority of the North-American society," Arias said in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations between the two countries, Arias
said: "We have a great deal in common, and we hope that our links

NINGBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- This port city of east China's
Zhejiang Province has just unveiled a set of new rules to attract
more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies are allowed and encouraged to invest in
productive projects, technical renovation projects and
export-oriented agricultural projects, according to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
Also welcome is overseas investment in new and high technology
and airport, port, highway, power, energy, water conservancy and

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Attracts More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
experienced a hefty increase in overseas investment in the first
five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Contracted overseas investment in Sichuan was valued at more
than 500 million US dollars in the first five months, up by 72
percent over the same period of last year. Overseas paid-in
investment soared 62 percent to more than 200 million US dollars
for the January-May period, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Persisting overseas investor confidence and increasing
investment in infrastructure and high-tech projects are a major
reason for surging overseas investment in Sichuan, experts pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many overseas-funded projects signed in the past
years are being implemented, resulting in a significant increase in
actual overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan leads many other provinces and regions in southwest
China in terms of economic development and the level of opening-up
to the rest of the world. The amount of overseas investment
utilized is the greatest in the less- developed central and
western areas.
</P>
<P>
To attract more overseas investment, Sichuan will unveil rules
and regulations on the development of mineral and water resources
later this year and will also cancel all unreasonable fees for
overseas-funded enterprises, according to Tang Limin, a
provincial government official.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fallout of the
lingering Asian financial crisis, a development zone in east
China's Shandong Province has made successful attempts to attract
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The contracted value of overseas investment in the Weihai
Economic and Technological Development Zone surged 46.8 percent
year-on-year in the first five months of this year, with the value
of paid-in investment hitting 30 million US dollars, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia used to account for 90 percent of overseas
investment in Weihai, with a particular large part coming from the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis has gulfed and continued to hurt many
Asian nations since last July, the zone has had to readjust its
measures to attract overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
A major effort in this regard is the introduction of national
treatment to overseas companies and overseas-funded enterprises,
under which all firms are equally treated in project approval, tax
and labor policies, housing, medical service, collection of
administrative charges, among other things.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the zone authorities have taken measures to improve
services for overseas investors and cooperate with related
departments, higher education institutions and research institutes
to attract overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The zone has also made effective efforts to enhance cooperation
with overseas intermediary agencies.

<P>
SHENYANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have started to
work on electrifying Tieling-Anshan section of Harbin-Dalian
railway line in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The electrification of the entire 946-km Harbin-Dalian railway
line will be carried out in three parts: Harbin-Tieling,
Tieling-Anshan, Anshan-Dalian sections, which will be constructed
by three separate companies.
</P>
<P>
Workers have been working on electrifying the Harbin-Tieling
section since May 18.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an Railway Engineering Corporation has given the task of
building the haulage and power facilities for an electrified
160-km Anshan-Tieling section, which is situated inside Liaoning
Province, said local sources. The project is listed as one of the
state's key construction projects for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The electrification of the entire Harbin-Dalian railway line is
scheduled to be completed and put into service by 2000. By then,
the railway line, the only electrification rail in northeast
China, will allow trains to pass at a speed of 140 km and will see
a rise of 5,000 tons in its haulage weight, said engineers.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Lab on Weather Modification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China established first weather
modification lab in an artificial rainfall base in northeast
China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The lab is jointly run by National Meteorological Bureau and
Jinlin provincial government.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, China only has one institute of weather
modification. It is attached to Chinese Academy of Meteorology.
</P>
<P>
With rapid growth of the economic development, disasters caused
by bad weather as drought, hailstone and early frost brought about
heavier losses to crop growth.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuying, deputy head of the lab, said China has achieved
great progress in weather modification since its launching of
first artificial rain on July 21, 1958 over the sky in Fengman
Reservoir in Jilin.
</P>
<P>
She said, only in Jinlin Province, more than 1,300 sorties of
planes took off for artificial rainfalls, which increased 20
percent of the rainfalls in the province in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the lab is managing to become a state-level one with
two or three years.

<HEADLINE> Broken Wheel Set as Cause for German Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's rail authorities said
Wednesday that a broken wheel has been established as the clear
cause for the country's worst post-war train derailment which
occurred earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-City Express (ICE), Germany's fastest train with a
top speed of 280 kilometers an hour, jumped the tracks near the
northern German town of Eschede on June 3 and crashed into a
nearby road bridge, killing 100 people and injuring another 88
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Bonn Wednesday, officials of the
German Railway company said preliminary investigations showed that
a broken metal wheel tire on the first carriage of the ICE train
had been the triggering cause for the whole derailment.
</P>
<P>
The faulty tire, probably the result of an internal fracture
caused by metal fatigue or material defect, broke about six
kilometers before the crash site and wedged in the undercarriage
of the car.
</P>
<P>
The train then traveled on about 5.5 kilometers on the tracks
before the broken tire hit a switch mechanism on the rail lines,
jerking the wheel off the track and derailing the carriage along
with all the following ones.
</P>
<P>
German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann said that it would
still take several months before the explanation could be formally
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, the German rail authorities had already
withdrawn all 59 ICE trains of the same generation of the
ill-fated train and equipped them with new wheels.
</P>
<P>
The accident, however, has considerably undermined the public
trust in the high-speed trains which had had a perfect safety
record since entering into service in 1991.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) Wednesday announced its debut into the Estonian
market with the launch of an Estonian kroon 100 million Eurobond
issue, which is equivalent to 6.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three-year notes carry an annual coupon of 10.00 percent,
and were issued at a price of 101.35 percent of the par. The
proceeds of the issue were swapped into U.S. dollar floating rate
funds.
</P>
<P>
This issue is part of the IFC's goal of contributing to the
development of new capital markets. The IFC is a member of the
World Bank Group, and also the largest multilateral source for
financing private sector projects in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This transaction under the IFC's Global Medium Term Note
Program brings the IFC's market borrowing to some 3,973 million
dollars for the fiscal year 1998, which began on July 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced the approval of a 60 million U.S.
dollar soft loan to Bolivia to improve housing conditions,
particularly for low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
The financing will enable the government to carry out a housing
policy aimed at making the real estate and housing finance markets
more efficient, enabling more funds to be channeled into the
sector and reducing the cost of housing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the resources for the program will consist of grants to
municipalities for upgrading low-income neighborhoods in cities
throughout the country, primarily through investments in basic
services.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities will compete for the grants by offering more
counterpart funding for the projects. The municipalities will also
take steps to modernize their land registers and property tax
systems, revise urban legislation to make it more effective, take
steps to legalize land tenure in informal settlements and provide
city sanitation services and road and draining maintenance in
beneficiary areas.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is some 71 million dollars. Apart
from the IDB loan, local counterpart funds some 11 million
dollars.

and economy will be high on the agenda of President Bill Clinton's
trip to China, said senior U.S. officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a White House background briefing just one week before the
visit, Presidential National Security Advisor Sandy Berger,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the president's special
assistant on economic policy, Gene Sperling, outlined a broad
agenda for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will start his trip next Thursday and his first stop
will be Xi'an, and then Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda during the summit in Beijing between Clinton
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin will be the stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Berger noted that China has played a "constructive role" in
forging a consensus among the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council on the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan on the
steps that they must take to move towards a situation of less
tension.
</P>
<P>
"We will be working with the Chinese to try to encourage both
the Pakistanis and the Indians to take those steps," he added.
</P>
<P>
On nonproliferation of weapons, Berger said "there's been quite
remarkable progress" in this area in the past five years. He hoped
that more progress is to be made.
</P>
<P>
On economy, Rubin said, "The United States has an enormous
stake in the economic well-being of China."
</P>
<P>
His remarks were echoed by Sperling. "We feel it is strongly in
our national interest to bring China into the global trading
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The American and Chinese officials will continue the
discussions that they have had about the state-owned enterprises,
the reform of that system, the issues around the financial sector
and the challenges in the banking sector, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Both Berger and Rubin praised China for its "absolutely
critical role" in maintaining the currency rate in helping
stabilize the financial market in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton "will press during the meeting for China to
open its markets for goods, service and agriculture as it engages
in the sweeping economic reforms," said Sperling.
</P>
<P>
On crime and drug trafficking, Berger said that "it has been an
area of growing cooperation" between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Berger reiterated that the United States has a fundamental
interest in engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
One of the administration's fundamental strategic objectives is
to "build a strong bridge to Asia" and "in particular, to put the
U.S.-China relationship on a more solid footing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for that is because the direction China takes over
the next 10 or 20 years will fundamentally and profoundly affect
our interests, our children's future, stability in Asia, peace in
the world," Berger told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Engagement is a vehicle, is a means to both expand the areas
of our cooperation and to deal with the Chinese directly, face to
face, about areas of difference," he added.

<HEADLINE> Study: Toys on Greek Market Contain Toxic Substances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Children's toys on the Greek market
contained high levels of toxic substances which could cause
serious damage to children's livers and kidneys, according to a
study carried out by the Greek branch of the environmental
protection organization Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace selected random samples of toys made from soft
PVC and sent them for analysis to an independent laboratory in
Germany. The results showed that the toys contained levels of
toxic phthalic compounds ranging from 20 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, the Greenpeace members Wednesday demonstrated
outside the Greek Health Ministry to demand the withdrawal of the
toys from the markets.

<HEADLINE> Crude Futures Up, Sharp Decline in Crude Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Crude futures posted their
largest gain in months Wednesday in New York after industry data
showed a big decline in U.S. inventories.
</P>
<P>
Crude saw heavy buying after the American Petroleum Institute's
reported late Tuesday that inventories unexpectedly fell by a big
margin.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Energy Department also reported Wednesday a sharp
decline in crude stocks.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of the market, crude for July delivery rose 62
cents to 12.60 U.S. dollars a barrel; July unleaded gasoline rose
0.58 cent to 46.51 cents a gallon; July heating oil rose 0.35 cent
to 37.32 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
But analysts still doubted if oil producers who pledged in
March to cut a total 1.72 million barrels a day from the market
actually met that target.
</P>
<P>
And there is concern that Iraq will soon be able to freely
export oil without having to get the permission of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Futures prices also advanced after the U.S. government stepped
in to support the Japanese yen by selling U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific PC Sales Shift to Stores: Dataquest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Sales of personal computers
through PC stores in Asia increased dramatically in the first
quarter of 1998, according to the U.S. market research firm
Dataquest Inc. based in California.
</P>
<P>
Despite the significant slowdown in PC shipment growth in the
Asia-pacific region, first quarter 1998 PC shipments through the
region's PC stores increased by 53 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
PC shipments through PC stores were just below 496,000 units
for the first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
One of the market pressures resulting from the regional
economic crisis is the overall demand shift to a higher proportion
of lower-end systems. The home and small business sectors have
registered slightly higher demand growth than other end-user
segments.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said that China is the leading contributor to the
growth in PC retail shipments in the region, with an 88 percent
increase in home market PC volume over the first quarter of 1997.
China accounted for 28 percent of the first quarter 1998 PC volume
through PC stores in Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth in regional demand for PCs from PC store
retailers is a direct reflection of the degree of home and small
office consumption in the markets like China, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
In another report, Dataquest said that the fast-growing Chinese
video compact disc (VCD) player production market is projected to
reach 14.5 million units in 1998, sustaining a 26 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
China's VCD-player demand will surge 17.4 percent on an annual
basis to reach 13.5 million units in 1998 and another 5.1 percent
in 1999 to 14.2 million units. The growth trend will decline in
2000 when digital video/versatile disc (DVD) players are projected
to dominate, according to Dataquest.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Continue Mediation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he will continue making efforts
to resume negotiations between the leaders of the two communities
in Cyprus, his spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to continue to explore possibilities that may lead to
a new momentum, my special adviser on Cyprus intends to visit the
island in the coming weeks," Annan was quoted as saying in his
latest report to the Security Council on his mission of good
offices in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that in the last six months he and his
special adviser have tried to make the necessary arrangements for
the continuing and sustained process of direct negotiations
between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, all these efforts so far have not proved
sufficient to lead to a resumption of the process.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he strongly hopes that all parties involved will
abstain from any action which could further exacerbate tensions.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Leader Expects Resumption of Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq
al-Hariri said Wednesday that peace talks between Israel on the
one side and Lebanon and Syria on the other are expected to resume
within several weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give you details but I can say that I am confident
that something will happen in the next few weeks on the
Lebanese-Syrian track," the prime minister told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll see the Americans moving towards something on the
Lebanese-Syrian track. Let's wait and see because there are steps
based on many things that may happen before," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri declined to elaborate on what he expected but he linked
it to his prediction that agreement with Israel was possible in
three months, if Israel resumes negotiations where they left off.
</P>
<P>
He made the prediction Tuesday after his meeting with President
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
Washington. Israel responded Wednesday by insisting that
negotiations should be "unconditional" -- a word Hariri
interpreted as meaning Israel wants to start the talks from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
"As for the Syrians and the Lebanese, we are ready to fulfill
an agreement in three months' time if Israel continues the
negotiations. Everyone was interested in what we said yesterday. I
believe that something might move very quickly," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister repeated Labanon's dismissal of Israel's
offer to withdraw from south Lebanon if the Lebanese government
gives it some security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon says the U.N. Security Council has already demanded an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal and that Israel is in no position
to set conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Either Israel withdraws from our territory unconditionally,
or, if Israel wants to have a different relationship that the one
we have now, it has to continue the peace process and we are ready
for that also," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vieri's Double Lifts Italy to 3-0 Win over Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTPELLIER, France, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A double from Christian
Vieri lifted Italy to a 3-0 victory over 10-men Cameroon in group B in
the World Cup finals here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italy led the first half 1-0 on a goal from Luigi Di Biagio after
eight minutes when the AS Roma midfielder headed home a pass from
Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon was reduced to 10 men after Raymond Kalla Nkongo was given
the marching order in the 45th minute by Australian referee Edward
Lennie.
</P>
<P>
But the Indomitable Lions from the African continent rallied
strongly in the second half, almost equalizing with long-range blasts
from Joseph Job of French side Olympique Lyon and Patrick Mboma of
Japan's Gamba Osaka.
</P>
<P>
Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero made his first appearance in
the competition when he replaced Roberto Baggio in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
He proved his value 10 minutes later, breaking off from the center
before feeding a ball to Vieri on the right to score.
</P>
<P>
Athletic Madrid forward Vieri was on target in the 89th minute,
this time slotting the ball home from in the area.
</P>
<P>
Vieri now tied Chile's Marcelo Salas for the leading scorer with
three goals.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Surge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street surged
Wednesday on efforts of the U.S. and Japanese governments to prop
up the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States began to sell dollars to
support the slumping Japanese yen for the first time since
February 1992. Japan, meantime, pledged to accelerate efforts to
revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point up 227.19 points
in heavy trading, finished the day with a rebounding of 164.17 at
8,829.46.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 19.55 to 1,107.14, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 23.29 to 1,776.41.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a more than 2 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 721.08 million
shares as against 658.46 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index gained 9.73 to 568.65, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index advanced 6.61 to 695.27.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.71 to 444.08.
</P>
<P>
Added to Tuesday's 37-point gain, Wednesday's rally made a big
dent toward wiping out a 207-point plunge Monday, when fears were
rising that Japan's recession would delay the recovery of other
Asian economies and hurt U.S. corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street actually followed a returning of Asian markets,
where major markets jumped remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market got a lift from the efforts of the two
countries.
