SINGAPORE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said here on Saturday night that regional economies
would grow at a rate of four to six percent in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local community event, Goh said the Southeast
Asian region would grow again after two to four years of painful
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not as vigorously as before, but growth rates of about
four to six percent per annum are certainly possible in the medium
term," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident of this because the region has many strong
points like a hard-working population, high saving rate, rich
resources and good cooperation between the countries," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
As for Singapore, he said the country must live with slower
economic growth and lower wage increases over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore caught the current bout of "the Asian flu,"
but had not fallen terribly sick.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the Singapore dollar went down by some 11
percent against the U.S. dollar and Singapore stock index lost
about 16 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But this was low compared to Singapore's neighbors, all thanks
to a strong immune system, he said, adding that Singapore had got
its fundamentals right, such as savings and investment in people
and worthy projects.

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks Mideast Parties to Cooperate with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan on Saturday called on all the concerned parties
in the Middle East to cooperate with the United States to revive
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a new conference at Naqoura near the
Lebanese-Israeli border, where U.N. peacekeeping force Unifil is
headquartered, Annan said he has discussed with the Lebanese side
the implementation of U.N. resolutions and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he encouraged the concerned parties to cooperate
with the U.S., a co-sponsor of the peace process alongside Russia.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the U.N. Resolution 425 can be implemented, Annan
said that carrying out a resolution needs a plan first, then
concerned parties would hold talks as the second step.
</P>
<P>
He said 20 years have passed since the resolution was adopted
and that some factors for the changes that took place in these
years should be taken into account in the event of implementing
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he will hold talks with Israeli leaders and
listen to what they have in mind on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by the U.N. Security Council after
Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978. It demands an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been defying the resolution and still occupies a
1,200-square-kilometer area, or one tenth of Lebanon's territory,
in the south, allegedly to protect its northern villages and towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Resolution 425, the 4,500-strong Unifil was
established in 1978 to make sure the withdrawal of Israeli troops
and assist Lebanese government to restore its authority in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel recently announced it intends to comply with the
resolution and pull back from south Lebanon if security
arrangements can be worked out with Lebanese government. Lebanon
rejected the conditional offer, saying the resolution calls for
unconditional withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters he would also raise the issue of Lebanese
detainees in Israel jails during his talks with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Beirut on the third leg of his Middle East
tour Friday, Annan was greeted by a crowd of Lebanese women whose
sons and husbands are imprisoned by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He promised he would press Israel to allow the International
Committee of Red Cross to visit those Lebanese detainees.
</P>
<P>
Some 210 Lebanese are jailed by Israel either because of their
refusal to collaborate with Israeli occupation forces or because
of having connection with Hezbollah, or Party of God, Lebanon's
leading resistance force.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to return to from Naqoura and meet with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi here Saturday afternoon, and leave
for Syria in the evening to continue his regional tour.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Jordan and Egypt, and will travel to Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas after Syria.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Investigation Into Smear Plot to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean ruling National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) said Saturday the investigation
into an alleged smear plot against President Kim Dae-jung during
his presidential campaign will continue.
</P>
<P>
NCNP spoke following the attempted suicide of Kwon Young-hae,
former director of the Agency for National Security Planning.
</P>
<P>
Kwon Young-hae tried to disembowel himself with a blade which
he brought with him to the restroom in a prosecution office around
4:30 a.m. Saturday. He was being questioned on the alleged charge
that he masterminded a smear campaign against Kim Dae-jung in the
presidential race last December.
</P>
<P>
NCNP's coalition partner, the United Liberal Democrats,
expressed concern over the possibility that the attempted suicide
will adversely influence the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Grand National Party (GNP) called for
continued investigation regardless of the suicide attempt. It said
the incident was a national mishap. The New Party for the People
hoped the truth would be revealed to the public to prevent a
similar incident from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
Local media said some GNP lawmakers were involved in the smear
plot by former intelligence officials, who made use of a letter
sent to Kim Dae-jung by a South Korean defector to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. The defector once served as Kim's
advisor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the GNP, which enjoys 163 seat of the
299-member National Assembly, said the investigation was
political retaliation by the ruling camp against the GNP. The
investigation began just one day after the GNP refused to approve
President Kim Dae-jung's appointment of Kim Jong-pil as prime
minister of the crisis-engulfed country.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Visits UAE To Mend Fences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani arrived here on Saturday on a fence-mending trip
to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sheikh Hamad will hold talks with UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on "ways of further
boosting bilateral relations," UAE's official Wam news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also focus on the Middle East peace process,
Arab unity and the situations in Iraq, the Wam said.
</P>
<P>
This is Hamad's first visit to the UAE since he took power in
June 1995 after ousting his father Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad
al-Thani in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Qatar and the UAE became tense after Abu
Dhabi granted shelter to Sheikh Khalifa and boycotted the Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference held last December in
Doha.
</P>
<P>
The deposed Qatari ruler currently stays in Europe. Qatari
officials say he is welcome to return home, but only as the
"father" of all Qataris.

<HEADLINE> Pope Begins Visit to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Catholic Pontiff, Pope John
Paul II arrived in the Nigerian capital Abuja at about 2:40
Saturday afternoon, beginning his three-day visit to this largest
black African country.
</P>
<P>
As the 77-year-old Pope got down from his special plane, he
was received by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha and a
group of cabinet ministers, all in their national costumes.
</P>
<P>
After a 21-gun solute, the Pope was greeted by Catholic
archbishops and bishops in Nigeria and the diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of brightly-dressed Nigerians gathering at the
international airport kept singing and dancing to display their
jubilation at the Pope's arrival.
</P>
<P>
The chanting of "I love you, I love you" could be heard from
the crowd almost all the way through the grand reception
broadcast live nationwide by the Nigerian Television Authority.
</P>
<P>
In his brief address at the airport, Abacha said all
Nigerians, regardless of their religious beliefs, warmly welcome
the visit of the Pope to the country.
</P>
<P>
The head of state, a Moslem himself, expressed his hope that
the visit would help build a stable, prosperous and religiously
harmonious Nigeria, particularly at the crucial stage of the
military government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Abacha promised that the Nigerian government and people would
firmly support the global campaign initiated by the Pope against
injustice, poverty, dictatorship and irregular capitalism.
</P>
<P>
The Pope, said to be radiating love, spoke in favor of the
Nigerian government as he talked about Nigeria's contribution in
bringing peace back to Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In his address, he also reiterated what he has advocated the
solution to conflict through dialogue and the promotion of
justice and human rights.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to Nigeria by the Pope. During his
last visit between February 12 and 17, 1982, he visited four
major cities of the country, including the then national capital
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
It is also the 13th visit to Africa since he became Pope and
his 82nd visit abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Papal visit has put the country's Catholic faithful, and
the Muslim community as well, into joy.
</P>
<P>
"He is going to recharge our spiritual battery," said Anthony
Olubumni Okogie, the Catholic archbishop of Lagos, adding, "Pope
John Paul's visit is a blessing to this country, especially at
this point in time."
</P>
<P>
Reverend Father George Ehusani, the Catholic Secretariat's
deputy secretary-general, even described the Pope as "a messenger
of reconciliation" whose coming "would usher in hope for our
troubled country".
</P>
<P>
The five million members of the Catholic community, together
with their other Christian brothers in Nigeria, would be excited
at his second visit, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pope's visit, according to some observers, will not only
boost Nigeria's image, but will go a long way in shoring up
confidence among the country's leadership.
</P>
<P>
That explains why the Nigerian has put so much weight on the
preparations for the Papal visit.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had announced several days before the Pope's arrival
adequate security and special ambulance arrangements for the
Papal visit.
</P>
<P>
The Pope is expected to pay a courtesy visit to Abacha later
Saturday afternoon and will leave Abuja early Sunday for Enugu in
the south enroute Onitsha, where he is billed to conduct a holy
mass and beatification of the late Nigerian Catholic priest Rev.
Father Cyprian Iwene Tansi, who died in Leicester, Britain, in
1964.
</P>
<P>
A meeting with Muslim leaders in Nigeria is scheduled for
Sunday evening when the Pope is back in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
After an open air mass near Abuja and a meeting with members
of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, the Pope will
leave for Rome Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
About 54 bishops in Nigeria and 10 other brother bishops from
Africa are expected to support the team from the Vatican during
the high mass.
</P>
<P>
Between 600 and 700 reverend fathers and priests would also be
assisting his holiness at the Kubwa Praying Ground, where the
Pope is scheduled to officiate before returning to Rome.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa here on Sunday on ways to save the stalled Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Annan told reporters that the talks were
"very useful and fruitful." He hailed the role of Syria as
indispensable in reaching just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been in a standstill for more than a year
due to Israel's hardline policy and its refusal of the principle
of trading land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters when he was greeting Annan at the
Damascus airport on Saturday, al-Sharaa called for a prominent
U.N. role in pushing the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Syria's close, strong and age-old relationship with
the U.N., al-Sharaa said his country fully respects and supports
the world organization, its objectives, principles and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the validity of the land-for-peace formula set in
the Madrid Mideast peace conference, and that Israel should not be
allowed to evade its commitments.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Marks World Water Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Minister of Agriculture,
Natural Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous Sunday
called for saving water to solve the water shortage problem of the
eastern Mediterranean island nation.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous made the call on the occasion of the World Water
Day, which falls on March 22. He said Cyprus is facing a drought
for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation as "drastic," he said the government
will adopt measures aiming at saving water.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which mainly relies on rainfall for its water supply,
is now suffering from the worst drought in history.
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment by the Water Development
Department, all reservoirs on the island now hold only 12.2
percent of their capacity, with a mere 33 million cubic meters of
water.
</P>
<P>
Dam inflow from rainfall runoff totaled only 12.7 million
cubic meters this year, compared to a 10-year average annual
inflow of 87 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody should realize that water is scarce not only in
Cyprus but in many countries of the world, and we have an
obligation to manage it carefully and exert every effort to save
water," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A seminar entitled "The Water Situation in Cyprus" will be
held here on Monday to mark the World Water Day in a bid to spark
public interest in saving water.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The real estate sector in east
China's Fujian Province has enjoyed steady development supported
by the soft landing of the nation's economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show an upsurge in the province's real estate market
since the first half of 1997, with investments for January and
February this year reaching 2.6 billion yuan, up 8.3 percent on
the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Fujian recorded a significant 19.9 percent rise in completed
building space in 1997, with unit sales growing by 51.7 percent
and actual sales income by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residential housing has attracted an increasing share of
Fujian's real estate investments.
</P>
<P>
The province pumped 7.9 billion yuan into housing construction
and completed floor space covering 4.53 million sq.m. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Housing floor space sold in 1997 hit a record 4.13 million
sq.m., up 51.7 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, last year's financial crisis in Southeast Asia has led
to falling investments from foreign real estate developers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Wants to Raise Garment Quotas to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Efforts are being made to have
Bangladesh's quotas of garment exports to the United States
increased by an additional 30 percent, the head of the Bangladesh
Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BGMEA President Mostafa Golam Quddus told a press briefing that
the association would meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed soon to brief them about the
efforts made by a BGMEA team during a recent visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said the BGMEA would seek the help of the prime minister
regarding the case of garments exports quota increases.
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S. visit as successful, he said the U.S.
wanted Bangladesh's commitment to free economy, political
stability and child labor-free in the garment industry as a
prerequisite for increasing the garment quotas.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had already fulfilled all the preconditions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government was expected to formally propose to
the U.S. government for the quota increase within the next one
month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's garment industry, which contributes about 70
percent of the country's export earnings, employs some 1.4 million
workers, generating the most job opportunities in the country,
according to recently released figures.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,600 garment factories in Bangladesh and they
are mainly located in the capital Dhaka, Narayanganj, a city some
20 km south of the capital, and Chittagong in the southeast of the
country, according to BGMEA officials.
</P>
<P>
Most of the garments produced in Bangladesh are exported to
North America and Europe, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 fiscal year which ended on June 30, 1997, the
garment industry earned some 3.4 billion U.S. dollars out of the
country's total export earnings of 4.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Police Seize Huge Bomb in Irish Town Near N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Security forces in the Irish
republic Sunday found a 590 kg bomb and arrested two men for
questioning, British police confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The huge bomb was discovered in a garage near Dundalk, a town
24 kilometers south of the frontier with Northern Ireland, police
said. The security sources believe it was destined for use in
Northern Ireland by republican guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest security success by Irish forces on alert
against dissidents who are hostile to peace efforts in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Security sources suspect a republican splinter group, probably
the Continuity IRA was preparing to transport the bomb to the
British-ruled Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Continuity IRA opposes a cease-fire called last July by the
powerful Irish Republican Army, which has fought a violent
campaign against British sovereignty for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Two Continuity IRA guerrillas threw a five-pound bomb in a
crowded bank in Londonderry city last Friday but it failed to
explode.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks are under way in Northern Ireland but the province
has been tense after bombings and killings by dissidents on both
sides of the sectarian divide who oppose negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Plane Overshoots Runway, Three Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were killed
and some 30 others injured Sunday night when a Philippine Airlines
(PAL) Airbus 300 overshot a runway on landing in Bacolod City in
the central Philippines, a Manila radio station said.
</P>
<P>
Three residents on the ground were killed when the plane
overshot the runway and plowed into a residential neighborhood in
Bacolod City, capital of Negros Occidental province, the
Manila-based private-run DZMM said.
</P>
<P>
The radio station, reporting on the scene, said the injured
were taken to three hospitals near the city, some 500 km southeast
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from Manila, was carrying more than
121 passengers and six crew members, it said.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers onboard the flight were evacuated and
firefighters doused the aircraft with foam to keep off the
leaking fuel.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Flight 137 was scheduled to land at 7:40
p.m. local time but crashed shortly before landing.
</P>
<P>
The plane struck several buildings and a portion of one of its
wings was flung into a nearby highway.
</P>
<P>
The accident came just six weeks after a DC-9 passenger plane
owned by the Cebu Pacific Airways slammed into a mountain in the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao when preparing to land in a
nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
None of the 99 passengers and five crew aboard the DC-9 plane
survived the country's worst air disaster.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have so far failed to determine the cause of the
DC-9 air tragedy. All the other eight aging DC-9 planes of the
Cebu Pacific Airways had been grounded following the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern China Placing Economic Hopes in "Golden Triangle" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China expects to invest heavily
by the end of the century in the southwest in an area known as the
"Golden Triangle" because of its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Lu Liangshu, deputy head of the Chinese Engineering Academy,
told a recent symposium here that the triangle can play a unique
role in the economic growth of three provinces and act as a
resource base to develop the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze and Pearl rivers.
</P>
<P>
The "Golden Triangle" consists of a 250,000-sq.km. area in the
provinces of Yunan, Guizhou and Sichuan. Lu says it is a piece of
valuable land for high-yield, high-quality agriculture, and the
government has started tapping its potential.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to spend 10 billion yuan on the Guizhou
part of the triangle to add 1.97 million tons of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
The part in Sichuan will become another large "grain basket"
after low-yield fields are converted and a grain center built.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan part, which covers a third of the province, will be
used for a tropical food center, producing half the province's
meat, grain, vegetables, and tobacco, and 80 percent of its
flowers and plants.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U. S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Congress's decision last week to go on an election year
highway spending spree underscores the limits of last year's
balanced budget agreement in dictating long-term spending and tax
policy. While the bipartisan budget deal imposed spending ceilings
and limits on tax cuts, lawmakers and the administration are
proving adept at finding ways around them.
</P>
<P>
-- Pentagon efforts to speed into operation antimissile weapons
inspired by President Ronald Reagon's "Star Wars" proposal are
marred by poor planning, insufficient testing and political
pressure bo hasten inauguration of the defensive systems,
according to an independent panel appointed by the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- When President Bill Clinton begins a 12-day trip to
sub-Saharan Africa Sunday, he will be visiting a region very
different from the one last visited by an American President 20
years ago. Apartheid is gone in South Africa, economic reform has
swept the continent and more countries are electing their
governments. The President's trip is a tribute to the growing
influence on foreign policy of 34 million African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
-- As Iraq and the United Nations position themselves for a
critical test of the agreement that averted an American military
attack in February, the head of the commission disarming Iraq says
that he plans rapid-fire inspections of previously off-limits
Presidential properties to determine what buildings will get spot
inspections later -- with much less notice.

southwestern China, are estimated at 241.9 billion tons, and it
has 51 billion tons in proven reserves, or more than the combined
total of 12 southern provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Four of Guizhou's ten major projects are in energy and
infrastructure and are in the Golden Triangle near the city of
Liupanshui, that boasts most of the province's coal reserves,
according to Yang Jinghua, a provincial official in charge of
investment.
</P>
<P>
Liupanshui has 36 billion tons of proven coal reserves and is
one of China's ten biggest producers, with an annual output of 20
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Water resources in the triangle make up 11 percent of China's
total and the government has decided to give priority to the Ertan
Hydro-electric Power Station in Sichuan and to spend 34.4 billion
yuan on it.
</P>
<P>
Yunan plans to build two large hydro-electric power stations at
the beginning of the next century, with a 14.4 million kw and 7.2
million kw capacity.
</P>
<P>
Highways and railways will also be important to the triangle's
development. Yunnan expects to build a 360-km expressway and a
railway from Liupanshui to Zhuzhou in nearby Hunan, to help
increase coal sales outside.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway, between the capitals of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan province, which
started operating at the end of last year, will also contribute to
the triangle's development.

<HEADLINE> Minister of Water Resources on Resource Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Water Resources Niu
Maosheng has called for the general public to gain a greater
awareness of the dangers of flooding, use water in accordance with
the law, and protect, explore and use water resources.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum marking the Sixth World Water Day today, Niu
said the Chinese government has always attached great importance
to the sustainable use of water resources which are vital for
economic and social developments, as well as for the future of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Annual publicity activities such as the World Water Day and the
Water Week of China are designed to acquaint the people with the
importance of water resources and enhance their awareness of the
need for the protection of them, according to Niu.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has dedicated massive manpower and
earmarked substantial funding to harness major rivers and lakes
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949. Remarkable achievements scored in related efforts have been
accompanied by the adoption of the Water Law and numerous related
regulations, said Niu.
</P>
<P>
The country's current water supply capacity stands at 520 billion
cu.m., with the annual growth rate standing at 1.4 percent, said
Niu, adding that the aforementioned levels have paved the way for
realization of an annual national economic growth rate of nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
Niu noted that perennial flooding and water shortages require
that related departments introduce more water conservancy projects
and remain vigilant during periods of flooding and droughts in
order to coordinate development of the population and resources, as
well as the environment and economy.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Hyundai Unveils New Memory Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Hyundai Electronics
Industries announced Sunday it has developed two new memory
chips, the world's fastest 2-megabyte SRAM and its first embedded
memory capable of recognizing voice and letters.
</P>
<P>
The new SRAM (Static Random Access Memory), about one third the
size of an ordinary SRAM, features a data access time of 55
nanoseconds, four times faster than the 200 to 300 nanoseconds of
existing products.
</P>
<P>
The new SRAM, which is based on a 0.33-micron process
technology, is fit for small-sized mobile communications devices
such as cellular phones and portable PCs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company, together with Harvard University, has
also developed a 16-megabit DRAM chip embedded with a central
processing unit which can recognize voice and letters.
</P>
<P>
The new chip can exchange data between the CPU and the memory
at rates to 12.8 gigabits per second, 80 times faster than that
between a separated CPU and a memory.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Develop 21st Century Space Exploration Vehicles (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese space scientist said
recently that China will strive to develop large launch
vehicles to meet the requirements of deep space exploration and
manned space flight.
</P>
<P>
"China must strive to produce space vehicles at the earliest
possible date in order to keep pace with the international trends in
the development of space technology and accommodate the launch of
larger communications satellites," said Xu Dazhe,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology
(CALVT).
</P>
<P>
Xu made the remarks at the international meeting of space
scientists held here last week.
</P>
<P>
He said that further development will enable China to carry out
expanded exploratory missions in the space in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The current task of China centers on increasing the low earth
orbit (LEO) payload capacity of existing launch vehicles to 15
tons, and on developing a new generation of more powerful launch
vehicles with a LEO payload capacity of over 20 tons," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
"China will develop manned launch vehicles in order to reach
advanced international levels for space technology and establish a
solid foundation for deep space exploration.
</P>
<P>
"Launch vehicles with a payload capacity of over 10 tons can,
in fact, carry astronauts into orbit. However, the capacity will
have to be increased to 20 tons or more for deep space
exploration, including lunar and planetary explorations."

<P>
Informed sources point out that the LEO capacity of the Long
March (LM) series of launch rockets has grown dramatically from a
mere 300 kg to some 11 tons.
</P>
<P>
China will extend great efforts to make major breakthroughs in
manned space flight technology by the year 2000, according to the
China Aerospace Corporation (CASC), which has established a
complete system for research, design, development, production and
testing for various space products.
</P>
<P>
CASC has 10,000-odd research scientists and ranks amongst the
world's leading space industries in various main areas of space
technology.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has developed a relatively complete series
of launch vehicles in the past 40 years has provided a "solid
basis for future development," said Xu, adding preparations for
space projects in the 21st century will center on improving the
reliability, safety and mission adaptability of the Long March
series, in addition to reducing costs.
</P>
<P>
"We will improve the launch success rate of the LM launch
vehicles by adopting improved reliability analysis, quality
control, manufacturing inspections, preflight checkout and
prelaunch condition monitoring systems," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
The CALVT, which employs over 27,000 researchers and engineers,
developed the LM launch vehicle series, which had successfully
placed into orbit over 40 satellites, including 13 foreign
satellites, by the end of 1997. The resounding success rate
elevated China's launch vehicle technology to advanced world
levels.

<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The first genetic map of the
British Isles has revealed that English, Scottish and Welsh are
biologically similar, united by common DNA that dates back to the
Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
According to a research made by scientists from the Institute
of Molecular Medicine at Oxford University, most Britons should
trace their genetic ancestry back more than 24,000 years to Stone
Age settlers, not as many think, to more recent foreign invaders
such as Celts or Normans.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said their research also shows that foreign
invaders barely had any impact on the British gene pool, The
Sunday Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The researchers profiled 6,000 people and compared their blood
samples with DNA extracted from the remains of the Stone Age
people.
</P>
<P>
They discovered that 99 percent can trace their origins directly
back to the Britons who populated the fertile wooded valleys carved
out by Ice Age glaciers, when Britain was still joined to the
European mainland.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial city,
Shanghai, has developed an environmental protection strategy tied
to its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shuping, head of the city's Environmental Protection Bureau,
told an international environmental protection forum that the city
will make a great effort to improve the environment and become an
international city, with emphasis on controlling the main
pollutants: sulphur dioxide, noise, and dust.
</P>
<P>
Companies that discharge toxic wastes will be required to clean
up their production and waste disposal and be in line with
standards this year. By the year 2000, all companies will be
expected to meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
The city's chemical, metallurgical, textile, and medicine
industries now have cleaner production methods.
</P>
<P>
Lu says that the city is set to spend three percent of its GDP
on enviromental protection for the remainder of this century,
meaning spending 8 billion yuan annually on environmental
improvements, mainly on water, air, and solid waste pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River, a tributary of the Huangpu River that is an
important passage to inland areas is especially important and is
expected to be cleaned up by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The city is increasing residents' awareness of the need for
environmental protection and has improved laws and regulations. It
will also continue to cooperate with other countries and
international organizations in environmental protection, Lu says.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Rebuffs U.S. Senate Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi parliament on Sunday
rebuffed a U.S. Senate resolution which calls for trial of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on charges of committing war crimes,
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
After a session of the National Assembly (Parliament), the
Chairman of Legal and Administrative Affairs Committee Sultan
Al-Shawi said that the aim of the resolution, adopted earlier this
month, is to influence American and world public opinion and to
defame Iraq and its government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shawi said that the U.S. Senate resolution came after the
American Administration failed in taking advantage of the recent
Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection, while Iraq succeeded in
conducting it diplomatically, according to INA.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz signed here last month an agreement on
peacefully ending the U.N.-Iraq crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a counter move, a report prepared by the committee was
discussed during the session, calling for trying both Former
U.S. President George Bush and the present president Bill Clinton
on charges of using internationally banned weapons against Iraq,
subjecting Iraqi prisoners of war to torture and continuing
obstructing the initiatives designed to get the embargo on the
Iraqi people lifted.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also decided to constitute a people's commission
to call for trial of Bush and Clinton, as well as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, before a U.N. tribunal on charges of committing
mass-killing crimes against the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Merchants Set Up China's Early Finance Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Merchants in China's northern
Shanxi Province were responsible for creating financial businesses
several hundred years ago, according to Kong Xiangyi, a professor
with the Shanxi University of Finance and Economics.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried in the Financial Times, Kong pointed out
that Shanxi merchants were running pawn shops, private banks and
accounting offices and were quite influential in China's Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Their creations included the system of separating capital
ownership from management, a currency exchange market, bill
discounting, traveler's checks and bank mortgages, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Kong's study also challenges the origin of China's account
transfer business that was recorded in 1890 in Shanghai. He said
the business had become popular among Shanxi merchants long before
that date.
</P>
<P>
Kong said the Shanxi merchants who dealt with currency business
had set up financial institutions specifically for cashing money
at different places in the Ming and Qing dynasties.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the currency trade in Shanxi, many
merchants expanded their business to other parts of China and even
overseas, in addition to establishing various financial
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
To coordinate the financial trade, they also formed such bodies
as guild and regional associations, which were regarded as the
embryo for China's central bank in early times, Kong said.

</P>
<P>
Arab countries, including Egypt, have criticized Ankara for
strengthening military ties with Israel and betraying the interest

</P>
<P>
The Arabs also have voiced apprehensions over Turkey's joint
maneuvers with the U.S. and Israel in eastern Mediterranean in
January and its decision to give Israel two contracts to upgrade
Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister, after meeting twice with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on Saturday evening, told reporters that
Ankara is not developing an alliance with Israel and their
relationship is not strategic.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official visit to Egypt by a Turkish foreign
minister since December 1993 and the highest-level one since
President Demirel visited Egypt last September.

Though Tanzania's economy is still underdeveloped, its civil
servants kill nearly half a year on weekends, holidays and tea
breaks, the newspaper quoted the survey as reporting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that for every civil servant, he or she
enjoys about 96 saturdays and sundays, 18 public holidays, a
28-day leave every year, bringing the number of days to about 142
days.
</P>
<P>
Besides these days, civil servants are well-known for spending
at least two hours a day for tea break or other private business,
or totally at least 40 days a year. This brings the total number
of manpower lost each year to 182 days, or nearly half a year.
</P>
<P>
Rugumiyamheto said: "The government has for quite a long time
thought of reversing the decision of compensating public holidays
on weekdays when they fall on Saturdays and Sundays."
</P>
<P>
He said that this issue might be discussed in the next session
of the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Announce More Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim said Sunday that new projections of the
country's economy, fiscal policy, the inflation situation and
import restrictions are among the additional measures he will
announce in parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need additional measures with regard to growth rate,
inflation and also fiscal policy problems in the Budget. Then, we
will stress on imports and exports. We must take a tough stand,"
Anwar, who is also finance minister, told a ruling party
conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also stress the importance of transparency in
the country's administration and tight discipline in the banking
sector at a time when the government was striving to stimulate the
troubled economy and restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time Anwar is going to announce
additional measures since tabling the 1998 Budget in parliament
last October.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Anwar announced a downward revision of the
country's growth projections for this year from seven percent to
between four and five percent, a slashing of the government's
expenditure by 18 percent and deferment of lumpy imports like
ships and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said he would announce more tougher measures on Tuesday to
deal with imports and exports as the two sectors had an impact on
the current account deficit, balance of payments and trade.
</P>
<P>
"We must control imports. We must only import goods which are
necessary, if not, use local items. They (imports and exports)
have an impact on the country's economic strength. As such, we
cannot take for granted calls to cut down imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imports foodstuffs worth 11 billion ringgit (about
3.018 billion U.S. dollars) a year, with animal feed as the main
component, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was also worried over the imports of
vegetables which amount to 500 million (about 137.18 million U.S.
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar stressed the need for transparency in the country's
administration, saying it was crucial to avoid irregularities and
corruption which could erode the government's credibility and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also called for strict monitoring of bank management to
ensure the sector was disciplined and did not face problems of
cash flow.
</P>
<P>
He said the banking sector should not bow to influential groups
irrespective of whether they were ministers, politicians, groups
linked to leaders or their family members.

<HEADLINE> East Tanzania Port Utilization Capacity Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The decrease of coffee and
sisal production in Tanzania has forced the utilization capacity
of the Tanga port in the east to drop by almost a half.
</P>
<P>
The port at present handles 250,000 tonnes of goods annually,
against 500,000 tonnes annually in the past few years, the
Principal Marketing Officer Mohammed Said told the Sunday
Observer.
</P>
<P>
Said admitted that the closure of some businesses like
Tanzania Fertilizer Company and CIC Textiles Mills in the Tanga
Region has also impaired the port business as few vessels are
using the port, which is one of the two major coastal ports in
the east African country together with the Dar es Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
On the sisal production decline, he said that in the 1970s the
cargo exported through the port were as high as 250,000 tonnes
and it dropped down to 35,000 tonnes in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more than 16,000 tonnes were exported through the
port, while in 1995 the figure was as low as 8,600 tonnes.
Exports in 1994 and 1993 were 7,540 and 4,023 tonnes
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for coffee, he said in 1996 and 1995, 53,642 tonnes and
24,172 tonnes were exported respectively, while in 1994 and 1993,
exports through the port were 29,470 and 42,518 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino-charged rains are also to blame for the decreased
coffee production which has caused a sharp decline of the cargo
going through the port.
</P>
<P>
To help the port business pick up, the official said, the
Tanzania Harbor Authority has decided to establish a marketing
department to open up new markets and boost business at the port.
</P>
<P>
Said named two companies which have shown interest in
exporting their cargo through the port, Fish Exporter in Kenya
and the World Food Program Relief Cargo.
</P>
<P>
The revival of the Tanga sisal plantation may also help to
revive the port's activities.
</P>
<P>
Sisal was first introduced into Tanganyika by Germans in 1892
from Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Interntional Cooperation Benefits Electronics Sector in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The electronics sector in east
China's Shandong Province has been improving its cooperation with
overseas companies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province established more than 30
electronics joint ventures in 1997, with a total investment of 67
million U.S. dollars and an export value of 160 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between local enterprises and foreign investors
such as Panasonic, Casio and Bell has been on track, said Sun
Zhihen, an official of the province's electronics bureau.
</P>
<P>
For example, Hisense, a local television set manufacturer, has
benefited from its cooperation with Sanyo and Toshiba and become a
nationwide TV manufacturer, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong sent eight delegations to Germany, Canada and the
United States last year to develop its relations with world-famous
electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the province's electronics sector generated
an industrial output value of 21.6 billion yuan, 20 percent above
the national average.
</P>
<P>
Shandong also expects to sell some ailing state-owned
electronics firms and list some profitable ones on overseas stock
markets, Sun added.

<HEADLINE> Yamaha Talent Scores Stunning Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yamaha charger Noriyuki Haga
scored a stunning victory with only seven-hundredths of a second
short of Honda's Aaron Slight in the second of Sunday's two 22-lap
races in the opening round of the Superbike World Championship at
Phillip Island in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Haga's win gave him a share of the championship lead with twice
world champion Briton Carl Fogarty.
</P>
<P>
Fogarty won the opening heat by 1.040s from Australian Troy
Corser, the two Ducati riders holding off a spirited charge from
Haga in the closing laps.
</P>
<P>
However, in race two both Fogarty and Corser suffered traction
problems after choosing the wrong compound rear tyres, fading to
third and sixth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Haga, the 23-year-old reigning Japanese superbike champion, had
two incident-packed heats in his first full season of world
championship racing, colliding a number of times in race one in
Australian Suzuki rider Peter Goddard.
</P>
<P>
Goddard's race ended on lap 12 when he crashed out of second
place while trying to hold Haga at bay.
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling quite comfortable but a big gust of wind hit the
bike and I ran wide, hit a little dip in the track, and the front
tyre let go," said Goddard.
</P>
<P>
Slight had an opportunity to turn the tables on Haga in race
two, but had to settle for second place, albeit by 0.071s.
</P>
<P>
Goddard made up for his disappointment with a fighting fourth
place in race two, getting the better of Kawaski rider Akira
Yamagawa by 0.015s.
</P>
<P>
Haga and Fogarty now head to round two of the championship at
Britain's Donington Park on April 13 tied for the lead on 41
points, with Corser third on 30 points and Slight 27.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Transfer Property Rights of State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will continue to transfer property rights and operation
rights of state-owned enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are encouraged to participate in the
transfer of property or operation rights, said Guo Tingbiao,
executive deputy governor of Liaoning, at a recent forum organized
to discuss ways of restructuring the state-owned enterprises and
transferring property and operation rights.
</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by a group of diplomats of foreign
consulates in Shenyang, the provincial capital, and
representatives of overseas business organizations to Liaoning, as
well as foreign managing officers of some overseas-financed
enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's oldest industrial centers, Liaoning now has
one-tenth of the nation's large- and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, with the public sector making up 78 percent of the
province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that Liaoning would practice a strategy of exercising
tight controls over influential state-owned enterprises while
loosening its grip of smaller firms in reforming the structure.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 selected large state-owned enterprises and
enterprises groups in the province will be operated by exclusive
state investment or with the state having controlling shares.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, property and operation rights for large
state-owned enterprises of minor importance will be transferred by
way of contracting, leases and trusteeship, and there will be no
limitations for state shares or for shares owned by other
investors from home and abroad, said the deputy governor.

<HEADLINE> Pope Asks Nigeria to Free Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pope John Paul II has
asked the Nigerian military government to free 60 political
detainees, local media reports said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the British Broadcasting Corporation as
saying that a list of 60 political detainees was handed over to
the Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi by an official on the
entourage of the Pope.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II arrived in Nigerian capital Abuja on
Saturday afternoon for his second visit to this largest black
African country since 1982.
</P>
<P>
He was welcomed at the airport by the Nigerian Head of State,
General Sani Abacha, and a host of government officials and
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, General Abacha noted that the Pope's
visit has come at a very critical moment in the military
government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the program would "usher in a new era of
stability and sustainable development in our country."
</P>
<P>
Abacha promised that the Nigerian government and people would
firmly support the global campaign initiated by the Pope against
injustice, poverty, dictatorship and capitalism without
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The Pope said in response that he has come to Nigeria "as a
friend, as one who is deeply concerned for the destiny of your
country and of Africa as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his visit is mainly a pastoral one, the main
purpose of which is for the beatification of Father Cyprian
Michael Iwene Tansi, the first Nigerian in the Church's history
to be officially proclaimed blessed.
</P>
<P>
He did, however, call on the Nigerians to work for the
building of a society that respects all its members in their
dignity, their rights and their freedoms through reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
After the welcoming ceremony at the airport, the Pope then
held close-door talks with General Abacha at the presidential
villa. The talks lasted about 40 minutes, but the content is not
known yet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Saturday to journalists at the airport, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Ikimi said that the Pope has made more than 80
similar visits worldwide and is noted for not interfering in the
internal affairs of those nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pope's visit is an indication of Nigeria's
stability as against the standpoint of some detractors.
</P>
<P>
The Pope is expected to leave Abuja early Sunday for Enugu in
the south en route to Onitsha, where he is scheduled to preside a
holy mass and the beatification of late Father Tansi, who died in
Leicester, Britain, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
A meeting with Muslim leaders in Nigeria is scheduled for
Sunday evening when the Pope is back in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
After an open air mass near Abuja and a meeting with members
of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, the Pope will
leave for Rome on Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Police Baffle Plot to Bomb World Cup </HEADLINE>

LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Police have discovered a plot by
Islamic extremists to mount a bombing campaign against this
summer's World Cup Soccer Finals in France, Britain's Sunday Times
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said World Cup brochures and a large quantity of
liquid explosives were recovered when Belgian police arrested
seven suspected members of an Algerian guerrilla group during the
raids in Brussels early this month.
</P>
<P>
The article echoes a report carried in the French newpaper Le
Parisien, which said detonators, chemicals and documents pointing
to the World Cup finals as a possible target were found in the
Brussels raids.
</P>
<P>
Belgian prosecutors said they were investigating the
possibility that Algerian Islamic militants may have planned a
bomb attack during the World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Police and intelligence officials from seven countries have
been briefed about the findings of the Belgian police.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Finding Ways to Aid Poor in Ethnic Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwestern
China is no longer relying just on government poverty relief and
has proven quite successful in turning to other ways.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology are one favorite method. In 1996, the
province started a poverty relief science and technology project
to train a million farmers to use 100 practical agricultural
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The use of plastic sheeting on nearly 220,000 hectares of
hybrid maize and a potato treatment technique on more than 33,000
hectares, for example, helped provide farmers with more money for
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Small poverty-relief loans are another idea borrowed from
abroad. By last year, 15,602 rural households had received a
one-year loan for as much as 1,000 yuan, improving their lives to
varying degrees. The province plans to expand the loans to all
poor areas by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some forms of cooperation in poverty relief have also helped
the effort. Ministries like Communications, Railways, and several
others, as well as 1,600 local departments have put 500 million
yuan into poor areas over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
International organizations like the World Bank and World Food
Program have also helped Yunnan's poverty relief efforts with 126
million US dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
A project is underway to resettle 400,000 poor people, 20,000
of whom have been moved.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has helped 2 million poor people shake off poverty in
the past two years and now still has 4.4 million poor people.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy showed
impressive all-round performance last year while the economies of
some other Asian countries were hit badly by the financial turmoil
in the region, the country's central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the bank showed that exports
rose by 20.7 percent, bringing in a total of 4.49 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 compared to 3.72 billion U.S. dollars the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports earned 3.32 billion dollars, due mainly to
the high performance by the garment sector which saw a 27.6
percent rise to 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports were also up by 14.5 percent to 5.65
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves in January this year saw a marked
increase, reflecting inflows of privatization proceeds and other
capital and an improvement in the current account of the balance
of payments. The reserves of 2.778 billion U.S. dollars were
sufficient to finance 5.3 months of exports.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the total revenue increased by 9.3 percent to
2.39 billion dollars last year while the tax revenue grew by 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, as indicated by the Colombo consumers'
price index, was 9.1 percent in February as against 9.3 percent a
month earlier, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist arrivals rose by 14 percent to 37,000 in
January from 32,700 recorded a year earlier, according to local
press reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) held its first tree planting
carnival in the Victoria Park here on Sunday, which attracted a
crowd of more 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The one-day carnival signaled the start of the annual event
which has been officially set on the last Sunday of March.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the carnival's opening ceremony here on
Sunday were Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
leading officials of the SAR government, officials of the
provisional urban council and provisional regional council and
representatives from SAR's 18 districts.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Zhu Yucheng, Deputy Director of the Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, and Liu Hongxiao, Deputy
Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The carnival, with a theme of "Joining Hands in Greening Our
Hometown Hong Kong," aims at raising the awareness of
environmental protection by the residents, officials of the
carnival's organizing committee said.
</P>
<P>
It worked as part of the on-going tree planting campaign to
cooperate with the popular annual tree planting program organized
by the SAR government's Department of Agriculture and Fishery and
a future corporate tree planting program proposed by the
Department.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 to 40,000 trees had being planted annually through

planting 10,000 trees every year since 1998 through the corporate
program.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Korean Peace Talks: One Hitch After Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The second round of the four-party
talks on implementing a permanent peace on the Korean peninsula
concluded here Saturday with no agreement reached after six days
of talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Xinhua, Chen Jian, Chinese Assistant Foreign
Minister and head of the Chinese delegation to the talks, said
that China, as chairman of this round, had tried its best to
facilitate the on-going peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended with no progress because the U.S. delegation
and the representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) stuck to their positions throughout the round, and no
agreement was reached on the formation of a special working
sub-committee, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the six-day talks bringing together China, the DPRK, the
Republic of Korea and the United States, China, the only country
which maintains formal diplomatic relations with all three other
countries, played a very special role.
</P>
<P>
On all the issues mentioned in the six-day talks, China
maintained no specific stance but a flexible attitude.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason why all other three parties in the
discussions pinned much of their hope on China and raised all
their problems at the meeting for resolution, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
But the three other parties have been hostile for too long and
have no confidence in each other, preventing them from reaching an
agreement, although their topics were wide-ranging and deep-going.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese diplomat told Xinhua that the just concluded round
had experienced three stages:
</P>
<P>
The first problem occurred on the morning of March 16, when the
talks were scheduled to open. the DPRK side objected to the
seating arrangements of the four delegations, and the United
States and South Korea tried to promote high-ranking official
contacts between the two parts of Korea through this round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
In response to a request from the DPRK, China proposed that in
future talks, the three parties, expect the rotating president
country, will be seated according to their alphabetical order of
their countries' names in English. Thus, in every four meetings, the
DPRK will face South Korea and the United States twice each. As a
result, the seating plan will carry no political implications.
</P>
<P>
China also proposed that a half day be set aside for bilateral
contacts, leaving the contact form, time and location to be
decided by any two parties concerned.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Korean Peace Talks: One Hitch After Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The session resumed in the afternoon after the other three
parties agreed to China's proposals. This is the first time the
quadripartite talks, which began last December, moved from the
procedural to the substantial stage. This was one of the results
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of March 17, China held separate consultations
with the U.S., the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, the DPRK insisted that the withdrawal
of U.S. troops from South Korea and a peace treaty between
Washington and Pyongyang be included into the topics. The United
States and South Korea, however, maintained that the talks should
start with the set-up of working groups on confidence-building.
</P>
<P>
The three parties later agreed to China's impasse-breaking
proposals that a sub-committee be established on a provisional
basis to discuss legal matters, long-term arrangements and
confidence-building measures. This was a second achievement of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
At a time when a sub-committee was likely to be formed, the
DPRK and the United States again each put forward a new request.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK questioned under which of the three aspects the
U.S. military presence on the Korean peninsula would be
discussed. The U.S. side, however, refused to single out
U.S. military presence as a separate issue.
</P>
<P>
The great gap between the two sides over the issues made the
six-day, second plenary session of the four-party talks, aimed at
seeking a lasting and stable peace on the peninsula, ended without
agreements on any substantial matters.
</P>
<P>
However, participants of all four parties described the
discussions as helpful. They had an in-depth exchange of views on
substantial issues relating to permanent peace on the Korean
peninsula, and deepened mutual understanding in "a candid, serious
and calm atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to specify, through suitable channels, the
exact date for the third plenary session.
</P>
<P>
In his chairman's statement, Chen said the four-party talks are
inherently a long and difficult process.
</P>
<P>
As long as the four parties continued to adopt a patient, calm
and pragmatic attitude, an approach of gradual progress, and show
mutual respect, the talks will certainly make gradual progress and
a lasting peace will be finally realized on the Korean peninsula,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China, as one of the four parties, will continue
to make positive contribution to the process.

<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) and its rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) exchanged
142 prisoners of war (POWs) in northern Iraq on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A KDP radio reported that 75 PUK POWs were swapped for 67 KDP
POWs in the KDP-controlled regions of Hizala and Koysancak in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said that the two rival parties were satisfied with this
initiative, which may indicate their willingness to work toward
peace.
</P>
<P>
PUK leader Jalal Talabani has sent a letter to KDP Chairman
Massoud Barzani seeking a broad reconciliation in a bid to set up
a permanent peace in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Talabani proposed a high-level meeting between
the two factions to sort out their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two groups agreed on their latest ceasefire, which seems to
be holding, last November after Talabani's forces attacked KDP
positions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two contenders have been fighting for control of northern
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War undermined Baghdad's ability to exert
influence there.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, chief U.N. arms
inspector arrived here Sunday on a four-day mission of inspections
of Iraqi presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, arrived
at Habbaniyah air port, 80 kilometers west of Baghdad, around
noon time.
</P>
<P>
Besides arrangements for inspections of presidential palaces,
Butler will also discuss with Iraqi officials the results of the
Technical Evaluation Meetings held early February and designed to
iron out differences between Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared for many times that it is free of banned
weapons, whereas UNSCOM has insisted that Iraq still conceals
some.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N.-Iraq memorandum of understanding on arms
inspection signed last month by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, a special arms
inspection group will visit the eight Iraqi presidential palaces
suspected of hiding chemical and biological weapons and their
programs.
</P>
<P>
The special group, which comprises senior diplomats appointed
by Annan and experts drawn from UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency, will be headed by Sri Lankan Jayanatha
Dhanapala, who will arrive here also on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Butler and Dhanapala are expected to hold discussions on the
arrangement for inspection of Iraqi presidential palaces.

BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed special envoy
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, Prakash Shah of
India arrived here Sunday to establish his office, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shah was appointed by Annan as his special envoy in Baghdad
early this month amid difficulties arising from time to time in
relations between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Shah's arrival in Baghdad will meet the need for improved
lines of communications between the Iraqi government and the
U.N. chief's office in order to help prevent difficulties from
developing into full fledged crises.
</P>
<P>
Shah, who will establish his office here before the end of this
month, will closely follow all developments relevant to the role
of the United Nations with regard to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"He will lend his support to existing United Nations
activities in the arms control, humanitarian and economic and
social fields while giving special attention to any crisis or
problem which might benefit from intervention by United Nations
Headquarters," Annan said when announcing his appointment early
this month.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Shortage Threatens Health Service In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Poor conditions in public health
institutions have driven Zimbbabwean nurses and doctors to the
private sector and even to neighboring countries, resulting in a
serious shortage of nurses in the public institutions in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The weekly Sunday Mail quoted Zimbabweam Minister of Health
and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps as saying that the shortage of
nurses was being compounded by inadequate funding.
</P>
<P>
''We are operating under very difficult conditions and morale
among our staff is low as a result of the overcrowding in the
hospitals and with poor facilities particularly in the maternity
department,'' said Stamps.
</P>
<P>
The working conditions in the public health institutions had
become so poor that some nursing staff were opting to go into the
private sector where conditions were better, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the newspaper, a critical
shortage of nurses in Zimbabwe threatens to further derail the
country's ailing health delivery system, with about 2,000 nurses
urgently required to fill vacant posts in both public and private
medical centers.
</P>
<P>
But Stamps said that not enough medical practitioners were
being trained to meet community demands, with a few doctors still
leaving the country for greener pastures in neighbouring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, the doctor to patient ratio was very high, Stamps
noted, what is important was to improve the working conditions
especially in the public sector in a bid to attract doctors.

<HEADLINE> 478,000-US-Dollar Fraud Foiled in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A lucrative deal in which the
Central Board of Health (CBH) in Lusaka was nearly swindled out
of more than 478,000 US dollars through a fake document allegedly
to order medicinal drugs from the U.S. has been foiled.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times of Zambia reported that two Citibank
officials have since been suspended in connection with the deal
while police have recorded a warn and caution statement from
another official at the bank.
</P>
<P>
Citibank's Managing Director Sanjeen Anand said that internal
investigations are going on and that the necessary action has
been taken.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot divulge anymore information on the matter because
of customer confidentiality. The matter has been handed over to
police and there are internal investigations being carried out
and of course the necessary action was taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We in Citibank are concerned like any other bank
over the high levels of fraud in the country. But we believe we
have the strongest internal control and that is how we managed to
intercept the whole thing."
</P>
<P>
The deal involved the transfer of 478,126 US dollars from
Citibank in Lusaka to Nations Bank in America on the strength of
a fake letter purportedly from the CBH, the money was in turn to
be paid to pharmaceutical distributors of America allegedly to
order medical drugs.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe has confirmed that the
incident happened early this month.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Urges Reducing Iran's Reliance on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Saturday urged reducing dependence of the country's
economy on oil revenues and orienting it to non-oil incomes, the
official news agency IRNA reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of pilgrims in the holy city Mashhad in
the northeastern province of Khorasan, Khamenei said "the enemy"
of the Islamic Republic is bring down oil prices and impose
sanctions in order to damage Iran's economy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Khamenei said, Iran had been dependent on oil as
the major and only source of its income during the reign of the
late Shah, who was ousted in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader said the nation now needs to follow the
policy that would make it independent from oil revenues and orient
its economy to non-oil incomes through an increase in production,
export of agricultural, industrial items, and expertise services.
</P>
<P>
Only then can oil be used by Iran as an efficient leverage in
international power politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei once again called on the Iranian nation to exercise
economic thrift and refrain from extravagant consumption.
</P>
<P>
In his new year address Friday night, the Iranian leader had
urged the practice of "reasonable thrift" and fight against
"extravagant consumption" in the new Iranian calendar year
(started from March 21).
</P>
<P>
Drastic fall in oil prices have dealt a heavy blow to Iran's
ailing economy with oil incomes as its mainstay. Experts warned
the economic situation would worsen if oil prices continue to drop
in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Having long distanced himself from the day-to-day run of the
country and specific issues, Khamenei's unusual speeches on the
economy may bode that a serious problem is in the offing due to
weak oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Prices for Iranian crude have plummeted to around 12
U.S. dollars per barrel, losing about six dollars from a year
ago.

Saturday the Kosovo matter is Yugoslavia's internal affair and

Primakov is in Slovenia for a two-day visit beginning Friday.
</P>

Primakov said he believed dialogues on the form of autonomy in
Kosovo might lead to the finding of a formula for Kosovo to
maintain relations with the Yugoslav federation, but the dream to
turn Kosovo into a third Yugoslav republic will not produce any

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges U.S. Not to Publicize Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has urged the United States not publicize its
plan on pushing forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
local Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Netanyahu held telephone discussions with
U.S. President Bill Clinton twice on Thursday and Saturday night
and tried to prevent the publicity of the American peace plan.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, Clinton and Netanyahu agreed that
before the U.S. makes its initiative public, the American Middle
East Peace Envoy Denis Ross will come to the region in an attempt
to bridge the differences between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton told Netanyahu that the American initiative
was closer to Israeli position than that of the Palestinians,
noting the U.S. agreed that the next Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank is conditional on the fulfillment of Palestinian
commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he did not understand why Netanyahu
opposed the American ideas so firmly, which he said were aimed at
narrowing the gap between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said that the U.S. administration had worked out
a new peace plan, which called on Israel to carry out a 13-percent
second withdrawal in the West Bank during a period of 12 weeks and
also called on the Palestinians to implement security commitments.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted that the U.S.-proposed withdrawal would
pose a strategic threat to Israel's security. Israeli officials
have been holding contacts with the administration and American
Jewish leaders in an attempt to prevent the issuing of the
American plan.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat Saturday called on the U.S. to make the
plan public in order to continue the peace talks, which have been
stalled since March last year.
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinian officials also confirmed that Ross would
travel to the region to "unofficially" present the American
plan.

labour.

According to Mugalla, the march began in Cape Town, South
Africa on Saturday. The participants, having traversed
several countries in southern Africa, will be met at Namanga in
Kenya by Kenyan trade unionists on April 28.

The Kenyan participants will then converge on Solidarity
Building on May 1, from where they will proceed to Uhuru Park in

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Envoy in Saudi Arabia on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An envoy of Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday to deliver a
letter to King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on efforts to resolve their
border dispute, reports from Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's message, the second of its kind in less than four
months, aims at paving the way for resuming border talks suspended
late last year after a border clash broke out.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the Yemeni patrol troops and
Saudi border guards exchanged fire, killing two Saudis and a
Yemeni.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, Brigadier Abdullah Al-Busheiri, who is secretary
general of the Yemeni president, was to activate the process of
bilateral talks on border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Saleh proposed in late 1997 to postpone the negotiations "if
there was no desire to resolve the problem" following the border
incident.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Ibn Abdul-Aziz
reiterated that the "border demarcation talks are going on and
did not stop."
</P>
<P>
The two countries are hoping to settle their long-standing
border disputes which may eliminate the last obstacle hindering
further improvement of bilateral relations to cover wider levels.
</P>
<P>
Both countries' officials had been optimistic by the end of
last year towards a quick solution of their border dispute
following the exchange of viewpoints of over a proposal of King
Fahd.
</P>
<P>
After the border incident, Yemeni Vice President Abdo Rabo
Mansour Hadi said his country was ready "to seek arbitration if
the impasse in border negotiations continues."
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani heading a high-level delegation visited Saudi Arabia at
the end of last November for discussions on solving the protracted
border dispute.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, al-Iryani delivered a letter
President Saleh to the Saudi King Fahd dealing with bilateral
relations and the ongoing efforts exerted to settle the land and
maritime borders between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The letter also tackled the sudden border shooting accident
which was the first of its kind since the memorandum of
understanding was signed in 1995.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Tourists Come to Ethiopia in Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) --More than 28,000 foreigners
were granted entry visas to visit Ethiopia during the last six
months, 6,000 more than the same period of the previous year,
the Ethiopian Security, Immigation and Refugees Affairs Authority
has said.
</P>
<P>
''The Ethiopian Herald'' on Sunday quoted Gizachew Adane, an
official from the authority as saying that the visitors were from
different countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Gizachew said that in addition to tourist visas, foreigners
also entered the country using transit, entry and work documents.
</P>
<P>
He said, the rise in the number of tourist arrivals is mostly
seen in July and August, adding that this is because most of the
visitors from Africa and elsewhere prefer to come during the
summer season.
</P>
<P>
However, Gizachew Adane said that his office takes the
necessary inspection and follow-up steps whenever foreigners
enter the country. The authority filed charges on 53 tourists who
overstayed their permitted period in 1996/97, he added.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee assured the Colombo government here Saturday that
it would not change its stand on the neighboring country, the
Hindustan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the visiting Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Laksman
Kadirgamar last evening, Vajpayee said that Indian would continue
its position for a peaceful political settlement of the ethnic
conflict "within the framework of the unity and integrity" of the
island nation.
</P>
<P>
As the first foreign dignitary to have called upon the India's
new Prime Minister, Kadirgamar carried a letter of felicitation
from Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of his two-day visit, Kadirgamar also met
Indian Home Minister L.K. Advani. Indian officials in the Ministry
of External Affairs described his discussions with the Indian
leaders as useful.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the latest Indian elections threw up the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) and its leader Vajpayee as the most likely
force for government formation, Colombo have been pondering over
its election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto said that the BJP-led Indian government would
support a united Sri Lanka within which the legitimate aspirations
of the Tamil people should be fully accommodated.
</P>
<P>
Such a declaration is always liable to the misgivings in
Colombo as it may be interpreted as leaving a leeway for the
Indian intervention.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Launch Gorai River Restoration Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
expected to launch a 250 million U.S. dollars Gorai River
restoration project by June this year, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project has been undertaken on a priority basis following
the 3-point action plan adopted by the representatives of the
donors at the 3-day international seminar on water resources
management held in Dhaka last week.
</P>
<P>
The work of Gorai's excavation with the financial assistance of
the donor agencies and countries, including the Netherlands and
Belgium, will begin by June this year to divert the flow of Ganges
water in Gorai River for ensuring dry season flow in it.
</P>
<P>
The action plan suggested a short-term program of dredging of
the river as soon as possible to provide some immediate
alleviation of the environmental degradation of the
Ganges-dependent area in order to take early advantage of the
opportunities provided by a 30-year Ganges water sharing treaty
signed between Bangladesh and India in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the completion of the project, the sufferings of the
millions of people of the country's southwestern region caused by
the shortage of water in the Gorai River will be mitigated, the
reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- For the past two decades, rural
reforms in China have continued to cut the "big rice bowl", the
one that fed everyone, and have set Chinese farmers free to do
their own farming.
</P>
<P>
These days, farmers have come together again, to set up
cooperatives or companies, to replace the people's communes and to
cope with market forces in agriculture. And Zhangzhou, a farming
city in Fujian Province, has taken the lead in turning farmers
into businessmen.
</P>
<P>
It now has 1,400 companies that process farm products like
milk, frozen and dried vegetables, cakes, tea, candy, and cans and
fodder, and other related farm items.
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies have signed contracts with local farmers,
meaning that they share the market risk by setting certain prices
for farm products.
</P>
<P>
The city government is playing a big role in developing
market-oriented agriculture, and has set up five integrated
development areas and eight farming bases for exports to help
local farms industrialize and specialize in relation to market
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 markets have been established in the province to
handle farm products, and a city information center now gives
farmers information on natiional and global market changes.
</P>
<P>
A number of zones are used as showcases for advanced farming
technology and success stories about local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The city has also benefited from its geographical proximity to
Taiwan and their semi-tropical climates.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have been encouraged to invest in local
agriculture, and 602 overseas-funded farming projects have been
started in Zhangzhou, 280 of them financed by Taiwan
investors. Investment from Taiwan in local farming amounts to 380
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Taiwan-funded farms produced 1.05 billion US dollars
worth of goods and had exports worth 75 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Non-Gasoline Vehicles to Roam Beijing's Streets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Driven by people's environmental
consciousness and potential profits, motor vehicles fueled by
sources other than gasoline or diesel will cruise Beijing, China's
capital.
</P>
<P>
They are called alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) and, according
to an engineer with the local Municipal Science and Technology
Commission, Beijing is a pioneer among Chinese cities in this move.
</P>
<P>
Now 34 light trucks powered by both petrol and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) are running in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They are the latest products of a joint effort between the
China Dongfeng Motor Vehicle Co., one of China's major automobile
plants, and Beijing Liquefied Petroleum Gas Co.
</P>
<P>
Drivers can push a button to easily switch between the two fuel
supply systems.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing gas supplier has also worked out an agreement with
Beijing Public Transit Co., which will have 120 buses on four
major downtown routes retrofitted for LPG fuel by May.
</P>
<P>
They plan to build a gas station for the project, so far the
biggest in town.
</P>
<P>
Meng Shengli, manager of a motor vehicle servicing plant under
Beijing LPG Co., said, "We do this initially to find a new market
for our gas, though environmental protection was one of the
reasons."
</P>
<P>
Beijing is replacing metal gas bottles in urban kitchens with
natural gas pipes. Eyeing this, the LPG company has rebuilt some
100 vehicles since 1994. Meng, who drives a red Santana with an
odometer reading 50,000 kilometers, has the city's first car to
carry a gas bottle in its rear trunk.
</P>
<P>
A more environmentally conscious project has unfolded from
early last year under the auspices of the Municipal Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shen Jinsheng of the Commission's Alternative Fuel Vehicle
Office said that the first-phase preparatory work costing 1.5
million yuan has been completed to systematically propagate such
vehicles in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said, "LPG and compressed natural gas vehicles should be
Beijing's choices."
</P>
<P>
Although the AFV is a mature technology internationally, it
must be adopted for China's cars and trucks whose engines and
circuitry are out-moded for at least a decade compared with those
in western countries, he said.

<P>
Beijing's move has caught the attention of some foreign
countries. Technology suppliers and would-be investors from the
United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan and Russia have
shown interest.
</P>
<P>
To probe the feasibility, General Motors has financed the
shipment of a car which could be widely used in Beijing's taxi
market as a sample to the United States. It is expected to be
shipped back to Beijing in April after it is equipped with a gas
power system.
</P>
<P>
General Motors has trained three engineers for Beijing. Kevin
Wang at GM's Beijing Office said, "GM has promised to transfer
advanced technology to China, a market with strategic
significance. Tail-pipe controls and environmentally related
knowhow are what the country needs most urgently."
</P>
<P>
Shen, of the Science and Technology Commission, said Beijing's
20,000 public transit buses, taxis, postal service vehicles and
garbage trucks are the fist targets for propagating AFV technology.
</P>
<P>
The number seems small compared with Beijing's army of 1.3
million motor vehicles, but they are the most frequently used
vehicles, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The commission official said that Beijing will make a major
move in the second half of 1998, but he didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly good news to Beijing," said Yu Xiaoxuan,
vice director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Heavy vehicle emissions have earned Beijing a firm standing
among the world's top 10 polluted metropolises. Experts say that
compared with gasoline motors, a LPG vehicle puffs out 92 percent
less carbon monoxide while producing the same power.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province to Slash Textile Production Capacity By Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will remove 691,000 outdated spindles in the coming three
years.
</P>
<P>
The figure will account for more than half the total spindles
in the province's state-owned textile mills, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry has been plagued by overproduction and
chronic inefficiency in recent years. The country is taking severe
steps to cut down its bloated scale.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's oldest industrial centers and is
home to one-tenth of the country's large- and medium-size
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 1.45 million cotton spindles, of which 1.3
million are distributed in state-owned textile factories. There
are 760,0000 outmoded spindles that will be cut in Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shusen, head of the Liaoning Subcouncil of the China
National Textile Council (CNTC), said by 2000 the province's
textile sector will have to lay off 80,000 workers, which will add
to the unemployment burden in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, destroying outdated spindles and improving
competitiveness will be conducive to a healthy development of the
national economy from the long-term point of view, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, 410,000 spindles will be cut in the
province this year, 170,000 in 1999 and 111,000 in 2000, Zhang
said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Backs Creation of International Criminal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Peru supports the creation of a
United Nations international criminal court to try crimes of
trans-national character, such as drug trafficking, terrorism and
genocide, sources from the Justice Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, Peru will not sign the agreement if
it does not establish total respect for the sovereignty and the
exhaustion of the internal judicial recourses of each member
country.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government is preparing a proposal to be presented
in June this year in Italy to a conference of plenipotentiary
delegates which is to draft a final multilateral convention to
permit the creation of the court.
</P>
<P>
The sketch of the Peruvian proposal said that before referring
a case to the court, the theme must be discussed and resolved upon
by all the judicial procedures of the country where the crime
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the creation of a permanent international
criminal court within the United Nations was outlined by the
U.N. International Law Commission.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new court would replace the tribunal set up by the
U.N. Security Council to investigate atrocities and crimes against
humanity.

Primakov is in Slovenia for a two-day visit beginning Friday.

turn Kosovo into a third Yuguslav republic will not produce any
result.

<HEADLINE> Structural Readjustment Boosts Anhui's Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Structural readjustment has enabled
the industry of east China's Anhui Province to grow at a rate
faster than the national average, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, Anhui has attached great importance to
developing the non-state-owned sector while maintaining stable
growth in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
The drive has enabled Anhui's industry to grow an average 26
percent in the last six years, a rate higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
An official survey has shown that the contribution to economic
growth of the non-state-owned enterprises has risen steadily in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
By 1993, the collective sector had exceeded the state-owned
sector in terms of industrial output value and contributed 50
percent to industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has taken a series of measures to accelerate the
development of the non-state-owned sector, especially that of the
collective sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that Anhui's investment rate in
the collective and private sectors was 9 percent higher than the
national average between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anhui has invested its limited state funds in
infrastructure and basic industries such as power, transportation
and water conservation.

<HEADLINE> Rural Firms in Shandong Keen on Structural Readjustment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The rural and township enterprises
in east China's Shandong Province are paying more attention to
structural readjustment than to pure quantitative expansion.
</P>
<P>
The overall quality and competitiveness of the companies have
improved consequently, with more enterprises than ever before
specializing in such areas as processing farm produce,
manufacturing machinery and equipment, building materials,
electronics, medicine and chemicals, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of China's economic powerhouses, has nearly 1.4
million rural and township enterprises. They generated 846 billion
yuan in output value in 1997, more than 85 percent of the rural
economy, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the enterprises' industrial incremental
value reached 167.5 billion yuan last year, more than 50 percent
of the provincial figure.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that Shandong's rural and
township enterprises made a combined 57.3 billion yuan in gross
profit last year, up 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rural and township enterprises mushroomed following China's
market economy reforms in the late 1970s and have grown rapidly,
with their proportion in the Chinese economy rising
steadily.

PRAGUE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade deficit of the Czech
Republic in the first two months this year was the lowest in three
years, a spokesman of the republic's National Statistics Bureau
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was 8.1 billion koruny (245 million U.S. dollars),
or 16.3 billion koruny (494 million dollars) less than the first
two months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the two months under review, its export rose by 42.9
percent, while import grew by 20.8 percent, compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery exports, which account for 40 percent of the total
export volume, grew by 58.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Czech republic's foreign trade deficit hit a record 160
billion koruny (4.8 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It dropped to 130 billion koruny (3.9 billion dollars) in 1997

<HEADLINE> Textile Firms in East China Involved in Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of textile
enterprises in east China are actively involved in restructuring
in a bid to raise productivity.
</P>
<P>
In a recent move, the Hefeng Textile Group of Ningbo City
joined the largest local textile conglomerate through a merger
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"The central government's decision to reduce spindles, cut jobs
and restructuring through merger and bankruptcy is helping
enterprises to throw off their heavy burden," said Xing Yongbao,
chairman of the Hefeng Group.
</P>
<P>
By eliminating 30,000 outdated spindles, Hefeng will get over
15 million yuan (1.807 million US dollars) in government subsidy
and interest-subsidized bank loans. The pension fees for retired
workers will be shared by the enterprise, the local government and
social security companies.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy will be used for the production of markable
products with high added value to improve the competition edge,
Xing said.
</P>
<P>
In another case, the Shanghai No. Five Textile Mill was merged
into the Sanqiang (Three Gun) Group, a leading textile brand. The
scheme enabled the group to be freed from millions yuan of debts.
</P>
<P>
The Zhoushan Textile Mill volunteered to reduce 18,000 spindles
and be merged by a local state-owned enterprise group. Director Ma
Haijian has expressed his confidence that the factory is able to
turn losses into profits and raise profit margin to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a State Council decision, the reduction of
outdated spindles in coastal and central cities will be a major
task of this year's restructuring of the state-owned
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Conference Calls for Cooperation on Water Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending a U.N. water
conference adopted an action plan Saturday calling for more
cooperation on the protection and management of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The plan was adopted at the end of the three-day "International
Conference on Water and Sustainable Development" held at the
headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The plan noted that purifying drinking water and making it
accessible to more people should be the top priorities for
international communities and governments in all countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for improving knowledge of water resources
by strengthening information systems and called for public
authorities to set up agencies monitoring the water resources.
</P>
<P>
It also called on public authorities to encourage more input
from the public and increase professional trainings on water
resources management.
</P>
<P>
Countries need to develop strategies for the water sector,
media should widely support the management of water resources and
donors should concentrate their financing on programs intended to
improve the environment, the action plan noted.
</P>
<P>
U.N. figures show that about 1.5 billion people in the world
are in short of drinking water and many African women have to
spend averagely four hours a day to collect water which is often
unclean and the source of numerous fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a final declaration, delegates to the conference expressed
concerns over the fact that "a quarter of the world's population
does not have access to safe drinking water" and that the scarcity
for the resource poses a "serious threat to social and economic
development, human health, global food security and the
environment."
</P>
<P>
600 delegates from 84 countries and 50 non-governmental
organizations attended the conference which was initiated by
French President Jacques Chirac in a U.N. special conference held
last year.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will be submitted for ratification in May to
the U.N. Commission for Sustainable Development.

CARACAS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan
basket of crudes and byproducts for export increased from
10.75 U.S. dollars per barrel Thursday to 10.80 dollars Friday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan sources attributed the price increase to rumors
about secret consultations between independent producing countries
and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to reduce the volume of crude pumped out and to stabilize
the prices.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan basket averaged 12.10 dollars per barrel in the
first two months this year, 1.90 dollars less than the average
sale price of 14 dollars figured out in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OPEC basket went up by seven cents from 11.73
dollars per barrel Thursday to 11.80 dollars Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Revise 1998/99 Budget Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
revise its draft state budget for fiscal 1998/99 (starting from
April 1) to accommodate efforts assuring an adequate supply of
food and essentials in the country, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
"The need to assure a supply of food and other essentials at
prices which do not burden the people, should be accommodated in
the implementation of the upcoming budget for 1998/99," the press
release issued Saturday night by the Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
"For this, a review is necessary to produce a realistic and
efficient budget to overcome various economic problems as a result
of the monetary crisis," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government on January 23 revised an earlier
1998/99 draft state budget originally outlined by President
Soeharto on January 6. The revised budget slashed fuel subsidies
and affirmed the targets of economic zero growth and 20 percent
inflation rate backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Under a reform agreement with the IMF, Indonesia agreed that
fuel prices are to rise from April 1 with the phase-out of
subsidies, which have drained government finances.
</P>
<P>
Economists and social activities have warned that spiraling
inflation and higher energy and transport prices could trigger
protests. Sporadic riots have already broken out in several towns
across Indonesia following a rise in prices of rice and other
essentials.

<HEADLINE> MPs Call for Investigation of Matchmaking Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Six female Democrat Parliament
Members have asked the Foreign Ministry to investigate a
matchmaking service agency run in Britain following complaints by
Thai women of beatings by their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Led by MP Laddawal Wongsriwong from Phayao Province, the
women's group said they had received several complaints from Thai
women who were married to Britons with the help of the Thai
bridges program organized by world association introduction
agencies based in London.
</P>
<P>
The female MPs claimed that many Thai young girls married to
foreign husbands had complained that they were beaten up and badly
treated by their husbands. In some cases, the MPs, said, Thai
girls were forced into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The MPs said complaints for help had previously been lodged
with the Thai Embassy in London, but they were not heeded, thus
promoting the Democrat MPs to seek the help of the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Bangkok Post, the Foreign Ministry was
requested to find out if the matchmaking service was legitimate.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Balance of Payments Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) stood at a deficit of 3.4 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of 1997, a surprising reversal from a surplus of 4.1
billion dollars at the end-1996, local newspaper Manila Bulletin
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Central bank economic research director Diwa Guinigundo was
quoted as saying the BOP deficit was mainly due to the huge
outflow of foreign funds in the second half of 1997 as a result of
the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another major cause was the importation of capital equipment
including aircraft for the modernization of Philippine Airlines
during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Importation by the national flag carrier during the year
amounted to 700 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia-IMF Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Indonesian
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) team here to
review the country's economic reform program have made
considerable progress, according to Indonesian and IMF officials.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Saturday night that both the IMF and
the Indonesian teams were satisfied with the preliminary talks,
but that another week was needed before the talks could be
concluded.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are optimistic that, based on the progress made
in the initial talks, this review will result in measures that
will not only review the Indonesian economy but will also create
stronger growth in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss said, "we
have made considerable progress over the last few days as the
international community prepared a relief program for the
crisis-hit country."
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said talks on the monetary sector looked at ways to
push the rupiah (national currency) to a more normal level of
value.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Concerning banking reform, discussion focused on efforts to
make the Indonesian banking reform agency stronger and more
independent, a move that should rebuild both domestic and
international confidence in the banking sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said although the private sector overseas debt problem was
not part of the IMF reforms, officials agreed that the problem
needed to be quickly solved.
</P>
<P>
"Various approaches have been discussed, including Mexico's
experience with its similar problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held the private sector debts, which accounts
for 60 percent the country's total debt of about 140 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of last year, was one of the main causes of the
current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar explained that further discussion would address
fiscal issues related to import subsidies for basic commodities
and on structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed an agreement with the IMF at the end of last
October in exchange for a bailout package of more than 40 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Indonesia promised to conduct wide ranging
economic, financial, trade reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
IMF gave its first 3 billion U.S. dollars tranche to Indonesia
in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fund withheld the second tranche worth 3 billion
U.S. dollars earlier this month because of the so-called lack of
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talks was the third between the two sides since the
IMF team led by Neiss arrived here March 18.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Takes New Measures on Banking Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, outlined new measures on banking
operations in a bid to bring commercial banks up to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
As the Nation newspaper reported Sunday, the BOT had discussed
five measures with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
bettering banking business.
</P>
<P>
First, the BOT would improve rules classifying loans by
increasing the types of loans from three to five.
</P>
<P>
Second, the period of "stop accrue interest income" would be
shortened from six to three months.
</P>
<P>
Third, the classification of loan reserves would be better
clarified.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, new measures would be laid out to restructure debts and
lower the amount of non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, banks would have to follow a strict "evaluation of
collaterals" to reflect their real asset quality.
</P>
<P>
According to BOT Governor Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi, some 400
billion baht (10 billion U.S. dollars) capitals would have been
needed to be injected into the 15 Thai commercial banks by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 400 billion baht will be raised this year and the
rest in 1999-2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three major banks, Bangkok Bank, Ayudhya Bank and Thai
Farmers Bank, will have a combined capital this year of no less
than 20 billion baht (500 million dollars), while medium- and
small-scale banks will raise 150 billion baht (3.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The required increase of capital is part of an accounting
standard which is used to indicate the strength of the banks as
accorded by the IMF, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied that the BOT had planned to increase
capital-adequacy ratio, used to indicate the bank's financial
condition, from 8.5 percent to 12 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi
continued his feat this year as he advanced into the third round
of the Lipton Championships tennis tournament in Key Biscayne,
Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Agassi, current 31st-ranked player in the world,
needed just 67 minutes to beat Nicolas Escude of France 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one has won back-to-back titles this
year in San Jose and Scottsdale after his dismal performance in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Agassi grabbed all his six breaks opportunities on the
40th-ranked Escude, who was January's Australian Open semifinalist.
</P>
<P>
Escude, who cut his foot surfing in Bali after Australian Open
in Melbourne, also broke three times.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile, last week's Champions Cup
winner, beat 94th-ranked Hendrik Dreekman of Germany 6-3, 6-4, in
just 59 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Rios, the highest-ranked South American since
Guillermo Vilas of Argentina, who was third in the world in August
1982, has won two titles this year, in Auckland and in Indian
Wells respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Michael Chang of the United States withdrew from
the Lipton Saturday for a strained left knee.
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to play against Christian Vinck of Germany in
second round match.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Grants Pardon to Prince Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk Saturday granted a royal pardon to deposed co-premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh for his two criminal convictions earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
"I order a complete amnesty for Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a
conviction on March 4, 1998, and a second conviction on March 18,
1998," said a royal order, signed by the king in Beijing, where he
has been receiving medical treatment, and faxed to the cabinet in
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The pardon came hours after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen sent
King Sihanouk a letter formally requesting absolution for the
expelled prince from two criminal convictions this month,
including the fines.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can Prince Ranariddh come back to Cambodia
for the general election without encountering any barricades,"
said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
A military court sentenced the prince, who was in Bangkok, to
five years in prison on March 4 on an arms smuggling charge.
</P>
<P>
Another court on Wednesday convicted Ranariddh of plotting to
overthrow the government with the help of Khmer Rouge. The court
sentenced him in absentia to 30 years in prison and ordered him to
pay more than 50 million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
The pardon of Ranariddh, who was ousted as first prime minister
by Hun Sun last July, was a key step in efforts to restore peace
in Cambodia and allow the prince to take part in the general
election on July 26.

MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Remittances sent home by millions
of overseas Filipino workers have more than tripled to 19.7
billion U.S. dollars over the last five years compared to 6.1
billion dollars recorded five years ago.

<P>
In a report published Sunday, the Department of Labor and

<HEADLINE> Exports of Gold and Silver Products Enjoy Big Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Gold and silver products are
passing through Beijing customs in ever-increasing quantities,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw gold and silver products worth 45.49 million
U.S. dollars pour out of the country through the customs,
representing a rise of 37 percent over 1996, said a report from
the municipal custom office.
</P>
<P>
General trade has been the major mode of exports of gold and
silver products, accounting for 93 percent of last year's total.
</P>
<P>
Gold product exporters usually buy gold from the PBOC and sell
gold products through general trade. By this means, gold product
exports earn greater profits than through processing trade thanks
to lower transportation and insurance expenses, said the report.
</P>
<P>
State export enterprises have taken a dominant position in this
business owing to their advantages in capital strength, processing
capability and access to credit.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the main destination of gold and silver products
handled by the Beijing customs, taking 94 percent of the total
last year.
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver product exporters in China also earned more
foreign exchange last year.

<HEADLINE> China-made Color Film Draws More Domestic Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese consumers
are turning to Lucky film, the only domestic brand to have
survived competition with the international giants such as Kodak
and Fuji, today's Business Weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
The English weekly quotes a survey which revealed that 25.5
percent of respondents will make Lucky their first-choice brand
this year, compared with only 15 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the proportion of respondents
already buying Lucky film rose to 26.9 percent from 18.4 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the market is still tough for Lucky, which hopes ultimately
to take one third of the domestic market. Kodak and Fuji show no
sign of loosening their grip, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei-based Lucky Film Co. Ltd issued 70 million A shares
last December to raise 432 million yuan (52 million US dollars) to
expand its production and sales network.
</P>
<P>
With technical renovation of its emulsion layer coating line
and film packaging equipment, the company will develop an annual
production capacity of 100 million rolls of color film within
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Company chairman Li baohe said the company will seek to expand
its market share by 10 percent from its current 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company's ambitious plan is strongly supported by the
State, which is planning to inject 3.2 billion yuan in loans and
apply preferential policies to Lucky.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality in Nanchang Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Air quality in Nanchang, the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province suffering serious acid
rain problems, has improved remarkably, according to the city
meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
The daily amounts of suspended particles and sulfur dioxide in
the air above the urban areas of Nanchang have been reduced by 31
percent and 7 percent, respectively, with nitrogen and oxygen
compounds declining by more than 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city air's pH, a measure of acidity and alkalinity, also
has risen to 4.23 from 3.26, which reflects a decline in acid
levels, according to a survey by the city's meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey results indicate that the city's air quality has
reached a level of good air quality standards, said meteorologist
Wang Guozhu.
</P>
<P>
"The refreshing air really makes people feel more comfortable,"
said one local school teacher.
</P>
<P>
"We have promoted the adoption of air purification facilities
among enterprises which discharge dust and polluting exhaust,"
said Wang, adding that environmental protection has been put on
the top of the government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The city, whose energy mainly comes from burning coal, is
stepping up efforts to build production lines of sulfur-fixed coal
and trying to substitute the coal with gas in urban areas, he
said.

Cardoso reportedly called Serra Friday night demanding an early
reply, because he could not leave the post vacant.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Pay one yuan, and own a former
state-owned company in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Today and Sunday the city government will sell 50 state-owned
medium and small enterprises to domestic and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Unprecedentedly favorable policies have been worked out by the
city government for the sales. The minimum prices for companies
with net properties valued at zero or in negative numbers have
been set at one yuan or 13 cents in U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The buyer will also enjoy preferential regulations regarding
the firm purchased relating to settlements with employees,
assessments on the properties, handling of assets and debts,
taxes, exemption of charges and the method of payments.
</P>
<P>
Creditors are banned from forcing the buyer to pay the debt
within the first two years after the purchase, and the returning
of debts to banks by the new owner are allowed to postpone
payments for up to two years, according to special regulations.

<HEADLINE> Spiders Help Farmers Harvest More Grain in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Spiders once were considered
disgusting for their dangerous, ugly appearance. However, for
local paddy growers in the Dongting Lake area in central China,
spiders have become their best friends for killing pests.
</P>
<P>
Some paddy land has been idle to set up safety for spiders. "If
the spiders can pass the winter safely, the pests will not be a
threat to the crops," says a local farmer.
</P>
<P>
Chinese books written 2,000 years ago read, "All are happy when
spiders are flourishing." A spider eats five-to-six insect pests
every day, a local expert says.
</P>
<P>
The lake area is the first in China to study pest control with
spiders. Many local villages have benefited ecologically.
</P>
<P>
"The area used to be plagued by pests," recalls Liu Hui, a
local expert in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, "and chemicals
had been used as the only weapon to fight them."
</P>
<P>
The amount of chemicals used was drastically reduced after
spiders were introduced, which has resulted in better quality of
farm products, according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the natural technology has become
popular in the area and is expected to be adopted by farmers in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, local people want to gain something from their
invention. Xiangyin County plans to turn its vast spider-guarded
farmlands into a new destination for tourists, and a school for
outside farmers who are eager to learn the cost-effective natural
technology.

<HEADLINE> International Shipping Center Takes Shape In Southern Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An international shipping center
has come into being in the southern region of east China's Fujian
Province since the country started reforming and opening-up in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the region now has 150 docks and more than
20 10,000-DWT (Dead Weight Tonnage) berths, with more than 30
shipping lines connecting to ports in Japan, Singapore, the
Republic of Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ports in this region in 1997 handled 29 million tons of
freight, accounting for more than 70 percent of the province's
total volume.
</P>
<P>
The region -- including the three well-known port cities of
Xiamen, Zhangzhou and Quanzhou -- has a 1,350-kilometer coastal
line and some deepwater bays fit for building large-scale ports.
</P>
<P>
The port of Xiamen, located in one of China's four special
economic zones, has had more than 40 docks and 10 10,000-DWT
berths and became one of China's top 10 largest ports.
</P>
<P>
It also became the pilot port for direct shipping across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou and Zhangzhou also promoted their export-led economy
through building ports and improving shipping facilities.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 100,000-DWT Meizhouwan oil dock under
construction at Quanzhou is the province's biggest, and the
30,000-DWT Zhangzhou cargo dock, built 10 years ago, has played a
big role in local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Fujian expects to complete the transportation network including
expressways, railways and international airports in its southern
region to further improve the booming shipping industry
there.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Grants Pardon to Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodum
Sihanouk Saturday granted a royal pardon to deposed co-premier
Prince Norodum Ranariddh for his two criminal convictions earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The royal pardon came after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen asked
King Norodom Sihanouk Saturday to grant a pardon to Ranariddh, the
king's son.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the king, Hun Sen requested absolution for
Prince Ranariddh from two criminal convictions this month,
including the fines.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can Prince Ranariddh come back to Cambodia
for the general election without encountering any barricades,"
said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
A military court sentenced the prince to five years in prison
on March 4 on an arms smuggling charge.
</P>
<P>
Another court on Wednesday convicted Ranariddh of plotting to
overthrow the government with the help of outlawed Khmer Rouge.
The court sentenced him to 30 years in prison and ordered the
prince to pay more than 50 million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is due to hold elections on July 26.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Evaluating Equipment Overseas Prior to Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Import and Export
Commodity Inspection Bureau has sent experts to England,
Switzerland and Japan to evaluate equipment provided by overseas
partners before shipment.
</P>
<P>
The equipment is valued at more than 120 million
U.S. dollars. Experts said that it is necessary for Chinese
enterprises to evaluate all kinds of equipment. Some overseas
investors reportedly quote higher prices than the equipment's
actual worth.
</P>
<P>
To avoid disputes, the bureau has adopted such evaluations
since 1994. For example, an overseas partner quoted the price for
his equipment at 1.9 million U.S. dollars. However, the bureau's
evaluation established the actual value at 1.4 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the equipment from the overseas partner has quality problems
before shipment, the bureau has the right to ask them to make
repairs, said officials from the bureau.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Timber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's decision
to protect the country's forest resources from logging has excited
many foreign timber enterprises with the prospect of a surge in
China's timber imports, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"Timber imports will definitely increase, but not
inordinately," according to an official in charge.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the country's limited wood resources, which
have suffered severe strain over the past few years, China is
encouraging the import of logs and limiting exports while
implementing forest protection projects that will lead to a
large-scale reduction in China's log output.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of China's log imports will be determined
predominantly by market demand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
New economic growth sectors such as the real estate market will
greatly stimulate timber imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Increasing levels of disposable income and greater
sophistication regarding interior design and furnishing will boost
demand for high-grade timber used for furniture and interior
decorating.
</P>
<P>
However, China is short of such high-quality wood, which means
that the huge domestic market will be mainly satisfied by imports,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He forecasts that in the future, the demand for wood will be
mainly met by domestic production and imports will play a
complementary role.

ROME, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Erik Zabel of Germany sprinted to
win the Milan to San Remo classic cycling race for the second
successive year on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German rider held off the French threat of Emmanuel Magnien
and Frederic Moncassin at the head of an 18-strong group for his
sixth win of the season in the 294-km race.
</P>
<P>
It also gave him the leader's jersey in the 11-round World Cup
series, with defending champion Michele Bartoli of Italy snatching
eighth place and 24 points to Zabel's 100.
</P>
<P>
Zabel came to the race boosted by three stage wins and three
second placings in the eight-day Tirenno-Adriatico race which
finished on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italian Alberto Elli almost upset Zabel's hopes. He escaped
alone at the top of the final climb, the Poggio, with six

JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A strategy to make the
people of Swaziland aware of Aids by putting condoms into
newspapers was implemented in the country on Saturday, said
sources from Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was jointly planned by the Swaziland Family
Planning Association (SFPA) and the Times of Swaziland newspaper

</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 condoms, inserted into copies of the
newspapers, were distributed by the SFPA on Saturday.

Reaction by recipients ranged from anger and amusement to
praise -- depending on the circumstances in which the condoms
were found and by whom, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi newspaper issued on Saturday said the method of
distribution achieved its objective. Swazis around the country
were talking about the condoms and this would make them think

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Having Alliance With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has assured Egypt that it is
not developing a strategic relationship with Israel, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday, quoted by the Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement after tete-a-tete talks with his
Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem, who arrived here Friday night on a
three-day visit to Egypt during which he will convey a verbal
message from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to President Hosni
Mubarak on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish foreign minister has clarified that this relation
is not strategic and cannot be described as alliance" despite
Israeli claims as such, Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
He voiced apprehensions of the Arab countries about the
ever-closer Turkish-Israeli relations, and said the region does
not need establishing alliances that would lead to more tensions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey came under fire during an Islamic Summit in Tehran last
December for its military cooperation with Israel and its
incursion into northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed a number of regional issues
including the Turkish "initiative with neighboring countries," and
the talks were very frank, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate, he said: "We are not talking about the
Turkish-Israeli relations, but about the so-called Turkish-Israeli
strategic alliance, against whom it is targeted, why it is
strategic and what is the nature of that strategic alliance."
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides agreed to work out an outline for
consultation and coordination between the two governments at the
level of top-ranking officials and deputy foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
It has been decided that the two countries' foreign ministers
will meet twice a year to discuss bilateral relations and regional
issues, added Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the Turkish minister listened to his views on
the situation in the region and the need to exert more efforts for
establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official visit to Egypt by a Turkish foreign
minister since December 1993 and the highest-level one since
President Demirel visited Egypt last September.

<HEADLINE> The DRC Agrees to Return Rwanda's Looted Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) - The government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) has agreed to return to Rwanda the
property that was looted by the former genocidal government in
1994, according to a state-run radio Rwanda report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was reached during a meeting held between the
two governments in the southwestern Rwandan town of Cyangugu on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the authorities of both countries agreed
to fight enemy forces causing insecurity on the common border.
Both countries pledged not to harbour destabilising forces on
each other's territory, radio Rwanda said.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission was set up to trace the looted properties
so as to hand them over to the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
Following the defeat of former Rwandan government in July
1994, Rwanda's assets made of military and office equipment,
government archives, as well as an estimated 600 million USD of
public treasury were ferried to Zaire by the fleeing dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations between the new regime in Kigali and the
government of late Zairean dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, were
fruitless.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Decides to Return to N. Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21, (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political arm of
the Irish Republic Army(IRA), has decided to return to the
Northern Irish peace talks on Monday after the party was suspended
from the talks for alleged Violence.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by the Sinn Fein executive at a meeting
in Dublin Saturday, according to BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's decision came as politicians involved in the
negotiations prepared for a final push for an agreement to end
decades of strife that has cost more than 3,200 lives.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fei was expelled from the talks on February 20 after the
British and Irish governments blamed the IRA for two murders.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said on the same day in
Warrington, England, "In any process of negotiations there comes a
point to move from talking to deciding. That moment is now."
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein will return to the talks on Monday in a positive and
constructive frame of mind," its chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said
after the executive meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the most powerful pro-British Protestant party in the
province has insisted it has no hope of achieving what it wants
from the talks and will return to violence.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, the party leader, said at its annual conference,
"As long as Sinn Fein-IRA does not recognize consent, does not
recognize our right to define ourselves as British, continues to
rearm, and continues to use violence to influence the
negotiations, we have nothing to talk to them about."

<HEADLINE> Australia Shows Interest in Tanzania's Mineral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia is interested in
Tanzania's mineral sector, the country's High Court Commissioner
to Tanzania Philip Green said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Australia hoped to play an active role in the development of
Tanzania's mineral sector, given the existing geographical and
geological similarities between the two countries, Green told
reporters in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"Several Australian mining companies and hundreds of
Australians are already actively involved in the exploration and
development of the gold fields in western Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's investment in Tanzania is expected to reach about
seven billion shillings (about 10.4 million US dollars) by 1999,
an increase of more than 60 percent over the current level.
</P>
<P>
Green commended the Tanzanian government's progress in
macro-economic reform which he said is likely to stimulate more
interest from Australian investors.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also pointed out that trade between the two
countries has grown during the last three years, with the 1996-97
two-way trade standing at 24 million US dollars, against 21
million US dollars in the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's exports to Tanzania in 1996-97 stood at 20
million US dollars while Tanzania's exports to Australia were 4.2
million US dollars," Green said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who was posted to Australia's mission in Dar es
Salaam between December of 1985 and December of 1987, reaffirmed
his country's commitment of strengthening the cordial relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Green, whose second language is Kiswahili and is married to a
Tanzanian doctor, presented his credentials to Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa on Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's New Cabinet Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone has set up a 15-member new cabinet ten days after he
regained power from the military junta that ousted him in a coup
last May.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, announced Friday night in the capital Freetown,
is said to be a fairly broad-based one, with six new appointees
including former Ambassador to the United Nations James Jonah
named as finance minister, the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the cabinet are yet to be known, but a presidential
spokesman was quoted as saying that they are "extremely very
capable indeed".
</P>
<P>
They will enjoy freedom to fulfill their responsibilities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new cabinet confirmed President
Kabbah's announcement last week to reduce the number of cabinet
ministers from 30 to 15 to show his determination for an
efficient government.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah, who ended his more than nine months of exile
in neighboring Guinea Tuesday after the intervention of the west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, has also pledged to run a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the government functionaries in the
past, such as bureaucracy, and faulty policies are part of the
factors that triggered off the coup in the tiny west African
country last May, forcing Kabbah and his government to flee to
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Summary:   Angola Makes Headway in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The peace process has been
revitalized in the month after the government and the former
rebel force, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) made successive progress in implementing the
Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The peace process took a big step forward in April last year
when a national reconciliation government was formed with the
involvement of UNITA and a unified army was formed. But
unexpected obstacles appeared when some former UNITA military men
tried to block the way for the re-building of government
institutions in the formerly UNITA controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The military confrontations between former UNITA military
forces, the government forces and the UN inspection mission in
many parts of the country forced the peace process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
And the eruption of military confrontation between the former
Zaire and the neighboring Congo Republic, which squeezed about
8,000 UNITA military remnants from border areas, cast another
shadow on Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Though most of the military remnants registered at the UN
inspection mission as required, the sudden inflow of the military
men poses yet another threat to the fragile peace and stability
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The widely reported killing, looting and raping by the
military men rendered the February 28th deadline for final peace
in the country a broken dream.
</P>
<P>
All the mishaps told Angolans and the international community
that trust had not been built on the country plagued by nearly
two decades of civil war, and peace could never come true as long
as an armed rebel force is still in operation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the UN Security Council passed a resolution for
sanction on UNITA, restricting UNITA leaders' trip abroad and
closing UNITA branches overseas.
</P>
<P>
To continue the peace progress, a new timetable was also out
on March 6th after discussions among representatives from the
United Nations, U.S., Russia, Portugal and other parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the Benin, Togo, Gabon and Congo (K) also join
the peace efforts by the United Nations to mediate between the
government and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The new time-table targets March 31st as the final day for the
implementation of the Lusaka peace deal.
</P>
<P>
To the content of all peace-lovers, all seemed to have
proceeded in accordance with the new time-table.
</P>
<P>
By March 20, UNITA declared non-militarization communique, the
400-strong bodyguard squad finished the registration and 191
former UNITA chiefs were demobilized. UNITA was also recognized
by the government as a legal party.
</P>
<P>
Before March 31st, tasks like moving UNITA headquarters from
Bailundo to Luanda, the commercialization of UNITA radio station,
and the re-establishement of government organs in UNITA
controlled areas are expected to be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
These, vital to the peace process in the country, are
recognized by analysts as a great leap forward, with the
dismobilization of the UNITA military chiefs having cleared the
way of any further threat of war.
</P>
<P>
As peace is drawing near to the war-ridden country, Angolans
are prepared to rebuild their homeland and make contribution to
the regional development in southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Rejects Case of Libyan Former FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday
turned down a lawsuit against Egyptian Interior Ministry filed by
the wife of a former Libyan foreign minister who disappeared in
Cairo in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Baha Al-Kekhia, an American citizen, accused the ministry of
failing to protect her husband, Mansour Al-Kekhia, when he was
attending a meeting of the Arab Organization of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The missing of Al-Kekhia, who had served as Libya's foreign
minister in 1970s before turning against the government, remained
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post newspaper said last December that Al-Kekhia
was abducted by Egyptian agents and handed over to Libya. He was
then reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has denied the allegation and accused the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency of being behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Baha demanded a compensation of 500,000 Egypt pounds (150,000
U.S. dollars) for the ministry's failure to ensure her husband's
security in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Cairo Primary Court ruled that there was no
evidence to prove any mistake or negligence on the part of the
ministry in protecting Mansour Al-Kekhia during his official stay.
</P>
<P>
Neither was there any proof that a crime was perpetrated
against him, the court said, "Al-Kekhia's wife has not come up
with one evidence to prove that a crime was carried out against
her husband."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the court said, Baha has failed to present to the
court any official paper confirming her marriage with Mansour.
</P>
<P>
Baha can appeal against the Saturday decision, but it is still
unknown if she will.
