<HEADLINE> China's No.1 Commercial Street Closed for Subway Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's most famous
commercial street, Nanjing Road of Shanghai, was closed today for
the construction of the city's second subway line. The closure is
expected to last one year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first complete closure of Nanjing Road since it was
opened in 1851. The road was closed only at night when a trolley
bus line was dismantled in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
According to Shanghai's urban development program, the second
subway line will cross Nanjing Road underground. A subway station
will be built on the eastern part of the road.
</P>
<P>
When dusk fell tonight on the largest city in China, several
large red steel fences were pushed slowly to the center of Nanjing
Road to halt the dense flow of vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
No closing ceremony was held, but residents who had learned the
news came voluntarily to watch. A light rain fell on those
assembled.
</P>
<P>
Li Ren, an official from the city's Huangpu District that
manages Nanjing Road, said the closure could turn out to be a rare
opportunity for development of this commercial street.
</P>
<P>
"The subway will bring many more customers when it resumes
operation, and some stores on the road regard this as a chance to
renew their buildings," he said.

<P>
However, not everyone was feeling good. Though the closed
portion of the road is only 100 meters long, 44 shops with a
business area of 35,800 square meters will be affected. Their
overall business losses during the closure are estimated at more
than 1.5 billion yuan (200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Because of the closure, one-third of the employees of the
Wangkai Photo Shop, one of Shanghai's oldest, were temporarily
laid off. They will lose 70 percent of their monthly income.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sad thing to leave Wangkai and Nanjing Road," said
a 30-year employee of the photo shop. "But we're willing to
sacrifice for a better future for the road and our shop."
</P>
<P>
Wen Xiaodong, a resident on the closed part of Nanjing Road,
confessed that it wouldn't be a happy memory to see so many pretty
neons vanish from around his house.
</P>
<P>
"I wish that the present dimness could bring about greater
splendor in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than two million people walked on
Nanjing Road every day, and commodities worth more than 20 billion
yuan were sold each year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Longgen, director of the economic and trade commission of
the Huangpu District, said that the government has mapped out a
plan to turn Nanjing Road into a multi-function pedestrian
shopping street in the next three years.

</P>
<P>
The Congress' decision to withdraw support for the United Front

PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- France today rejected an Iraqi
proposal on opening presidential sites to delegates from the
United Nations but excluding the United Nations Special Commission
on Disarmaments in Iraq (Unscom) from joining inspections there.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal cannot make things move forward. The Special
Commission is the only one which has at its disposal the mandate
for localizing and neutralizing arms," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Secret-Gazeau.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also called on the chief of Unscom, Richard
Butler, to go to Baghdad immediately to solve the disputes over
"sensitive sites" in order to "avoid any incident."
</P>
<P>
She said that an oral agreement reached on June 22, 1996,
between former chief of Unscom, Rolf Ekeus, and Deputy Prime
Minister of Iraq Tarek Aziz, which banned Unscom members from
visiting sensitive sites, does not have "contractual value."
</P>
<P>
"It is inexact to affirm that this agreement has the value of a
contract and that Mr. Butler is held to conform to it," said the
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Continues to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal income
continued to grow a healthy 0.5 percent in October, the Commerce
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, personal incomes have risen for 12
straight months. October's increase, following a smaller 0.3
percent growth in September and 0.6 percent in August, brought
income to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.97 trillion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Spending also increased 0.5 percent in October to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.58 trillion dollars following gains of
0.3 percent in September and 0.2 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Most of the strength in consumer spending in October came from
a 0.8 percent increase in services. Spending on non-durable goods,
such as food and clothing, rose 0.3 percent. But spending on
durable goods _ big ticket items from cars to refrigerators, fell
0.4 percent
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that the trend reflects steady wage
increases stemming from low unemployment that has created a tight
labor market favoring job seekers. The nation's unemployment rate
has been at or below 5 percent since last Winter, the lowest and
also longest such stretch in 24 years.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Reduce Greenhouse Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from Germany,
Brazil, South Africa and Singapore today called on the developed
countries to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the
benefit of the whole mankind.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate
Change to adopt at the forthcoming Third Conference of the Parties
in Kyoto (Japan) a protocol or other legally binding instrument
which will reflect the great importance of global climate
protection to the whole of mankind," the leaders said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Deputy President Thabo M.
Mbeki of South Africa, and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of
Singapore was issued in advance of the climate conference in
Kyoto, Japan, next week.
</P>
<P>
They said the legal document to be adopted at the Kyoto
conference "must contain legally binding commitments for the
developed countries to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions."
</P>
<P>
The developed countries will have to reduce emissions of the
three most important greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane,
and nitrous oxide by at least 7.5 percent by the year 2005 and by
15 percent by 2010 compared with 1990, the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
"All nations on earth must cooperate with one another in order
to safeguard our climate system for future generations," they
said.
</P>
<P>
They added that in the longer term, a truly global effort by
all countries is needed, in order to move towards achieving the
ultimate objective of the climate framework convention.
</P>
<P>
They also said that they recognize the need for sustainable
economic growth in developing countries and regard technological
cooperation and financial assistance to be part of their long-term
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Hence the Kyoto conference should also consider measures to
advance access to or transfer of technology, as well as financial
assistance in order to assist developing countries in meeting
their commitments," the leaders said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Farmers Union Criticises Designated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers
Union (CFU) said today that most of the commercial farms listed
by the government for acquisition were not in the categories of
farms that were previously said to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
The government today published the list of 1,480 commercial
farms it has designated to resettle about 100,000 landless
peasant families.
</P>
<P>
The list comprised farms belonging to white and black
individuals, companies and some government parastatals stretching
across the country's 45 districts.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has said farmers would not be
compensated for land but for the improvements they made on the
farms.
</P>
<P>
CFU President Nick Swanepoel said today in a statement the
list contained numerous anomalies and inconsistencies, and
predicted that production from large-scale farming would drop
from 14 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (one billion U.S. dollars) to
8.8 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (630 million U.S. dollars) annually,
with value of exports dropping to 6.6 billion Zimbabwe Dollars
(470 million U.S. dollars) from 10 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (700
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of workers on commercial farms would drop from
327,000 to 180,000 following the acquisition exercise.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the listed farms do not meet other pre-announced
criteria of not driving commercial farmers off the land, and some
are among the most intensively utilised and highly productive in
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the assurance given us by President Mugabe that
genuine grievances in the land acquisition program will be
considered," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As a primary industry in Zimbabwe, agricultural output and
earnings and farm workers' output and earnings have a massive
multiplier effect in the whole economy," he said.

NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress party today
withdrew its support for the seven-month-old United Front minority
government headed by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, and staked
its claim to form a new "secular" government.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri met President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan this evening to convey the decision of the party
to withdraw support over the issue of an investigative report
which indicted one major constituent of the ruling United Front
for being linked with the 1991 assassination of former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Since the report was tabled in parliament on November 20, the
Congress party has been demanding the sacking of three cabinet
ministers belonging to the indicted Dravida Munnetra Kazagham

needs support from the Congress party to maintain a minority
government, has firmly rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here this evening, Kesri said that the
Congress Working Committee, the highest decision making body of
the party, made the decision to withdraw support unanimously.
</P>
<P>
The decision has also been communicated to Prime Minister
Gujral, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Gujral has decided to
resign instead of recommending dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the
lower house of Indian parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is expected to convene a cabinet meeting
after the Steering Committee of the United Front meets here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Following the cabinet meeting, he is likely to tender
resignation of his council of ministers to the president.
</P>

<P>
MOGADISHU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Somalia's
southern coastal town of Brava said six people were killed in two
separate incidents in the village of Kunyo Barrow in the past 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
In one incident, four people were bitten to death by
crocodiles inside the village.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the crocodiles were brought by the
recent floods that hit Kunyo Barrow village, 315 km south of the
capital Mogadishu, following the outburst of the river banks
owing to the heavy rains in Somalia and on the mountain lands of
Ethiopia from where River Shabelle originates.
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, two men were eaten by lions that also
attacked the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Abyow Nunye Abyow told the press in Mogadishu that the floods
are not only affecting the people, but are also displacing the
wild animals in the jungles.
</P>
<P>
"Both people and animals meet in the dry areas beyond the
water's reach and on the hills," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abyow added that 2,000 out of the 3,000 residents of Kunyo
Barrow village and its surrounding sub-villages are now in
critical condition for being lack of food, shelter and medicine
after water floated their villages and besieging them.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Mogadishu itself has faced two days of constant
rains since Thursday. The rains have further deteriorated the
already poor sanitation of the town.
</P>

They are now threatening the lives and houses of hundreds of
refugee families in the nearly 100 refugee camps in Mogadishu.
These refugees consist of internally displaced people and
Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains have provoked the outbreak of severe
diarrhoea, malaria and other parasites. Doctors in the capital
said five children died of diarrhoea every day in the past 15
days.
</P>
<P>
The pools of water lying in the main streets of the capital
have also strained the movement of vehicles in the city, and some
of the public transport buses have not been operating since
Thursday for lack of passengers who remained indoors sheltering
from the rains.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu currently remains short of vegetables, coal and milk
because of the rains.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Vote to Ban Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- British members of parliament
voted overwhelmingly today in favor of banning hunting of wild
mammals with horses and hounds.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, introduced by Labor MP Mike Foster, received 411
votes for the ban while 151 voted against, dealing a blow to one
of the most traditional pursuits of Britain's rural upper class.
</P>
<P>
But the Bill is unlikely to become law as the government has
not given it extra parliamentary time.
</P>
<P>
Interior minister George Howarth denounced hunting as
"repugnant" but gave no guarantee that the government would allow
the private member's bill enough parliamentary debating time for
it to become law.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this Bill is to protect wild mammals from cruelty
and from the unnecessary pain and suffering inflicted in the name
of a so-called sport," Foster told a packed House of Commons --
usually almost deserted for the low-key debates held on most
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
He said that, at a conservative estimate, 100,000 wild animals
were hunted to death in Britain every year, often being pursued to
the point of exhaustion and then being torn to death by pursuing
hounds.
</P>
<P>
The issue has attracted intense interest in Britain -- many MPs
say it is one of the main themes of letters from constituents.

LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in Asia

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Defends Iran's Supreme Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani today stood by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei by saying that it was unfair to criticize the leader.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayer congregation, Rafsanjani, now
chairman of the advisory State Exigencies Council, said that to
criticize the leader for his performance of tasks would be to
ignore the multitude of services he had rendered for the nation.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, an influential religious figure, Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, challenged Khamenei over the issue of
Valayat-e Faqih (governance of supreme religious jurisprudent),
which meant the supreme leader has the final say in every
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri was once successor designate to Iran's late Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, but was later disqualified by him partly
for outspokenness. This time he advised Khamenei to supervise,
rather than directly interfere in, government affairs.
</P>
<P>
His remarks set off a wave of strong condemnation and attacks
from political and religious circles. Rallies and demonstrations
were held throughout the country in the past two week.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Khamenei "had agreed to the investment on
him of the leadership authority only under reluctance," adding
that it was unfair to think or to say that the leader had taken
that office as the result of private arrangements for him.
</P>
<P>
He deplored recent political "rows and controversies" in the
country over the person of the leader or the issue of leadership,
saying that the fierce polemics has its roots outside of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said recent debates at certain theological schools in Qom, a
religious city about 100 kilometers south of Tehran, and at Tehran
University had been "bitter for us and sweet to foreigners."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani hoped the uproar would discontinue so that the
present administration would be able to proceed with its tasks at
a better political and social environment.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that he personally was partial to free debates
and academic liberties, but stressing that "the approach to those
liberties had to be wise, discreet and consistent with the nature
of the topic."

<HEADLINE> India's Opposition Party Keeps Options Open on Forming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to the withdrawal
of support by the Congress party to the government, the opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said tonight that it was keeping
options open to form a new government but a final decision would
be taken tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping our options open (to form a government) but
will meet tomorrow morning to take a final decision on forming the
government," senior BJP leader and former prime minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
PTI said Vajpayee and other BJP leaders, including party
President Lal Krishna Advani, will first formulate the party's
strategy at a meeting here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was very critical of the Congress party which has just
withdrawn its make-or-break support for the seven-month-old United
Front government headed by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral over
an investigative report on the assassination of former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The United Front has rejected to meet the Congress party's
demand for sacking three ministers belonging to one constituent of
the front which was indicted by the report for being linked with
the 1991 assassination.
</P>
<P>
"The government could have been brought down in the floor of
the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Indian parliament)," Vajpayee
said, regretting that the decision to form the next government
would be taken at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has already staked its claim to form a new
government shortly after it withdrew support to the government
earlier this evening.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not Against Turkey's Bid for EU: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus backs Turkey's
aspirations for European Union (EU) and is ready to participate in
accession talks at the same time together with Turkey, a Cypriot
government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides said
Cyprus' course for EU membership and that of Turkey can act as
"catalysts" in efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said "Cyprus has no objection to sitting at the same table
with Turkey, nor do we object to Turkey's prospect for European
integration, but our accession course and that of Turkey are
matters which concern the (European) Union."
</P>
<P>
It is up to the EU to define the terms and conditions which
will enable Turkey to hold membership talks with EU, he said,
adding that at present all indications are that it is impossible
to do that.
</P>
<P>
These terms, he noted, relate to improved human rights record,
increased effort to settle the Kurdish and Cyprus problems and
ironing out differences with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, together with another five candidate countries, is due
to begin accession negotiations with the EU in Spring 1998.
Turkey, which is not included in this list, has been trying to
rally support from EU member states for its participation in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' accession talks with the EU has prompted Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to threaten to boycott future Cyprus
settlement talks, and integrate his self-styled "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus" with Turkey if the talks go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls to Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) today called for "continued commitment to the
fight against AIDS disease".
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Ahmed Haggag, Assistant Secretary General
of the OAU, in his opening statement at a ceremony to commemorate
"1997 World AIDS Campaign" held this afternoon here.
</P>
<P>
Haggag said, "Africa has more afflicted individuals than any
of the continents of the globe and in sub-Saharan Africa the
situation is even graver."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that "in July 1992 in Dakar, the heads of state
and government at their 28th summit, adopted a declaration on the
AIDS epidemic in Africa", saying that "our leaders set a target
that by the end of 1992, each one of us will be publicly
recognized as the leader of the fight against AIDS in our own
country."
</P>
<P>
He told participants that the 10th International Conference on
Sexually Transmitted Diseases/AIDS in Africa will be convened in
Cote D'ivorie in December to deliberate on AIDS and development,
as the theme of the conference.
</P>
<P>
A statement made by the dean of African Diplomatic Corp said
since 1981 when the first AIDS case was discovered in the US, the
world has over 30 million cases now and the majority of those
cases are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed for protecting children from the infection
and giving them hope and care they need.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World AIDS Day, which falls on
December 1, 1997, is "Children Living in a World With AIDS".
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the joint United Nations program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 1996, an estimated 400,000 children
under the age of 15 became infected with HIV, which causes AIDS.
This brought the total number of children in the world living
with the virus at the end of 1996 to 830,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of children living with HIV will reach one million
by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the one and a half million people who died of AIDS in 1996,
350,000 were under the age of 15. Sub-Saharan Africa is currently
the worst affected region.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1996, out of the nine million children under 15 years
old had lost their mothers to AIDS, more than 90 percent of them
were living in sub-Saharan African countries.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Publish Report on "Bloody Sunday" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is to
publish a report on the 1972 "Bloody Sunday" massacre, stepping up
pressure on London for a fresh inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday January 30, 1972, British troops in Northern Ireland
killed 14 Catholic people during a civil rights demonstration in
Northern Ireland's second city of Londonerry.
</P>
<P>
The "Bloody Sunday" incident, which had won support of young
Catholics for the outlawed Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighting to
end British rule in the province, is now commonly regarded as a
landmark in Northern Ireland's history.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was quoted by press reports
from Dublin as saying Thursday night that the Dublin government
would publish a report based on previous findings on the incident
early next year because Britain was dragging its feet on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have given the British government a great deal of time and
space in which to consider the matter," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be my intention to publish that report in the early
months of next year so that the public opinion in this country and
in Britain and elsewhere can judge for itself what is the next
appropriate step," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain's Labor government has promised in
October to establish an independent review of the events of Bloody
Sunday after the Irish government handed over some new evidence to
Britain.

MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia and NATO have serious
differences at the Vienna negotiations over the treaty on
conventional armed forces in Europe, Head of the International

Ivashov told a briefing here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivashov, NATO is trying to avoid limiting the
collective level of conventional armaments.

<P>
He said the problem is that quantity parameters of conventional
armaments in Europe were set for two blocs - NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, which disintegrated some time ago.
</P>

Ivashov noted if NATO is enlarged, conventional armaments of
former Socialist countries may become part of the NATO structure
and break the balance of forces.

Russia has managed to achieve an agreement that each of the 30
signatories to the treaty will not strive to increase its
conventional armaments and be ready to curtail them.
</P>
<P>
Russia still suspects the NATO's promise not to permanently
place "substantial combat forces" on territories of its new
members.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of NATO, it could be a division while Russia
thinks it could not be larger than a brigade.
</P>
<P>
Russia "will not accept the role of an extra attached to NATO",
Ivashov said. Russia wants to discuss further steps in the
military sphere to be undertaken in Europe. It is likely to deal
with the plans for NATO's development in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the event, Russia's proposals are not accepted, the visits
to NATO Headquarters of Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Chief
of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Anatoly Kvashnin on
December 3 and 4 respectively, will be held in any case, Ivashov
noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Looters May Face Death by Firing Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- About 50 Sierra Leoneans detained
for looting may face death by firing squad, according to the new crime
decree the military junta issued today.
</P>
<P>
"Any person found guilty of looting, commandeering of vehicles or
who receives any looted property or commandeered vehicle shall be
sentenced to death by firing squad," the decree says.
</P>
<P>
The decree, back-dated to take effect from May 28, three days after
the junta came to power through a coup, was published today in the
official weekly gazette.
</P>
<P>
Official figures of looters have not yet been released, but up to
50 people are estimated to be in detection in connection with looting
offenses.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 10 soldiers charged with murder were shot by firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
According to the new decree, the sixth signed by junta leader Major
Johnny Koroma, an anti-looting squad of military and police officials
will be established.
</P>
<P>
Suspects arrested by the squad will be tried by civilian courts
within 14 days, the decree says.
</P>
<P>
It imposes jail terms ranging from five years to life for persons
in possession of looted property or commandeered vehicles, and two to
seven years for any person who harasses or intimidates another person.
</P>
<P>
A 500,000-U.S. Dollar fine or two years' imprisonment or both will
be levied on any person who obstructs the work of the anti-looting
squad.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted police sources as saying that about
1,000 vehicles were commandeered in the wake of the coup but only a
fraction have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
In another development to show the junta's soft line towards local
media, the police this afternoon released seven journalists who have
been detained for eight days.
</P>
<P>
They have not been charged with any offence and freed
unconditionally, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
More journalists who have been in detention for at least two weeks
without charge may be released in the days to follow.

<HEADLINE> Two Germans Arrested on Spying Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- German judicial authorities said
today that they had arrested two Germans suspected of spying for
the former Soviet Union and later for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two men, identified only as 47-year-old Bernhard N., and
45-year-old Wolf L., had been put into custody pending further
investigations, German federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard N., who had worked for a leading aerospace company in
northern Germany, is accused of passing on classified information
on manufacturing details of a passenger plane to the now dissolved
Soviet KGB and then to the follow-up Russian intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Wolf L., initially a full-time employee of the former East
German state security ministry known as the Stasi, had been the
KGB agent who controlled Bernhard N. since 1984.
</P>
<P>
German prosecutors said Bernhard N. had been given a fee of
5,000 German marks (2,800 U.S. dollars) each time when he met Wolf
L. since 1984.

ABU DHABI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Undersecretary of
Defense John Hemer today visited Bahrain's Sheikh Aesi air base
where tens of U.S. warplanes were deployed as part of U.S.
military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini news agency said that during the hours-long visit,
Hemer held talks with some senior Bahraini military officials on
the latest developments in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details of the visit. However, observers
here noticed that Hemer's visit came days after the deployment of
36 more warplanes in Bahrain to beef up U.S. military muscle in
the standoff with Iraq over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Washington began to reinforce its military presence in the
region three weeks ago, after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
ordered the expulsion of American members on the U.N. weapons
inspection teams on charge of spying.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, together with other arms inspectors, returned
to Baghdad last week after Russian efforts to defuse a military
showdown between Baghdad and Washington. But U.S. military buildup
has continued.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials in the Gulf said the entire U.S. 347th
Air Expeditionary Wing, including about 1,000 ground support
staff, was now in the Gulf region, according to local reports.

<HEADLINE> India PM Resigns After Withdrawal of Congress Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral resigned tonight after Congress withdrew support for
his seven-month-old minority government over an inquiry report on
the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, the Press
Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party withdrew its support after the ruling United
Front refused to meet its demand for dropping three ministers
belonging to the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), a constituent of
the front, from the government.
</P>
<P>
The DMK was indicted by the so-called Jain Commission report
for being linked with the 1991 assassination.
</P>
<P>
In a brief letter to President Kocheril Raman Narayana, Gujral
said the Congress party has asked him to drop the three DMK
ministers for totally unjustifiable reasons.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfair and unethical to tarnish the fair name of a
party or to blame the party only because of the Jain Commission
report," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Assigning high priority to the national interest I have come
to the conclusion that I should submit my resignation to you. My
council of ministers and I, hereby, submit our resignations," the
prime minister said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Gujral government was sworn in on April 21 after the H.D.
Deve Gowda government collapsed following the withdrawal of
support by the Congress party on March 30.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Slams Egyptian Media For Sowing Discord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Qatar today accused Egyptian
media of sowing dissension between Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), thus keeping the war of words between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari News Agency quoted Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al Thani as saying today that the
Egyptian media is trying to "drive a nail between the UAE and
Qatar."
</P>
<P>
The minister made the comment after UAE President Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who ended an official visit to Egypt days
ago, criticized Doha's failure to boost Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Egypt has been quarreling over last year's foiled
coup attempt in Qatar and the Doha economic conference which was
boycott by a majority of Arab countries for Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has claimed that two Egyptians from the Egyptian army
were involved in the coup attempt to topple the Qatar government
in February in 1996. Some Qatari officials, including Foreign
Minister Hamad, even directly alleged Cairo's implication.
</P>
<P>
Egypt denied the charges. President Hosni Mubarak said that the
two Egyptian suspects were "retired army officers who had
temporary work contract with the Qatari government."
</P>
<P>
Egypt also called Qatar to clarify its position towards the
charges. However, Qatar made no comments.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were further strained due
to their difference over the Doha economic conference. Cairo had
urged Qatar to call off or postpone the meeting for lack of
progress in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Qatar angrily accused Egypt of meddling in its internal affairs
and making indiscreet remarks. The row was escalated when Qatar
issued a ban on the entry of air passengers from Egypt and other
nine states as one of the security measures prior to the
conference Egypt decided to boycott.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said in his address to the QNA that so far there has been
no mediation from a third country to settle the current crisis
between Qatar and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Concerned Over Turkish Settlers' Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government has
expressed concern over Turkish settlers in northern Cyprus,
describing it as the biggest danger for Cyprus' present and future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here today, Government
spokesman Manolis Christofides said that it is obvious that
thousands of settlers from Turkey have been intentionally
transferred to the island.
</P>
<P>
"It is an international crime which must be tackled by all of
us on a global level," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of a census in December 1996, published in
the Turkish Cypriot press Thursday, the population in
Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus has reached 200,587.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said that the statistics of the Republic of
Cyprus showed that Turkish Cypriots in 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded the island, numbered 120,000.
</P>
<P>
"The settlers brought into Cyprus from Turkey are at least
100,000," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has showed displeasure with the remarks
by British Special Envoy for Cyprus Sir David Hannay that the
Turkish settlers have the right to stay in Cyprus after the
country's problem is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Hannay was reported to have said that Turkish settlers in the
northern part of Cyprus married to Turkish Cypriots had acquired
"Turkish Cypriot citizenship" and therefore had the right to
remain on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides, who is now in
London to meet with Hannay to elaborate on his government's
positions on the settlers' issue, dismissed Hannay's statements as
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides reiterated his country's position that "the Turkish
settlers can not remain in Cyprus after a solution."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office announced Thursday that Hannay has made
it clear that his statement does not imply or is intended to
"imply a shift in Britain's policy of not recognizing the 'Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus,' which remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the east Mediterranean
island in the wake of a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Discuss Debt Reduction With Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Debt reduction, the
pace of economic reform and budget deficit are on the agenda of
the consultations between Tanzanian government and the donor
community next month.
</P>
<P>
Financial Minister Daniel Yona said that the two-day
Consultative Group Meeting opening here on December 10 will be
attended by representatives of some 40 donor countries and
institutions, reported the "Business Time" today.
</P>
<P>
Yona said Tanzania is working hard to meet most of the
benchmarks set by the donor community for more development aid.
</P>
<P>
During a seminar meeting last year, the government pledged to
pursue right economic policies in order to secure gains achieved
by the ongoing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania promised at the seminar that it would cut down its
borrowing from local banks, curb tax evasion and direct more
resources to key areas of services.
</P>
<P>
"During the Consultative Group meeting next month we shall
discuss with our development partners how far we have gone as far
as the reforms are concerned," Yona said.
</P>
<P>
They will also deliberate on the successes, obstacles and the
financial requirements needed to further carry out development
programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Paris Club meetings which mostly dwell on debt
issues, Yona described the Dar es Salaam meeting as an encounter
between "development partners," which will also focus on giving
the government "ownership of development programs."
</P>
<P>
It means a large chunk of financial commitment to
donor-supported programs will have to be undertaken by the
government, the paper said.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is giving positive consideration to the
early ratification of the landmine protocol of the convention on
certain conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien following their talks, Jiang said that China will
continue to take an active part in international landmine clearing
efforts in the future, including making contribution to the
international landmine clearance foundation, and providing
international assistance in the areas of mine clearance training,
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government has decided to send an
observer to the conference on banning anti-personnel landmines to
be held from December 2 to December 4 in Ottawa. The Chinese
observer will also participate in the round-table conference on
landmine clearance and assistance.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Jiang said he and Chretien had an in-
depth exchange of views and reached broad consensus on further
advancing China-Canada relations and on a host of international
and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to the development of
a lasting, healthy, stable and friendly relationship on the basis
of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two side also agreed to work together for the
building of cross-century partnership relations of all-round
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Jiang briefed Chretien on China's
modernization drive. Jiang said the frank and open talks between
him and Chretien have help promote the friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is here on the second leg of his state visit to Canada,
the first by a Chinese head of state in 12 years. Jiang arrived
from Calgary last night and will leave for Toronto this afternoon.

ADDIS ABABA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia said today that over 4.2
million people in the country need relief food in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the donor community, Commissioner Simon
Mechale said the food requirement for the 1998 is estimated to be
572,835 metric tons. Over 1.55 million people need close
monitoring in food supply, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many small rains season dependent areas
which lost their crops last season and whose food situation is
not expected to change until the coming June.
</P>
<P>
''There are also big rains season areas, which have totally
lost their crops, and are expected to be dependent on relief for
the whole year,'' he said, adding ''The rest of the affected big
rains season areas producers are expected to require assistance
at different times of the year.''
</P>
<P>
Simon Mechale said that unlike the previous years, when the
country used to have considerable amount of carry over stock, it
is facing 1998 with no stock.
</P>
<P>
The commission appealed to the international donor community
for providing 103,369 metric tons of food aid for 1997.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Government Budget Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The German government today
finally pushed through its budget plan for 1998 and a
supplementary budget for this year after four days of debates in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised 1997 budget approved by the Bundestag, the
lower house of parliament, the Bonn government would be allowed to
run a budget deficit of 70.9 billion marks (40.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1997, compared with the originally planned 53.3
billion marks (30.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revision was made necessary due to larger-than-expected
shortfall in tax revenues as well as soaring unemployment. The
total government spendings were cut by 2.4 percent from the level
of 1996 to 444.8 billion marks (252.7 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 budget which foresees a total government
expenditure of 456.8 billion marks (259.5 billion dollars), the
government would have to cut the deficit to 56.4 billion marks (32
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
German officials have ensured that Germany would be able to
meet the budgetary limit of the planned single European currency
both in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union Maastricht Treaty, EU states must
bring their budget deficits to no more than three percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in order to qualify for the single
currency, the Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1,
1999.

Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH).
</P>
<P>
The mission, with a mandate of one year until November 30,

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The high incidence of
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) played a significant role
in the growth of HIV in South Africa, the Medical Research
Council said today.
</P>
<P>
"The high prevalence of STIs is a major factor in the rampant
growth of HIV," South African Press Association quoted the
council as saying.
</P>
<P>
Describing STIs as the iceberg under the country's AIDS
epidemic, it said about a quarter of the population might have at
least one type of STIs.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) leads to AIDS (acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome).
</P>
<P>
The council said much of its research into the prevention of
AIDS is now focusing on STIs. The effective treatment of STIs had
reduced HIV infections by 42 percent in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Council researchers had found that 77 percent of sex workers
and more than half of pregnant women in the Hlabisa community in
Kwazulu-Natal had at least one STIs.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of HIV infection is also high, with half sex workers
being infected, 16 percent of pregnant women, and 24 percent of
women attending family planning clinics," the council said.
</P>
<P>
Half of Hlabisa women suffering an STIs experienced no
symptoms and did not seek treatment. The rest sought treatment in
a relatively late date. Of those doing so, only a quarter
received the correct drugs.
</P>
<P>
Mass media campaigns are required to bring the need for
treatment against STIs to the attention of communities, and the
use of condoms to prevent such infections should also be
encouraged, the council said.

Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), as the regional party was
indicted by the report for being linked with the 1991
assassination of the former Congress party leader.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government, which needs the support of the
Congress party to survive, has firmly rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
In a four-page letter delivered to President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan earlier tonight, Congress party President Sitaram Kesri
conveyed his party's decision to withdraw support to the Gujral
government but opposed dissolution of the Lok Sabha (the lower
house of Indian parliament).
</P>
<P>
Staking Congress' claim to form a new government, Kesri said
the party was sure of proving a majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
He said the Congress leadership was unanimous on the decision
to withdraw support for the Gujral government with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later, Kesri said his party was forced to
do so because the United Front did not respect the sentiment of
his partymen. He appealed to the secular forces in the country to
support the party in forming a new "secular" government.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Congress party withdrew support for his
government, Prime Minister Gujral tendered resignation of his
council of ministers to the president.
</P>
<P>
The president accepted Gujral's resignation and asked him to
continue as caretaker prime minister "until alternative
arrangements are made."
</P>
<P>
In a brief letter to the president, Gujral denounced the
Congress party for asking him to drop the three DMK ministers for
"totally unjustifiable reasons."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "unfair and unethical" to tarnish the fair name
of a party or to blame the party only because of a report.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Atal Behari Vajpayee, senior leader
of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the party was
keeping options open to form a new government and a final decision
would be taken tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was critical of the Congress party's decision to
withdraw support to the United Front government, saying that "the
government could have been brought down in the floor of the Lok
Sabha."
</P>
<P>
That would have given an opportunity to the Congress party to
tell the nation why it was bringing down the government besides
allowing Gujral to reply to it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a bid to prevent either the BJP or the Congress
party from coming to power, a delegation of the 13-party United
Front tonight presented letters to President Narayanan soon after
the withdrawal of Congress support, saying they will not support
formation of a government headed by the BJP or Congress.
</P>
<P>
United Front convener N. Chandrababu Naidu, who headed the
front delegation, said in a letter to the president: "I wish to
state on behalf of the United Front that in the event of an
exercise of forming an alternative government, the United Front
stands committed not to extend support to any government headed by
BJP or support by BJP or any government led by the Congress
party."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the political focus has now
shifted to the presidential palace where the president will
consider claims and counter-claims of various parties to form a
new government in the next couple of days.

<HEADLINE> 33 Islamists Sentenced to Death in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish court today sentenced
33 Islamists to death for their involvement in an arson attack
four years ago, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A ruling handed down by Ankara State Court said that they had
attempted to break Turkey's constitutional order by using force.
</P>
<P>
These defendants were charged with the 1993 arson in central
Turkey's Savas city, some 300 kilometers east of Ankara, in which
37 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were liberal Muslims and often at odds with
these defendants, who favored a pure Islamic rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
The attack caused grave concern among the secularists, who
later urged the Turkish judicial organs to stop such violence.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Welfare Party, however, expressed its
dissatisfaction with the sentence, calling the court ruling
"politically motivated."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has adopted a series of strict measures
to curb the rapidly expanding fundamentalism in the secular
republic.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Turn Deadly Desert into Oasis (2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
Their most powerful argument is that China in recent years has
invested billions of dollars into petroleum exploitation in Tarim,
and is now looking for new oil reserves in Lop Nur.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said, geologists recently discovered a sylvite
mine near Lop Nur with an estimated reserve of 250 million
tons. China is now spending about 600 million U.S. dollars each
year on potassium chloride imports.
</P>
<P>
"A road that crosses Lop Nur is indispensable for exploiting
oil and sylvite here," said Wang Mili, a 56-year-old geologist who
is an expert on Lop Nur.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the huge difficulties his water program would
inevitably meet in construction, He said that nuclear technologies
could be used for the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
"If this idea comes true, Lop Nur, a former nuclear testing
ground, will become the biggest beneficiary of China's nuclear
achievements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the Lop Nur region, with an area
equal to the Republic of Korea, used to have China's second
largest inland lake.
</P>
<P>
The region was desertified after a course shift of the Tarim
River more than 2,000 years ago, and has since been regarded as a
"forbidden zone."
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Peng Jiamu, a noted scientist from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, was reported missing in Lop Nur. Yu Chunshun, an
explorer from Shanghai, was found dead in the desert in June of
1996.
</P>
<P>
From 1964 to 1981, China conducted 23 atmospheric nuclear tests
at Lop Nur. The Chinese government agreed to a moratorium on
nuclear testing last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Says Peace Will Prevail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan believed
that peace will prevail in the Middle East despite the current
deadlock due to Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Peace is "a strategic choice" for the Jordanians, and it will
prevail in the region at last, said Hussein while outlining his
policy at the opening session of the 13th parliament.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive peace depends on restoration of justice, the
inalienable rights of concerned sides and adherence to signed
agreements and commitments, the king told the 80 members of the
House of Representatives, elected on November 4, and the 40
royally appointed Senators.
</P>
<P>
While blaming the Israeli government for blocking the peace
process due to its intransigent policy, King Hussein contended
that the determination of the Israeli people to realize peace will
"eventually win over all obstacles."
</P>
<P>
Jordan is keen on cooperating and coordinating with all the
Arab countries, especially Egypt, to save the peace process
among the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will continue to support the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in particular, to realize the legitimate rights of
the Palestinians to establish an independent state on their
national soil with Jerusalem as its capital, the king added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that all obstacles to peace will be
overcome at last and peace will prevail, so that the whole region
will go for progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed the peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and is one
of the two Arab countries after Egypt to conceive peace with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Turn Deadly Desert into Oasis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have put
forth a bold project to turn the country's most deadly desert zone
into an oasis with water from the Qinghai and Tibet Plateau, known
as the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
If the project is carried out early next century as scholars
expect, Lop Nur, a large desert in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, will restore its ancient appearance of a
large oasis with an abundance of vegetation and trees.
</P>
<P>
The critical part of this project is an ambitious water
diversion program initiated in 1972 by He Zuoxiu, a professor with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to He's plan, tunnels should be dug through the
Kunlun and Altun mountains on the Xinjiang-Qinghai border to
divert water from the Yarlung Zangbo and Yangtze rivers to the
Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The long ditch would cross Lop Nur, which is in the eastern
part of Tarim, and bring back fresh water that has been absent
from this region for more than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Other scholars have put forth ideas about how to restore Lop
Nur's ancient glory and prosperity as a key city on the Silk Road,
the legendary ancient trade route linking Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
One suggestion is to build a 1,000-kilometer road linking
Dunhuang in western Gansu Province and Turpan and Korla in eastern
and southern Xinjiang to the hinterland of Lop Nur, a route quite
similar to the Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
Another plan is the construction of a railway connecting
Xinjiang and its neighboring province of Qinghai with several
stations built in the western part of Lop Nur.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese government has kept quiet on the project,
its supporters say they firmly believe it will become a reality in
the near future.

JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Heavy confrontations
erupted this afternoon between Palestinian protesters and Israeli
security forces in Bethlehem and Ramallah, two cities of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
At Bethlehem checkpoint near Rachel Tomb, a large number of
Paletinian protesters threw stones at Israeli troops who
responded with volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
About 40 protesters were wounded during the clash and some of
them were sent to a near hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were taking part in a solidarity march with
Palestinian prisoners, which started from the red crescent in
Bethlehem. The confrontation erupted when the protesters arrived
at the checkpoint near Rachel Tomb.
</P>
<P>
The clash is still going and more Palestinian policemen are
rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, hundreds of Palestinians taking part in the march
to demand the release of Palestinian prisoners also clashed with
the Israeli security forces at the entrance of Ramallah and no
casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), about
5,000 Palestinians are now detained in various Israeli jails and
many of them are held as administrative detainees without any
charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today met with visiting Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both Saddam and Zyuganov emphasized the
need for maintaining friendly and cooperative relations between
Iraq and Russia, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said the world needed a powerful and active Russia "to
achieve international equilibrium."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president also expressed his appreciation for
the Russian initiative sponsored by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, saying that Iraq would sincerely and seriously cooperate
with Russia to make the overture a success.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government decided on October 29 to expel
U.S. inspectors in the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,
triggering its crisis with the United States.
</P>
<P>
To avoid military solution, Russia called on Iraq to
cooperate with the UNSCOM and allow U.N. weapon inspectors,
including American members, to return to Baghdad to resume their
mission, while Russia promised Iraq that it would help make
the sanctions imposed on Iraq eased or lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government agreed a week ago to allow the UNSCOM,
including its American members, to return to Baghdad to resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
Saddam also welcomed a Russian State Duma (Lower House of
Parliament) decision in support of lifting the seven-year-old
embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who arrived here Thursday, underscored the
necessity of lifting the embargo to clear the way for the
resumption of traditional bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian Communist Party backed the Russian
government's decision to help lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was present at the
meeting.

<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that since China and New Zealand forged
diplomatic ties 25 years ago, relations between the two countries
have developed smoothly thanks to efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during a meeting with New Zealand Prime
Minister James Bolger earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he was pleased to see Bolger again after his visit to
New Zealand in June.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his New Zealand visit, Zhu said that New Zealand is
advanced in economy, sciences and technology, which impressed him
deeply and remained fresh in his mind.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed gratitude for Bolger's efforts in developing
bilateral ties, and said he hopes that Bolger would do more in the
continuous development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
ties between China and New Zealand, Zhu said, adding that New
Zealand is the first country to reach agreement with China on its
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). He expressed his
appreciation for New Zealand's support.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed belief in the prospects for mutual cooperation in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Bolger attributed the more extensive and deeper development of
bilateral ties to China's reform and opening-up drive, and the
tremendous changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Now, the bilateral ties are on a solid basis, Bolger said,
hoping that the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries would continue to advance.

</P>
<P>
China will continue to improve its investment environment and
encourage foreign businesses to make investment in his country.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also touched upon the recent financial
situation in Southeast Asia and its subsequent impact. Zhu said
that China's RMB has been stable, and in fact, it has revaluated
while maintaining its stability.
</P>
<P>
Facing the devaluation of currencies in Southeast Asian
countries, China will take measures to increase the
competitiveness of its commodities export and its absorption of
overseas funds, and it will not nor has the necessity to resort to
ways which will make the RMB devaluate.
</P>
<P>
Bolger left here later this afternoon after winding up his
China visit.

<HEADLINE> Snail Fever Incidence Declines in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The population of chronic
snail fever patients in China has decreased by more than 43
percent since 1989, and 227 of 400 counties that reported cases
have wiped out this epidemic.
</P>
<P>
These figures came from a national conference on the prevention
and cure of snail fever, also known as schistosomiasis, which
convened here today. Snail fever causes chronic anemia and organ
infection.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that since 1990 the average number of
people catching snail fever has dropped by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun said at today's conference that
China has achieved remarkable success against snail fever, but
much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
Snail fever remains out of control in 118 counties, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments in regions with a high incidence of snail fever
should further enhance prevention efforts against the disease, and
spare no effort to improve the medicare network in rural areas,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said special funds for preventing snail fever should be
efficiently managed to avoid waste or embezzlement, and that
effective measures should be taken to guarantee working and living
conditions for people engaged in snail fever prevention.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention of snail fever is a major event that has great
significance to public health, economic growth and social
progress. Governments at all levels must coordinate their efforts
to ensure success," she said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorates will
focus on corruption in governmental bodies and judicial offices, a
top official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Local procuratorates at different levels must immediately

</P>
<P>
More corruption cases inside governmental organs and judicial
offices have been reported in recent years, although judicial
departments have cracked down on such crimes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, from January to October this year,
Chinese procurators' offices had investigated and punisheded
12,420 officials. Of those, 2,312 ones were above the county

<HEADLINE> Digital Color TV Sets Developed In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first generation of
digital color TV sets, developed by the Hangzhou West Lake
Electronics Group Ltd., were put on market today.
</P>
<P>
The digital color TV sets are first of their kind to be put on
the Chinese market and the technical level is equal to advanced
international standards, according to an appraisal report
submitted by the National Quality Test Center for Radio and
Television Products.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the simulation technology to produce color TV
sets in the 1980s. A research group sponsored by the state
electronic industrial sector was set up in 1988 to develop digital
color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
The West Lake Electronics Group, which adopted German
technology, developed the software handling the CPU (central
processing unit) and digitalized the TV set's picture and sound.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is based in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, thus becomes China's first producer of digital
TV sets, which have two product types: CD2978PN and CD2988PN. The
two types both have high-quality picture and sound.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: EU Entry Still Beyond Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite years of efforts to
join the European Union (EU), Turkey still strives by all means
for even a candidacy -- but the hope seems to be very slim.
</P>
<P>
Turkey pressed hard on the issue during Thursday's visit by
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, whose country holds
EU's term presidency, in the last chance before the EU leaders
will finalize key issues for the body's expansion in a
mid-December meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Juncker made it clear that Turkey must make concessions in
areas of human rights, Cyprus problem and the dispute between
Turkey and Greece, an EU member, to see a hope possible in the
Luxembourg EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Turkey officially applied for EU membership in 1987, but its
drive has suffered repeated setbacks despite a customs union
agreement reached with the EU in 1995.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report prepared by the European Commission excluded
Turkey from the ranks of the prospective candidates for EU
membership, making Ankara very angry.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials, including Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
himself, paid shuttle visits to EU members over the past two
months. But all the efforts failed to produce any progress.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the largest economic power in the EU, has ruled out
any possibility for the EU-Turkish talks at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's bitter relations with Greece also make the EU
countries hesitant to support Ankara's stand, fearing to bring the
thorny Cyprus problem into the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island
following a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara showed its tough side by refusing any
concessions in principles.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem threatened a
drop of Turkey's EU membership bid if the EU still says no to
Ankara's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Some Turkish ministers said it does not mean the end of the
world for Turkey to be an outsider of the EU, suggesting further
relations with countries like Russia, Japan, China or India
instead.
</P>
<P>
But analysts regard these threats or suggestions as merely
tactics to catch EU's attention.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, as a rather weak economy, relies heavily on financial
and technical help from the EU. Thus, it won't give up easily its
years of efforts for full EU membership, they said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has expressed the belief
that his country is bound to be a full EU member no matter what.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the EU, which is reluctant to accept Turkey
at present, will never completely stop its contacts with Turkey
regarding the membership issue, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The European bloc, they continued, can not afford to ignore the
fact that a pro-Western Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, is a key player in southeastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets New Zealand Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today that since China and New Zealand forged
diplomatic ties 25 years ago, relations between the two countries
have developed smoothly thanks to efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during a meeting with New Zealand Prime
Minister James Bolger earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he was pleased to see Bolger again after his visit to
New Zealand in June.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his New Zealand visit, Zhu said that New Zealand is
advanced in economy, sciences and technology, which impressed him
deeply and remained fresh in his mind.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed gratitude for Bolger's efforts in developing
bilateral ties, and said he hopes that Bolger would do more in the
continuous development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
ties between China and New Zealand, Zhu said, adding that New
Zealand is the first country to reach agreement with China on its
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). He expressed his
appreciation for New Zealand's support.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed belief in the prospects for mutual cooperation in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Bolger attributed the more extensive and deeper development of
bilateral ties to China's reform and opening-up drive, and the
tremendous changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Now, the bilateral ties are on a solid basis, Bolger said,
hoping that the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries would continue to advance.
</P>
<P>
Bolger offered his congratulations on Hong Kong's smooth return
to its motherland and appreciated the "one China, two systems"
policy adopted by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present situation of and prospects for China's
economic development, Zhu said his country's economy is making
healthy advances.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate has dropped to a very low level, Zhu
said, adding that China's economy will continue to grow at a rate
of eight to nine percent a year in the coming several years until
early next century.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to improve its investment environment and
encourage foreign businesses to make investment in his country.
</P>
<P>
Bolger left here later this afternoon after winding up his
China visit.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Optimistic About Chinese Medicine's Treatment for AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists plan to
conduct medical research on the effectiveness of traditional
Chinese medicine in treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS), saying they are "cautiously optimistic."
</P>
<P>
By using a prescription including several herbal medicines on
AIDS patients, researchers will focus on measuring the increase of
CD4 positive cells, which indicates the human immune function, and
the decrease of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
Scientists will use AZT, a commonly-used AIDS drug, in another
patient group for comparison.
</P>
<P>
The compound prescription includes herbal medicines that can
clear away heat and toxic material and improve the human body's
immune functions, said Guan Chongfen, head of the research
group. Among the herbal medicines are bupleurum, milkvetch,
Chinese angelica and licorice.
</P>
<P>
"Although we use traditional Chinese medicine, all of the
criteria adopted to appraise curative effects will be Western
medical standards," said Guan, who is also leading an
immunological research group in the Chinese Academy of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM).
</P>
<P>
Results of clinical research and immunological methods in the
past decade have proved TCM about 40 percent to 50 percent
effective in treating AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
"But now we need to conduct a more scientific and objective
appraisal on curative effects," she said, adding that the current
research is part of efforts to make TCM more reliable and credible
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Testing viral load by measuring increased or decreased
quantities of HIV in the human body is a new and commonly accepted
method to decide whether a drug is an effective treatment against
AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
Guan, who has been involved in researching AIDS treatment with
TCM methods for about 10 years, said she was "cautiously
optimistic" about the research.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with Western medical treatment which focuses on
attacking HIV, TCMs emphasize more on improving the patient's
immunity to block the virus," she said.
</P>
<P>
"TCMs also have fewer harmful side effects, and are more
affordable than those drugs," she said.
</P>
<P>
Guan said TCM therapy is facing great challenges because
researchers are still not very clear about how TCM treatment works
against AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, said he hopes that China and New Zealand will
make joint efforts to push forward bilateral relations on the
existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Li made his remarks during a meeting with New Zealand Prime
Minister James Bolger here today.
</P>
<P>
Li warmly welcomed Bolger, who arrived here Thursday on an
official visit to China at Premier Li Peng's invitation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is different from New Zealand in
social systems, cultural traditions and ideology, but that the two
countries have developed bilateral ties by increasing high-level
exchanges of visits and expanding economic and trade cooperation
since the two forged diplomatic ties 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand share identical or similar views in
international affairs, Li said, adding that New Zealand supports
China in lots of major issues, for which Chinese government is
appreciative.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable progress in bilateral relations is connected
closely with Bolger's efforts, Li said while expressing his
gratitude to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand have enjoyed a wide range of common
interests and have a vast potential for cooperation, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said that New Zealand highly values relations
with China and bilateral ties that have advanced during the past
25 years, adding that New Zealand will make even greater efforts
to improve the friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said he has been looking forward to Li's upcoming visit
to his country to attend the celebration activities sponsored by
New Zealand to mark the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at today's meeting were Li Xueyong, chairman of
the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of
the State Science and Technology Commission; Huang Guifang,
Chinese ambassador to New Zealand; and Yang Jiechi, assistant
foreign minister of China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Called Not to Lose Hope in Overcoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today said people should not lose hope in overcoming the monetary
turmoil because the Indonesians are not the only ones affected by
it.
</P>
<P>
"If success in overcoming is still not there, please do no
dwell in hopelessness as that would in itself brings disaster and
as if there are no longer other way-outs," the president said
aboard the plane which flew him back to Jakarta from Medineh,
Saudi Arabia, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto pointed out that South Korea, whose economy is
stronger than Indonesia's, is also experiencing the monetary
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said it was therefore why the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Forum) leaders' informal meeting in Vancouver, Canada,
on November 24-25 had to give attention on how to overcome the
monetary turmoil which affects a number of APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the globalization, there is no a single country
which could stay alone, making partnership cooperation more
important in overcoming various problems," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other Southeast Asian nations have been
hitting badly by the monetary crisis since early July this year.
The value of Indonesian rupiah has dropped by more than 40 percent
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the crisis, the Indonesian government has taken
many measures, including seeking long-term loans from the IMF and
other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Hong Kong High-tech Startups Budding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- When FinaTech was founded by
two young men in 1991, no big customer wanted to do business with
this high-tech startup, which struggled to apply real-time
information technology into high-risk derivative transactions.
</P>
<P>
Now FinaTech has designed ten software programs on futures,
options and other derivative instruments for such leading data and
information suppliers as Reuters. In fact, it is Reuters' only
supplier of these financial engineering products in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The change was dramatic, but as FinaTech's managers said,
without an incubation program sponsored by the Hong Kong Tech
Center, they could have failed in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
FinaTech joined the three-year program in 1995, which is aimed
to help high-tech startups by reducing operating costs in the
beginning years till they become full-fledged to jump into market
competition.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest help for us is on the marketing side," Lam Hon
Shing, FinaTech's business development manager, told Xinhua in an
interview. "It is difficult for a small and new company to gain
trust with big customers, but being an incubatee of the Tech
Center boosts our image."
</P>
<P>
Now there are 35 incubatees like FinaTech, who can enjoy the
lower-than-market rentals and other assistance in marketing,
finance, technology and management inside the Tech Center.
</P>
<P>
Every three months, five or six more high-tech budding
companies picked up from 150 applicants join the incubation
program, said Dr James Liu, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Industrial Technology Center Corp (HKITCC).
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to turn young people with technical expertise into
successful managers and entrepreneurs," said Dr Liu, who was happy
to see that the incubation program has started to bear fruit in
three years' cultivation.

<P>
A graduate company from the incubation program started with
four people, FinaTech left the Tech Center with 16, and now
employs 300 staff members in Hong Kong and China's inland
areas. It has expanded its manufacturing facilities to Southern
China's Guangdong, where 200 workers produce multi-lingual pagers
for emerging markets in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Under the program, high-tech startups can concentrate their
scarce resources on research and development of new products,"
said S. C. Mok, president of Display Research Laboratory, also an
incubatee in the Tech Center. His company strives to develop core
technology for computer display, which has won the 1997 Hong Kong
Industry Award.
</P>
<P>
The incubatees pay 25 percent of the market rentals for offices
in the beginning year, 50 percent in the second year, and 75
percent in the final year.
</P>
<P>
Mok said: "The step-by-step process helps us go through
difficulties in the initial stage, while at the same time makes us
quickly adapt to the market competition after graduation."
</P>
<P>
Dr Liu pointed out: "When Hong Kong's labor-intensive
manufacturing base has moved to the lower-cost Chinese inland
areas and Southeast Asia, Hong Kong's industry has to readjust its
direction to high value-added, and knowledge-based products."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong should develop those technology-intensive industries
that could be firmly rooted in the city and not move away to areas
with cheaper labor and rentals," he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Hong Kong is one of the world's leading film
producers -- a competitive edge in developing multimedia and
interactive video products, said Dr Liu.
</P>
<P>
The incubation program covers four technology areas of focus,
which Dr Liu said are where Hong Kong's advantage lies, namely
multimedia and networking, telecommunications software and
systems, and microelectronics and components.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic about the future of Hong Kong's high-tech
industry. "The development of a high-tech company needs capital,
management and technology know-how," said Dr Liu, "it is not
difficult for a market as open as Hong Kong to meet the need."
</P>
<P>
"The key problem is for investors to realize that high-tech
industry is the trend of the time, and is way to enhance Hong
Kong's competitiveness," he finally said.

CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran became the last team to
qualify for the 1998 soccer World Cup finals after drawing with
Australia 2-2 in a play-off in Melbourne on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran won on more away goals although the two sides tied 3-3 on
aggregate. In their first encounter in Tehran, the squads tied
1-1.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1978 that Iran reached for the
finals and only the second time in history.
</P>
<P>
Australia seemed to be close to booking their tickets to France
after striker Harry Kewell scored in the 32nd minute and
midfielder Aurelio Vidmar netted in the 48th minute to give the
Socceroos a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
But Iran's Karim Bagheri exploited a defensive mix up to pull
one back in the 77th minute. Three minutes later Khodadad Azizi
ran through to beat Aston Villa's Mark Bosnich one-on-one before
slotting the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
An Australian record crowd of almost 100,000 watched the match
at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

<HEADLINE> HK Shoppers Swarm in Bankrupt Yaohan Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
bargain-hunters are swarming into Yaohan department stores across
Hong Kong today for a final cash-and-carry sale before the failed
chain locks its doors for good.
</P>
<P>
Local police are keeping order as thousands of people queued
behind barricades outside the Yaohan store in the town of Shatin
in the "New Territories", one of the chain's nine stores in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Inside, shoppers rummaged through clothing, shoes and household
items at cut-rate prices. Many of the shelves were picked clean by
midday.
</P>
<P>
"Not much to buy inside anyway," one woman complained on her
way out of the store. But a man following her said: "The prices
for many goods have been cut by 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
Yaohan Department Stores went into liquidation a week ago over
its inability to repay its debts. Yaohan, owned by the Japanese
Wada family, expanded aggressively in the 1980s but saddled with
debt, was forced to file for court protection from its creditors
in September of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 2,700 workers who were laid off by Yaohan Department Stores
in Hong Kong have urged the related authorities to make up for
their losses.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after the Labor Department of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region's government ruled that the
unpaid workers, including 1,700 full-time employees and 1,000
part-timers, could be compensated directly from the Central
Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the Hong Kong Retail Management Association announced
that it had found 1,250 retail job vacancies for Yaohan's
discharged employees in the past seven days, noting that it,
together with the Labor Department, continues to help the
discharged workers find new jobs as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Marketplace Has More Players: ACI President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent Asian market
volatility highlighted the fact that the marketplace today
comprises a much wider rage of participants than simply banks,
monetary authorities and corporate customers, a financial market
dealer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers today have to react to the activities of not only "this
traditional base of participants" but also new influences on the
market -- "the wide array of international investment
institutions, hedge funds and proprietary trading accounts",
Eugene Prim, president of the ACI -- the Financial Markets
Association, told Asia Forex 97, an annual ACI event which kicked
off Friday.
</P>
<P>
Every major international investment fund is an active
participant in the marketplace, using the foreign exchange markets
to hedge their vast holdings of bonds and equities or to increase
or decrease the exposure weighting of specific currencies in their
portfolios, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly the case in respect of their holdings in
emerging markets "where liquidity in the capital markets is often
poor and there is a lack of derivative instruments to assist them
in this process", said Prim, who is also a senior manager from
Kredietbank Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Hedge funds and proprietary trading accounts are performing
similar functions, Prim added.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with the criticism that managers of such funds
were intentionally "throwing world markets into disarray." "They,
like us, have shareholders or investors to answer to," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He described the turbulence Asia has weathered in the past
several months as "unprecedented". "The degree of volatility has
been above average," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers have had to contend with daily price movements
sometimes exceeding 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
But "we operate in a free market environment and, like it or
not, this supply and demand situation will determine the degree to
which exchange rates rise or fall," Prim said.
</P>
<P>
Given the breadth of the marketplace, Prim said, the time has
come for ACI to open the doors to a wider array of participants.
</P>
<P>
ACI wishes to be fully representative of the marketplace,
providing the central forum for discussions, education and ethics
for the entire market, not solely the small percentage that the
bank and broking community today represents, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that ACI will continue to respond to requests,
particularly from emerging market areas, to provide professional
training.
</P>
<P>
ACI is an umbrella organization for member financial market
associations. The Hong Kong Financial Markets Association, a
member association of the ACI, is hosting this year's Asia Forex
-- the 19th Asia Pacific Financial Markets Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A total of 610 financial market dealers from 37 countries and
regions attended the two-day conference.

items in leading British newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Official Optimistic About Post-Crisis Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew said here today that Southeast Asia's economies would
recover after the financial crisis that shook the region.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark at a press conference following talks with
General-Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Do Muoi.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the economies in this region may slow down their pace
in six to nine months after the crisis, but the overall economic
foundations will still remain stable.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that policies be adjusted to ensure investment in
productive activities.
</P>
<P>
The high savings rate in the region and emphasis on education
would also help the economy reverse its declining trend, he added.
</P>
<P>
The pace of recovery may be different because the regional
economies were battered to different degrees during the crisis and
the countries may adopt different measures to revitalize their
economies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Calls for Supremacy of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today called for supremacy of the constitution, saying
deviation from it would be unfair, both to the country and its
people.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no supremacy of law, it leads to rule of
individuals and law of jungle reigns supreme. No civilized society
can survive without supremacy of law," Leghari said while
inaugurating a conference on "local initiatives in development
learning and growing" here.
</P>
<P>
Legharif made the remarks at a time when Pakistan is now facing
an unprecedented constitutional crisis due to the nerve-wracking
tussle between the government and the judiciary involving Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Sha.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is not property of any individual or those who are
ruling it, rather its every citizen has equal rights under the
constitution," Leghari said after reading his written speech.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Government, Opposition and every one, in a
leading position to step forward and vow to uphold justice and
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If mistakes were committed, these should be confessed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was created to establish supremacy of law and freedom
of institutions, he said, supremacy of law should be ensured
without any consideration of personal gains and losses.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan did not come into being for establishing personal
dictatorship," Leghari said. Pakistan was created where every body
would have equal opportunities and a society based on justice
would be set up, he added.
</P>
<P>
The President said solidarity and national unity were need of
the hour.
</P>
<P>
National institutions are important, individuals may come and
go, he said, a society, without institutions, could neither
survive nor dispense justice.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Toughens Penalties on Abuses of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has toughened penalties on
illegal production and use of military and police uniforms, and
planned a major reshuffle of police ranks after a terrorist attack
in south Egypt on November 17 that killed 68 people.
</P>
<P>
English daily Egyptian Mail reported today that the unlicensed
dealing in uniforms, according to an order issued Friday by Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, carries jail terms from three to 15
years while abusing the uniforms to perpetrate crimes gets hard
labor.
</P>
<P>
The harsh penalties were imposed as part of the fence-mending
measures after the carnage in front of a Pharaonic temple in
Luxor, 560 kilometers south of Cairo, where six Islamic militants
in black police uniforms shot and slashed 62 people, including 58
foreigners and four Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
The attack has prompted another major reshuffle for police
officers following two waves of changes in the Interior Ministry
on November 19 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The new shake-ups are expected to cover around 300 officers in
the Tourism and Antiquities Police ranks which were merged after
the Egypt's worst terrorist attack for decades.
</P>
<P>
Within two days of taking office on November 19, Interior
Minister Habib el-Adli plucked out 21 of the ministry's top
security officials and over 50 police officers in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
These measures came as part of a new security plan to protect
tourist sites and strengthen closer coordination with the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri has decided to personally supervise the plan, which
will involve the ministries of defense and interior affairs and
several security bodies.

<HEADLINE> OPEC agrees to hold Producers-Consumers Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has decided to hold an oil
producers-consumers meeting on December 2-3 in Kyoto, Japan, to
discuss the demand that OPEC members pay the so-called "carbon
tax".
</P>
<P>
OPEC Governor for Indonesia Purnomo Yusgiantoro said here today
at a press briefing that the decision was made by the OPEC oil
ministers last night at a session.
</P>
<P>
OPEC consider the imposition of the carbon tax by the developed
nations as unfair, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"They (the developed nations) do not impose similar tax on the
import of coal, which also emits carbondioxioe gas," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yusgiantoro said that the Kyoto meeting is important
as it will also discuss efforts to stabilize the world oil price.
</P>
<P>
In several past OPEC meetings, the Kyoto meeting has been
proposed by Venezuela but did not get enough response from other
delegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the current 103rd OPEC Ministerial Meeting, the Venezuelan
delegation reminded the OPEC members again about the importance of
establishing a long-term strategy that will put oil price
stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far OPEC has only focused on a short-term strategy that sets
oil quota production for each individual member countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the OPEC oil ministers have agreed the increase of
production quota based on a study that world oil demand will
increase by 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) next year. On
Saturday and Sunday they will try to resolve differences over how
much the output ceilings should be. They will also elect a new
secretary general for the next three year period.
</P>
<P>
The current OPEC production ceiling set in 1995 was 25.033
million bpd. Some members proposed to increase the ceiling to 27
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Yusgiantoro also said last night's session agreed that the next
OPEC ministerial meeting will be held in Vienna on June 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd OPEC ministerial meeting started on November 26 and
will last till December 1.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's 11 member countries -- Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Algeria,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela -- attended the six-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> Per Capita Income Up Slightly in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Per capita income in Romania
was up 12 percent to reach 797,000 leu (about 101.5 U.S. dollar)
in October, the National Statistics Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The increase, against that of September, came along with a 13.1
percent monthly rise in industrial production, the government
agency said in a latest data sheet available today.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted, the total industrial output in the
year's first 10 months was equivalent to only 95.6 percent of the
production recorded in the same 10-month period last year.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the mining, energy and manufacturing sectors were
down by 11.8 percent, 10.5 percent and 2.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although the 6.5 percent inflation in October was much lower
than the high of 30.7 percent recorded in March, prices for
foodstuffs, services and medical care went up remarkably.
</P>
<P>
By media accounts, prices were up 8 to 22 percent for pork,
fruit and edible oil, and by 14.7 and 184.4 percent respectively
for postal and telecommunication services and residential heating.
</P>
<P>
In addition, medical charges shot up by 15.6 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
By the Romanian government's estimation, the year's inflation
rate could accumulate to 130 percent by the end of 1997.

</P>
<P>
The nurses in the capital city of Nairobi held a brief meeting

In a statement issued here on Friday, the registrar Muthoni
Muriithi said, "the Nursing Council of Kenya has noted with
dismay that some nurses have gone on strike despite a request by

their demands on December 3."

<P>
The Laboratory Association of Kenya Secretary General, Dan
Owiti, said that his members were supporting the nurses' strike.

<HEADLINE> 5 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon (Update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Five Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF) soldiers were wounded late Friday night in a bomb blast in
western sector of the security zone in South Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted IDF officers as reporting that the soliders
were evacuated by helicopter to Haifa's Rambam Hospital shortly
after the incident. The injuries of the five were not serious,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers were on a parole in the Tieli area when
the road bomb apparently planted by guerrillas went off.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by Lebanese resistance group
Hezbollah, its members also exploded an Israeli tank in the south
by road bomb at midnight and completely destroyed it. But no
casualties were mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy fighting erupted late Friday night in the
central sector of the security zone, the radio reported. The IDF
and Hezbollah exchanged gun fire, shelling each other's positions
with mortars and rockets. But no casualties of both sides were
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, military conflicts intensified in
the security zone. Hezbollah constantly fired rockets on IDF
positions and military posts in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The IDF gunners returned fire, while the Israeli Air Force
(IAF) fighters constantly went into actions to strike the
Hezbollah targets inside and outside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in South
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its security of the northern region.
</P>
<P>
Since January this years, about 40 IDF officers and
soldiers lost their lives in the security zone, bringing the
death toll to 225 since 1985.
</P>
<P>
As the mounting violence in South Lebanon has cost more Israeli
lives, the debate over the value of the occupation has intensified
in Israel. Among those who favor a withdrawal is Israel's northern
commander Major General Amiram Levine.

<HEADLINE> Sales Tax, Price of Fuel Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
approved rises in sales tax and fuel duties plus a second five
percent levy on income tax to raise additional revenue to pay war
veterans gratuities and pensions.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance said on Friday that
the increases in fuel duties, 20 Zimbabwe cents (1.4 U.S. Cents)
a litre on petrol and diesel, come into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
From Monday all goods and services now attracting 15 percent
sales tax will attract sales tax at the rate of 17.5 percent. The
sales tax on electricity rises from five percent to 10 percent
also on Monday, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The government also wants to raise another levy of five
percent on income tax payable by both companies and individuals,
said the spokesman. This would take effect from April 1 this
year for companies and from January 1 next year for individuals.
</P>
<P>
The new levy will raise the effective maximum rate of income
tax on individuals from 42 percent to 44 percent. For companies
the effective rate of tax on income will be 41.25 percent, up
from the present 39.375 percent.
</P>
<P>
People were phoning the daily "The Herald" yesterday to
criticize the raising of the consumptions taxes and the new levy
on income tax. Some were concerned that the move would create
divisions between taxpayers and former freedom fighters who are
going to benefit from the funds raised through the introduction
of the levy, the paper reported today.

CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's housing start-ups shrank 23 percent in
the third quarter to 11,180 homes, compared with the same period
last year, according to the latest report of the Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the July-September figures of housing
start-ups point to a quicker slowdown in the construction
industry. In the public sector there were 3,530 start-ups, down
from 5,900 in the same period last year and 7,650 in the private
sector, a fall of 1,020 on the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The data for the first nine months of the year show an
overall 12 percent decline to 34,550 in comparison to the total
for the equivalent period last year and a 33 percent fall on the
1995 number.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's aim is to construct and market
50,000 new homes each year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The trade battle between the European Union and
Israel that began four years ago with a dispute concerning orange
juice could be resolved in the near future, according to Israeli
government sources.
</P>
<P>
The EU is objecting to alleged Israeli diluting of domestic
orange juice with Brazilian oranges before exporting the produce
to Europe and thus breaching the trade agreement between the two
parties. Israeli producers deny the claim and have received
widespread backing from civil servants and politicians.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus and South Africa have signed an agreement on
avoidance of double taxation in an effort to facilitate business
cooperation between the two countries, Cyprus Weekly reported

Stavros Epaminondas, head of the Foreign Ministry's economic
division, signed the agreement with South Africa's High
Commissioner to Cyprus David Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
Epaminondas said that Cyprus could help South Africa's business
activities with Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East because of
its location.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that the agreement will help
promote business ties between the two countries, in view of the
fact that there is a strong Cypriot community in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- George Bemz, chief of German Commerzbank, has said
that the bank is to issue treasury bonds worth 144 million
U.S. dollars at the request of the Lebanese government, the

<P>
TORONTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at a gala dinner by Canada-
China Business Council (CCBC) here today:
</P>
<P>
The Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Mr. Desmarais,
Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
First of all, please allow me to thank the Canada-China
Business Council for the kind invitation which gives me an
opportunity to get together with you, friends both old and
new. Over the years, you have made positive contributions to the
development of China-Canada relations and the enhancement of
mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples. I
wish to express my sincere gratitude to you and, through you, to
all those who have cared for and supported the friendly relations
between China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to take this opportunity to give you an
overview of the situation in China and make a few observations on
the economic relations and trade between our two countries.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 this year, the Chinese Government smoothly resumed
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Since then, the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong have been maintained with
the implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which has
continued as an international trade, financial and shipping
center, is playing a positive role in the regional and world
economy.

<HEADLINE> Program Adopted to Improve Environment in Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The environment ministers
from the European Union and Mediterranean countries today adopted
an action plan to improve the battered ecology in the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The short- and medium-term Priority Environmental Action
Program was aimed at turning around the environmental degradation
in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
A statement approved by the one-day conference said that all of
the participating countries were willing to make efforts to
protect the environment in the Mediterranean and they also
demanded effective measures to improve it.
</P>
<P>
The statement said to solve the environmental problem in the
region must first of all establish integrated water resources,
management and sewage disposals, as well as integrated protective
measures along the Mediterranean. Priority items on environmental
protection should also be defined to prevent desertification.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Environment Minister Pekka Haavisto said that the
problem, which will continue to exit for several decades, could
not be resolved in a short time.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 representatives from all 15 EU and 12
Mediterranean countries attended the conference, which was part of
the "Barcelona Declaration" process.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the process launched two years ago is to set up a
free trade zone in the Mediterranean in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean countries reportedly drew more than 180
million visitors last year, accounting for more than 33 percent of
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
But the environment in the region was seriously contaminated
since a large amount of garbage and polluted water was not treated
properly.

<HEADLINE> Iran-EU Crisis Over With Return of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The diplomatic row between Iran
and the European Union (EU) will be over with today's return of
Iran's ambassador to Germany Hussein Musavian.
</P>
<P>
Musavian is the last Iranian ambassador to return to an EU
country and other Iranian envoys have been back to their missions
in respective EU states last week following the arrival of last EU
envoy to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"As a whole, despite the U.S. pressure, Europe adopted a
constructive attitude regarding Iran," the daily Iran News quoted
an expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-EU crisis was triggered by the Berlin court rule in
April which accused the top Iranian leaders of having a hand in
the killing of four Iranian Kurdish anti-government leaders in
Mykonos Restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The EU states withdrew their ambassadors to Iran in a protest
and announced to halt the "critical dialogs" with the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of both sides for a speedy resolution of the
crisis is a clear proof that "Iran needs Europe and Europe needs
Iran," Iran News said.
</P>
<P>
The French role was significant in the final resolution of
the crisis, an unnamed expert was quoted as saying, and
Iran-Total gas agreement was a turning point where both sides
realized they needed each others.
</P>
<P>
The French company Total signed a 2-billion-dollar accord with
the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) on September 28 on the
exploration of Iran's Southern Pars gas reservoir in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that more important was the EU support
for the Iran-Total deal and France's refusal to accept the
U.S. extraterritorial laws which warned to punish foreign
companies with 20 million dollars investment in Iran's oil and
gas industries.
</P>
<P>
"Now both the EU and Iran have a clean slate to resume
their normal ties based on mutual respect and interest," Iran
News said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi voiced Iran's readiness to resume "constructive dialogs"
with the European countries.
</P>
<P>
A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said recently that Bonn
expected the return of its ambassador to Tehran would be the
preamble to negotiations over all the issues of contention
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the coming in office of the new government of Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, the EU countries insist to continue
"critical dialogs" with Iran despite the U.S. sanction against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Minister of State of British
Foreign Office Derek Fatchett Wednesday also warned the U.S. that
its sanctions regime against Iran was damaging cooperation with
the EU on a common policy towards Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Britain and its EU partners were opposed "in principle" to the
U.S. extraterritorial legislation and believed it was "better not
to isolate Iran totally," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that besides the economic cooperation, the
EU countries would like to exchange views with Iran over the
issues of international terrorism, mass destruction weapon, human
rights abuses and Tehran's stance towards the Middle East peace
process.

<P>
In mid-September this year, the Communist Party of China
convened its 15th National Congress. The theme of the Congress is
to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an
all-round advancement of the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the 21st century. The Congress mapped
out blueprint for China's reform and economic development across
the century and the strategies for its economic, political and
cultural development. The general goal is to build China into a
strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally-advanced modern
socialist country by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, China has maintained a sustained
economic growth and achieved continued successes in raising the
productive forces, aggregate national strength and people's living
standards. From 1992 through 1996, our GDP grew by an average
annual rate of 12.1 percent. New breakthroughs have been made in
the reform of economic system and marked progress attained in the
economic structural readjustments. The output of grain and other
farm produce has increased steadily. Infrastructure such as water
conservancy, communications and telecommunications and basic
industry such as iron and steel and energy sectors have grown
rapidly. Science, technology, education, culture, public health
and other undertakings are flourishing. China's economic growth
is expected to be maintained at about 8 percent before the end of
this century and at about 7 percent for the first decade of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has opened wider to the outside
world. Its share in the world export market is tripled. In the
past five years, its foreign trade volume totaled over 1.1
trillion U.S. dollars, registering an average annual growth of
16.4 percent, ranking 11th in the world today. This year, the
volume is expected to top 300 billion U.S. dollars. By last
October, China had approved over 300,000 foreign-invested
enterprises in China, with its actual use of foreign investment
totaling over 200 billion U.S. dollars. Some foreign banks have
set up operational agencies in China and the insurance and RMB
(local currency) businesses are already open to foreign firms on a
pilot basis.

<P>
ROME, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the European
Rapid Reaction Forces, composed of French, Italian, Portuguese and
Spanish soldiers, was officially operational in Florence today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony for the occasion, Spanish general Juan Ortuno
Such, commander of the forces known as EUROFOR, said his soliders
were ready to carry any tasks as required by the member states.
</P>
<P>
General Guido Venturoni, chief-of-staff of the Italian
military, told a press conference thereafter that the EUROFOR
would mainly include professional soldiers from the four countries.
</P>
<P>
If needed, Venturoni noted, additional troops with specialized
capabilities would be available from these countries to help the
EUROFOR in different missions, probably in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the EUROFOR was decided in 1995 by an
agreement among the four European countries.

We are endeavoring to develop an open economy by improving the
opening-up pattern which is all-directional, multi-leveled and
wide-ranging. We will further improve foreign-related legal
regimes, protect the rights and interests of foreign-funded
enterprises according to law, grant them national treatment,
enhance the transparency of the trade regime and protect
intellectual property rights. We will quicken the pace of opening
the energy, communications and other infrastructure sectors to the
outside world and gradually open the banking, insurance and other
service sectors. China's vast market and huge potentials for
development will provide enormous opportunities for China's
economic and technological cooperation with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Canadian people
have a long history. In the hard times of the War of Resistance
Against Japanese Aggression waged by the Chinese people,
Dr. Norman Bethune -- son of the Canadian people, traveled
thousands of miles to China and laid down his life for the
liberation of the Chinese people. His noble characters have won
him esteem from China's millions.
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached importance to the development of
friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation with
Canada. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in the early
1970s, the mutual understanding between our two peoples has been
constantly deepened, exchanges and cooperation strengthened and
friendship enhanced. In recent years, our exchanges, either
bilateral or in international arena, have become increasingly
frequent. We have established the mechanism of a joint trade and
economic committee. China and Canada have become each other's
important trading partners with their two-way investment and
economic and technological cooperation expanding year by year. A
new pattern of cooperation in numerous fields, with diverse forms
and at various levels, has basically taken shape. There are now
over 3,300 projects in China with direct Canadian investment. The
key cooperation projects such as CANDU reactor are proceeding
smoothly. These successes are attributed to the joint efforts of
the business communities of both sides, as well as the vigorous
support of the two governments of China and Canada. China's market
will stay open to Canada. The Canadian business community is
welcome to make investment and do business in China.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned of US High-tech Conventional Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia is deeply concerned
about the high precision conventional weapons being developed by
the United States, a senior Russian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, a high ranking official in
charge of the department of international military cooperation
under the Russian Defense Ministry warned that the U.S. move may
lead to a new round of arms race between Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has stepped up the production of high precision and
high-tech conventional weapons and is developing the sixth
generation of weapons systems, although it agreed to reduce its
nuclear arms, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is opposed to the proposed talks on limiting the
production of sea-based conventional cruise missiles while the
negotiation on offensive strategic weapons is going on, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that some of the Russian-made
conventional weapons are by no means inferior to U.S. productions.
</P>
<P>
As Russia is faced with economic woes, it cannot afford another
arms race with America. But it is likely that Russia may be
unwillingly dragged into a new round of arms race in certain
circumstances when the situation is intensified, he added.

The development of the friendly relations and
mutually-beneficial cooperation between China and Canada will
serve not only the fundamental interests of our two nations, but
also peace and development of the Asia-Pacific and the world at
large. It is the common task for us to bring the economic and
technological cooperation between our two countries to a new
high. In this regard, I wish to propose the following:
</P>
<P>
1. View and handle our bilateral relations from a strategic
perspective with the 21st century in mind, maintain a firm grip on
our common interests and promote the friendly and
mutually-beneficial cooperation with a positive and pragmatic
approach.
</P>
<P>
2. With respective distinctive characteristics, our two
economies share a strong complementarity. We can step up
cooperation of equality and mutual benefit in the areas of energy,
communications, telecommunications, power generation,
petro-chemicals, environmental protection, agriculture and raw and
semi-finished material in the interest of common development.
</P>
<P>
3. Broaden areas and open up more channels of cooperation. The
cooperation between our two countries may be conducted in China's
coastal areas and may also be extended to its richly-endowed
central and western part. It can be conducted in our respective
countries while the possibility of cooperation in a third place
can also be explored.
</P>
<P>
I hope that the business communities of both countries will
work continuously to promote fresh and greater development in the
economic relations and trade between our two countries.

In the last few days, I have had an in-depth exchange of views
and reached broad common ground with Governor-General Romeo
LeBlanc, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and other Canadian leaders
on bilateral relations and some major international and regional
issues of common interest. The two sides fully agree that,
proceeding from the fundamental interests of our two peoples and
the larger interest of world peace and development, China and
Canada should establish a cross-century partnership of all-round
cooperation. The two sides resolve to take positive measures to
attain this goal at an early date.
</P>
<P>
My current visit to Canada has served the purpose of deepening
mutual understanding, enhancing friendship, looking into the
future and developing cooperation. The hard-working and talented
Canadian people and their enterprising spirit have impressed me
deeply. I firmly believe that with the concerted efforts of both
sides, China-Canada relations will surely be able to advance along
a sound and steady course.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, I wish to express once again, on behalf of my
wife and all my colleagues and also in my own name, our sincere
gratitude to Governor-General and Mrs. LeBlanc, Prime Minister and
Mrs. Chretien and the Canadian Government and people for the warm
and friendly hospitality accorded us.

<P>
KUNMING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The plague taking placing in
Yiliang County of southwest China's Yunnan Province has been
brought under control, according to official information reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan provincial sources say that 19 patients who suffered
from the plague, which is of a gland-related type, have all been
discharged from hospitals after having received medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
In late October this year, public health departments of Yunnan
monitored that 19 people from Xiaomuxing village and some
neighboring villages in Yiliang County had caught the plague.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government, as well as local governments of the
concerned areas, in cooperation with local health and epidemic
prevention departments, made a quick response by sending
plague-prevention and treatment experts to the epidemic occurrence
site and mobilizing the villagers to kill mice and flea,
pasteurizing and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
By November 24, the epidemic disease had been wiped out
completely. All the 19 patients suffering from the disease had
recovered and been discharged from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
No newly-infected cases have been found. The plague prevention
experts have left the epidemic occurrence site where order has
come back to normal.

MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will host in
1998 the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Ministerial Meeting on Women in Manila, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' hosting of the meeting was part of the
agreement among APEC leaders who have just concluded their fifth
summit in Vancouver, Canada, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs was quoted as
saying the meeting will review developments involving women in
APEC's agenda and determine the next steps to integrate women into
the mainstream of APEC's activities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled in response to initiatives taken by
world women leaders who first met in Manila in November 1996
shortly before the Philippines hosted the fourth APEC Leaders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The women leaders then batted for more substantive and
mainstream role in APEC affairs, but due to lack of time the issue
was not adequately addressed during the 1996 APEC meetings. The
just-concluded Vancouver APEC meetings took up the issue.

<HEADLINE> Bill to Criminalize HIV Infection Gazetted in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
now taken steps to make it a criminal offence for sufferers of
HIV to deliberately transmit the deadly virus to uninfected
people.
</P>
<P>
According to the criminal law amendment bill gazetted on
Friday, a mandatory prison sentence of up to 20 years would be
imposed on any person convicted of a sexual offence if it is
proved that the convicted person was infected with HIV which
causes AIDS at the time of the offence.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the criminal law will make provision for a
sample to be taken from an alleged sexual offender for the
purpose of ascertaining his HIV status.
</P>
<P>
The criminal law amendment bill will also seek to abolish the
presumption that boys between the ages of 12 to 14 years cannot
be convicted of rape or even attempted rape but instead must be
convicted of a lesser offence such as indecent assault or common
assault.
</P>
<P>
"Experience in the courts has shown that boys under the age of
14 years are capable of sexual intercourse and can commit all the
acts that constitute the crime of rape," says a clause in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
Another clause in the bill will seek to increase the penalties
for offences under the principal act.
</P>
<P>
According to the current estimates, an estimated one million
Zimbabweans are infected with HIV in a country of about 12.4
million people. About 500 people said to be dying every week from
AIDS.

<HEADLINE> 30 Percent of Vehicles in Sri Lanka not Roadworthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Three out of ten motor
vehicles in Sri Lanka, particularly buses, are not roadworthy,
Motor Traffic Department Commissioner D.S. Edirisinghe said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said his department will launch a vehicle re-registration
program next year to identify those vehicles that are not suitable
for road transportation.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said they were unable to phase out those
vehicles from the roads in a short period of time as that could
lead to an acute shortage of buses and badly affect public
transport.
</P>
<P>
He said many Sri Lankans try to get the maximum use out of
their vehicles even though they should be consigned to junk yards.
</P>
<P>
The country also lacks a regular system to inspect the
performance of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 1.4 million vehicles plying on the
roads. A total of 79,416 vehicles were registered and 124,500
driving licences issued last year, the commissioner said.

BUCHAREST, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said today that the reform in his country has been
on the right path and would produce fruit in the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said in a television interview that the national
economy has not been totally extricated from the difficult
situation and people's living standards have not been improved,
but the macro-economic situation in the country is improving.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the one-year economic reform, the president said the
principal achievements were the reduction of financial deficit
from 10 percent last year to the current 4.5 percent, the control
of inflation and the increase of foreign reserves from 700 million
U.S. dollars earlier this year to 2.6 billion dollars now, setting
a record since the World War Two.
</P>
<P>
But Constantinescu admitted that the reform was more difficult
than what was imagined because of the weak foundation of the
national economy and ineffective management and operation
mechanism of the government.

<HEADLINE> EBRD Playing More Important Role in Ukrainian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is apparently playing an
increasingly important role in the Ukrainian economy.
</P>
<P>
The latest sign for the financial institution's heavy presence
came from the group of seven (G7) leading industrialized nations'
request for the EBRD to administer the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
</P>
<P>
The repair of the "sarcophagus" housing the Chernobyl No. 4
reactor will begin in January 1998, the Ukrainian News Agency
quoted Yury Poluneev, EBRD director for Ukraine, as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl Shelter Fund includes 300 million U.S. dollars of
G7 donation and 39 million dollars raised by the Ukrainian
government last week during a fund-raising conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD has been the largest investor in Ukraine with a total
cash injection of 800 million dollars, half of the entire foreign
funds the country has got since its independence six years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EBRD has pledged to increase its investment to
2 billion dollars next year, so as to boost the former Soviet
republic's small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the Ukrainian part, Kiev will host the EBRD annual
conference in May 1998. And a tip of 50 million dollars will come
from the EBRD for renovate the capital's hotels and airports.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 people, including 60 prime ministers, are expected
to be flocking into Ukraine for the event, said Oleg Taranov,
chairman of the organizing committee for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also bring Ukraine many business opportunities
and a tourism boom, the Ukrainian official said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Has Yet to Reach Agreement on Quota Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- OPEC oil ministers were at
odds over how far to increase production quotas as they entered
the third day of their 103rd conference here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, Iran and Libya insisted that the 11-member
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) not raise
output quotas based on the likely demand of 1.8 to 1.9 million
barrels per day (bpd) next year, sources at the meeting said last
night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary of the Libyan Energy Commission Salem
El-Badri said no agreement on output quotas had yet to be reached.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that OPEC oil ministers would reach an
agreement on Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said OPEC
members should take into account the economic crisis in Asia,
which has an impact on oil demand in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"But we will discuss them (output quotas) with other members in
a constructive manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its meeting on Thursday, OPEC said its output was currently
around 27.2 million bpd, three million higher than the current
quota and beyond the top end of the range of exports' forecasts
for OPEC demand next year.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency said, almost all OPEC members violated their
production quotas last October with Venezuela producing 3.4
million bpd, 1.1 million higher than its quota.
</P>
<P>
But Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Jose Arrieta said here Friday
output quotas were not important issues to be discussed at the
103rd OPEC meeting, which opened here on November 26.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of other matters which should draw our
attention. For instance, the environment-related carbon tax
imposed by developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
In their Plenary meeting on Friday night, the OPEC oil
ministers also discussed the election of OPEC secretary general
and hear the OPEC Economic Commission's report. But no results of
the discussion are available this morning.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that the incumbent OPEC Secretary
General Rilwanu Lukman would be re-elected for another three-year
term.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will last still December 1.
</P>
<P>
OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges to Bring China-Canada Cooperation to New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, Canada, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today called for joint efforts to bring economic and
technological cooperation between China and Canada to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The development of friendly relations and mutually-beneficial
cooperation between China and Canada, the visiting Chinese leader
said, will serve the fundamental interests of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The relationship will also serve the peace and development of
the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, Jiang told a gala
dinner here hosted by the Canada-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
He made three proposals, as follows, on further advancing the
two countries' cooperation efforts:
</P>
<P>
-- View and handle bilateral relations from a strategic
perspective with the 21st century in mind, maintain a firm grip on
common interests and promote the friendly and mutually-beneficial
cooperation with a positive and pragmatic approach.
</P>
<P>
-- Step up cooperation of equality and mutual benefit in the
areas of energy, transportation, telecommunications, power
generation, petro-chemicals, environmental protection, agriculture
and raw and semi-finished materials to help common development.
</P>
<P>
-- Broaden areas and open up more channels of China-Canada
cooperation. The cooperation may be conducted in China's coastal
areas, extended to the country's richly-endowed central and
western regions, or in both countries or possibly in a third place.
</P>
<P>
With respective distinctive characteristics, Jiang noted, "our
two economies share a strong complementarity."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the business communities of both China and Canada
will work continuously to promote fresh and greater development in
economic relations and trade between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien today said he wants the economic relationship between
Canada and China to "grow still stronger."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gala dinner here attended by visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Chretien noted: "The Canada-China economic
relationship is growing."
</P>
<P>
"But at the risk of appearing greedy, let me say that we want
it to grow still stronger," he told the event hosted by the
Canada-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
"I know you feel the same way," Chretien told Jiang and hailed
the achievements made by the Chinese government "in meeting the
economic needs" of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Canada welcomes new business opportunities in China. And we
also warmly welcome Chinese investment in Canada," Chretien told
more than 1,200 Canadian and Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Canada and China established full diplomatic relations in
1970. "Times have changed. But friendship and understanding remain
at the heart of the Canada-China relationship," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"Business, trade and investment have, in recent years, become
the most dynamic aspects of our partnership," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the dinner, Jiang said: "China's market will
stay open to Canada. The Canadian business community is welcome to
make investment and do business in China."
</P>
<P>
"The development of the friendly relations and
mutually-beneficial cooperation between China and Canada will
serve not only the fundamental interests of our two nations, but
also peace and development of the Asia-Pacific and the world at
large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, on his part, said, "China is a very important part of
that Pacific neighborhood. And as good neighbors, we are working
as partners on issues that bring us together and those that
separate us."
</P>
<P>
"Since the landmark Team Canada visit in 1994, both the dollar
value and scope of our trade have increased," he added. "Indeed,
if we include Canada-Hong Kong trade, China is now our third
largest trading partner."
</P>
<P>
"Canadian business is eager and excited about China's vast
economic potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Canada and China enjoy a growing economy. According to the
International Monetary Fund, the Chinese economy should grow 9.5
percent this year while Canada's economy is running at close to
four percent.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary investigations
conducted by Colombo police in connection with a recent raid on a
Tamil rebel shelter have revealed that the LTTE's next economic
target was either the Colombo Port or the city's major oil depot,
police said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police raided a shelter of members of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
One rebel suspect was captured and another committed suicide by
swallowing a cyanide capsule when police stormed their hiding
place.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have found evidence that the rebels were
targeting either the Colombo Port, the economic center of Sri
Lanka, or an oil depot of the Sri Lanka Petroleum Corporation in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels bombed the Fort area in the center of Colombo
on October 15, killing 18 people and injuring more than 100
others.
</P>
<P>
One month later, they planted several magnetic explosive
devices on four fuel tanks of Sri Lanka's biggest thermal power
plant in an attempt to destroy the whole station. Some of the
devices exploded and caused fire, which was brought under control
within about 30 minutes.
</P>

ROME, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy's economy showed growth of
1.9 percent in the third quarter over the same period last year,
the Italian central statistics bureau ISTAT said today.
</P>
<P>
ISTAT said the third quarter's growth came from all sectors,
including services and heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the figure, if confirmed by official data on
December 31, should result in annual gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of more than 1.2 percent for the whole 1997.
</P>
<P>
This trend could guarantee a 2.2-2.3 Percent GDP growth next
year, according to a government forecast.
</P>
<P>
However, Some analysts also pointed out that the glooming
situation of consumption and employment could curb the development
trend of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the Japanese automobile's exports due to the
slump of Japanese Yen could also threaten Italian economy, which
put the auto industry on the top priority, they added.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Prudent in Increasing Production Quota: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Ida Bagus Sudjana said
here last night that OPEC's production quota for the year 1998 was
discussed prudently in view of all macro conditions such as
expansion of the oil market and a tendency toward sluggish
economic growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
After a plenary session of the 103rd OPEC conference here,
Sudjana said that differences of opinion among OPEC's members
still prevailed on the projection of next year's market demand.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said OPEC decided that production quota would not
be discussed in a multilateral manner but through bilateral
consultations among OPEC member countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Sudjana, there were varying opinions about OPEC's
oil production next year. Certain quarters wished to increase
production quota to 27 million barrels per day (bpd) at the
minimum and others expected that the quota would be raised to 26
million bpd at the maximum.
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis is feared to influence the oil market
development in the world as many observers could foresee the
economic growth in same Asian countries would decrease from seven
percent to only about four percent," Sudjana said.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana believed that OPEC should increase production quota to
26 million bpd because a higher quota could make oil prices drop
drastically.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's official quota set in Vienna last June was 25.033
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd OPEC ministerial meeting started on November 26 and
will last till December 1.
</P>
<P>
OPEC currently consists of 11 countries -- Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Export Up by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's export has
registered a 20.3 percent growth in the first three quarters this
year, government sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said all major export items recorded growth, except
rubber and petroleum products, which saw declines due to high
domestic demand for rubber as a raw material and temporary closure
of a petroleum refinery for routine maintenance at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment exports showed the highest growth (27.9
percent) during the period, followed by tea (20.2 percent),
coconut products (18.8 percent), gems (15.5 percent) and minor
agricultural products (14.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the growth to a further increase in
manufactured product exports, which reflected industrial expansion
and improvement in work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's import growth rate dropped from 22.2
percent during the corresponding period last year to 17.8 percent
from January to September this year, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Car Bombs Injure Four in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Two car bombs,
allegedly planted and detonated by drug traffickers, injured four
people in two Colombian cities today.
</P>
<P>
One of the explosions, taking place here outside a naval school
this morning, caused slight injuries to three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It struck at a time when this city was hosting the third
meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Caribbean States
Association (CSA) attended by officials from 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
Initial police investigation indicated that the vehicle, used
as the shell of the bomb, was packed with 30 kilograms of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first bomb blast, another car exploded near the
Burger Station fast food outlet in the west of Medellin, causing
the injury of a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Police blamed drug traffickers for the attacks, apparently in
retaliation against the national legislature's recent approval of
a law on the extradition of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The law, once decreed, would allow the extradition of the
traffickers on the wanted list of a foreign nation.
</P>
<P>
The explosion promoted authorities to tighten up security
measures around the venue of the CSA forum, which was inaugurated
Thursday night and scheduled to conclude tonight.

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes New U.N. Civilian Police Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 28 (Xinhua)-- The Canadian government today
welcomed the decision of the United Nations Security Council to
create a new U.N. Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH).
</P>
<P>
The mission's mandate is to assist the government of Haiti in
supporting and contributing to the professionalization of the
Haitian National Police. It has been formed in response to a
request by the president of the Republic of Haiti to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for further support for the
development of the Haitian National Police.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations police mission in Haiti is an entirely new
mission that is clearly adapted to Haiti's special and evolving
circumstances," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believed that the new mission established today and the
resolution that authorizes it are evidence of the continuing
commitment of the international community to assisting Haiti as it
continues these early, important steps along the road to stability
and development as a democratic nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the current U.N. Transition Mission in Haiti
(UNTMIH) expires on November 30 when most of the participating 600
Canadian Forces members will return home. A small number will
remain in Haiti until Canadian equipment have been returned to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 50 Canadian civilian police officers now serving in
Haiti with MITNUH will return to Canada, while others will
continue to serve with MIPONUH. The new mission will comprise up
to 300 civilian police officers, some of whom will form a security
unit to provide assistance to the personnel of the Mission and to
protect its property.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Helsinki and Lillehammer
agreed on Friday to bid jointly for the 2006 Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"Two strong winter sporting countries -- Finland and Norway --
now offer the international Olympic movement the opportunity for
high-class Winter Olympic Games in 2006," the City of Helsinki
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Helsinki lacks the terrain for the alpine skiing events, so it
invited Lillehammer, which hosted the 1994 Winter Games, to join
its bid. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided in
1990 to allow Games to be split between hosts.
</P>
<P>
If successful, Helsinki would be the first city to host both
summer and winter games. It hosted the Summer Olympics in 1952.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the opening and closing ceremonies, the
skating events, hockey and curling to be held in Helsinki, with
the alpine skiing, bobsleigh and luge events, and exhibition
snowboarding held in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
Nordic skiing, biathlon and ski-jumping and freestyle skiing
would be held 100 km north of Helsinki at Lahti.
</P>
<P>
Nagano, Japan, will host the next Winter Games in February, and
Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States is host for the 2002
Games.

yen on Aug. 11, 1992.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Decides to Keep Human Rights Team in Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today decided to go ahead with a human rights mission
probing alleged massacres of Rwandan refugees in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The move came after meetings between team leaders and the
government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Annan was
threatening to withdraw the team out of the country after being
frustrated by months of delay of the team's probing.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to President Laurent Kabila, which was written
Thursday, Annan said, "The team will now proceed with its work."
He added the team was being kept in the country because of the
"positive and constructive outcome" of meeting it had with
officials of the Congo government.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission was set up to probe allegations that forces
loyal to Kabila or his Rwandan allies had massacred Hutu refugees
during the seven-month campaign that brought him to power in May.
</P>
<P>
The team arrived in Kinshasa in August. Since then it has been
waiting for the permission from Kabila's government to begin
investigations in the field.
