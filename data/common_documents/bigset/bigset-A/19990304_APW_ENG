<HEADLINE>  Hunter: `Sometimes You Want to Cry' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter felt  
more nervous walking on the field at spring training Thursday than 
he ever did in a World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hid his jitters, as he did during his pitching career,  
and strode confidently, if gingerly, on and off the field in his 
first public appearance since being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's 
disease four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an overpowering right-hander, Hunter couldn't shake hands  
firmly with former teammates, but he had big hugs for them as he 
participated in pregame ceremonies at the New York Yankees' 
exhibition season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time in my life I was nervous walking on the  
field,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right. It's just my hands and arms don't work  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with typical Catfish humor, he added: ``There's not too  
much muscle there left. But I never had too much to start with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hunter has severe weakness in both his arms and  
hands a year after suffering early symptoms of the progressive, 
neurological disease, formally called amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. He relies on his wife and childhood sweetheart, Helen, 
to dress him and feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you want to cry,'' he said, ``other times you just  
look around and you're thankful that you're living. The main thing 
is, maybe there might be a cure for it one of these days, years or 
whatever. Maybe I can last that long. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people who are a lot worse off than I am. A lot  
of people say, 'Well, you've got this disease, there's really no 
cure for it.' But you never know, there might be a cure right 
around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his spirits are up, Hunter briefly choked up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got my kids,'' he said before pausing, his eyes misty as he  
held back tears. ``That helps. I've got one grandson. It looks like 
he might play ball. His name's Taylor, and he's 3. He's got a ball 
in his hand right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he tries not to worry too much about how fast the  
deadly disease might progress, about how it eventually might put 
him in a wheelchair and wipe out his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get teary-eyed a little bit more than I used to,'' he said.  
``But it might be along with age, too. The main thing is, you only 
live one day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stays busy on his farm in Hertford, N.C., 600 acres of  
cotton, peanut, corn and bean fields and 400 acres of woods. He 
also goes to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore once a month 
or so for treatment and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit around, you think too much,'' Hunter said. ``Like Dick  
Williams said about pitching, 'If you start to think, you're always 
in trouble.' The best thing is not to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Yankees camp, Hunter visited with Williams, his manager  
with the Oakland Athletics. Before the game, he also sat with 
former pitching stars Whitey Ford and Mel Stottlemyre in manager 
Joe Torre's office, swapping stories and laughing with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yankees manager Clyde King and fellow North Carolina  
buddy Jerry Narron, a catcher with the Yankees in Hunter's last 
season, visited Hunter and his wife at their farm a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was busy redecorating his house, but came out to greet  
them and showed them around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't believe his attitude. He was smiling and upbeat  
and positive,'' King said. ``We expected the worst. Maybe he'd be 
sitting in a chair. But I'll tell you, he lifted our spirits. We 
went down there to cheer him up, and we left there cheered up. 
That's Catfish for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, a right-hander, won 224 games in a 15-year career with  
the Yankees and Athletics, including a perfect game in 1968. He had 
a string of five straight 20-win seasons and won the AL Cy Young 
Award in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Goose Gossage, who came out of the bullpen more than a few times  
for Hunter late in his career and who is now a special pitching 
instructor for the Yankees, had tears in his eyes when he spoke of 
Hunter's illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hits too close to home,'' Gossage said. ``It kind of shocks  
you. It's scary. We're all thinking of him. Really, I think about 
him all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of competitor that Cat was on the mound is going to  
go right into what he's got to battle now. I don't know how he's 
coping with it. But I'm sure that if anybody can cope with it, he 
can. Because of the competitor he is, and because of the 
personality that he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALS is named for Gehrig, the Yankees' Hall of Famer who died  
from the disease in 1941 at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 30,000 Americans have the disease, which attacks  
nerves in the spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, 
causing progressive paralysis leading to death.

<HEADLINE> Europe Angered at U.S. Trade Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union filed a complaint against the  
United States before the World Trade Organization on Thursday, 
saying U.S. moves to impose sanctions in a dispute over bananas 
violate global trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, European targets of the sanctions, from prosciutto  
producers to cashmere companies, accused the United States of 
trying to destroy their industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration notified U.S. importers that they are  
liable for hefty tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods in 
retaliation for European barriers on banana imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says American banana companies lose $520  
million annually in sales to Europe because of illegal trade 
barriers that favor bananas imported from former European colonies 
in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed to stand, the U.S. tariffs would double the cost of  
the targeted goods, pricing them out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has asked the WTO to invoke a special process under which  
the United States and the 15-nation EU trading bloc would have 20 
days to settle their differences. If they failed, the EU could then 
ask the WTO to rule on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Lader, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, was summoned for a  
meeting Thursday in London with Stephen Byers, Britain's Trade and 
Industry Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue the dialogue to try and find a working  
solution in the context of the extraordinary friendship between our 
two countries,'' Lader said later. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers reported Friday that Lader's summons by the  
government was the first such formal protest for a U.S. ambassador 
to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade Minister Brian Wilson called the U.S. action  
``potentially catastrophic'' for the British cashmere industry, 
which is concentrated in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people there are saddened and utterly bewildered that the  
United States should attack them in this way over a dispute which 
has absolutely nothing to do with them or their industry,'' said 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Italy's consortium of Parma ham producers, Stefano  
Fanti, accused the United States of unfairly targeting Italy to 
pressure the EU to modify its banana import system. Some 98 percent 
of prosciutto in the United States comes from Italy, and 94 percent 
is Parma ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Products from 13 of the EU's 15 nations risk being hit by the  
tariffs. These include Italian and Greek pecorino cheese, French 
handbags, German coffee makers and British biscuits. The 
Netherlands and Denmark have been spared because they sided with 
the United States in the trade dispute.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says a financial overhaul  
bill proposed by the Senate Banking Committee chairman fails to 
protect consumers and would hurt community lending laws -- and he 
would veto the legislation if it is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday expressed  
the administration's ``strong support'' for a bipartisan compromise 
bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration in principle supports legislation  
that would lift the Depression-era barriers between banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. But the White House has 
threatened to veto several versions in recent years that took an 
approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is more in  
line with the views of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than 
those of the administration. The bill calls for most new financial 
activities to be conducted by affiliated companies within bank 
holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's Senate banking panel and the House Banking Committee  
were voting today on amendments to two separate financial overhaul 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph Nader and other 
consumer advocates have expressed concern that the legislation, by 
allowing banks, brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more 
deeply into each other's businesses, could bring a dangerous 
concentration of economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act ... 
a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore hope 
in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto the bill if it is presented to me in its current  
form,'' the president said in the letter, dated Tuesday and 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton wrote, the bill would ``provide inadequate  
consumer protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official cited as an example a provision in  
the compromise House bill, but absent from Gramm's, that would 
require banks selling securities to make sure they are appropriate 
for a consumer's income and circumstances. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, in response, insisted that his proposal would not weaken  
the community investment law that banks must follow, but would 
``restore its integrity.'' The 1977 law requires banks and thrifts 
to lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the law led him to block financial  
overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning days last fall. The 
legislation had squeaked through the House in May by one vote, 
214-213. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his new proposal, banks would not have to get a  
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to set up 
holding companies to conduct new financial activities.

<HEADLINE> New Jordanian Prime Minister Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Abdullah has designated a seasoned  
politician and confidant of his late father to be Jordan's next 
prime minister and form a new government, state-run media said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Raouf Rawabdeh, a longtime proponent of King Hussein's  
liberal outlook and a supporter of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with 
Israel, will get the top spot, the Petra news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet was to be announced later today, once Prime  
Minister Fayez Tarawneh formally submits his resignation to the new 
king, according to Petra, the mouthpiece of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	An official in Tarawneh's office, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the Cabinet has held its last meeting, during which 
Tarawneh and his ministers signed a resignation letter to be 
submitted to Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	The government change is Abdullah's first major executive  
decision. It was expected and seen as part of a widespread shuffle 
in senior public posts, including positions within the royal 
palace, police and intelligence. Tradition dictates that a serving 
Cabinet resigns when a new king comes to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, 37, King Hussein's eldest son, ascended to the throne  
hours after his father died of cancer Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawabdeh, a 60-year-old member of Parliament, consulted late  
into Wednesday night with potential Cabinet ministers, palace 
sources told The Associated Press on customary condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear when the king designated Rawabdeh, who has held  
several Cabinet portfolios in the past three decades, to be the 
next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawabdeh, who was close to Hussein, also is known to be close to  
Prince Hassan, who was replaced as heir to the throne less than two 
weeks before Hussein died. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after taking office, Abdullah rejected the resignation of  
the present 23-member Cabinet headed by Tarawneh, who took office 
last August. Government officials said then that Abdullah was first 
consulting with aides and statesmen on the country's future 
political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The palace sources said Abdullah has asked Rawabdeh to bring in  
a Cabinet of technocrats and liberal politicians to jump start 
economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a country barren of natural resources, is saddled by  
$6.1 billion in foreign debt. Unemployment is at 15 percent, 
inflation is 6 percent and about a third of the country's 3.8 
million people live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawabdeh was elected in the country's first nationwide vote in  
1989 to the 80-seat lower house of Parliament, and has served there 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	For 18 months beginning in February 1997, Rawabdeh served as a  
deputy prime minister. Rawabdeh is from a prominent Jordanian 
family from the northern town of Sareeh.

<HEADLINE> 'Saving Private Ryan' Wins Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan''  
won the top movie award from the Producers Guild of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Since inception of the awards in 1989, the top movie winner has  
gone on to win an Academy Award for best picture every year with 
the exception of 1995 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' is nominated for 11 Oscars.  
</P>
<P>
	The PGA awards were announced Wednesday night. In television,  
David E. Kelley won for producing the series ``The Practice,'' 
which also won three Golden Globes and three Emmys. Kelley was also 
nominated in the same category for ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In non-series TV, Tom Hanks won the PGA prize for HBO's ``From  
the Earth to the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks was also awarded the Nova Award for most promising  
television producer for his ``Moon'' project. The Nova Award for 
movie producing was given to Peter and Bobby Farrelly for ``There's 
Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg also took home the Milestone Award honoring historic  
contributions to the motion picture industry.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Don't Necessarily Help Studios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Oscar can jump-start a career, boost box  
office or get its director, producer or stars a better table at the 
hottest restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	But it can't protect a movie studio from going belly up.  
</P>
<P>
	Three studios and one production-acquisition house with films  
receiving Academy Award nominations this year are either dead or 
face uncertain futures, the result of corporate upheaval in the 
movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	PolyGram Films and its specialty label Gramercy Pictures have an  
armload of Oscar nominations: Gramercy's ``Elizabeth'' with seven 
nominations including best picture and PolyGram's ``What Dreams May 
Come'' with two nominations for its stunning visuals. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Seagram Co. purchased the PolyGram parent PolyGram NV,  
the domestic distribution offices of PolyGram Films are being shut 
and foreign operations melded into Seagram-owned Universal Studios. 
Gramercy is likely to be sold or folded into another studio, 
perhaps Universal's specialty label, October Films. 
</P>
<P>
	That is if October Films stays in the Seagram family. October,  
whose ``Hilary and Jackie'' picked up nominations for actresses 
Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, is another candidate to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, most of the operations of long-struggling Largo  
Entertainment, which produced ``Affliction,'' were closed by its 
corporate parent, JVC Entertainment of Japan, just days before two 
of its actors, Nick Nolte and James Coburn, received Academy Award 
nominations for best actor and supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the back-room turmoil won't be evident on the  
screen. The films will remain in release, with vigorous advertising 
and Oscar campaigns. The executives who got the boot will probably 
get new jobs and, this being Hollywood, higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But it does give some insight into how things work in the movie  
industry -- to a degree how they've always worked -- in this 
community that novelist Budd Schulberg likened nearly 60 years ago 
in ``What Makes Sammy Run?'' to a gold rush boom town whose chief 
products are movies, ambition and fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bittersweet,'' said Barr Potter, Largo's chairman and  
chief executive, who will remain at the company to help with the 
shutdown. ``It's just an example of the extremes that one goes 
through in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was, perhaps, worse in the early 1990s, before the start of a  
Hollywood economic surge. Consider that the 1991 best-picture 
winner was ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' whose producers picked up 
the Oscars while the film's studio, Orion, was in the throes of 
bankruptcy. The movie also won Oscars for director Jonathan Demme, 
co-stars Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster and screenwriter Ted 
Tally. But with the Hollywood economy showing signs of cooling, and 
movie production costs continuing to soar, fear and uncertainty are 
as strong as they have been in years. Many studios, worried about 
staking too much on a single picture, are entering into financial 
partnerships with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of deals are done with more and more frequency,''  
said Miramax West Coast President Mark Gill, whose studio's 
best-picture nominee ``Shakespeare in Love'' is being financed and 
released in a partnership with Universal Studios. ``The rivalries 
are put aside, frankly, to moderate risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the co-production deals and the shifting corporate  
ownership of studios and their art house divisions, lines are now 
blurred all over the Hollywood map. It isn't always clear who 
should get credit -- or who will be around this time tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the tale of this season's second costume drama, about  
the behind-the-scenes intrigue during the reign of England's Queen 
Elizabeth, has plenty of its own real-life drama behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth'' began life as a Working Title production for the  
Dutch-owned film and music company PolyGram NV, the same 
producer-studio partnership behind the Oscar-nominated ``Four 
Weddings and a Funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced for about $22 million, ``Elizabeth'' was distributed  
through PolyGram's Gramercy Pictures, which handles lower-budget, 
artier films. After becoming a hit last September in the United 
Kingdom, the film came to the United States, where it built an 
audience and endeared itself to the Academy, which nominated it for 
the seven Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	But a cloud has hung over Gramercy ever since Seagram, the  
Canadian liquor and entertainment giant, purchased PolyGram last 
year for $10.2 billion. Seagram already had a Hollywood studio in 
Universal and a specialty division in October Films, and suddenly 
PolyGram and Gramercy were looking expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram sold off pieces of PolyGram -- MGM got most of the film  
library, a company called Carlton Communications Inc. got the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, a Saudi prince, Muhammad Bin Bandur Abdul Aziz, was  
reportedly willing to pay $400 million to $600 million for the rest 
of PolyGram, but the deal never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	So Seagram merged PolyGram's international businesses with  
Universal and started laying off employees in the domestic PolyGram 
office, leaving Gramercy in limbo. Gramercy still could be sold, or 
it could be merged into October Films. 
</P>
<P>
	But studio officials remained committed to ``Elizabeth,''  
despite the uncertainty. There was a vigorous Oscar campaign and a 
healthy marketing push, including television ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also has received a strong distribution commitment; it  
has been put in expanded release since the Oscar nominations, 
earning a modest box-office boost from the Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also caught in the Seagram-PolyGram whirlwind is ``Hilary and  
Jackie,'' which was released by October Films, whose own future is 
hardly clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade papers have reported that media mogul Barry Diller, who  
had purchased Universal's television operations from Seagram, may 
have his eye on October, though a sale to Diller has reportedly 
been rejected by October's partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Just who will ultimately own and control October remains a  
question, though the film is shielded from the turmoil. It, too, 
has an Oscar campaign and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the major players would comment beyond a recent  
Universal statement that ``the process of integrating PolyGram 
Filmed Entertainment into Universal's film operations has now 
begun'' and that Gramercy's fate, like that of PolyGram's video and 
TV operations, is ``still currently under evaluation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More coldly certain is the fate of PolyGram Films' U.S.  
distribution offices, which didn't survive Oscar season, even as 
its Robin Williams film, ``What Dreams May Come'' competes for 
awards for art direction and visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
	People started clearing out their desks last month in the  
Beverly Hills offices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the corporate parents are still behind the film, which is  
getting a strong Oscar campaign in ads in the trade papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Largo's shutdown was long expected. Formed 10 years ago, it had  
produced or acquired ``G.I. Jane,'' ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' 
and ``Affliction.'' But it has struggled in recent years; JVC 
stopped its production financing last year, leaving Largo 
essentially a sales agent. Then last month, JVC discontinued even 
those activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affliction,'' however, got a big Oscar push and remains in  
theaters (the movie is being distributed by Lions Gate). In the 
meantime, executives are mopping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no specific plans at the moment,'' said Potter. ``I'm  
focusing on tying up all the loose ends. And once that's behind me, 
I'll be making every effort to find my next situation and explore 
any interesting opportunities.''

<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Many food worshippers struggling to shed  
pounds are coming to a new revelation: They are losing weight 
through prayer and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no fasting. Instead, participants in The Weigh Down  
Workshop, a program taught by volunteers in churches throughout the 
country, use prayer and Scripture to fight the temptation to 
overeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scripture helps us get through that time when we're  
struggling,'' said Ron Hornbeck, a devotee of the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dietitians and theologians, however, say people must be  
careful about mixing faith and dieting. They say some people may 
get wrong, even dangerous messages. Believing that God loves or 
favors only those who are thin trivializes faith, they say, and 
psychological problems that sometimes underlie obesity may require 
medical or dietary interventions, not just prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the skepticism, Christian diet programs are  
growing rapidly, becoming a major player in the $40 billion a year 
weight-loss industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Weigh Down Workshop began taking its message to churches  
six years ago, more than 250,000 people have attended its workshops 
worldwide. And founder Gwen Shamblin has sold nearly 1 million 
copies of her book, ``The Weigh Down Diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Place, another Christian health and diet program, has  
spread through more than 10,000 churches. Overeaters Anonymous is 
also a spirituality-based program. 
</P>
<P>
	There are others, each with a different approach, but their  
message to overeaters is united -- substitute a love of God for a 
love of food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why America is so overweight is that they've been  
told dieting is the key,'' said Shamblin, a registered dietitian 
who lives in Franklin, Tenn. ``But dieting only makes people focus 
on the food. God will provide a way of escaping overeating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her plan sounds simple, almost too simple: Eat when you are  
truly hungry, and eat just to feel full. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea came to her after watching a thin friend eat, noticing  
that she finished half of a hamburger and then started to wrap it 
up. That's what led Shamblin to practice what she now preaches. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends that since God created all food, there are no ``bad  
foods.'' She cites Bible verses such as Colossians 2:16, which says 
``let no one pass judgment on you in question of food and drink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God didn't put bacon on this Earth and make it smell so great  
to tell you that you couldn't eat it,'' Shamblin said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an appealing approach to dieters tired of following  
regimented eating plans or those afraid of the effects of 
controversial diet pills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been on a lot of other diet programs and I had to give  
up so much,'' said Pam Denman, now a workshop organizer in Toledo. 
``I thought that just isn't fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under this weight-loss plan, nothing is off limits -- not even  
cheeseburgers, fried chicken or chocolate cake. There's no counting 
calories; there are no exercise videos to mimic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always been taught that fat foods are bad, but  
Scripture tells us no food is off limits,'' Hornbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are doubters. Nutritionists question the wisdom of  
allowing dieters to have a menu without restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to be careful with that to make sure a person  
gets enough fruits and vegetables in their diet,'' said Shirley 
Kindrick, director of Comprehensive Weight Management at Ohio State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everybody knows how to choose what they should eat,'' she  
said. ``It's knowing what's appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she also gives credit to the idea of getting up from the  
dinner table when full. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the time we eat on autopilot and we end up eating more  
than we realize,'' Kindrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others argue that weight disorders from obesity to anorexia  
often have psychological components that should be treated 
professionally, not simply through prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these is theologian Mary Louise Bringle, author of ``The  
God of Thinness,'' who has urged Christian dieters to improve 
fitness as they work at controlling their weight. She also stresses 
self-acceptance, saying overweight people should not believe God 
loves them less. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the Weigh Down program go through 12-week  
workshops in which Shamblin says they learn to ``transfer a 
relationship with the refrigerator to a relationship with God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They watch videotapes and read Scripture during the course,  
which costs first-timers just over $100. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Knotts and her husband, Jack, both say their faith in  
Jesus Christ helped them quit smoking. Now they hope their devotion 
and the workshop will help them take off a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think God wants us to be healthy, or healthier, and this is  
a way,'' said Mrs. Knotts. ``I think we tend to overindulge, but I 
don't think God wants that.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rise Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose for a third consecutive day Thursday,  
reaching their highest in nearly two months, on sudden declines in 
U.S. inventories. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline also rose 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures tumbled, while grains futures  
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude continued its trek higher, with prices having gained more  
than 10 percent this week, as investors interpreted inventory data 
as a sign that prices had finally bottomed out and could begin to 
move sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported earlier this week that  
inventories plunged a sharp 5.903 million barrels last week to 
326,751 million barrels, confounding expectations for an increase 
and erasing what had been a year-over-year surplus in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventories now are 1.01 million barrels below levels at the  
same time last year despite what continued oversupply by some of 
the world's top producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline and heating oil futures also were boosted by  
Tosco Corp.'s decision to shut its Avon refinery in California, 
which touched off a scramble for crude products in the West. Cash 
prices in the Northeast market rocketed higher as those holding 
supplies were content to wait for higher prices that may come as 
demand shifts westward. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures investors also are concerned gasoline destined for the  
important Northeast market might be diverted west as the peak 
demand season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for April delivery rose 42 cents to $13.35 a barrel at the  
New York Mercantile Exchange; April heating oil rose 1.25 cents to 
34.80 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 1.35 cents to 
41.26 cents a gallon; April natural gas rose 3.9 cents to 1.762 for 
each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled nearly 6 percent in heavy selling on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York, posting new 11 1/2-year lows 
in a continued rout tied to oversupply and weak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures have been on the defensive for months, pressured  
by bumper world supplies and fears Brazil, the world's largest 
grower, would export large amounts of its crop to help ease 
economic problems and bring in hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
	May sugar fell .35 cent to 5.50 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures jumped on the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S.  
Agriculture Department reported exports in the past week of 1.14 
million metric tons, well above the highest analyst estimate of 
900,000 metric tons. The report put shipments to date 19 percent 
above the previous marketing year's pace and ahead of the USDA's 
estimate of a 15 percent increase for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat export sales came in at 702,900 metric tons, also well  
above expectations of 400,000 metric tons being shipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also were supported by an increasing number of analyst  
reports that estimate spring plantings will fall sharply over the 
previous year, as farmers plant more lucrative soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures followed wheat higher early, but retreated at  
the end of the session as nervous traders eyed bumper crops from 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	May wheat rose 2 cents to $2.62 1/2 a bushel; May corn rose 2 1/4  
cents to $2.17 per bushel; May soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.68 per 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets closed lower Thursday on  
negative local news, but the region's largest exchange, Tokyo, 
bucked the trend and showed a slight gain on lower interest rates 
and a stronger U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 13.09  
points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 14,183.45. On Wednesday, the 
average had climbed 249.30 points, or 1.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates and a stronger dollar boosted investor  
confidence, with export-related shares soaring on hopes that gains 
by the dollar would help them earn more on overseas sales. Japanese 
products are more competitive abroad when the yen falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen for a second straight day,  
following a decision from Japan's central bank on Wednesday to 
lower short-term interest rates to a record low of 0.02 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.58 yen in late afternoon trading, up 1.40  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 121.77 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares fell slightly as investors found little  
motivation in the government's budget plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 9.64 points, or 0.10 percent,  
to close at 9,912.76. The index rose 8.92 points or 0.09 percent on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation that the Hong Kong government was negotiating with  
Walt Disney Co. about building a theme park here may be good for 
the economy in the long term, but there was little in the budget to 
spur investor confidence right now, said Jerry Pang of HSBC 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares fell as foreign investors sold amid renewed  
pessimism over Thailand's bankruptcy law. The SET index lost 4.37 
points, or 1.3 percent, to end at 337.14. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell on continued selling of consumer-related  
and market heavyweight Telkom shares. The JSX Composite Index fell 
1.653 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 394.154. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares fell as investors locked in profits after a  
two-day surge. The PSE index fell 11.24 points, or 0.6 percent, to 
close at 1,997.68. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose on buying of blue chips. The Composite  
Index rose 3.36 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 516.59. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares fell as investors cashed in on the market's recent  
four-day rally. The KOSPI fell 2.20 points, or 0.41 percent, to 
close at 532.29. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares fell on a weak bond market and an overnight drop  
in Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index fell 4.6 points, or 0.2 
percent, to close at 2,885.3. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares rose on buying of property-related stocks. The  
STI rose 17.60 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,433.41. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares fell as speculators cashed in earlier gains. The  
Weighted Price Index fell 9.40 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 
6,393.74. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose on buying of market heavyweight Telecom

<HEADLINE> Lost Dog Returned Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Marie Bennett had given up on  
finding Bear, a chocolate Labrador retriever apparently stolen from 
her yard in southern California four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last month came a stunning call from the animal control  
office in San Diego: Bear had been found alive and well, wandering 
the countryside of northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely could not believe it,'' Mrs. Bennett said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	How the dog made it halfway across the nation remains a mystery.  
How to get her back was shaping up as another, until sympathetic 
pet lovers started talking on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear disappeared early in 1995 from the Bennetts' fenced-in  
front yard in Campo, Calif., 60 miles east of San Diego. The gate 
had been pried open. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-February, animal control officer Al Benson of Osceola  
County, Mich., picked up a stray dog roaming around the small town 
of Evart. 
</P>
<P>
	The faded tag numbers on the dog's collar led him to San Diego's  
animal control office, which traced the license. Mrs. Bennett 
telephoned Benson a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said they didn't have the means to have the animal shipped  
out there,'' Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He consulted local pet groomer Bev Neiber, who posted a notice  
on an Internet mailing list for groomers and breeders. A relay ride 
to drive Bear home couldn't fill all the gaps, so Mary Lemp, 
another groomer in Salinas, Calif., contacted Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline waived shipping costs, which would have been around  
$200, spokeswoman Debby Burroughs said. A kennel in Mecosta County 
donated a shipping crate and a veterinarian in Reed City updated 
Bear's shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear was on her way home Feb. 22.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful having her back,'' Mrs. Bennett said. ``It  
amazed me how many people got involved in this. If they hadn't, 
we'd have never known that Bear was still alive.''

<HEADLINE> Fierce Winds Kill 3 in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Residents of the Northwest and South picked up the pieces today  
after storms lashed both regions with damaging wind, rain and snow, 
knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people. Three people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving winds and likely tornadoes blew across several Southern  
states Wednesday, destroying homes and downing power lines. Nearly 
a foot of snow fell in parts of the Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old Alabama man died when winds estimated at 60 mph to  
80 mph uprooted a tree and slammed it into his trailer home in 
Millbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you just heard a big boom,'' said a neighbor,  
Stephanie Cleckler. ``Glass started flying everywhere ... that's 
when everybody started screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 45-year-old North Carolina woman was killed when winds threw a  
tree onto her car near Hendersonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The fierce winds slammed into a steel mill construction site  
south of Richmond, Va., mangling a half-dozen trailers and injuring 
16 workers, authorities said. Ten remained hospitalized with neck 
and back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expecting this, needless to say, at least not to  
this extent,'' State Police Lt. G.W. Taylor said. ``There was a 
combination of wrecks, vehicles that wouldn't go, snow, ice and 
strong winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 20 inches of snow were predicted to fall in far western  
Maryland, where near whiteout conditions forced the temporary 
closure today of about 30 miles of Interstate 68. Allegheny Energy 
in Hagerstown said about 2,000 customers in its five-state region 
were without power this morning, down from about 24,000 overnight. 
Schools in five area counties were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, the storm knocked out power for more than 100,000  
in North Carolina after leaving 8 inches of snow in the mountains. 
Most were back in service by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Northwest, Washington Gov. Gary Locke declared a state of  
emergency in five western counties after a punishing storm with 
wind gusts of 68 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves measured 35 feet in steady 60 mph winds. A 36-year-old man  
was killed when a tree fell on the car about 30 miles north of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was knocked out to more than 200,000 people, though most  
had it restored by early today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two routes used by thousands of Seattle commuters to  
traverse Lake Washington was still closed today after its 
drawbridge malfunctioned. It wasn't expected to be fixed until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds also canceled passenger ferry service in the Puget  
Sound area Wednesday morning, affecting about 45,000 people. Better 
weather was expected for the region today. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Washington coast, heavy seas combined with high tides to  
temporarily flood downtown Raymond with up to 2 feet of water. Two 
apartment complexes were evacuated, and nearly 40 people sought 
shelter at a Red Cross facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, heavy seas pushed the wreckage of a beached cargo  
ship back to shore in Oregon. The oil-laden bow section of the New 
Carissa broke free of a tug Tuesday night and drifted 50 miles to a 
beach near Waldport. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of storms late Tuesday also damaged homes in Texas and  
Florida. Several people were hurt in Texas' Jasper County, where 
twisters nearly demolished six homes and damaged as many as 25 
others. A tornado in the Florida Panhandle damaged about 55 homes, 
with 20 sustaining major damage.

<HEADLINE> GOP To Push Tax Cut to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They may not know it yet, but Americans want  
and deserve a tax cut, House Republicans fervently believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree with pollsters and pundits who say Americans don't  
care about tax relief,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, 
told a Capitol Hill tax rally Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls in recent months have consistently ranked  
the GOP's signature issue low among priorities that Americans have 
for Congress in these booming economic times, far below such 
matters as ensuring that Social Security remains solvent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armey said that because Republicans have agreed with  
President Clinton to set aside 62 percent of projected budget 
surpluses to fix Social Security, the real debate is over whether 
to use the rest to cut taxes or increase government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the choice is seen that way, the American people  
overwhelmingly come out on the side of cutting taxes,'' Armey said. 
``What we want to do is heighten people's awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of substantial tax cuts plan to hold dozens of town  
hall meetings around the country, issue newspaper opinion pieces 
and use broadcast advertising to press their case. Twenty outside 
groups ranging from the Chamber of Commerce to the Christian 
Coalition will join the effort, holding rallies and forums and 
promoting lower taxes on radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Democrats now insist that 77 percent of the  
surplus be used to shore up both Social Security and Medicare, with 
the rest to be used for small, targeted tax relief and more 
spending in areas such as education. Republicans are scrambling to 
prevent Democrats from using that argument to muscle aside broader 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a question of who has the best P.R. machine,'' said  
Evan Liddiard, a partner in the KPMG accounting firm's national tax 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans frequently argue that federal taxes now consume 21  
percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the highest ratio 
since World War II. But the Treasury Department counters that the 
burden on the middle class is at a 20-year low and that the rise in 
tax collections is mainly due to sharp increases in incomes for the 
wealthy driven in part by the surging stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation tamed, unemployment low and tax refunds from the  
Internal Revenue Service running well ahead of last year's levels, 
many analysts say it will be tough to sell Americans on a major tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an awareness of the need to prioritize,'' said Ellen  
Nissenbaum, legislative director at the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities. ``You cannot make a compelling case for the need for 
tax cuts compared with the need to strengthen Social Security and 
Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are also trying to sort out which specific tax cuts  
to push. Most in the GOP now agree that a 10 percent cut in income 
tax rates won't happen and are looking at various alternative 
packages of more targeted, less costly reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the latest, by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Rep.  
Jerry Weller, R-Ill., would, among other things, eliminate the 
``marriage penalty'' paid by many couples compared to their taxes 
as singles, phase out estate taxes, raise personal exemptions in 
the income tax and lift Social Security earning limits for seniors 
who want to work. Total cost is about $341 billion over five years.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Rise to $861 Bil / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $5.91 billion to $861.81 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $4.64 billion to $708.75 billionfor the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund

</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.450 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.451 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose to  
4.37 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.34 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.36 percent from 4.37 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.47 percent from 4.44  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.46 percent from 4.47 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
61 days, down from 58 days in the previous week, IBC Financial Data 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks

Wednesday, down from 2.18 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts

<HEADLINE> What To Do About Microsoft? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A prominent trade group in the technology  
industry, traditionally loath to involve the government in its 
business, is endorsing in a secret report the breakup of Microsoft 
if the company loses its landmark antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how the proposal might affect government lawyers,  
who are pondering what to do about the software giant as the trial 
moves into the final stages -- with the growing likelihood of an 
eventual ruling at least partly against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the bitter courtroom fight, there is genuine  
apprehension in Washington about tinkering with the awe-inspiring 
success of a company that employs 27,000 people, recorded $14.4 
billion in sales last year and whose Windows software runs most of 
the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Software and Information Industry Association made its  
recommendations in a report sent to Justice Department lawyers 
after a vote by its board. 
</P>
<P>
	The group proposes what some legal experts call the  
``death-penalty'' for Microsoft if it loses -- splitting it up into 
companies selling separate products, such as Windows software and 
Internet content, or breaking it into three or four ``Baby Bills'' 
or ``Mini-Microsofts'' each with identical products. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said a breakup ``deserves the most careful attention  
of the government and the court.'' But it doesn't distinguish which 
breakup plan it recommends, calling it ``ultimately an antitrust 
policy question with no clear answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft says it is premature to consider choices it could  
face. Spokesman Greg Shaw called the described remedies ``little 
more than wishful thinking by our competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the government prevails, its once-bitten lawyers will be  
mindful of their own previous, failed efforts to muzzle Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few months after Justice last forced Microsoft to agree  
to tone down its aggressive behavior, Bill Gates met with 
executives of a business ally who asked him about his apparently 
uncharacteristic surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``This antitrust thing will blow over,'' the company's  
billionaire chairman answered, according to the meeting's notes. 
``We haven't changed our business practices at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 1995 consent decree, endorsed by the same judge in the  
ongoing trial, didn't stop Microsoft from bundling its Internet 
software into Windows, a central issue in the current case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 agreement instead focused on encouraging competition  
for operating systems. But it's clear that Microsoft was more 
worried, by then, about the Internet's emerging threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was closing the barn door after the horse was down the road  
in another city,'' quipped Richard Gray, a California antitrust 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's crystal ball was not as clear as  
Microsoft's,'' agreed William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at 
George Washington University. ``Microsoft outmaneuvered them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Justice's  
antitrust sister agency, last week urged the government to 
``proceed cautiously in breaking up'' dominant high-tech companies 
like Microsoft, known in the industry as an 800-pound gorilla. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to level the playing field ``is to kill the  
gorilla, and the government doesn't want to do that,'' said Michael 
Cusumano, co-author of a book on Netscape's fight with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever they decide, government lawyers will need to persuade  
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who's expected to 
issue a verdict this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sits back and realizes, they want me to change the future  
direction of this industry for the next 20 years,'' said Kovacic. 
``And he realizes this is maybe the most important industry we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it loses, Microsoft's future could include behavioral  
restrictions, such as disclosing its prices or facing new limits on 
deals with computer makers and Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers acknowledge they also are seriously  
considering a requirement that Microsoft allow other companies to 
modify Windows and sell it themselves, so-called ``compulsory 
licensing.'' Critics warn that could lead to future, incompatible 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's breakup proposal is significant because  
Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the 1,400-member 
group, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association. Its 
board includes executives from Netscape, Oracle Corp., IBM Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington group ``concludes that a structural  
reorganization of Microsoft can avoid the drawbacks associated with 
conduct-based, behavioral relief,'' such as a need for constant 
government oversight and the risk that Microsoft might look for 
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's executive director, Ken Wasch, declined to comment  
on the report. But Wasch, a frequent Microsoft critic, said he 
considers untenable the idea of compulsory licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft would have every incentive to ensure the licensees  
are defeated in the marketplace,'' Wasch said. ``Why would anybody 
buy into that, pay for the privilege of getting crushed by 
Microsoft?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it wins, the government has urged the judge to organize a  
special hearing to consider Microsoft's fate.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Jump Forward; Dow Up 135.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in late morning after  
IBM announced a $16 billion sales agreement with Dell Computer. The 
market was also helped by strong retail sales data and a report 
that new unemployment claims reached a 10-year low in February. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 135.02 at 9,410.90, after easing 21.73 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 38.33 at 2,303.53, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
up 16.30 at 1,244.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 236.97 million 
shares, above Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by IBM, which soared 9 1/8 to 175 7/8, after  
the computer giant agreed to provide Dell Computer with parts in a 
seven-year contract worth $16 billion. Dell's shares were up 2 7/16 
at 83 3/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overnight futures looked good,'' said Scott Bleier, chief  
investment strategist at Prime Charter, ``and then you're greeted 
with the IBM development, which kicked technology in the pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, February sales at the nation's biggest retailers  
topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 17.7 percent. Wal-Mart shares, which are 
part of the Dow industrials, were up 1 11/16 at 89 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also boosted by an 10 a.m. Commerce Department  
report that new orders for U.S. factory goods rose 1.7 percent in 
January to a $349.6 billion annual rate. While that was a record 
high, it was still a little under economists' expectations and 
therefore didn't raise fears of inflation in the bond market, where 
the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged and yielding 5.69 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Fears Losing Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sharing her innermost feelings about her  
presidential affair and her loathing for Kenneth Starr, Monica 
Lewinsky says her major worry now is ``doing something to lose my 
immunity'' from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ABC interview with Barbara Walters and a book entitled  
``Monica's Story,'' Ms. Lewinsky let the public share her anguish -- 
about her relationship with President Clinton, her sex life with 
others and the main players in the drama that led to a historic 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parts of her story were previously untold: her thoughts of  
hurling herself out a 10th floor window when prosecutors first 
confronted her about the affair; her abortion, the result of an 
affair with a fellow Pentagon worker in 1996 before her 
relationship with Clinton ended; and her feeling now that Clinton 
is ``a much bigger liar than I ever thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president did not  
watch the interview. As for her comments, Lockhart said: ``She has 
every right to tell her story from her side. We have every right 
... to move on. That's what the president's doing. He's going to 
focus on the job he was elected to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her television interview, Ms. Lewinsky wore a black pants  
suit and smiled often as she recalled some of the fondest -- and 
even her most painful -- moments of the relationship with Clinton. 
But her eyes became moist as she described her ``very wonderful 
mom'' Marcia Lewis -- who knew of the affair and was forced to 
provide anguished testimony before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once, while recounting the pain the crisis has caused her  
family, she broke down crying. ``People have no idea about what 
this has done. ... It was so destructive,'' she said, tears 
streaming. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clintons left Washington for a day their friends and  
aides admitted would be painful. The president went to a 
fund-raiser in New Jersey; the first lady tested the political 
waters in New York where she's considering a bid for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Countering Clinton's assertion under oath that only Ms. Lewinsky  
performed acts of sexual gratification, Ms. Lewinsky flashed a wide 
grin and answered ``yes'' when Ms. Walters asked whether Clinton 
did things ``that made you feel, as a woman, happy and contented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky saved some of her harshest words for the  
investigation of her affair by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
``I really felt raped and physically ill with myself,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book spared no words for Starr's prosecutors, deriding one  
as a ``revolting specimen of humanity'' and another as a ``pit-bull 
terrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the former intern, who has immunity from prosecution from  
Starr, remains worried that he's not through with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid of doing something to lose my immunity,'' she said.  
``And being prosecuted. Or having my family prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before her immunity deal with Starr was sealed last  
summer, Ms. Lewinsky filed a false affidavit in the Paula Jones 
case denying an affair with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you know that you were committing perjury?'' Ms. Walters  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied. ``I think I knew I was lying, but  
I had no knowledge. I mean I had no idea what all the different 
elements of perjury were at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing her feelings about Clinton now, Ms. Lewinsky said in  
the book by Andrew Morton: ``I was hit by the fact that I don't 
have him in my life anymore. I just miss him so much right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she also called Clinton ``a selfish man who lies all the  
time'' and said sometimes ``I have to turn off the TV because I 
feel sick looking at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Walters brought up the abortion, Ms. Lewinsky nodded  
and said it was ``a very sensitive subject.'' No further 
conversation was aired on the subject, and the veteran interviewer 
had to explain that Ms. Lewinsky was ``clearly uncomfortable'' 
discussing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky slightly lost her composure, placing her hand on  
her face, as Ms. Walters played a tape of her becoming hysterical 
during a taped conversation with Linda Tripp -- the Pentagon 
employee who eventually revealed the affair to Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Portions of the book focused on Starr's tactics -- calling them  
``a matter for grave public concern. The whole exchange about 
immunity was a waste of time except insofar as it exposed the 
dubious methods employed by Starr's investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Jackie Bennett said Wednesday he  
could not comment on the book because his office hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky also discloses in the book that she and her mother  
briefly considered ``fleeing across the border to Canada'' to 
escape Starr's investigation ``but that idea was discarded as soon 
as it was mentioned, because they believed that the FBI would have 
every airport and border post staked out.''

<HEADLINE>  Lewinsky Tells ABC-TV About Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara Walters played the role of a stern  
mother to a frank Monica Lewinsky in their long-awaited interview, 
a two-hour show Wednesday that ABC treated as a prime-time soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most soap operas, the ``20/20'' episode climaxed with tears  
and a moral lesson of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	America's premier television interviewer, Walters led Ms.  
Lewinsky gently but bluntly through the story of the former White 
House intern's affair with the president. She began with broad 
questions, giving Ms. Lewinsky a chance to introduce herself and 
deliver a message to the country, before getting specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do you get the nerve? Who does this?'' Walters wondered  
as Ms. Lewinsky explained how she first gave Bill Clinton a peek at 
her thong underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever say to yourself, `I'm doing something wrong?'''  
Walters asked. 
</P>
<P>
	When Walters asked Ms. Lewinsky whether Clinton was a sensuous  
man, she answered, ``I'll get in trouble.'' Responded Walters: 
``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in, Monica. You 
have immunity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters carefully worded some sexually blunt questions, asking  
at one point whether things were done ``that made you feel, as a 
woman, happy and content.'' Other times she was more direct: ``Did 
you ever try to have intercourse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Walters asked the sort of personal questions  
most Americans would ask if they spent a few hours with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Many were insightful: ``Do you think he was genuinely 
remorseful or do you think he is just sorry he got caught?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial and the saga's impact on the nation's  
political process were barely mentioned, however. ABC also made no 
apparent effort to get others in the drama, either in the White 
House or Kenneth Starr's office, to give their viewpoint during the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	With enough compelling material, it was curious that ABC needed  
to relentlessly hype the interview as a cliffhanger and tawdry 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may understand the president as you never have before and  
the woman who loved him,'' a breathless announcer said at the 
outset. Twice, ABC urged viewers to stay tuned for the ``secret 
never before revealed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret -- that Ms. Lewinsky had an affair with another man  
while working at the Pentagon and had an abortion -- stuck out 
awkwardly in a story about a relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Before each commercial break, ABC felt it necessary to tease  
viewers as if they might quickly escape: ``When we come back, the 
infamous blue dress!'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had no trouble finding advertisers for the show, despite  
asking for prices as much as five times what sponsors would 
normally pay during ``20/20.'' There were eight ads during the 
first break -- for an investment company, a movie, a restaurant 
chain, a hair coloring treatment and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice during the special, ABC ran ads for weight reduction  
treatments -- jarring considering Ms. Lewinsky's battle with the 
bulge. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters aggressively promoted her interview earlier Wednesday,  
with appearances on ``Good Morning America,'' ``Live with Regis and 
Kathie Lee'' and her own show, ``The View.'' She revealed that Ms. 
Lewinsky had knitted her a scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's Web site also was busy finding tie-ins, including a Ms.  
Lewinsky trivia test that asked where the former intern had her 
hair done in Washington and what she ordered when she visited a 
certain restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Ms. Lewinsky was ultimately brought to tears  
when she talked about her and her parents considering suicide 
during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	For her final question, Walters asked what Ms. Lewinsky would  
tell her children in the future about the incident. ``Mommy made a 
big mistake,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that,'' Walters concluded, ``is the understatement of the  
year.''

<HEADLINE>  Lewinsky Tells ABC-TV About Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara Walters played the role of a stern  
mother to a frank Monica Lewinsky in their long-awaited interview, 
a two-hour show Wednesday that ABC treated as a prime-time soap 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most soap operas, the ``20/20'' episode climaxed with tears  
and a moral lesson of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	America's premier television interviewer, Walters led Ms.  
Lewinsky gently but bluntly through the story of the former White 
House intern's affair with the president. She began with broad 
questions, giving Ms. Lewinsky a chance to introduce herself and 
deliver a message to the country, before getting specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do you get the nerve? Who does this?'' Walters wondered  
as Ms. Lewinsky explained how she first gave Bill Clinton a peek at 
her thong underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever say to yourself, `I'm doing something wrong?'''  
Walters asked. 
</P>
<P>
	When Walters asked Ms. Lewinsky whether Clinton was a sensuous  
man, she answered, ``I'll get in trouble.'' Responded Walters: 
``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in, Monica. You 
have immunity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters carefully worded some sexually blunt questions, asking  
at one point whether things were done ``that made you feel, as a 
woman, happy and content.'' Other times she was more direct: ``Did 
you ever try to have intercourse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Walters asked the sort of personal questions  
most Americans would ask if they spent a few hours with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Many were insightful: ``Do you think he was genuinely 
remorseful or do you think he is just sorry he got caught?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial and the saga's impact on the nation's  
political process were barely mentioned, however. ABC also made no 
apparent effort to get others in the drama, either in the White 
House or Kenneth Starr's office, to give their viewpoint during the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	With enough compelling material, it was curious that ABC needed  
to relentlessly hype the interview as a cliffhanger and tawdry 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may understand the president as you never have before and  
the woman who loved him,'' a breathless announcer said at the 
outset. Twice, ABC urged viewers to stay tuned for the ``secret 
never before revealed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret -- that Ms. Lewinsky had an affair with another man  
while working at the Pentagon and had an abortion -- stuck out 
awkwardly in a story about a relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Before each commercial break, ABC felt it necessary to tease  
viewers as if they might quickly escape: ``When we come back, the 
infamous blue dress!'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had no trouble finding advertisers for the show, despite  
asking for prices as much as five times what sponsors would 
normally pay during ``20/20.'' There were eight ads during the 
first break -- for an investment company, a movie, a restaurant 
chain, a hair coloring treatment and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice during the special, ABC ran ads for weight reduction  
treatments -- jarring considering Ms. Lewinsky's battle with the 
bulge. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters aggressively promoted her interview earlier Wednesday,  
with appearances on ``Good Morning America,'' ``Live with Regis and 
Kathie Lee'' and her own show, ``The View.'' She revealed that Ms. 
Lewinsky had knitted her a scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's Web site also was busy finding tie-ins, including a Ms.  
Lewinsky trivia test that asked where the former intern had her 
hair done in Washington and what she ordered when she visited a 
certain restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Ms. Lewinsky was ultimately brought to tears  
when she talked about her and her parents considering suicide 
during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	For her final question, Walters asked what Ms. Lewinsky would  
tell her children in the future about the incident. ``Mommy made a 
big mistake,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that,'' Walters concluded, ``is the understatement of the  
year.''

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan May Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's feuding factions will  
hold face-to-face talks to try to find a peaceful end to their 
protracted and bloody conflict, a U.N. envoy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Taliban army, which controls roughly 90  
percent of Afghanistan, will meet with their northern-based 
opponents on March 10 in the Turkmenistan capital of Ashkabad, U.N. 
special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really appeal to the two parties not to disappoint once  
again the people of Afghanistan,'' Brahimi told a news conference 
in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brahimi warned that failure at the negotiation table will surely  
mean another season of bloodletting on the battlefield in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan is in the midst of a bitterly cold winter, which has  
caused a lull in fighting. Mountain passes are clogged with snow 
and troops generally stay hunkered down in their mountain bases 
until the weather improves. 
</P>
<P>
	But spring is approaching and Brahimi said that ``both sides are  
feverishly preparing for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say this is their last chance ... but this really is  
the chance I hope they will not waste,'' Brahimi said of the peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Brahimi's agenda during meetings with the Taliban  
leadership was the return to Afghanistan of the United Nations 
international staff, evacuated last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The world body withdrew its foreign staff after an Italian  
worker was shot and killed on Aug. 21, the day after the United 
States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at eastern Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban blamed the killing on renegade soldiers seeking  
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was targeting alleged terrorist camps run by  
Osama bin Laden, who Washington believes masterminded the Aug. 7 
attacks on its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Brahimi said he has received a Taliban promise to protect United  
Nations staff. U.N. security personnel are assessing the safety 
situation before a decision about returning to the war-ruined 
country is made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. special envoy leaves Friday for Iran.  
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan is a strong ally of the Taliban and one of only three  
countries to recognize the hardcore Islamic movement. Iran is 
believed to be supporting the opposition and in particular 
Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Wells To Return Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- David Wells will be back on the field  
Friday after four days of treatment for back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play some long toss Friday,'' Wells said. ``There's no  
use in rushing something like this. There's another five weeks to 
go in spring training, so my major thing is to get healthy get out 
there and get ready for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Quantrill still doesn't know when he will return to the  
mound, after breaking his leg in a snowmobile accident Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week,'' said Quantrill, who has  
only been throwing long toss along with his daily therapy in the 
trainers room.

<HEADLINE> Blackmun Abortion Ruling Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry Blackmun's 1973 Supreme Court opinion in  
Roe vs. Wade galvanized both sides of the national debate over 
abortion and spurred decades of activism in courts and on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, who died Thursday, ``stood as the founder of modern  
day abortion-rights jurisprudence in the United States,'' said 
Simon Heller of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. ``We 
categorize him among the heroes of the pro-choice movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who oppose the right to abortion saw Blackmun as far from  
a hero. He got more than 60,000 pieces of hate mail over the 
decision that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun's opinion ``was without a doubt the catalyst that  
galvanized what we call the pro-life movement in the United 
States,'' said Jay Alan Sekulow of the American Center for Law and 
Justice, who has defended anti-abortion protesters in court on 
free-speech grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The national outcry clearly wasn't there until the Roe  
decision,'' Sekulow added. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the court issued the ruling in 1973, each state could  
decide for itself whether to allow abortion. Most did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The years since have seen numerous court cases over efforts to  
limit abortion, massive street marches by advocates on each side, 
clinic blockades by anti-abortion protesters, and violence -- 
including the killings of several doctors who performed abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion has been a big issue in many political races and in  
confirmation hearings for new Supreme Court justices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the highest court reaffirmed the basic right to  
abortion, although it also upheld many limits imposed by states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pot keeps boiling 26 years later,'' said Clarke Forsythe,  
president of Americans United for Life, who criticized the idea 
that ``one national sweep of the pen could solve the abortion 
debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, formerly a pioneering women's  
rights advocate, suggested during her pre-Supreme Court days that 
the country might have been better off if the right to abortion had 
been established more gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree,'' said Kate Michelman of the National Abortion  
Rights Action League. ``There's no question that we were moving to 
repeal the abortion laws ... but it was slow and it was state by 
state, year by year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center said that  
if the Supreme Court had not ruled, more states may have allowed 
abortion in some form. But she added, ``Even today, there's no 
reason to think that every state would have legalized abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life  
Committee, called abortion an issue that ``strikes so fundamentally 
at our sense of what is right and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A social controversy such as this has not been seen in our  
nation since the debate over slavery of African-Americans,'' he 
said, and predicted the debate will continue into the next century 
over ``what abortion is and what it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote the worst Supreme Court decision in history,'' said  
Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberger added: ``There is no Supreme Court precedent that we  
can rely upon if there is a determined effort to appoint justices 
who are committed to overturning it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sekulow said Blackmun kept his legacy going as author of Roe vs.  
Wade by his separate opinions in later abortion cases. ``He knew 
what he was known for,'' Sekulow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of  
America, said, ``Many women in the future will not ever have heard 
of Harry Blackmun, but they will have choices that women (before 
Roe) did not have.''

<HEADLINE> EU Angry Over U.S. Tariff Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union filed a complaint against the  
United States before the World Trade Organization on Thursday, 
saying U.S. moves to impose sanctions in a dispute over bananas 
violate global trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, European targets of the sanctions, from prosciutto  
producers to cashmere companies, accused the United States of 
trying to destroy their industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration notified U.S. importers that they are  
liable for hefty tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods in 
retaliation for European barriers on banana imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says American banana companies lose $520  
million annually in sales to Europe because of illegal trade 
barriers that favor bananas imported from former European colonies 
in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed to stand, the U.S. tariffs would double the cost of  
the targeted goods, pricing them out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has asked the WTO to invoke a special process under which  
the United States and the 15-nation EU trading bloc would have 20 
days to settle their differences. If they failed, the EU could then 
ask the WTO to rule on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade Minister Brian Wilson called the U.S. action  
``potentially catastrophic'' for the British cashmere industry, 
which is concentrated in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people there are saddened and utterly bewildered that the  
United States should attack them in this way over a dispute which 
has absolutely nothing to do with them or their industry,'' said 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Italy's consortium of Parma ham producers, Stefano  
Fanti, accused the United States of unfairly targeting Italy to 
pressure the EU to modify its banana import system. Some 98 percent 
of prosciutto in the United States comes from Italy, and 94 percent 
is Parma ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Products from 13 of the EU's 15 nations risk being hit by the  
tariffs. These include Italian and Greek pecorino cheese, French 
handbags, German coffee makers and British biscuits. The 
Netherlands and Denmark have been spared because they sided with 
the United States in the trade dispute.

<HEADLINE> Warren Buffett To Sell His Jet </HEADLINE>

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett's ``Indefensible'' has become  
dispensable.

	The billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said he's  
selling his jet, dubbed ``the Indefensible,'' and now uses planes 
from a New Jersey company he just bought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll save a bundle,'' Buffett told the Financial Times in

pilots, or waiting on maintenance checks. This way I just call them

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Fund Missing Kids Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress would formally recognize the Center  
for Missing and Exploited Children and make annual appropriations 
to it under a bill approved Thursday by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure sets aside $10 million in federal money for the  
center annually from 2000 to 2004. This year, the center received 
$8.12 million and its Jimmy Ryce Training Center received another 
$1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would free the center from applying annually for  
authorization and money, committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
said. The government has awarded grants to the center for the past 
14 years to operate a national resource center in Arlington, Va., 
and a national 24-hour hot line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center provides invaluable assistance and training to law  
enforcement around the country in cases of missing and exploited 
children,'' Hatch said. ``The center's record is quite impressive 
and its efforts have led directly to a significant increase in the 
percentage of missing children who are recovered safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center works with the FBI, the Justice, State and Treasury  
departments and other federal agencies to find missing children and 
prevent child victimization. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would renew a law that targets federal money to  
areas with large number of runaway youths. One program created by 
the law provides grants for temporary shelter and counseling for 
youths under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Other grants provide longer-term housing to homeless young  
people from 16 to 21 and helps them become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure's projects ``benefit those children truly in need  
and at high risk of becoming addicted to drugs, sexually exploited 
or abused or involved in criminal behavior,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a similar bill last June, but it died in the  
House after lawmakers tried to attach controversial provisions 
dealing with juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 249.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Battier Plans To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's No. 1 team is about to get  
one of its best players back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's Shane Battier, sidelined for the past week with a  
severely sprained left ankle, went through a one-hour practice at 
full speed Wednesday night and reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring any overnight complications from pain or swelling,  
Battier said he expected to play tonight when the Blue Devils 
(29-1) meet Virginia (14-15) in the first round of the Atlantic 
Coast Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Battier sat out Duke's regular-season finale against North  
Carolina, but the Blue Devils still won by 20. Nonetheless, he 
cautioned against saying his return would give the Blue Devils an 
overwhelming advantage against a Virginia team they defeated twice 
by 46-point margins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virginia has nothing to lose,'' he said. ``They can come in  
and play and not worry about making mistakes. The pressure is all 
on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battier, a sophomore forward widely recognized as one of the  
nation's best defenders, said that as recently as Monday it 
appeared unlikely he would be able to play against the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can really feel it day by day coming back to me. I've been  
very encouraged by the improvement, especially in the last two 
days,'' he said. ``I basically went from not being able to even get 
up on my tiptoes to being able to jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battier planned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday night,  
but the ankle felt so good early in the session that he decided to 
keep testing it. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the session ended, Battier had worked up a good  
sweat by taking part in all the team drills. He dunked several 
times, hit a number of 3-pointers, set some picks, made some solid 
plays on defense and ran the floor well, looking all the while like 
he wasn't bothered by the high ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Battier appeared much more at ease than coach Mike  
Krzyzewski, who is scheduled for hip replacement surgery as soon as 
the season ends. Krzyzewski limped around the practice floor and 
alternately leaned on the scorer's table or sat on the Duke bench 
to rest the sore hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't move around well,'' he said, breaking into a wide  
smile. ``But it doesn't hurt my thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said he would not start Battier, but would use him  
according to feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's feeling good and I'm feeling good,'' Krzyzewski said,  
``he'll play a lot.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Fans Are Into March Badness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While college basketball fans are immersed in March Madness, NBA  
fans are into March Badness after a month of February Futility. 
</P>
<P>
	When St. John's beat Notre Dame last week after looking inept in  
the first 20 minutes, coach Mike Jarvis said, ``It looked like the 
Knicks-Nets in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis, of course, was referring to New York Knicks and the New  
Jersey Nets, who a few days earlier seemed to put the ball 
everywhere but in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA likes to say it has the world's greatest athletes. What  
it could use are some basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	What fans have been getting are preseason games at  
regular-season prices, although there have been some special ticket 
deals, as players huff and puff up and down the floor and throw up 
clinkers from all angles and distances. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a struggle for a team to hit 80 points in a game. The Utah  
Jazz contrived to score only 56 points, the second-lowest in an NBA 
game for a team since the 24-second shot clock went into effect in 
the 1954-55 season, eight years after the NBA was founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan could score that many points on a good night.  
Come back, Michael! 
</P>
<P>
	Ineptitude has become such a norm that it has become the story.  
Did the Bulls lose? That's no longer the question. Now it's `Did 
the Clippers win?' As of Tuesday, with no game scheduled Wednesday, 
the Los Angeles Clippers were 0-13 and in cold pursuit of the NBA's 
worst-start record of 0-17 set by the Miami Heat in the 1988-89 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who note that tough defense is a reason for the  
scoring drought. Maybe, but more legitimate reasons might be the 
playground mentality of many pros and the idea that showmanship is 
what counts. So if you can't slam dunk, then throw one up from 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a bigger reason, because of the owner's lockout, is  
teams are being asked to play four or five games a week instead of 
two or three so that a 50-game season can be held before the 
interminable playoffs begin. Four games in seven days seem to be 
just too many for the world's greatest athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it possible that some of these multi-millionaires did not  
work at getting into and staying in the best physical condition 
during the lockout? 
</P>
<P>
	The shorter training camp and more intense schedule have to have  
had something to do with the rash of injuries that have hit the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance, however, has been good, and not only because of the  
league's public relations efforts. The faithful seem to be willing 
to put up with subpar play, at least for the current season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would seem that the NBA could be headed for trouble in  
the post-Jordan era unless basketball becomes as important as show 
boating. If a player can't be a superstar, he should just settle 
for being a player and part of the game. The faithful would 
appreciate that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the collegians take over the world's biggest stage --  
the country's television sets -- and you can be sure they'll make 
the most of the opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Mice Smell Study Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scientists believe they have figured out how the  
nose knows. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery that has long perplexed experts is how creatures can  
distinguish among many thousands of odors with their 1,000 or so 
smell sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study of mice found that instead of dedicating a single  
sensor to a single odor, mammals use their sensors in combination. 
The same sensors are triggered again and again in different 
combinations, and each combination spells out a unique odor. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensors, or olfactory receptors, line the wall of the nasal  
cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each receptor is used over and over again to define an odor,  
just like letters are used over and over again to define different 
words,'' said Dr. Linda B. Buck of the Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck and colleagues from the Life Electronics Research Center in  
Amagasaki, Japan, reported the discovery in Friday's issue of the 
journal Cell.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As George W. Bush and Al Gore and Bill Bradley  
and Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes -- just to name 
a few -- have announced, they will be announcing one of these days 
that they are running for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The rites of announcement are well under way, creating  
candidates by degree. 
</P>
<P>
	The players already are running, of course. And in most cases,  
they have been, some for months, some almost full time since the 
last presidential election. But no matter. Announcing is part of 
the game. For the longest long shots, entering day is as good as it 
gets, and they become names down the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the money runs out or the voters do, at least 10  
Republicans and two Democrats are candidates, in varying stages of 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, the third-time GOP candidate, who always has  
played by his own rules anyhow, has just entered the 2000 campaign 
his own way. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan did not announce he was exploring whether to announce  
he would run and announce it later. He did it the old-fashioned 
way, and just said it outright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mount up and ride to the sound of the guns,'' he exhorted in  
declaring his White House candidacy in Manchester, N.H., on 
Tuesday. Four years ago, he called his troops peasants with 
pitchforks. But even with new weapons, his prospects are minimal, 
even in the state in which he won the first primary of 1996, edging 
then front-runner Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's rerun was telegraphed when he took a leave of absence  
from his between-campaigns job as a conservative commentator on 
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire announced earlier that he is  
running, a plunge that has not rippled in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming soon: Elizabeth Dole, who held two Cabinet posts, served  
as president of the American Red Cross and campaigned in her 
husband's losing cause in 1996. Her next step will be an 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Unannounced, she ranks high in the surveys of Republican  
opinion, second to Bush, who is announcing his exploratory 
committee on Sunday after saying he would say so. The governor had 
said he would tell Texas reporters first, which he did on Tuesday. 
Sunday, he is to go national. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio  
and Gary Bauer, a conservative who left as president of the Family 
Research Council to seek the GOP nomination, already have 
exploratory committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore and his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill  
Bradley, already have presidential campaign committees, one step 
past exploratory organizations. Both are campaigning. Both are 
planning to announce later that they are candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the jargon of these exercises, those will be their formal  
announcements. That means staged for television, with speeches and 
cheering sections. Ironically, the most formal steps are the 
initial ones, the exploratory committees, which enable a potential 
candidate to legally raise and spend campaign money, ostensibly for 
the purpose of exploring whether to keep doing so as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The money has to be raised within federal limits, no more than  
$1,000 from an individual, $5,000 from a political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a statement of candidacy, the point at which  
the candidate's finances are subject to Federal Election Commission 
restrictions and reporting. There are spending ceilings set by 
federal formula for each state. There also is an inducement because 
each donation can qualify for up to $250 in matching federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	That system, tracing back to 1976, is a legal overlay on the  
traditional political ritual of announcing a campaign for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Those did not come as surprises, either. They were not the real  
starting points; the candidates who would deepen their voices and 
pace their words to declare that ``I am a candidate for president 
of the United States'' already had been out raising money and 
lining up supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But in those days before federal campaign finance laws, there  
was a point to being coy about candidacy. Once a candidate 
declared, rivals could demand equal TV and radio broadcast time, 
which did not apply to undeclared campaigners. Better to wait, and 
get more air time. 
</P>
<P>
	That is not the test now. It is raising and spending money in  
pursuit of the White House, with or without benefit of declared 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Which does not detract from the ritual of announcements, but  
adds more stages to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who ran four  
years ago and has not stopped since, is to announce his 2000 
campaign Tuesday. ``I'm off and running,'' he said the other day, 
campaigning in Des Moines, Iowa. Next week he will confirm what it 
is he is off and running for. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes is a nonstop campaigner, too, unfettered by the  
spending limits that will apply to rivals who accept matching 
federal funds for their primary election costs. There have been 
hints that Bush might forgo federal money, and thus spending 
limits, too. He would not say when he announced his forthcoming 
announcement.

<HEADLINE> Senate Crafting Mitch Recovery Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is objecting to a  
$1.9 billion Senate measure that would provide aid to Central 
Americans struggling to recover from Hurricane Mitch. And a similar 
House bill is falling victim to political dueling over the federal 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee planned to vote today on the  
legislation, which also contains funds for struggling U.S. farmers, 
the American steel industry, and aid to Jordan after King Hussein's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the bill, panel Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, has  
included savings from food stamps and welfare accounts that were 
not expected to be spent this year, as well as a 5 percent 
across-the-board reduction in some domestic programs. That prompted 
an outcry today from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockart accused senators of  
looking for ``a political fight,'' and urged them not to. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an emergency. The need is real. The need is  
desperate,'' Lockhart said. ``These are issues that should be above 
the partisan fighting here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill  
Young, R-Fla., abruptly postponed a vote set for today by his own 
panel after House leaders ordered him to find savings to pay for 
his entire measure, which has a $1.2 billion price tag. Unlike the 
paid-for Senate bill, Young's would have only paid for the $100 
million for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a general feeling we ought to find offsets'' to pay  
for the bill, said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, in a 
brief interview. ``It's been a thing we've done'' for emergency 
domestic spending in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had proposed using part of this year's expected $109  
billion federal surplus to pay for most of the measure. But House 
leaders, eager to show they are more fiscally responsible than 
Clinton, decided against using the surplus in their very first 
spending measure of the year -- especially for a bill dominated by 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP fiscal conservatives had also complained that the measure  
should be paid for -- especially since this year's expected surplus 
comes entirely from Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we spend money, we won't steal it out of Social Security,  
and that's the first case out of the box,'' said conservative Rep. 
Tom Coburn, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Senate bill contained budget savings to pay for  
itself, that put added pressure on House leaders to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriations panel aides said they had already planned to trim  
defense and foreign aid funds to pay for the $100 million in aid to 
Jordan. But now, they are also hunting for savings to offset $956 
million for Central America and $152 million for American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure won't be ready until at least next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money is to help Honduras, Nicaragua, El  
Salvador and Costa Rica recover from Hurricane Mitch. The October 
storm, considered the worst natural disaster ever in the Western 
Hemisphere, killed more than 9,000 people, left more than 3 million 
homeless and destroyed more than $8.5 billion worth of property. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton journeys to Central America to view recovery efforts on  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agriculture aid is to help U.S. farmers facing a weak export  
market caused largely by Asia's economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Reunion Tour To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen's reunion tour with the E  
Street Band kicks off April 9 in Barcelona, Spain, then continues 
in Europe through early June and hits the United States in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in my life, I really missed playing with those  
guys,'' Springsteen told The Associated Press. ``These are people 
I've known since my teens. ... To share that closeness, it's 
unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the tour opener, Springsteen &AMP; Co. will play 16 shows  
across Europe. The American dates will run from mid-July through 
the end of September, with the band playing multiple shows in 
as-yet unannounced venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehearsals ``have been really great,'' Springsteen said. ``It's  
been a lot of fun. Everybody's really enjoying themselves and 
having a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shows will mark the first tour for Springsteen with the band  
since 1988-89's Amnesty International tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss and his bandmates planned to rehearse Thursday in their  
hometown, Asbury Park, N.J., at Convention Hall on the boardwalk.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Bill Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic congressman wants to lift the  
federal ban on the medical use of marijuana in states where voters 
have approved it as a treatment for pain, nausea or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do to get marijuana into the hands of people  
suffering is to set aside the federal controls on marijuana, so the 
states can determine this issue for themselves,'' Rep. Barney Frank 
of Massachusetts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank has proposed legislation that would reclassify marijuana  
as a Schedule II drug, meaning that it could be prescribed by 
doctors under certain conditions, just as cocaine and other 
controlled substances are. Prescriptions for such drugs are subject 
to federal and state review. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside the federal ban on marijuana in those  
states -- Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and Nevada 
-- where voters have permitted medical use of the drug. The bill 
would not affect states that have not permitted such use. 
</P>
<P>
	Although marijuana users with a demonstrated medical need don't  
face state prosecution in those six states, they still face 
possible federal prosecution, Frank said. Doctors, too, may shy 
away from prescribing the drug for fear of losing their right to 
prescribe other federally controlled substances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also require the federal government to supply  
marijuana for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank has pressed the issue twice before, and he is not hopeful  
that his latest proposal will pass the Republican-controlled 106th 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the House adopted by 310-93 vote a resolution by Rep.  
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that said marijuana is a dangerous and 
addictive drug and should not be legalized for medical use. 
Supporters said efforts to legalize the drug for medical use send 
the wrong message to teen-agers, and that scientific testing has 
not proved a medical use for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the New England Journal of Medicine has editorialized in  
favor of medical marijuana, and the American Medical Association 
has urged the National Institutes of Health to support more 
research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Canada's health minister authorized clinical  
trials to determine if marijuana is a useful medicine for people 
suffering from terminal illnesses and other painful conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the International Drug Control Board concluded  
last month that in-depth and impartial scientific studies should be 
conducted into marijuana's possible medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the six states that allow medical uses of  
marijuana, 11 states have reduced the possession of small amounts 
of the drug to a minor civil offense, similar to a traffic 
violation. They are Alaska, Oregon, California, Minnesota, 
Colorado, Nebraska, Mississippi, Ohio, North Carolina, New York and 
Maine.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses U.N. Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On her testing-the-waters Big Apple tour,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday at the United Nations -- one of 
the posts mentioned for her future -- that women now enjoy ``all 
kinds of possibilities where none had been dreamed of before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for messages in her comments, Democrats trying to  
draft her for the state's 2000 Senate race also hoped she would 
heed her separate counsel to young school girls in sports: ``Dare 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the noisy U.N. Trusteeship Council, where 1,000 filled the  
seats and hundreds more stood against the walls, the chamber 
erupted into a whooping, standing ovation as she stepped across the 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the revolution is on the move,'' Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan quipped with a nod to ``Madame'' Clinton, seated at the 
center of a dais lined with seven women. 
</P>
<P>
	She led the chamber in applauding Annan's line that women are  
not ``an incidental ornament for the men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her own speech, which stretched past 30 minutes, the first  
lady spoke about women's diverse ``life paths'' and ``responsible 
choices.'' She railed against disrespect of women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no longer acceptable to say that the abuse and  
mistreatment of women is cultural. It should be called what it is: 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the United Nations, Mrs. Clinton was visiting a local  
school to spotlight ``Dare to Compete,'' an HBO documentary on 
women in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, weighing her options at the close of her husband's  
term in the White House, made clear on this campaign-style swing 
that she will not ``drop out of the political process,'' as she put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the will-she-or-won't-she guessing continued.  
</P>
<P>
	In between four packed public appearances, Mrs. Clinton met  
privately -- in her suite at the Waldorf, and at the Manhattan home 
of a Wall Street friend -- with advice givers from New York politics 
and finance who are pushing her to run for the Senate seat of 
retiring Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Her spokeswoman divulged nothing of the meetings, and Mrs.  
Clinton said Wednesday she had no announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her allies have suggested Mrs. Clinton might prefer to  
serve as U.S. ambassador or some sort of goodwill ambassador with 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	To staff and delegates there, she spoke passionately about her  
travels -- many of them solo trips -- to Africa, Northern Ireland, 
Romania, India, Ukraine, Central America and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced that she and, most likely, her daughter Chelsea  
would travel later this month to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco ``to 
see firsthand the progress that women are making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German delegate Christl Schraut, who waited at the U.N. entrance  
for a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton, said the first lady is enormously 
popular overseas but could put her talents to better use at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations is well known everywhere, of course. But  
you just can't do or get things in motion as much as you can in 
American domestic politics,'' Schraut said.

sentence from 40 years to 30 years, meaning the former Panamanian 
dictator could be eligible for parole by 2007. Noriega had asked

Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people more than a year ago. The 
verdict sparked a whoop in the courtroom at the Camp Lejeune Marine 
base, and outrage from Italian officials. Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, 
was charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter among other 
things. The crash and its aftermath strained relations between the 
United States and Italy, a NATO ally.

good today, and the Huskies held on for a 57-56 victory over Seton 
Hall in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. Third-ranked 
Connecticut (26-2) advanced to tomorrow's semifinals against the 
winner of the quarterfinal between fourth-seeded Syracuse and 
fifth-seeded Villanova.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gives States Entire Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would get none of the  
$246 billion promised by tobacco companies to states to settle 
health-related lawsuits under a bill approved Thursday by a key 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is money the states won on their own, with no help from  
the federal government,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, 
the prime sponsor. ``This will settle the issue once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee attached Hutchison's measure  
on a voice vote to a $1.9 billion emergency spending bill that 
includes aid for economically strapped U.S. farmers, victims of 
Hurricane Mitch in Central America, the American steel industry and 
Jordan after King Hussein's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has asserted that the federal  
government deserves a slice of the money paid by tobacco companies. 
The administration points out that under Medicaid law states must 
share proceeds of any lawsuits involving the program because half 
its costs are borne by the federal government. Many of the states' 
lawsuits relied on the costs of tobacco-related illnesses to the 
Medicaid program in seeking money from the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But all 50 governors and hundreds of state officials have been  
battling to keep the money -- they say Washington played no part in 
the drawn-out legal fight -- and spend it as they see fit. The 
tobacco companies agreed to pay $40 billion over 25 years to settle 
four state lawsuits and another $206 billion in a broader deal with 
the other 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison's measure would bar the Clinton administration from  
using Medicaid law to recoup the money. Supporters said it was 
critical to move the measure swiftly because state legislatures 
nationwide are making decisions on how to spend their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. ``The  
states are wondering what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Appropriations Committee brushed aside warnings from some  
senators to go slowly in rewriting Medicaid law. Senate Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., had warned colleagues that 
the move could have unforeseen ramifications for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``No decisions should be made until the facts are on the  
table,'' Roth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, asked  
Hutchison to withdraw the measure in light of Roth's objections, 
but she refused. The committee also defeated an effort by Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, to limit the bill's effects to the 1999 and 2000 
fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said he expected the tobacco amendment to pass the full  
Senate when the emergency bill goes to the floor later this month, 
but whether the House would go along is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall emergency spending bill has become a political  
touchstone because Stevens proposes to pay for it with money from 
welfare and food stamp programs that isn't supposed to be spent 
this year, as well as 5 percent reductions in some other domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned committee vote on the House version was postponed  
Thursday until next week so that similar spending offsets could be 
found, instead of taking most of the money out of projected budget 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart accused GOP lawmakers  
of causing a ``political fight'' by trimming other accounts. ``The 
need is real, '' he said. ``These are issues that should be above 
the partisan fighting here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans are insisting on preventing any supplemental  
spending bills from violating the fiscal 1999 budget caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it's not politics at all,'' said House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``It's called budget responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Medical Marijuana Law Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska's medical marijuana law goes into  
effect today, offering a legal shield to people who smoke the weed 
for a short list of medical ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 percent of the voters in the November election favored  
the measure, which allows marijuana use for ailments including 
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, chronic pain, seizures and muscle spasms, 
provided the patient has a doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows patients to grow limited amounts of marijuana and  
protects doctors who recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing, selling or using marijuana for recreational purposes  
remains illegal and marijuana is still classified with heroin and 
LSD under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a bill introduced in Congress on Wednesday would set  
aside the federal ban on marijuana in the states that have approved 
its use: Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Alaska law calls for identification cards that  
medical marijuana users could show to fend off arrest, the 
Department of Health and Social Services is not yet accepting 
applications for a registry of qualified patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without a card, the law will provide a defense if people  
are arrested for using medical marijuana. Patients will be allowed 
to keep 1 ounce of marijuana, or grow six plants, including three 
flowering plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect that the police would exercise some discretion,  
and ask appropriate questions that would allow them to gain enough 
information to determine if the person is legitimately using 
marijuana for medical purpose or just using it as an excuse,'' said 
Dean Guaneli, the state's chief assistant attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Tuthill wishes the law had come about a few years earlier.  
The retired airline pilot was using marijuana to ease chronic pain 
caused by a severe car crash when a neighbor complained to 
authorities about the marijuana patch on his property in Homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuthill was placed on probation after a plea bargain that  
forbids him from smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have period of times when my pain is so severe that I just  
can't do anything,'' said Tuthill, 48, who says other pain 
medications nauseate him.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar soared against the yen today after the  
head of a Japanese ruling party committee on finance signaled his 
support for additional measures to drive down interest rates. Tokyo 
stocks crept higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.58 yen in late afternoon trading, up 1.40  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 121.77 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average edged up 13.09  
points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 14,183.45. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 249.30 points, or 1.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazuyoshi Kaneko, who heads a newly created Liberal Democratic  
Party committee to monitor the turbulent bond market, told 
reporters today that he was considering new measures to curb the 
recent rise in long-term interest rates. One possibility, he said, 
was having the central bank buy more government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has already been intervening in short-term  
money markets. On Wednesday, it flooded the interbank loan market 
with cash by purchasing short-term government bonds. That sent the 
call rate -- the rate major banks charge each other for overnight 
loans -- to an all-time low of 0.02 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are aimed at pulling Japan out of its worst recession  
in half a century by cutting borrowing costs. Lower interest rates 
drive down a country's currency as investors move their money 
elsewhere in search of higher returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been buying (dollars) today,'' said Hajime Sato,  
assistant general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank. ``There are still lots of yen-negative 
factors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged as low as 121.75 yen and as high as 122.78  
yen. In other currencies, the euro was traded at 133.13 yen, up 
from 132.25 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond sank to 1.610 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 
percent, driving its price up to 101.53 yen from 101.04 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, shares rose on optimism over the lower  
interest rates helping rekindle growth. The stronger dollar also 
gave a boost to shares of exporters on expectations it will boost 
the yen value of their overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony Corp. was among the biggest gainers, jumping more than 4  
percent after the electronics giant unveiled its next-generation 
PlayStation TV game consoles. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.30 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,105.11. The 
TOPIX closed up 7.73 points, or 0.71 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 389 million shares traded on the first section,  
almost unchanged from Wednesday's 395 million. Rising and declining 
shares were about evenly split.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Buy Level One for $2.2B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of  
personal computer chips, said Thursday it would buy Level One 
Communications, a small rival, for $2.2 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is intended to sharpen Intel's edge in the Internet  
equipment market. 
</P>
<P>
	Level One's 800 employees would keep their jobs as the  
Sacramento, Calif.-based company becomes a subsidiary of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ``provides us with the silicon building blocks  
necessary to supply the rapidly growing demands created by the 
Internet and e-commerce,'' Craig Barrett, Intel's president and 
chief executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's computer chips supply the brainpower for about 80  
percent of the world's personal computers, but the Santa Clara, 
Calif.-based company has been striving to expand into new markets 
to counteract the slowing sales of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Level One comes in. The company specializes in  
chips used in high-speed networks that carry voice, data and 
Internet transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pepper, Level One's president and chief executive, will  
become an Intel vice president for the company's Network 
Communications Group and general manager of the Level One 
Components Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is the largest in Intel's 31-year history, comes  
just days after the company completed its $185 million acquisition 
of Shiva Corp. Shiva makes equipment employees can use to dial up 
to their corporate computer networks via the Internet, thus 
eliminating long-distance calls and cutting the cost of maintaining 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will buy, license or develop what ever it takes to be No.  
1'' in the data communication semiconductor industry, said Mark 
Christensen, general manager of Intel's Network Communications 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three years, sales of data communications chips  
are expected to grow twice as fast as sales of microprocessing 
chips, according to Dataquest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, Level One shareholders will get .43  
of an Intel share, worth about $48.75, in exchange for each Level 
One share. That represents a 79 percent premium over Level One's 
closing stock price Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel will issue about 18.6 million shares of new stock to  
complete the transaction. The exchange rate and the total number of 
shares will be adjusted for Intel's previously announced 2-for-1 
stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the stock markets closed. Level  
One's shares closed down $5.25 at $27.12 1/2 following a downgrade 
from Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill on concerns of slower sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's stock fell $1.31 1/4 to $113.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Jump Forward; Dow Up 135.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in late morning after  
IBM announced a $16 billion sales agreement with Dell Computer. The 
market was also helped by strong retail sales data and a report 
that new unemployment claims reached a 10-year low in February. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 135.02 at 9,410.90, after easing 21.73 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 38.33 at 2,303.53, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
up 16.30 at 1,244.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 236.97 million 
shares, above Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by IBM, which soared 9 1/8 to 175 7/8, after  
the computer giant agreed to provide Dell Computer with parts in a 
seven-year contract worth $16 billion. Dell's shares were up 2 7/16 
at 83 3/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overnight futures looked good,'' said Scott Bleier, chief  
investment strategist at Prime Charter, ``and then you're greeted 
with the IBM development, which kicked technology in the pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, February sales at the nation's biggest retailers  
topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 17.7 percent. Wal-Mart shares, which are 
part of the Dow industrials, were up 1 11/16 at 89 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also boosted by an 10 a.m. Commerce Department  
report that new orders for U.S. factory goods rose 1.7 percent in 
January to a $349.6 billion annual rate. While that was a record 
high, it was still a little under economists' expectations and 
therefore didn't raise fears of inflation in the bond market, where 
the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged and yielding 5.69 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Jury in Gondola Case Deliberates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Eight military jurors began a second  
day of deliberations today on whether a Marine pilot whose jet hit 
an Italian ski gondola cable last year is guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter for the 20 people who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury met for about four hours Wednesday afternoon. Six of  
the eight officers on the jury must vote guilty in order to convict 
Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, has urged jurors to rely on the  
expert testimony. He said his client suffered from an optical 
illusion that made him think his jet was higher than it was, that 
an altimeter on the jet malfunctioned and that the gondola at 
Cavalese, Italy, wasn't marked on American maps. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the only reason the  
mishap happened was because Ashby flew by his own rules. He said 
the pilot ignored speed and altitude limits, which Ashby testified 
he didn't know about. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces more than 200 years in prison if convicted of all  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the jury deliberated, attorneys for Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, the navigator in Ashby's EA-6B Prowler jet, said 
closing arguments made them optimistic that charges against their 
client could be dismissed. Schweitzer faces charges similar to 
Ashby's.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher at 2 p.m., although  
below their highest levels of the day, in a broad-based rally that 
included technology, retail, financial and energy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 128.22 at 9,404.10. The Dow got as high as 9,448.66, up 172.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 10.01 at 2,275.21, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
up 8.36 at 1,236.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at 508.84 million 
shares, above Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by IBM, which was up 6 3/4 at 173 1/2, after  
soaring as much as 10 1/4 to 177. The computer giant agreed to provide 
Dell Computer with parts in a seven-year contract worth $16 
billion. Dell's shares were up 1 3/16 at 82 1/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial-services stocks were higher as bond prices were stable  
after giving ground on Wednesday. The benchmark 30-year Treasury 
bond was unchanged, yielding 5.69 percent. American Express was up 
2 3/8 at 110 3/16. Salomon Smith Barney started coverage of the stock 
with a ``buy'' rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and oil-service stocks were higher with oil prices. Dow  
member Exxon was up 1 3/4 at 67 7/16. Halliburton was up 1 33/64 at 31 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks moved higher amid strong February sales figures.  
Wal-Mart, whose February sales rose 10.3 percent at stores open at 
least a year, was up 1 3/8 at 88 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's rise, which extended a recovery in technology  
shares that started late Wednesday, was ``totally justified'' by 
recent economic data and the fact that investors still have a lot 
of money to put to work, said Thomas McManus, portfolio strategist 
at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Once prices get low enough, ``people find out that there's some  
strong underlying demand,'' McManus said. ``After all, there's lots 
of cash in money-market mutual funds, and so there is a lot of 
liquidity, and earnings growth is improving, the manufacturing 
economy is improving, and it doesn't look like (Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan) Greenspan has indicated that he plans to let 
inflation run away any time in the next few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was quiet following a 10 a.m. Commerce  
Department report that new orders for U.S. factory goods rose 1.7 
percent in January to a $349.6 billion annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
	While that was a record high, it was still a little under  
economists' expectations and therefore didn't raise fears of

<HEADLINE> Sens. To Overhaul Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crop insurance would cost less and be more  
widely available to farmers under an overhaul proposed Thursday by 
farm-state senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is an attempt to reinforce the safety net  
created by the 1996 farm bill. The market-oriented ``Freedom to 
Farm'' law replaced decades of federal subsidy programs with a 
seven-year system of direct, declining payments aimed at weaning 
producers off the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the crop insurance changes say farmers need new  
tools for handling market fluctuations as they move away from 
reliance on government subsidies tied to crop production. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this time of low prices and global economic woes, farmers  
and ranchers deserve an effective risk-management tool they can 
depend on,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., the 1996 farm law's 
architect and a sponsor of the crop insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a fellow Kansan, said the  
proposal raises many of the ideas he has advocated, including 
providing more affordable and accessible insurance, speeding new 
insurance policies to market, helping farmers hit with multiyear 
losses and allowing federally sponsored livestock coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that this bill establishes a strong basis for  
working together toward meaningful crop insurance reform this 
year,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman plans to hold several hearings across the country on  
the issue. But lawmakers were irate that President Clinton 
submitted his budget with no proposals on how to fund crop 
insurance changes, despite mentioning them in his State of the 
Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would double the government's cost of providing crop  
insurance to about $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Roberts and other lawmakers saw crop insurance as a way  
to stabilize farmers hit with disaster. But many farmers still 
don't have crop insurance or don't have enough coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is, crop insurance doesn't work where disasters have  
struck several years in a row, because policies are based on past 
crop yields. If yields drop, so does the available coverage. And if 
a producer, spurred by flexibility in the 1996 law, plants a 
completely new crop, insurers aren't willing to cover it until a 
few years later, when the crop is established. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would address those problems by creating an average  
production history credit program for start-up farmers or those who 
have added land or rotated crops. It would adjust the history for 
producers who have suffered calamities. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage producers to buy crop insurance and boost coverage  
levels, the bill's sponsors propose to provide higher subsidy 
payments for those with more coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bill inverts current subsidy formulas and increases the  
likelihood that farmers will find it a better way to manage risk,'' 
said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., another of the measure's co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would waive the current ban on insuring livestock.  
</P>
<P>
	It also would restructure the Federal Crop Insurance Commission  
Board and increase the Risk Management Agency's accountability to 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure would create a private-public  
partnership office within the Agriculture Department and a fee 
system designed to protect companies that develop new insurance 
policies sold by other companies.

<HEADLINE> 400-Year-Old Horoscope Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 400-year-old horoscope that was written  
for an Austrian nobleman by the astronomer Johannes Kepler himself 
was discovered in a drawer at a University of California at Santa 
Cruz archive. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, written in a flowery hand by the man who helped  
discover the laws of orbital motion, was located by astronomer 
Anthony Misch in December while he was researching solar eclipse 
expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear exactly what Kepler was predicting for the life  
of Hans Hannibal Hutter von Hutterhofen, who was born in 1586. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it said to collect your taxes from your serfs tomorrow  
or don't put your money on the Holy Roman Empire, I don't know,'' 
Misch said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The document includes the nobleman's date and time of birth in  
German, as well as a sepia-colored diamond with an X through it 
enclosed by a square. It is signed by another eminent astronomer, 
Wilhelm Struve, declaring that the horoscope is written ``in the 
hand of Kepler, from the collection of Kepler Manuscripts in 
Pulkova.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulkova observatory was founded near St. Petersburg, Russia,  
in the early 1800s. Struve signed the manuscript in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was completely unexpected. It was a very, very exciting  
thing for me to discover it because I am a collector and an amateur 
historian,'' Misch said. ``It made me tremble a bit to find 
something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Misch sent the 4-by-6-inch manuscript, still in excellent  
condition after being backed in construction paper and preserved in 
``a real cheap little frame,'' to an autograph specialist in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote back very promptly and said, `Congratulations, you  
have a Kepler,''' Misch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's Lick Observatory apparently bought the  
horoscope in Germany in the late 1800s, according to a journal of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kepler was the imperial mathmetician to the Holy Roman Emporer  
Rudolph II. His discoveries that planetary orbits were elliptical 
and that planets speed up when they get closer to the sun laid the 
groundwork for Sir Isaac Newton's theory of gravity a half-century 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	But did Kepler really believe in astrology?  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't apparently believe in the daily influence of the  
planets on people's lives,'' Misch said. ``But he was very much of 
a mystic, with one foot in medieval times and one foot in the 
scientific method.''

<HEADLINE> Lifer Freed After 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- JeDonna Young still doesn't sleep a full night.  
</P>
<P>
	In the darkness of her bedroom, she wakes and, with tears  
welling in her eyes, relives the same moments over and over: 
</P>
<P>
	The last walk from her cell. The clank of the prison gates  
behind her. The first rush of cold air and the warm embrace of her 
niece, who handed her 20 red roses -- one for each year she had 
spent behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep thanking God,'' she says. ``This is such a blessing. I  
say to myself, 'It really happened!' and I'm just so thankful. Then 
I cry. I think it's just kicking in, the reality of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality is JeDonna Young is free.  
</P>
<P>
	Two decades after she was sentenced to life without parole for  
heroin possession, she was released -- thanks to a change in the 
law. It was a day she never doubted she would see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought how I would get out, what it would be like,''  
she says, sitting in her mother's home, where she now lives. ``It 
was just getting out -- that was the hardest part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young was the first inmate paroled after state lawmakers amended  
Michigan's ``650 lifer law,'' a throw-the-book-at-'em measure for 
anyone convicted of delivering, or intending to deliver, 650 grams, 
about 1.4 pounds, of cocaine or heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her boyfriend, who was the target of police, were  
arrested in 1978 after nearly three pounds of heroin were found in 
her car. She has always maintained she didn't know it was there; he 
swore she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plight -- a 24-year-old mother with no prior criminal record  
doomed to die in prison -- had stirred sympathy over the years. Even 
an appeals court suggested the law wasn't intended for her, writing 
in 1989: ``The tiger trap may have sprung upon a sick kitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until last year that the law changed, making  
parole a possibility for a handful of prisoners, including Young. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, her bid for freedom had a well-known supporter:  
former Gov. William Milliken. ``Had I realized that the law would 
have been applied to individuals like JeDonna Young, I would never 
have signed the bill,'' he wrote the parole board, saying he had 
believed the measure would be used for drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's decision was unanimous.  
</P>
<P>
	Days later, JeDonna Young walked out, carrying her life's  
belongings in a few boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely older and I'm definitely wiser,'' says Young,  
now a grandmother about to turn 45. ``I'm not sad. I'm just in awe. 
Twenty years. I keep saying that to myself. TWENTY years. That's a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So long that the 7-year-old son she left behind is now the  
father of a 7-year-old girl. So long that the niece who drove her 
home was just 4 when she went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	So long that the everyday world has become a strange, confusing,  
even overwhelming place. 
</P>
<P>
	In prison, she constantly wore radio or TV headphones to cut  
herself off from her surroundings. Now, she wanders through 
groceries and malls, gawking at everything, surprised at what is 
commonplace: 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet chocolate that costs $30 a pound. (``I almost  
fainted!'') 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarkets stocked with ready-made sandwiches and mashed  
potatoes. (``Everything is so commercial!'') 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech gadgets with curious alphabet names: HDTV and DVD.  
(``I remember when 8-track tapes were new.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' she says, her eyes widening, ``I'm giving off  
vibes like I just landed from Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though two decades have passed, she says she ``felt like a  
little girl on Easter'' when she went shopping with her 71-year-old 
mother, Irene Hardy, the day after her Jan. 29 release. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom bought me some shoes and gave me a purse and a couple  
of dollars,'' she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	And she spent some of it indulging in things she had longed for  
behind bars: fresh vegetables, white chocolate, Southern pecan 
coffee beans, ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
	Her top priority now is to get a master's degree in social work  
so she can work with troubled families. She earned a bachelor's 
degree in prison and worked as a certified paralegal for legal 
services, making about $3 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Her hair in a pony tail, her face unlined, JeDonna Young looks  
like a college student. She is poised and confident -- this is a 
woman, after all, who kept a resume in prison. But she is 
misty-eyed, too, recalling how she gave some of her meager 
belongings to other lifers before she left, selecting personal 
items she thought each could use. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she goes out daily with family and friends, there have  
been no solo ventures yet, except shoveling her mother's sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been taking everything very slowly,'' she says. ``I'm  
here, but I'm not solid yet with my surroundings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Hardy told her where the bus stops in the neighborhood  
were, she replied, ``Well, I don't think I could ride a bus now,'' 
her mother recalls. ``She's frightened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a drive near her childhood home, nothing was recognizable --  
old buildings were down, new ones up. On her first trip down her 
mother's block, something was different. But what? Then she 
realized: It was the towering maple trees, just scrawny saplings 
when she left. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has apologized to her mother and her 27-year-old son,  
Deloneo, for putting them through an ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law was cruel,'' Mrs. Hardy says. ``They didn't only make  
my child suffer. My whole family suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She still marvels at being with her daughter. ``I keep looking  
at you,'' she told Young the other day, ``and I want someone to 
pinch me and make sure that this is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deloneo, who was raised by his grandmother, is giddy, too,  
though for years he was bitter, wondering why murderers were 
released from prison but his mother was not. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day she got out, it was cloudy,'' Deloneo recalls from  
Kalamazoo, where he runs a sandwich shop. ``Then the sun came out 
of nowhere. I said, 'My mama's home! Let me give her a call.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	They spent their first day together watching the Super Bowl.  
``It was just like you died and had gone to heaven,'' says Deloneo, 
who fell asleep in her lap. ``I have a family back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, they met in Kalamazoo and took a walk.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just lovely ... that nobody was listening or watching  
or taping the phone conversation,'' Deloneo says. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is catching up with Del, as she calls him, poring over  
childhood snapshots of him in Halloween costumes and on camping 
trips. But she is determined not to dwell on missed memories or 
mistakes made. 
</P>
<P>
	``A long time ago I ... promised myself that I'm not going to  
look behind me,'' she says. ``I would not sit up and think about 
why I was there and how I got there. ... I had to stop asking, 
'Why? Why?' I said, 'God, let your will be done. All I ask is that 
you guide my steps.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's former boyfriend and co-defendant, James Gulley, died in  
prison in 1997. He apologized to her and, for years, wrote her. She 
never responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades of paying for one mistake have made JeDonna Young  
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't feel right,'' she says, ``I don't do it.''  
</P>
<P>
	And now even mundane things thrill her.  
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate being outside, taking a walk, doing the  
laundry,'' she says. ``I have a new outlook on life. It's almost 
like someone died and has been revived. I take nothing for 
granted.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tests Fund-Raising Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley looked to  
his first presidential fund-raiser Thursday for a rush of early 
money that he hopes will make his bid for the Democratic nomination 
appear less of a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in his adopted home state after a series of campaign trips,  
Bradley hoped to bank $1.5 million from the evening event. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more fund-raisers geared at upper middle-class voters are  
scheduled over the next six weeks as Bradley tries to wrest the 
nomination from Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world of $1,000 contributors at the presidential level is  
not a large world as it is now defined,'' Bradley said last week in 
New Hampshire. ``It could be expanded if you're different enough, 
if you're talking about the future in a compelling-enough way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign announced earlier this week that it had qualified  
for public matching funds by raising $5,000 in amounts of $250 or 
less in 21 states. Though the matching funds won't flow until next 
year, Bradley is using his early qualification as a sign of his 
viability. 
</P>
<P>
	His close friend Phil Jackson, a fellow New York Knick in the  
1970s and until recently the coach of the Chicago Bulls, provided 
star power at Thursday's fund-raiser and will attend another next 
week in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	John Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres, also is helping  
Bradley raise money. Bradley aides say other prominent sports 
figures will be involved in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say presidential candidates in 2000 need to raise $20  
million by the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> New Claims Against Olympics' Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Olympic Committee delegate  
Phil Coles allegedly accepted thousands of dollars worth of jewelry 
from a businessman connected to Athens' bid to host the 1996 
Olympic Games, a report said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting the diamond and gold cufflinks and a gold necklace in  
1990 breached IOC rules, the Australian Financial Review reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations, which come on top of claims Coles received more  
than $60,000 worth of travel and gifts from Salt Lake City, were 
reportedly made by senior figures who worked on Melbourne's bid to 
host the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources refused to be named. One told the newspaper that the  
estimated value of the jewelry was about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the International Olympic Committee rules barred  
gifts worth more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic corruption investigators would be happy to view any  
evidence of fresh allegations against Coles, International Olympic 
Committee member Jacques Rogge told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, member of an IOC committee probing bribery allegations  
surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, said he had not 
heard details of the new allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to uncover every possible wrongdoing so if there is  
any information we would like to look for irrefutable evidence,'' 
he told ABC radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing and breaching  
the rules we would apply sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When told of the new claims, Rogge said he was interested in  
receiving documents to prove them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubts about what you're saying to me but before  
commencing I would like to have the facts, if any,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles returned from Switzerland this week after meeting IOC vice  
president Dick Pound, chairman of the investigation into the 
tainted Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will recommend to either expel, reprimand or exonerate  
Coles for allegedly accepting gifts and travel from Salt Lake 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the investigation are expected in the next few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to contact Coles for comment were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Davis Earns Extra Day Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Davis delivered his first clutch hit  
for the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday, not that it showed up in 
any boxscore. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his single gave the Bob Gibsons a victory over the Stan  
Musials in an intrasquad game and earned his side a nice reward -- 
an extra day off during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was merely exercising my right as a veteran to take care of  
the veterans,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams actually ended up tied at 3 after 4 1-2 innings, with  
Mark McGwire singling in both his at-bats against batting practice 
pitcher Dave McKay. But with the stakes so high -- by spring 
standards, at least -- manager Tony La Russa figured there had to be 
a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	So every player was allowed to hit a fair ball into the empty  
field and Rene Lachemann, who served as catcher, umpire and public 
address announcer, called them hits or outs. 
</P>
<P>
	With players on both sides standing near the plate and  
hollering, McGwire hit a popup to the mound but Davis singled to 
left field to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	Musial was not at the park and neither was Gibson. Next week,  
Gibson is expected at camp to work with St. Louis pitchers, and La 
Russa said he'd make sure the Hall of Famer knew his team had won. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll put a suitable trophy in his locker,'' La Russa said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was an earlier intrasquad game featuring many of the  
younger Cardinals, and that one also had consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	As in, players on the losing team had to make two of the  
Cardinals' three longest spring bus trips -- there's a 140-mile ride 
to Haines City to play Kansas City and a pair of 110-mile swings to 
Viera to play Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Drew homered in that game, but it was waved off -- again,  
anything goes in spring training -- when it was decided his team had 
used too many hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew's team lost, ensuring the prized rookie a scenic tour of  
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young guys need the trips,'' La Russa said. ``It's good  
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 300 was drawn to Roger Dean Stadium by the  
chance to see McGwire play for free. The souvenir stand opened for 
business and did well with several McGwire items, including a model 
bat selling for $75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals play their first exhibition game Friday against  
Los Angeles at Vero Beach. Kent Mercker will start for St. Louis 
against Ismael Valdes.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks Ask $62B in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fifteen of Japan's largest banks formally applied  
for $62 billion in government aid Thursday as part of a publicly 
funded cleanup of the nation's loan problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks -- which included some of the world's largest lenders,  
such as the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. -- 
also had to submit restructuring plans to the Financial 
Reconstruction Commission, which is overseeing the cleanup, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will use the plans submitted Thursday to draw up  
the terms for preferred stock and subordinated bonds that the banks 
will sell the government to get the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks get to pay low rates of interest for the money. Other  
than that, the stocks and bonds sold to the government will be 
treated like normal securities -- including giving the government a 
shareholder's say. 
</P>
<P>
	The final terms of the sale are to be released March 12, and the  
actual purchases will take place March 30, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds were approved late last year as part of a $210 billion  
bailout of the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese banks are struggling to write off bad loans estimated  
at between $580 billion and $1.2 trillion. The loan problem has 
soaked up funds badly needed to help the economy pull out of its 
worst recession since World War II.

<HEADLINE> Online After-Hours Trading To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long excluded from the world of after-hours  
trading, individual investors may now get the chance to react to 
late-breaking news when it occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this summer, a leading Internet brokerage will offer  
an evening trading session for its customers through a new 
electronic exchange named IndivEx. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Discover Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter &AMP; Co., may be quite profitable considering how the soaring 
popularity of Internet trading has overwhelmed online trading 
systems at major firms in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, cautioned that individuals may be better off  
if they remain sheltered from the sharp price swings typical of 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have the misimpression that by not being able to  
trade after hours, they are missing out on great opportunities,'' 
said Bill Burnham, an industry analyst for CS First Boston. 
``They're not likely to get some great deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evening session would begin at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. Eastern time  
and run for two or three hours. Right now, about 40 percent of 
Discover's trades are placed after 6 p.m. Eastern time and then 
executed the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for after-hours  
trading,'' said IndivEx co-founder Michael Satow, who previously 
worked as a lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual investors are well-suited for after-hours trading  
because they work all day,'' he said. It's when they get at home at 
night that they have time to digest the day's financial news, 
discuss it with their family, and make trading decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many publicly held companies release important news after  
the 4 p.m. closing bell on Wall Street, only professional money 
managers have been able to buy or sell stock before the market 
reopens. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, many of these money managers are acting on behalf of  
individuals through the mutual funds and huge pools of retirement 
money they control. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, investors have long carped about having their personal  
assets frozen until the morning or for an entire weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But while after-hours trading has been available to  
institutional investors for years, the volume has remained 
relatively light. If there's a major imbalance between buyers and 
sellers, stock prices can move wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a lot of liquidity, the after-hours market (for  
individual investors) could be very volatile,'' said Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipse Trading, the creator of IndivEx, hopes to protect  
investors from sudden price swings by requiring them to place 
``limit orders'' that specify an exact price for any stock they 
want to buy or sell. A size limit such as 5,000 shares may also be 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	IndivEx also announced Wednesday that Bernard L. Madoff  
Investment Securities, a top ``market maker,'' has signed onto the 
project. Market makers are a crucial link in any electronic trading 
system, matching buy and sell orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Discover and Madoff may not be the only securities firms that  
see an opportunity in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Goldman Sachs and ETrade each bought a 25 percent  
stake in Archipelago, the operator of an electronic trading system 
for Nasdaq stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But ETrade, the No. 2 online broker, and Charles Schwab, the  
biggest, both said they have no plans at this time to offer 
after-hours trading for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	And Instinet, a unit of Reuters that pioneered post-market  
trading and still conducts the bulk of all such trades, declined to 
comment on whether it might develop a retail business.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Jesuit order's weekly magazine, America, has  
appointed its first lay Catholic and first woman staff member in 90 
years of publication. Patricia A. Kossmann will be literary editor, 
mainly responsible for book reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Kossmann,a specialist in publishing Catholic books, succeeds the  
Rev. Patrick Samway. She was a senior editor at Doubleday and 
manager of its Image Books imprint, and executive editor of Triumph 
Books and Liguori Publications. She is a past president of the 
Catholic Book Publishers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	America's editor, the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, said the Kossmann's  
appointment ``is in keeping with the Jesuit commitment to 
collaborative ministry with the laity, and solidarity with women.''

 *Church yearbook shows continuity    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 1999 Yearbook of American and Canadian  
Churches, produced by the National Council of Churches, generally 
shows continuity in religious trends. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest U.S. denominations remain in the same order as last  
year: the Roman Catholic Church; Southern Baptist Convention; 
United Methodist Church; National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.; 
and Church of God in Christ. The Catholic Church also is the 
largest group in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Several predominantly white and relatively liberal denominations  
affiliated with the National Council of Churches continue to lose 
members, while conservative groups outside the council continue to 
grow. But the yearbook said the rates of decline and increase have 
flattened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearbook acquired financial reports from 58 U.S.  
denominations showing annual contributions totaling $24.9 billion. 
Those groups account for 28 percent of the 157.5 million members of 
organized religion in the United States.

 *Evangelical group names president    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Bishop Kevin W. Mannoia of the Free  
Methodist Church has been named president of the National 
Association of Evangelicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannoia, 43, of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., was named by the board  
at the annual meeting of the NAE, a theologically conservative 
association claiming 43,000 local churches, 49 denominations and 
250 independent ministries. The appointment is effective in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming a bishop in 1996, Mannoia was a district  
superintendent, pastor and college executive. He has a theology 
degree from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Illinois and a 
Ph.D. in higher education administration from the University of 
North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannoia succeeds the Rev. Don Argue, who has been named  
president of Northwest College in Kirkland, Wash.

 *50 church fires may be traced to one man    	
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man charged with seven fires at Indiana  
churches may be responsible for up to 50 fires throughout the 
Midwest and South, according to probable cause affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department said Jay Scott Ballinger, 36, of  
Yorktown, was arrested and charged with setting seven Indiana 
church fires dating back to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Also charged with one count each of arson are Angela Wood, 24,  
of Atlanta, described as an exotic dancer and Ballinger's 
girlfriend; and Donald A. Puckett, 37, of Lebanon, Ind. Wood is in 
federal custody in Macon, Ga., and Puckett is being held in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests stemmed from the work of the National Church Arson  
Task Force, established in 1996 after a series of fires at black 
churches in the South. Those arrested are white, and most of the 
Indiana churches burned were in mainly white rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit from a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
agent said Ballinger, who was tracked to a hospital where he was 
treated for burns Feb. 7, admitted as many as 50 church fires. 
Jerry Singer, an ATF special agent, said the fires occurred from 
Ohio to Mississippi.

 *Orthodox Jews protest changes in Israeli law    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some 25,000 Orthodox Jews chanted psalms at a  
prayer vigil in protest of Israeli supreme court rulings that could 
reduce Orthodox influence over everyday activities in the Jewish 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks earlier, some 200,000 Orthodox Jews protested in  
Jerusalem over the same grievances. Among them: a recent Israeli 
supreme court edict that could allow seminary students to be 
drafted and another challenging Orthodox control of marriage, 
burial and Sabbath travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox Jews make up only 10 percent of Israel's population.  
But they control the parliament through political parties. The 
rulings put them at odds with secular Jews, who comprise 70 percent 
of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Many secular Jews in Israel fear increased Orthodox influence  
and object in particular to an exemption from compulsory military 
service if Orthodox youths are engaged in full-time, 
government-subsidized religious studies. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent court ruling ordered Israel's parliament, the Knesset,  
to either legalize the exemption or draft the ultra-Orthodox.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Cable Car Verdict Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Eight military jurors announced they  
reached a verdict today after a second day of deliberations on 
whether a Marine pilot whose jet hit an Italian ski gondola cable 
last year is guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the 20 people 
who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors announced they would soon return to the courtroom to  
announce the verdict. Six of the eight officers on the jury must 
vote guilty in order to convict Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission 
Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors deliberated for four hours on Wednesday, and about  
three hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, has urged jurors to rely on the  
expert testimony. He said his client suffered from an optical 
illusion that made him think his jet was higher than it was, that 
an altimeter on the jet malfunctioned and that the gondola at 
Cavalese, Italy, wasn't marked on American maps. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the only reason the  
mishap happened was because Ashby flew by his own rules. He said 
the pilot ignored speed and altitude limits, which Ashby testified 
he didn't know about. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces more than 200 years in prison if convicted of all  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the jury deliberated, attorneys for Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, the navigator in Ashby's EA-6B Prowler jet, said 
closing arguments made them optimistic that charges against their 
client could be dismissed. Schweitzer faces charges similar to 
Ashby's.

<HEADLINE> Ind. Ax Killings Jury Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A jury deadlocked on murder charges that a  
teen-ager faced in the ax killings of his pastor and the 
clergyman's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman said he planned to retry  
17-year-old Sean Rich in the Dec. 15, 1996, slayings of the Rev. C. 
Frederick Mathias of Northminster Presbyterian Church and his wife, 
Cleta, because he wanted to gain closure for the Mathias family. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could not agree Wednesday on murder, arson, battery  
and other charges after 11 hours of deliberations but convicted 
Rich on one count each of burglary and theft and two counts of 
confinement. It acquitted him on a charge of cruelty to an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich could receive up to 93 years in prison when he is sentenced  
April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Mathias family and the congregation shook their  
heads in disbelief as Judge Gary Miller read the verdicts to a 
packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't express how disappointed we are that this hell the  
Mathias family has suffered through will continue,'' said Mark 
Moore, the congregation's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias and his wife were found lying face down and bloodied in  
their family room, their hands bound behind their backs. 
Investigators said an ax was stuck in the back of the minister's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's pet cat had been kicked to death and was found  
under a Christmas tree. Police suspect that Rich, who was 15 at the 
time of the crimes, started a fire to destroy evidence of the 
crimes. Police discovered a container of lighter fluid at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich's friend, Paul Brightman, testified during the trial he had  
handed the ax to Rich and watched his young accomplice swing the ax 
and kill the couple. Brightman testified as part of a plea bargain 
in which he accepted a 65-year prison sentence for his role in the 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich's attorney, Glenn Huelskamp, tried to portray Brightman as  
an unreliable witness who was scared by police into placing Rich at 
the crime scene.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In his first day on the job,  
Brazil's new central banker Arminio Fraga raised interest rates to 
45 percent Thursday in a controversial effort to stamp out 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga called the increase in the Central Bank's lending rate for  
commercial banks necessary to keep prices from exploding. ``Our 
main commitment is to (control) inflation,'' Fraga told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have risen sharply since January, when Brazil stopped  
spending dollars to prop up its currency. The real has lost about 
43 percent of its value since then, which has made imported goods 
and components more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets reacted well to Fraga's announcement. The  
Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's 
largest, was up 2 percent in afternoon trading. The real 
strengthened to 2.07 to the dollar from 2.14 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	But many economists say raising interest rates will have a  
disastrous impact on the deficit and recession. The government 
admits the economy will shrink 3 percent to 4 percent this year, 
and private analysts predict it will be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs said Wednesday that Brazil  
should immediately cut interest rates to 20 percent to create jobs 
and take pressure off the deficit. But Brazilians are afraid of a 
return of the four-digit inflation that plagued the economy for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inflation rate will determine whether or not we have  
problems,'' said Fraga, a former associate of U.S. financier George 
Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga gave himself powers to lower interest rates whenever he  
wanted but said the bank's monetary policy committee would have to 
approve any further increase. 
</P>
<P>
	By next month, Brazil expects to receive about $9 billion from a  
$41.5 billion aid package put together by the International 
Monetary Fund. The money will be available after the two sides 
reach an agreement on ways to fix the economy, which could be 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show of command by Fraga was seen as a positive sign, after  
a month when monetary policy was virtually adrift. Fraga's 
predecessor, Francisco Lopes, was fired on Feb. 2 for failing to 
stop speculation that weakened the real.

<HEADLINE> Report: Boeing Sold Jets Below Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A report by an aerospace analyst concludes that  
Boeing Co. last year sold its planes below the cost of producing 
them, with average prices paid by customers 14 percent to 27 
percent below list prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Nisbet, an analyst for JSA Research, attempted to quantify  
Boeing's practice of discounting its jetliners to customers in its 
price war with European archrival Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	In his report, Nisbet uses a new figure disclosed by Boeing to  
subtract revenues it received for such extras as spare parts, 
training and modifications from its overall commercial-jet revenues 
of $35.5 billion. Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial 
Airplane Group, told financial analysts last week that those extras 
amounted to $4 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	By subtracting the extras, Nisbet said he could estimate for the  
first time the prices customers paid last year for the airplanes 
themselves, and compare them with list prices, which Boeing has 
raised by 2 percent to 10 percent since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, customers paid $31.5 billion for the 559 planes Boeing  
delivered last year, Nisbet said. He then calculated the average 
actual prices paid per aircraft model and compared them with the 
list prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked at what I found,'' he said. ``The airline that  
needs some airplanes in the short term might have to pay the list 
price for quick delivery, but the others are not coming close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials refused to comment on Nisbet's report or his  
methodology. The company does not release details of its aircraft 
sales, other than a gross value when a customer gives permission. 
Each sale is unique, varying widely by aircraft model, customer, 
financing arrangements, and the deal Boeing can cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, the world's largest maker of commercial jet aircraft,  
made $1.12 billion profit last year on $56 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Nisbet said that not only did Boeing sell its planes at a  
discount, it sold them below cost, losing almost $600 million on 
aircraft sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Nisbet figures Boeing had a 1998 pretax profit of $651 million  
on the sale of parts, services, training and other extras. Overall, 
the commercial airplane group reported a 1998 profit of just $63 
million, meaning Boeing ``was $590 million in the hole on their 
aircraft,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ad Campaign Promotes Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Here's a warning for drivers everywhere: ``Keep  
using my name in vain and I'll make rush hour longer -- God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is on a billboard in Texas, one in a series of giant  
road signs with pithy messages purporting to be divinely crafted. 
Another warns Texans: ``You think it's hot here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signs are part of a national campaign called ``God Speaks,''  
advertisements with black backgrounds and stark white lettering and 
18 different slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-denominational ads -- meant to pique the interest of  
people who don't attend church -- began in Florida and have appeared 
in northern Texas since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers in other cities soon will start seeing the billboards,  
which are also posted on the Internet and have won several national 
advertising awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's meet at my house Sunday before the game,'' one billboard  
implores. ``Loved the wedding, invite me to the marriage,'' another 
suggests. The Bible gets top billing in this one: ``Have you read 
my 1 best seller? There will be a test.'' All of the ads are signed 
``God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida and Texas signs were financed by separate, anonymous  
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rick Rendon, general manager of Outdoor Systems Advertising  
Inc., said members of the Dallas Outdoor Advertising Association 
were behind the Texas campaign, and that billboard owners have 
donated some of their space. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may take some heat over it,'' Rendon said in today's Dallas  
Morning News. But, ``we think it's a great campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smith Agency of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., created the ads on  
behalf of an anonymous client. 
</P>
<P>
	But the messages are boldly signed and to the point, as in:  
``Don't make me come down there -- God.''

<HEADLINE>  MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson's first two innings on the  
mound for the Arizona Diamondbacks were routine by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the young University of Arizona batters who faced him, they  
were 31 pitches that are impossible to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like the Eiffel Tower because I'm only  
5-foot-7,'' said 19-year-old Keoni DeRenne, one of two batters who 
hit a ball into fair territory against the Big Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's immense. It was just awesome. Hopefully, they got it on  
videotape because I'd like to show it to my kids someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his trademark glare, at 6-foot-10 towering on the mouned,  
Johnson methodically struck out four of the six batters he faced 
Wednesday. The other two grounded out to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Torres struck out on three pitches, and was thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have the opportunity to face Randy Johnson, it's like  
a dream come true, it's like a childhood dream,'' he said. ``Yeah, 
three pitches, but those three pitches meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was more or less satisfied with his effort. Of his 31  
pitches, five were call strikes, seven were swinging strikes, six 
were fouls, 11 were balls and two were hit in play. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a couple of breaking balls and change-ups, but mostly  
four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed the breaking ball wasn't there, but  
I'm always that way in spring training,'' Johnson said. ``I just 
went out there to work on my mechanics and my arm strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Diamondbacks, strolled to the mound at Tucson Electric Park under 
bright sunshine in 80-degree weather. In the distance beyond left 
field, the Catalina Mountains provided a scenic backdrop to what 
amounted to a historic moment for the second-year franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks purple was the fourth major-league uniform  
Johnson has worn. He started his career with Montreal and spent 9 1/2 
seasons with the Seattle Mariners. For a half-season last year, he 
on the Houston Astros. Now he's the marquee addition to a 
high-priced rotation that could vault Arizona into National League 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Johnson said, ``not nearly exciting as the  
first start I make in L.A. (the April 5 season opener against Kevin 
Brown in Dodger Stadium) or probably even more so when I make my 
first start at Bank One. But it's going to be an exciting four 
years for this organization and for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't want to hit anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get worried if it's a guy up there making millions of  
dollars, let alone a young kid trying to get a college education,'' 
he said. ``He might be president of the United States someday. You 
never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks eventually won the game 10-2. It was, Johnson  
joked, a little revenge for other games he'd pitched against the 
Wildcats long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Johnson faced the University of Arizona, he walked  
six and was shelled for six runs on 13 hits in a 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1985. He was no Big Unit then, just an extremely tall,  
extremely wild junior at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting back at U of A after all those beatings I used to  
take at USC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in baseball on Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland Indians outfielder Mark Whiten will miss at least  
two weeks of spring training with a stress fracture of his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, expected to open the season as a reserve, complained  
about pain in the foot and underwent tests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Relief pitcher Jeff Shaw couldn't wait any longer for the  
birth of his third child and arrived at the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
camp at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was given permission to report after wife Julie delivered,  
which was supposed to be Feb. 15, then Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie's still healthy, the baby's not in danger, that's the  
most important thing. . . . This one's being stubborn,'' Shaw said. 
The Shaws have been told they are going to have a son. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ron Wright's back appears to be all right. Wright, who missed  
most of last season with a back injury, hit two home runs in a 
Pittsburgh Pirates intrasquad game at Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Pirates are still waiting for outfielder Jose  
Guillen, stuck in the Dominican Republic while awaiting an entry 
visa into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The stars at the St. Louis Cardinals' Jupiter, Fla., camp  
weren't players. ``The real heroes were the groundskeepers,'' 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``They told us a storm was coming 
between 12:30 and 1 p.m., so we moved everything up an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although rain cut short two intrasquad games, there was enough  
time for a 9-8 contest on a field where the wind was blowing out. 
The game on the field where it was blowing in was 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Port St. Lucie, Fla., the New York Mets assigned former  
catcher John Stearns as an advance scout during the regular season. 
Stearns will report on the tendencies of both pitchers and hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Toronto Blue Jays signed six players, including pitcher  
Chris Carpenter and outfielder Shannon Stewart, who agreed to 
three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-baseman Tom Evans, utility player Felipe Crespo and  
right-hander Nerio Rodriguez all signed one-year deals, and 
reliever Robert Person's contract was renewed. That means the Jays' 
entire 40-man roster is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter's and Stewart's deals are believed to be worth  
more than $3 million. It's the first time the Blue Jays have signed 
long-term deals with players with fewer than two years of 
major-league service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter and Stewart said they appreciated the Blue Jays`  
precedent-setting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It`s good for me,'' said Stewart, 25, who batted .279 and  
stole 51 bases in 144 games last season. ``It gives me security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, 23, was 12-7 and had a 4.37 earned-run average in 33  
games last season, 24 of them starts. He was scheduled to start 
against Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and the New York Yankees in 
Toronto's first exhibition game today.

<HEADLINE>  MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson's first two innings on the  
mound for the Arizona Diamondbacks were routine by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the young University of Arizona batters who faced him, they  
were 31 pitches that are impossible to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like the Eiffel Tower because I'm only  
5-foot-7,'' said 19-year-old Keoni DeRenne, one of two batters who 
hit a ball into fair territory against the Big Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's immense. It was just awesome. Hopefully, they got it on  
videotape because I'd like to show it to my kids someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his trademark glare, at 6-foot-10 towering on the mouned,  
Johnson methodically struck out four of the six batters he faced 
Wednesday. The other two grounded out to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Torres struck out on three pitches, and was thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have the opportunity to face Randy Johnson, it's like  
a dream come true, it's like a childhood dream,'' he said. ``Yeah, 
three pitches, but those three pitches meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was more or less satisfied with his effort. Of his 31  
pitches, five were call strikes, seven were swinging strikes, six 
were fouls, 11 were balls and two were hit in play. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a couple of breaking balls and change-ups, but mostly  
four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed the breaking ball wasn't there, but  
I'm always that way in spring training,'' Johnson said. ``I just 
went out there to work on my mechanics and my arm strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Diamondbacks, strolled to the mound at Tucson Electric Park under 
bright sunshine in 80-degree weather. In the distance beyond left 
field, the Catalina Mountains provided a scenic backdrop to what 
amounted to a historic moment for the second-year franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks purple was the fourth major-league uniform  
Johnson has worn. He started his career with Montreal and spent 9 1/2 
seasons with the Seattle Mariners. For a half-season last year, he 
on the Houston Astros. Now he's the marquee addition to a 
high-priced rotation that could vault Arizona into National League 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Johnson said, ``not nearly exciting as the  
first start I make in L.A. (the April 5 season opener against Kevin 
Brown in Dodger Stadium) or probably even more so when I make my 
first start at Bank One. But it's going to be an exciting four 
years for this organization and for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't want to hit anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get worried if it's a guy up there making millions of  
dollars, let alone a young kid trying to get a college education,'' 
he said. ``He might be president of the United States someday. You 
never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks eventually won the game 10-2. It was, Johnson  
joked, a little revenge for other games he'd pitched against the 
Wildcats long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Johnson faced the University of Arizona, he walked  
six and was shelled for six runs on 13 hits in a 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1985. He was no Big Unit then, just an extremely tall,  
extremely wild junior at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting back at U of A after all those beatings I used to  
take at USC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in baseball on Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland Indians outfielder Mark Whiten will miss at least  
two weeks of spring training with a stress fracture of his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, expected to open the season as a reserve, complained  
about pain in the foot and underwent tests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Relief pitcher Jeff Shaw couldn't wait any longer for the  
birth of his third child and arrived at the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
camp at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was given permission to report after wife Julie delivered,  
which was supposed to be Feb. 15, then Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie's still healthy, the baby's not in danger, that's the  
most important thing. . . . This one's being stubborn,'' Shaw said. 
The Shaws have been told they are going to have a son. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ron Wright's back appears to be all right. Wright, who missed  
most of last season with a back injury, hit two home runs in a 
Pittsburgh Pirates intrasquad game at Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Pirates are still waiting for outfielder Jose  
Guillen, stuck in the Dominican Republic while awaiting an entry 
visa into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The stars at the St. Louis Cardinals' Jupiter, Fla., camp  
weren't players. ``The real heroes were the groundskeepers,'' 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``They told us a storm was coming 
between 12:30 and 1 p.m., so we moved everything up an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although rain cut short two intrasquad games, there was enough  
time for a 9-8 contest on a field where the wind was blowing out. 
The game on the field where it was blowing in was 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Port St. Lucie, Fla., the New York Mets assigned former  
catcher John Stearns as an advance scout during the regular season. 
Stearns will report on the tendencies of both pitchers and hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Toronto Blue Jays signed six players, including pitcher  
Chris Carpenter and outfielder Shannon Stewart, who agreed to 
three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-baseman Tom Evans, utility player Felipe Crespo and  
right-hander Nerio Rodriguez all signed one-year deals, and 
reliever Robert Person's contract was renewed. That means the Jays' 
entire 40-man roster is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter's and Stewart's deals are believed to be worth  
more than $3 million. It's the first time the Blue Jays have signed 
long-term deals with players with fewer than two years of 
major-league service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter and Stewart said they appreciated the Blue Jays`  
precedent-setting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It`s good for me,'' said Stewart, 25, who batted .279 and  
stole 51 bases in 144 games last season. ``It gives me security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, 23, was 12-7 and had a 4.37 earned-run average in 33  
games last season, 24 of them starts. He was scheduled to start 
against Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and the New York Yankees in 
Toronto's first exhibition game today.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A financial overhaul bill proposed by Senate  
Banking Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, split the committee along 
partisan lines today. 
</P>
<P>
	It faces a presidential veto because President Clinton believes  
the bill, which would lift the Depression-era barriers between 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies, fails to protect 
consumers and would hurt community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was adopted and sent to the full Senate by the  
Banking Committee, 11-9, with only the Republican senators 
supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved a GOP amendment exempting small  
banks -- with less than $100 million in assets -- from the community 
lending laws. In a party switch, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., voted 
against the amendment while Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at an impasse before we even start,'' Sen. John Kerry,  
D-Mass., said at the beginning of a drafting session on Gramm's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said he regretted that the bill lacked the Democrats'  
support, and he promised to try to work out the differences. ``This 
is the beginning of the process,'' he told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gramm added, ``I am increasingly convinced that the  
president doesn't want a bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In principle, the Clinton administration supports legislation to  
overhaul the financial services laws. But the White House has 
threatened to veto several versions in recent years that took an 
approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Gramm is more in line with the views of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than those of the 
administration. The bill calls for most new financial activities to 
be conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday expressed  
the administration's ``strong support'' for a bipartisan compromise 
bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official cited as an example a provision in  
the compromise House bill, but absent from Gramm's, that would 
require banks selling securities to make sure they are appropriate 
for a consumer's income and circumstances. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph Nader and other 
consumer advocates have expressed concern that the legislation, by 
allowing banks, brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more 
deeply into each other's businesses, could bring a dangerous 
concentration of economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act 
..., a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore 
hope in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, in response, insisted that his proposal would not weaken  
the community investment law that banks must follow, but would 
``restore its integrity.'' The 1977 law requires banks and thrifts 
to lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the law led him to block financial  
overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning days last fall. The 
legislation had squeaked through the House in May by one vote, 
214-213. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his new proposal, banks would not have to get a  
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to 
conduct new financial activities within holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financial services modernization is of such overriding  
importance to the national economy that President Clinton will be 
compelled to sign'' the bill, Gramm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,  
and Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the panel's senior Democrat, on 
Monday unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawmakers Wednesday, Rubin expressed the  
administration's ``strong support.'' The Treasury chief said the 
bill ``would benefit consumers, businesses and communities.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Rise on Export News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and wheat futures advanced Thursday on  
Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by unexpectedly heavy export 
demand. Soybean futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures jumped after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
reported exports in the past week of 1.14 million metric tons, well 
above the highest analyst estimate of 900,000 metric tons. The 
report put shipments to date 19 percent above the previous 
marketing year's pace and ahead of the USDA's estimate of a 15 
percent increase for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat export sales came in at 702,900 metric tons, also well  
above expectations of 400,000 metric tons being shipped. Wheat 
futures were also higher on assumptions of possible dry pockets in 
the Plains states, news that China's winter wheat crop is under 
moisture pressure and a generally tight worldwide winter wheat 
market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also were supported by an increasing number of analyst  
reports that estimate spring plantings will fall sharply over the 
previous year, as farmers plant more lucrative soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures followed wheat higher early, but retreated at  
the end of the session as nervous traders eyed bumper crops from 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 2 cents to $2.62 1/2 cents per bushel;  
May corn was up to 2 1/4 cents to $2.17 cents per bushel; May oats 
were up 1 3/4 cents to $1.06 1/4 cents per bushel; May soybeans were up 1/4 
cent to $4.68 cents per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle retreated on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies were both 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was down .65 cent to 67.60 cents per pound;  
March feeder cattle fell .68 cent to 72.42 cents per pound; April 
lean hogs were up .87 cent to 43.42 cents per pound; March pork 
bellies were up 3 cents to 51.50 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Disaster Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would help states  
prepare for natural disasters through a bill the House passed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, approved 415-2, would provide $25 million in  
the current fiscal year and $80 million for 2000 to aid state 
program aimed at reducing losses from disasters. It also outlines 
steps to streamline programs to assist victims after disasters 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be spent for such things as mapping flood  
plains, relocating buildings and informing citizens about 
damage-prevention measures. Each state would receive at least 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., a chief sponsor of the bill,  
estimated it would save the federal government $109 million in 
disaster relief over the first five years. Last year, more than $2 
billion was spent to help disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this bill does is move us in the direction of not  
continuing to pay over and over again for the same losses to the 
same people in the same geographic areas,'' said Rep. James 
Oberstar, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which still requires Senate consideration, also  
would increase to $25,000 the amount of federal aid available to 
each disaster victim family and provide up to $5,000 for emergency 
repairs to each home not covered by disaster insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the House passed a bill that would require  
the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to set up a pilot loan program to help small 
businesses and homeowners relocate and take other steps to reduce 
the impact of natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>

	The bill is H.R. 707.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Number at 10-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing first-time  
applications for unemployment benefits fell last week and, for 
February, the average level of new applications reached a 10-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 286,000 last week,  
down 8,000 from the week before, the Labor Department said today. 
The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out the 
volatile weekly totals, declined to 290,750, from 293,000 for the 
four-week period ending a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the lowest average since February 1989 and reflected  
the continued strength of the American economy. The department was 
scheduled Friday to report the unemployment rate for February and, 
in advance, analysts believed it would hold at a 29-year low of 4.3 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Edge Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices edged lower Thursday as another  
flurry of strong economic data left traders bracing for signs of 
inflation in Friday's unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, or  
$0.31 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, held steady at late Wednesday's seven-month 
high of 5.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have been hit hard over the past two weeks by a series of  
reports revealing surprising strength in the economy that could 
prove inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend continued Thursday with retailers reporting strong  
February sales and new government data showing a rebound in factory 
orders and a 10-year low in new claims for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors fear the Federal Reserve will slow the economy with a  
boost in interest rates. Rising interest rates hurt bonds by making 
their yields less competitive, while inflation makes fixed-income 
investments less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Thursday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 1/32 to 3/32 point, while intermediate maturities 
fell 1/8 to 7/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.48 
points to 1,274.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.60 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.48 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.74 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.02 percentage to 4.56 percent. One-year yields rose to 4.88 
percent, while the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.64 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Wednesday at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 11/32 point to 123 9/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.27 percent from 5.25 percent late 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Addresses U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dropping a hint about a call to civic duty,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton is tantalizing New Yorkers who look at the 
first lady and see their next senator. But so far she's just 
keeping them guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	On her second day in New York, Mrs. Clinton gave a speech at the  
United Nations about the upcoming Women's Rights Day, and later was 
to host a preview of an HBO documentary on women in sports at a 
school in Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's visit to the Big Apple had the feel of a campaign  
rally even as she remained coy on whether she would be a candidate. 
Democrats used her visit Wednesday -- her first to New York since 
saying she was giving careful thought to a Senate bid -- to woo the 
fence-sitting first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	And some of her supporters were anything but subtle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think it's time for a woman to represent New York in  
the United States Senate?'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., blared to 
an overflow crowd of about 900 mostly female donors who plunked 
down up to $1,000 apiece to soak up the Hillary phenomenon at a 
Democratic National Committee luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, standing behind Schumer, smiled as the crowd  
erupted in applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her aides sought to portray her jaunt to New York as  
just another of many forays here, Mrs. Clinton's words were just 
vague enough to stoke her boosters' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the  
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
``We cannot say `I won't be involved in politics because I don't 
like the negativity. I don't like all of the ads on television.''' 
</P>
<P>
	She alluded only once to the Senate race.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that there were some who thought that, uh, I might  
have an announcement to make,'' she said, pausing and holding the 
crowd in breath-catching suspense. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't.''  
</P>
<P>
	Groans followed.  
</P>
<P>
	This morning, she treaded in international circles with a speech  
at the United Nations where she praised global gains in women's 
rights, but said that as a new century approaches roadblocks still 
bar true gender equity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many women around the world are finding their voices in new  
ways. And as we stand here together, we have to do all we can to 
make sure those voices are amplified. Their stories are heard and 
told,'' she told several hundred diplomats and government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	She also called for a crackdown on what she termed ``a growing  
trade'' in the international selling of women and girls across 
borders for labor, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The aura of mystery surrounding Mrs. Clinton's political  
flirtation is spawning a parlor game in Democratic circles. The 
buzz after her speech placed odds on her running. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she's not running she's giving a good impression of someone  
who is,'' New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone said. ``I 
think every indication now is that she runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until she does decide, she is a huge cash draw for the  
Democrats. Wednesday's luncheon raised $500,000, a record for the 
DNC's Women's Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Even political veterans marveled at the sea of awestruck  
supporters, cameras and clamoring reporters hanging on the first 
lady's every word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not believe the amount of press,'' said former Rep.  
Geraldine Ferraro, who once ran as vice president on the Democratic 
ticket and lost to Schumer in the Democratic Senate primary last 
year. ``It's like a presidential announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton would be a formidable candidate, she would  
also face what looks to be a tough battle against her most likely 
Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Her lead 
against Giuliani, which had surged into the double digits in 
earlier polls, shrank to just four points, equal to the margin of 
error, in a survey released Wednesday by the Marist College 
Institute for Public Opinion.

<HEADLINE> Fisk Might Return to Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nearly 19 years after an angry parting  
with the Boston Red Sox, Carlton Fisk is considering returning to 
the team he hit one of baseball's most famous homers for. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the field Thursday before Boston's spring training  
opener, Fisk said he had a ``nice conversation'' with general 
manager Dan Duquette in the morning and planned further 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although an exact role hasn't been determined, Duquette said  
Fisk could be ``a role model, a liaison'' or a catching instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk, 51, said he didn't have much interest in returning to the  
Red Sox when he and Duquette first spoke about the possibility two 
years ago, but said ``it's starting to grow a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his most memorable at-bat in a 24-year career that ended  
in 1993 with the Chicago White Sox came in Game 6 of the 1975 World 
Series. He hit a ball down the left field line, waved both arms 
toward fair territory and ended up with the game-winning homer in 
the 12th inning. But Cincinnati won Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he became a free agent when the Red Sox failed  
to mail a contract on time. He joined the White Sox, where he had 
another bitter departure when they released him while they were on 
the road in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of water under that bridge,'' he said of  
his Red Sox experience. ``I think we've all matured and grown.'' He 
pointed out that different people ran the Red Sox then. 
</P>
<P>
	``That relationship is a long time ago,'' Duquette said. ``I  
think Carlton Fisk will be remembered above all else for his 
heroics in Game 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could help him get into the Hall of Fame, although he fell  
short in the voting this year, the first time he was eligible. Fisk 
wouldn't say whether he would have a Red Sox or White Sox cap on 
his plaque if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he wasn't angry about falling short in a year when  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount all were elected in their 
first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel unrecognized. I felt just a little disappointed.  
The three guys that were elected were absolutely deserving,'' Fisk 
said. But he's sure he is, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know in my heart that I was as good at my position as they  
were at theirs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk set the major league record of 2,226 games caught and had  
351 homers at that position, the most ever by a catcher. He had 25 
homers in games when he was not catching. He was only the third 
catcher to hit at least 300 home runs, score 1,000 runs and drive 
in 1,000 runs; the others were Yogi Berra and Johnny Bench, both 
Hall of Famers.

<HEADLINE> D.C. To Court Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seats at RFK Stadium have been realigned.  
Base paths have been carved out of fresh sod for the first time in 
six years, all awaiting the arrival of the Montreal Expos for a 
couple of days next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Next time, maybe they'll stay a lot longer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say that they'll find a much larger and warmer  
welcome than they have in their own home stadium for quite some 
time,'' said Mike Scanlon, who is part of a group that wants to 
bring major league baseball to the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	It's mere coincidence that the Expos are accompanying the St.  
Louis Cardinals for a pair of exhibition games at RFK on April 2 
and 3. When the event was arranged, the big attraction was supposed 
to be Mark McGwire; now the focus will be on a financially troubled 
team on display in an area that's been trying lure baseball back 
since the Senators left to become the Texas Rangers 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are closer now than we ever have been,'' said Jim  
Dalrymple, who has been working on the task for 14 years as 
executive director of the District of Columbia Sports Commission. 
``I think we've got the right game plan in place. We just need a 
little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of relocation does not sit well with major league baseball  
-- no team has moved since the Senators. But with a Saturday 
deadline approaching for a financing plan for a new stadium in 
Montreal and no money in sight, commissioner Bud Selig is expected 
to give Expos president Claude Brochu permission next week to 
negotiate with out-of-town bidders who could buy the team and move 
it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading contenders would be groups from Charlotte, the  
District of Columbia and Northern Virginia -- the generic name for 
the densely populated suburbs to the west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	For fans in the D.C. region, it's another hill on a roller  
coaster ride that has left them somewhat jaded. It seems there's a 
new team every other year that is rumored to be on the verge of 
coming to the Washington area -- the Astros and Pirates were the 
most recent. 
</P>
<P>
	The group from Northern Virginia, headed by telecommunications  
executive William Collins, has come close twice. Collins made the 
finals in the last round of expansion in 1994 and had a handshake 
agreement to buy the Astros had voters not approved a new stadium 
there by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to deal,'' said Scanlon, executive vice president  
of the Collins group. ``We would welcome Claude and any other 
members of his group in our membership group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer Douglas Jemal, who wants a team in the  
district, is also waiting for the go-ahead to negotiate with 
Brochu. Tim Newman, vice president of entrepreneur Don Beaver's 
group in Charlotte, said such talk is ``all premature,'' but that 
Beaver is ``monitoring the situation very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While each bid has promise, all three have their drawbacks,  
starting with how to finance a $300 million stadium and where to 
build it. And, for the two D.C. area groups, there will be certain 
opposition from Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, whose team 
draws heavily from the Washington area and considers the region one 
big market. Of the Northern Virginia bid, Angelos had said that if 
the state of Virginia wants a team, it should be placed in 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baltimore and Washington have always been separate markets,''  
Scanlon said. ``There is no way people in Virginia consider 
themselves a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that Mr. Angelos would make such a statement,''  
said Gabe Paul, executive director of the state-created Virginia 
Baseball Stadium Authority. ``The Orioles, in order to move from 
St. Louis in 1954, had to ask for and receive permission from the 
Senators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte group doesn't have to deal with Angelos, but it's  
biggest drawback could be its plan to have the Expos play in the 
Charlotte Knights' minor league stadium -- expanded to seat perhaps 
25,000 -- during the two years it would take to build a new 
facility. The two D.C. area groups would use RFK, which housed the 
Senators, as an interim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Collins group also has a head start on the financial end.  
The Virginia legislature has approved partial funding for a stadium 
and given Gov. Jim Gilmore authority to negotiate the rest of the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for Northern Virginia is because of the growth of  
this region,'' Paul said. ``How can baseball overlook the No. 7 
(television) market in the country forever?''

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise 1.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories surged in January  
for the second consecutive month, perhaps signaling the start of a 
rebound in American manufacturing after a year of struggling with 
fallout from Asia's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders increased 1.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $349.6  
billion following an even stronger 2.3 percent increase in 
December, the Commerce Department said today. There were weaker 
increases during five of the six months before December. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs of strength in that and other reports encouraged the  
stock market. The Dow Jones average of industrial stocks shot up 
131 points in the first hour of trading, to 9,407, and was up more 
than 150 points in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have been hurting from loss of export sales to  
Asia and other economies in recession and factories shed more than 
200,000 jobs last year. But U.S. consumer demand has remained brisk 
and today's report fits with other signs of recovery in 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the nation's biggest retail chains reported  
higher-than-expected sales in February. Not only were consumers 
buying up discounted winter merchandise, there was also great 
demand for full-priced spring goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also reported today that the number of  
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell last week and, for February, the average level of new 
applications reached a 10-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 286,000 last week,  
down 8,000 from the week before. The four-week moving average of 
claims, which evens out the volatile weekly totals, declined to 
290,750, from 293,000 for the four-week period ending a week 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the lowest average since February 1989 and reflected  
the continued strength of the American economy. The department was 
scheduled Friday to report the unemployment rate for February and, 
in advance, analysts believed it would hold at a 29-year low of 4.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of January's strength in factory orders was concentrated in  
aircraft, which doubled from $7.8 billion in December to $15.9 
billion in January. The 102.7 percent increase was the largest in 
five years. Excluding the volatile transportation segment, orders 
fell 0.3 in January, the first decline in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, aircraft wasn't the only high point for the month.  
Orders jumped 4.9 percent for electronic equipment, including a 13 
percent increase for communications equipment. Orders for stone, 
clay and glass products rose 0.7 percent, reflecting robust 
construction in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer and office equipment orders fell 4.8 percent; steel  
orders, 8 percent, and engines and turbines, 27.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to  
last at least three years -- rose 3.6 percent. Orders for 
non-durable goods fell 0.8 percent, pulled down by a decline in 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of factory goods, a barometer of current production,  
fell 0.8 percent, the first drop since October, after an identical 
increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog of unfilled orders jumped 1.6 percent, the first  
increase since August. And inventories of factory goods fell 0.3 
percent, the third drop in a row.

<HEADLINE> Impasse for Aloha Flight Attendants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Saying that negotiations are moving too slowly,  
flight attendants for Aloha Airlines have asked a federal mediator 
to get involved in the stalled contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were hopeful Thursday that a neutral third party  
could jumpstart seven months of snails-pace negotiations. They also 
were optimistic that a strike will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it will be the first step toward a settlement,'' said  
Cynthia Kain of the Association of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	An application for assistance was received Wednesday by the  
Washington-based National Mediation Board, which will name a 
mediator to the case in the next two weeks, spokesman Jim Armshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covering the airline's 243 flight attendants  
expired in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no fear of a strike,'' Aloha spokeswoman Stephanie  
Ackerman said, pointing out the airline avoided strikes and reached 
agreements with pilots and machinists after mediators joined 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Aloha is the No. 1 interisland carrier with 60 percent of the  
market. It currently offers 180 daily flights, including 16 that 
were recently added because the airline expects an upswing in 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the issues of pay and benefits, flight attendants are  
seeking higher pay and revised work rules for the airline's 
proposed new service to the Marshall Islands and Federated States 
of Micronesia since those assignments would last three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's request to fly those Pacific Island routes is  
pending before the U.S. Department of Transportation.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Pilot Acquitted in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury acquitted a Marine  
pilot today of all charges that he recklessly flew his jet into an 
Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A whoop went up in the courtroom at the Camp Lejeune Marine base  
when the verdict was announced. Family members of the victims wept 
and hugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I really want to say is that this has been a tragedy for  
all involved, and my heart and thoughts and prayers go out to all 
the families of the victims,'' Capt. Richard Ashby told reporters 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, was charged with 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter and one count each of destroying government property, 
destroying private property, dereliction of duty and failure to 
plan the flight properly. The crash and its aftermath strained 
relations between the United States and Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot faced a possible sentence of 206 years if he had been  
convicted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Captain Ashby is certainly free to go,'' said the judge, Lt.  
Col. Robert Nunley. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Ashby had recklessly disregarded  
altitude and speed restrictions. The defense said the military's 
map didn't show the ski lift, and that key jet equipment wasn't 
working properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really baffled by this ruling,'' said Italian Premier  
Massimo D'Alema through a translator while visiting the John F. 
Kennedy Museum in Boston. ``With that kind of a massacre, with so 
many causalities, I think it is a duty to ensure ... that justice 
is done.'' He said Italy will ``explore all the legal ways'' to 
hold those responsible liable. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian prosecutor had pursued a trial in Italy, but an  
Italian court ruled that the United States had jurisdiction under a 
NATO treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart would not comment on the  
verdict, citing the ongoing court proceedings, but said the matter 
could come up Friday during President Clinton's meeting with 
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart also said the fact that U.S.-Italy relations had  
weathered the incident was ``a testament to the strength that we 
can work through a tragedy like this and remain allies and 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors -- all Marines, though none were combat pilots --  
deliberated 7 1/2 hours over two days after more than three weeks of 
testimony. They declined to comment on the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The families' reaction is shock,'' said John Arthur Eaves, who  
represents relatives of the German victims. Some hugged and wept 
after the verdict, and Eaves said several lamented that there is 
``no justice in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eaves said the families also ``agree with the defense that  
there's many responsible parties here.'' He said the U.S. 
government still has not compensated the families, yet it 
appropriated $20 million to pay for damages to the Italian ski 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident caused an uproar in Europe. People living in the  
Alpine ski area said they had long complained about low-flying jets 
from Aviano air base and their ``Top Gun'' antics. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Ashby of ``flat-hatting'' -- reckless flying.  
They said he violated the mission's 517-mph speed limit and 
2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet, traveling at 621 mph, cut 
the cable about 370 feet above the valley floor, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., said he thought the altitude  
restriction was 1,000 feet. He claimed he was unaware of a speed 
limit. His attorneys contended the jet's altitude gauge 
malfunctioned, and an optical illusion made Ashby think he was 
flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the Mount Cermis ski lift wasn't marked on  
Ashby's government-issue map. Ashby testified last week that he 
didn't see the cable until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said just one other U.S. aviator has been  
court-martialed and convicted in a civilian death. In 1970, an Army 
helicopter pilot was convicted of negligent homicide when a rotor 
blade killed a civilian in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers claimed Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., were charged because of 
political pressure that went as high as the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces a trial on similar charges later.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby still faces an obstruction of justice charge stemming from  
the disappearance of a videotape his navigator shot during the 
fatal flight. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement to jurors Wednesday, Maj. Daniel  
Daugherty, a government prosecutor, said Ashby's conduct was 
``outright dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said Ashby should have known he was flying too low and  
too fast by merely looking around. ``You have the roads, the cars, 
the houses, the humanity of it all. Captain Ashby ignores it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Frank Spinner said that a number of problems  
suddenly confronted Ashby in the seconds before his jet hit the 
cable -- the spotty altitude gauge didn't warn him his plane was too 
low, the optical illusion, and the fact that the ground rose 150 
feet during the last seconds before the jet sliced the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't avoid what you can't see,'' he said. ``This was a  
trap. This was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-seat crewmen on Ashby's plane initially faced  
charges in the accident, but the charges were later dropped.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Justice Blackmun Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun, who wrote the 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
nationwide and ignited a still-raging moral and political debate, 
died Thursday at 90. 
</P>
<P>
	He had retired in 1994, after serving 24 years on the nation's  
highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died at a hospital in suburban Arlington, Va., from  
complications following hip-replacement surgery performed nine days 
earlier. He had fallen and broken his hip at home a day before the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who had come to know Blackmun well, praised  
him as someone with ``passion for the welfare of the American 
people, for defending our liberties and our institutions, for 
moving us forward together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Blackmun served ``with compassion, distinction and  
honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed in 1970 by President Nixon, Blackmun was considered a  
staunch conservative in his early days on the court. But by the 
time he retired, he was considered its most liberal justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia, who opposed Blackmun's views on abortion  
and many other subjects, called him ``a good man and a good justice 
deserving of the respect of all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who replaced Blackmun, cited his  
``continuous concern for ordinary citizens and for the law's impact 
upon their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun often cast liberal votes in cases pitting individual  
liberties against governmental authority. But he generally voted 
against expanding the rights of criminal suspects. He was a 
champion of maintaining a strict separation between church and 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But towering above all else in Blackmun's tenure was his role in  
the 1973 decision and subsequent abortion rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	His authorship of Roe vs. Wade brought him repeated threats on  
his life. He received more than 60,000 pieces of ``hate mail'' 
calling him a murderer and comparing him to the Nazi overseers of 
genocide. Blackmun insisted on reading all such mail. ``I want to 
know what the people who wrote are thinking,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1983 interview with The Associated Press on the eve of the  
decision's 10-year anniversary, Blackmun repeated the phrase 
``author of the abortion decision'' slowly and softly. ``We all 
pick up tabs,'' he said. ``I'll carry this one to my grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of stopping just short of reversing Roe vs. Wade,  
the court in 1992 reaffirmed, by a 5-4 vote, the 1973 ruling's 
central holding -- that women have a constitutional right to end 
their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun wrote that the victory was good law only as long as the  
current court was intact. But President Clinton's election and 
Justice Byron R. White's decision to retire before Blackmun 
lessened the anticipated impact Blackmun's departure might have. 
</P>
<P>
	When appointing Blackmun, Nixon called him a ``strict  
constructionist,'' defined by Nixon aides as a judge who leaned 
toward interpreting existing law rather than making new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was Nixon's third choice to fill the vacancy created  
when Justice Abe Fortas resigned under fire for having accepted a 
$20,000 fee from the family of a financier who went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected Nixon's nominations of two federal appeals  
court judges, Clement Haynsworth of Greenville, S.C., and G. 
Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, who had been a member of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals since 1959 and was confirmed by a unanimous Senate vote, 
said years later that his No. 3 status ``always kept me a little on 
the humble side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his early years on the high court, Blackmun was derided for  
what legal scholars perceived as his dependence on fellow 
Minnesotan and longtime friend Warren E. Burger, the chief justice 
who had been appointed by Nixon a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was called ``Hip Pocket Harry'' and ``The Minnesota  
Twin'' in print. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end of his first decade on the court, Blackmun had  
established himself as an independent force whose vote often was a 
critical one in close cases. 
</P>
<P>
	He also emerged in a new role -- the justice most intent on  
forcing the court to come to grips with the realities of the 
problems it was asked to resolve and with the real-world effects of 
those resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinions often portrayed those realities with passionate  
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court in 1993 ruled that U.S. authorities need not give  
hearings before seizing and returning Haitians who had fled their 
homeland by boats, Blackmun was the lone dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They demand only that the United States, land of refugees and  
guardian of freedom, cease forcibly driving them back to detention, 
abuse and death,'' he wrote. ``That is a modest plea. ... We should 
not close our ears to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before his retirement, Blackmun repudiated his  
career-long acceptance of capital punishment and declared himself 
opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death-penalty experiment has failed. I no longer shall  
tinker with the machinery of death,'' Blackmun wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was born in Nashville, Ill., but was raised in St. Paul  
and Minneapolis. He and Burger first met as kindergarten pupils, 
and Blackmun served as best man in Burger's 1933 wedding. But on 
the high court, differences between the two jurists strained those 
boyhood ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun is survived by his wife, Dorothy, three daughters and  
five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Winds in Northwest, South Kill Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Residents of the Northwest and South picked up the pieces today  
after storms lashed both regions with damaging wind, rain and snow, 
knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people. Two people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving winds and likely tornadoes blew across several Southern  
states Wednesday, destroying homes and downing power lines. Nearly 
a foot of snow fell in parts of the Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old Alabama man died when winds estimated at 60 mph to  
80 mph uprooted a tree and slammed it into his trailer home in 
Millbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you just heard a big boom,'' said a neighbor,  
Stephanie Cleckler. ``Glass started flying everywhere ... that's 
when everybody started screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fierce winds slammed into a steel mill construction site south  
of Richmond, Va., mangling a half-dozen trailers and injuring 16 
workers, authorities said. Ten remained hospitalized with neck and 
back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expecting this, needless to say, at least not to  
this extent,'' State Police Lt. G.W. Taylor said. ``There was a 
combination of wrecks, vehicles that wouldn't go, snow, ice and 
strong winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power was out overnight for 56,000 customers in North Carolina  
after storms left 8 inches of snow in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Northwest, Washington Gov. Gary Locke declared a state of  
emergency in five western counties after a punishing storm with 
wind gusts of 68 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves measured 35 feet in steady 60 mph winds. A 36-year-old man  
was killed when a tree fell on the car about 30 miles north of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was knocked out to more than 200,000 people, though most  
had it restored by early today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two routes used by thousands of Seattle commuters to  
traverse Lake Washington was still closed today after its 
drawbridge malfunctioned. It wasn't expected to be fixed until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds also canceled passenger ferry service in the Puget  
Sound area Wednesday morning, affecting about 45,000 people. Better 
weather was expected for the region today. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Washington coast, heavy seas combined with high tides to  
temporarily flood downtown Raymond with up to 2 feet of water. Two 
apartment complexes were evacuated, and nearly 40 people sought 
shelter at a Red Cross facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, heavy seas pushed the wreckage of a beached cargo  
ship back to shore in Oregon. The oil-laden bow section of the New 
Carissa broke free of a tug Tuesday night and drifted 50 miles to a 
beach near Waldport. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of storms late Tuesday also damaged homes in Texas and  
Florida. Several people were hurt in Texas' Jasper County, where 
twisters nearly demolished six homes and damaged as many as 25 
others. A tornado in the Florida Panhandle damaged about 55 homes, 
with 20 sustaining major damage.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Pilot Acquitted in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury acquitted a Marine  
pilot today of all charges that he recklessly flew his jet into an 
Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A whoop went up in the courtroom at the Camp Lejeune Marine base  
when the verdict was announced. Family members of the victims wept 
and hugged. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I really want to say is that this has been a tragedy for  
all involved, and my heart and thoughts and prayers go out to all 
the families of the victims,'' Capt. Richard Ashby told reporters 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, was charged with 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter and one count each of destroying government property, 
destroying private property, dereliction of duty and failure to 
plan the flight properly. The crash and its aftermath strained 
relations between the United States and Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot faced a possible sentence of 206 years if he had been  
convicted of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Captain Ashby is certainly free to go,'' said the judge, Lt.  
Col. Robert Nunley. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Ashby had recklessly disregarded  
altitude and speed restrictions. The defense said the military's 
map didn't show the ski lift, and that key jet equipment wasn't 
working properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really baffled by this ruling,'' said Italian Premier  
Massimo D'Alema through a translator while visiting the John F. 
Kennedy Museum in Boston. ``With that kind of a massacre, with so 
many causalities, I think it is a duty to ensure ... that justice 
is done.'' He said Italy will ``explore all the legal ways'' to 
hold those responsible liable. 
</P>
<P>
	An Italian prosecutor had pursued a trial in Italy, but an  
Italian court ruled that the United States had jurisdiction under a 
NATO treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart would not comment on the  
verdict, citing the ongoing court proceedings, but said the matter 
could come up Friday during President Clinton's meeting with 
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart also said the fact that U.S.-Italy relations had  
weathered the incident was ``a testament to the strength that we 
can work through a tragedy like this and remain allies and 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors -- all Marines, though none were combat pilots --  
deliberated 7 1/2 hours over two days after more than three weeks of 
testimony. They declined to comment on the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The families' reaction is shock,'' said John Arthur Eaves, who  
represents relatives of the German victims. Some hugged and wept 
after the verdict, and Eaves said several lamented that there is 
``no justice in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eaves said the families also ``agree with the defense that  
there's many responsible parties here.'' He said the U.S. 
government still has not compensated the families, yet it 
appropriated $20 million to pay for damages to the Italian ski 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident caused an uproar in Europe. People living in the  
Alpine ski area said they had long complained about low-flying jets 
from Aviano air base and their ``Top Gun'' antics. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Ashby of ``flat-hatting'' -- reckless flying.  
They said he violated the mission's 517-mph speed limit and 
2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet, traveling at 621 mph, cut 
the cable about 370 feet above the valley floor, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., said he thought the altitude  
restriction was 1,000 feet. He claimed he was unaware of a speed 
limit. His attorneys contended the jet's altitude gauge 
malfunctioned, and an optical illusion made Ashby think he was 
flying higher than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree the Mount Cermis ski lift wasn't marked on  
Ashby's government-issue map. Ashby testified last week that he 
didn't see the cable until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said just one other U.S. aviator has been  
court-martialed and convicted in a civilian death. In 1970, an Army 
helicopter pilot was convicted of negligent homicide when a rotor 
blade killed a civilian in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers claimed Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., were charged because of 
political pressure that went as high as the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces a trial on similar charges later.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby still faces an obstruction of justice charge stemming from  
the disappearance of a videotape his navigator shot during the 
fatal flight. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing statement to jurors Wednesday, Maj. Daniel  
Daugherty, a government prosecutor, said Ashby's conduct was 
``outright dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daugherty said Ashby should have known he was flying too low and  
too fast by merely looking around. ``You have the roads, the cars, 
the houses, the humanity of it all. Captain Ashby ignores it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Frank Spinner said that a number of problems  
suddenly confronted Ashby in the seconds before his jet hit the 
cable -- the spotty altitude gauge didn't warn him his plane was too 
low, the optical illusion, and the fact that the ground rose 150 
feet during the last seconds before the jet sliced the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't avoid what you can't see,'' he said. ``This was a  
trap. This was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-seat crewmen on Ashby's plane initially faced  
charges in the accident, but the charges were later dropped.

<HEADLINE> ABC Says 74M Tuned In to Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 74 million people tuned in to hear  
Monica Lewinsky confess the details of her affair with President 
Clinton, second only to the number of people who watched the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in bookstores where workers stacked the just-released  
``Monica's Story'' onto shelves Thursday, there were signs of both 
Monica mania and intern overload. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research gave ABC's Wednesday night interview a  
33.4 rating and 48 share, meaning just under half of the nation's 
working television sets were tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ms. Lewinsky interview was the most-watched interview since  
Oprah Winfrey's prime-time questioning of Michael Jackson in 1993, 
which had a 39.3 rating and 56 share. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the second highest-rated program of this television  
season after the Super Bowl, which had a total of 127.5 million 
viewers for at least part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview's average audience during the two hours was just  
over 48 million people. ABC said it was the most-watched news event 
ever televised on one network; most breaking news stories are 
broadcast on several. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's hourlong interview with Britain's Channel Four  
was broadcast Thursday in some 30 countries. Unlike the ABC 
interview, Ms. Lewinsky was paid for the Channel Four interview -- 
reportedly $660,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in that interview what she would say to the president, Ms.  
Lewinsky said: ``I'd probably want to at some point apologize to 
him for having been indiscreet about the relationship. I don't know 
if I'd want to see him. I don't know what the point would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I could think of a few other people that I'd rather  
spend an evening with than him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC treated its interview as a prime-time soap opera, with  
Barbara Walters sticking largely to the personal details of the 
affair rather than what it meant for the country. At its end, she 
asked Ms. Lewinsky what she would tell any of her future children 
about the affair. ``Mommy made a big mistake,'' she replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that is the understatement of the year,'' Walters  
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the commercials were as entertaining as the interview.  
At least two weight loss products were advertised during the talk 
with Ms. Lewinsky, who has obsessed about her weight. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's own promo for its upcoming miniseries, ``Cleopatra,''  
sounded familiar given the context: ``She seduced the most powerful 
man in the world,'' the promo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky's book -- a collaboration with Princess  
Diana biographer Andrew Morton -- was being snapped up on the 
Internet. The confessional was No. 1 on the bookseller lists of 
Amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com., although neither would say what 
that status meant in terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those pop culture phenomenons,'' said Ben Boyd,  
a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com. He said the book was selling 
2.8 copies per minute for a few hours late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer reaction seemed mixed in an early spot check of  
bookstores Thursday around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had nobody calling looking for it,'' said Lee Schwartz,  
owner of The Book Center in Cumberland, Md. ``It seems like most 
people are saying, `I just don't want to hear about it anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody who comes to our store has shown any interest in the  
Monica Lewinsky affair. In fact, they're sick of it,'' said Steven 
Elliot of the Kendall Book Shelf in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no response from Ms. Lewinsky yet to a potential job  
offer. The regulars on Walters' daytime chat show, ``The View,'' 
offered on the air Wednesday to let Ms. Lewinsky try out for a 
vacant spot on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was a serious offer that was extended,'' said  
Fiona McRobert, the show's spokeswoman. ``I don't know how 
legitimately she's going to take it.''

<HEADLINE> Hair Test May Reveal Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A test for breast cancer can be done be analyzing a single pubic  
hair, Australian researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiologists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney  
found that microscopic characteristics in the hair may reveal 
whether a woman has breast cancer. They also believe that the hair 
may indicate whether a woman is carrying a certain gene mutation 
that raises the risk of later developing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Pubic hair was found to be easier to read than scalp hair  
because it it less likely to be damaged by perms, dyes or the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists, however, said the study is too small to be  
conclusive. They also questioned whether the method is an 
improvement over existing tests -- mammograms for finding cancer, 
blood tests for identifying genetic risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is not approved for clinical use.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the researchers, radiologist Veronica James, said the  
hair test could help women living in poor, remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samples for this test could be posted from anywhere in the  
world in an envelope,'' Ms. James said. ``In many poorer countries, 
no mammography is available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used sensitive X-ray equipment to analyze the  
scalp hair of 23 women who earlier had been diagnosed with breast 
cancer, and found their hair contained one or more extra rings in 
the keratin, or protein layer. Of 28 women who were known to be 
cancer-free, all but four did not have the extra rings. 
</P>
<P>
	The same pattern was found in 12 women whose pubic hair was  
analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can look at the patterns we are getting from our hair  
samples and know that the diseased ones are different from the 
normal ones because they have changed in structure,'' Ms. James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women in the study had not been diagnosed with breast  
cancer, but earlier tests found they carried a mutation of the 
BRCA-1 gene associated with an inherited form of the disease. Hair 
from all five patients contained full or partial extra rings 
similar to those in the breast cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. James said the results suggest that a woman's hair could  
indicate the presence of the BRCA-1 mutation even before cancer is 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
	David Savitz, chairman of epidemiology at the University of  
North Carolina, said pubic hair is a more reliable biological 
sample than scalp hair; he has used it to determine people's 
history of cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the Australian study was too small and its results  
must be repeated in larger studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Savitz said he also questions widespread screening for the rare  
BRCA-1 form of the disease -- which accounts for as few as three in 
211 breast cancer cases, according to one 1998 study -- especially 
when there is no ``useful'' way to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who have the defective genes sometimes choose drastic  
options, such as having their breasts removed while they are still 
healthy.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Berates Shock Jock Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Thompson, in his new job as a radio talk  
show host, confronted a shock jock who was fired for making a 
racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was a one-sided conversation Thursday, with the former  
Georgetown basketball doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one kid hears something as irresponsible as you said, that  
is dangerous to all of us,'' Thompson said in lecturing Doug ``The 
Greaseman'' Tracht on WTEM-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht was dismissed from his morning drive job at WARW-FM last  
week for playing part of a song by Grammy-award winning recording 
artist Lauryn Hill and then commenting, ``No wonder people drag 
them behind trucks,'' a reference to the dragging death of James 
Byrd, Jr. in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracht made an apology tour Wednesday, but the appearance on  
Thompson's show was a clash of two strong, divergent personalities 
well known in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, along with co-host and ex-Washington Redskins player  
Doc Walker, lashed out at Tracht, who had little to say in his own 
defense other than repeated confessions of guilt and requests for 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several times I've listened to you and laughed and said,  
`That's funny,' but that is a disappointment to me,'' Thompson 
said. ``I see absolutely no humor in racism. Can I forgive you? 
Yes. Can I forget? Very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson suggested that Tracht receive counseling, and Tracht  
indicated he might. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hits home, and it hits home hard,'' Tracht told Thompson.  
``I have no justification. I'm not going to say, `Look at it this 
way.' I can't argue with anything you've said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time that Tracht has run afoul of the  
black community. In 1986, he made a disparaging remark about the 
Martin Luther King holiday.

<HEADLINE> Three Houston Octuplets Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The reality of parenting seven babies is starting  
to hit home for Ikye Louis Udobi and Nkem Chukwu. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the three healthiest of their surviving octuplets have  
come home from the hospital, the couple say they welcome the 
challenges along with the rewards -- but donations would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a van and a bigger house,'' said the babies' father,  
Ikye Louis Udobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis and his wife brought home daughters Ebuka and Echerem and  
son Jioke on Wednesday morning. The infants were greeted by 
``Welcome Home'' signs and an impromptu family celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was dancing and rejoicing,'' Louis said. ``My  
mother-in-law was kind of singing, rejoicing and praising the 
Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got the feeling his babies sensed the moment, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``They opened their eyes when they got home, signifying, `We're  
home,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three have been among the largest and healthiest since  
birth. Chima, a girl, is fighting off an intestinal ailment and 
should be home within a few weeks, pediatrician Dr. Patti Savrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chidi and Gorom, both girls, continue to get 24-hour care in the  
neonatal intensive care unit. The weakest and smallest baby is the 
only other boy, Ikem, who was back on a ventilator after surgery 
overnight to repair an inflamed bowel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebuka was born on Dec. 8, and the others on Dec. 20. Odera, born  
at just 10.3 ounces, died a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Savrick said the babies who went home need no special care.  
Doctors decided they were ready to leave because they are breathing 
and maintaining body temperature on their own and are on full diets 
of breast milk and formula. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're ready to go. They're good babies,'' Savrick said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jioke is the largest baby at 5 pounds, 5 ounces. Ikem weighs  
just 3 pounds, 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The three infants at home are living in an open area of the  
family's four-bedroom house in southwest Houston. The parents say 
they're getting help from Ms. Chukwu's mother and members of their 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents insist they're not worried about the strain of  
having three babies at home and four in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way we can kiss them goodbye before going to visit their  
brother and sisters,'' Louis said.

<HEADLINE> Justices Remember Blackmun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of statements issued by current Supreme Court members  
about retired Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who died Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	--Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: ``He will be missed by his  
friends throughout the building, from his breakfast gatherings in 
the cafeteria every morning to his continuing association with his 
colleagues after he had retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice John Paul Stevens: ``Intelligence, kindness, diligence,  
warmth, scholarship, grace and an unusual concern about the impact 
of judicial decisions on real people are among the fine qualities 
that shaped his important contributions to the work of the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: ``He was a brilliant, meticulous  
and thoughtful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Antonin Scalia: ``No one was more dedicated to the rule  
of law, or more painstaking in the execution of his 
responsibilities on this court. He was a good man and a good 
justice, deserving of the respect of all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: ``He gave unyielding devotion to  
the court, to its scholarly work and to the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice David H. Souter: ``He was a forceful judge, a good man  
and an affectionate friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Clarence Thomas: ``I was fortunate to sit with (him)  
during my first years on the court. He was always the consummate 
professional who conducted himself with great dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: ``We did not always agree and we  
approached oral argument differently, but he was to me a model of 
the caring justice for his integrity, his high sense of justice, 
his exemplification of decency, modesty and civility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice Stephen G. Breyer: ``Harry Blackmun's continuous  
concern for ordinary citizens and for the law's impact upon their 
lives made him a great and human justice. We will miss him 
enormously.''

<HEADLINE> Cheaper or Free Internet Entry Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Until now, it's been an Internet fact of life:  
No one roams the Web for free. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing is set in stone online, least of all access plans  
and their price tags. And monthly dial-up fees could go the way of 
the dot matrix printer if others keep giving away what America 
Online -- the biggest Internet provider -- is trying to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's popular unlimited access plan costs $21.95 a month and  
some companies offer restricted monthly plans for $9.95. With the 
advent of free Internet service, however, some Web users are 
deciding 10 bucks a month isn't such a great bargain after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway announced last week that it would throw in a free year  
of its Internet service with any computer purchase of more than 
$1,000. Even more threatening to the stranglehold of 
pay-for-service providers has been the early success of some rivals 
that let customers dial up for free. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 million Britons have signed on with Freeserve, which  
began operating in September and already has surpassed AOL as 
Britain's most popular Internet access provider. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero, brought to the Web by the same venture capitalists who  
sparked an online stampede last month by giving away 
advertisement-rigged computers at www.Free-PC.com, has signed up 
400,000 customers since it launched a free service in October. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is a fraction of the more than 2 million subscribers  
added since mid-November by AOL, the king of connectivity with 16 
million subscribers, it is hardly a marginal development. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for free Web access, these services want free access  
to your eyes -- and a fixed portion of your computer screen -- for a 
parade of advertisements. Most Web users are used to this. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the free services are successful, Internet access could  
be reduced from a revenue-producer to a mere marketing gimmick -- a 
throw-in like PC software or pin-striping on a new car. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder if consumers will be getting what they bargained for  
from the upstart services, most of which have meager resources. 
</P>
<P>
	David Meier is among the skeptics, though he loves a good  
cyber-bargain. He even guides people to ``free stuff'' on the 
Internet with his site at www.y4i.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would always pay for access, because I don't want  
problems,'' he said. ``I don't want to worry about getting online 
or them being too busy, and I don't want that little box on my 
screen. I'd rather pay the 20 bucks a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those happy with their switch to a free Internet provider  
have doubts, including a young woman who subscribed recently to 
NetZero. 
</P>
<P>
	She sent the Westlake Village, Calif., company an e-mail  
bemoaning companies that go out of business within months leaving 
subscribers ``with a blank look on their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She asked for a heads-up if business went bust: ``How long have  
you been operating, and if you DO go out of business anytime in the 
foreseeable future, will you let all the users know well in 
advance?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the listings that came up in a browser search for ``free  
Internet access'' were many with links to www.Freewwweb.com. But 
the Internet service isn't exactly free. The Connecticut-based 
company charges a one-time fee of about $120 but seems to be one of 
the few NetZero rivals with local dial-up numbers across most of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another service, webCOMBO, charges a one-time fee of $149.95 for  
otherwise free access to its national network. Others such as 
zDial, FreePPP and FreeI charge nothing but only have dial-up 
numbers in a specific region. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online has no plans to get into a price war with new  
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly a very competitive industry, but we believe  
we offer the best value,'' said AOL spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new services are far more vulnerable to financial pressures  
and technological problems than big players like AOL, AT&AMP;T, 
Microsoft Network, EarthLink and MindSpring. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean little or no customer support and the risk that  
the service might suddenly vanish along with your e-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers also have doubts as to whether the advertising revenue  
alone can cover the huge costs of running an Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not funded big time, there's no way you can provide  
good service,'' said Ilan Klein, president of Vizooal Inc., a New 
York-based Internet marketing firm.

<HEADLINE> NBA Fans Are Into March Badness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While college basketball fans are immersed in March Madness, NBA  
fans are into March Badness after a month of February Futility. 
</P>
<P>
	When St. John's beat Notre Dame last week after looking inept in  
the first 20 minutes, coach Mike Jarvis said, ``It looked like the 
Knicks-Nets in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis, of course, was referring to New York Knicks and the New  
Jersey Nets, who a few days earlier seemed to put the ball 
everywhere but in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA likes to say it has the world's greatest athletes. What  
it could use are some basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	What fans have been getting are preseason games at  
regular-season prices, although there have been some special ticket 
deals, as players huff and puff up and down the floor and throw up 
clinkers from all angles and distances. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a struggle for a team to hit 80 points in a game. The Utah  
Jazz contrived to score only 56 points, the second-lowest in an NBA 
game for a team since the 24-second shot clock went into effect in 
the 1954-55 season, eight years after the NBA was founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan could score that many points on a good night.  
Come back, Michael! 
</P>
<P>
	Ineptitude has become such a norm that it has become the story.  
Did the Bulls lose? That's no longer the question. Now it's `Did 
the Clippers win?' As of Tuesday, with no game scheduled Wednesday, 
the Los Angeles Clippers were 0-13 and in cold pursuit of the NBA's 
worst-start record of 0-17 set by the Miami Heat in the 1988-89 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who note that tough defense is a reason for the  
scoring drought. Maybe, but more legitimate reasons might be the 
playground mentality of many pros and the idea that showmanship is 
what counts. So if you can't slam dunk, then throw one up from 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a bigger reason, because of the owner's lockout, is  
teams are being asked to play four or five games a week instead of 
two or three so that a 50-game season can be held before the 
interminable playoffs begin. Four games in seven days seem to be 
just too many for the world's greatest athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it possible that some of these multi-millionaires did not  
work at getting into and staying in the best physical condition 
during the lockout? 
</P>
<P>
	The shorter training camp and more intense schedule have to have  
had something to do with the rash of injuries that have hit the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance, however, has been good, and not only because of the  
league's public relations efforts. The faithful seem to be willing 
to put up with subpar play, at least for the current season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would seem that the NBA could be headed for trouble in  
the post-Jordan era unless basketball becomes as important as show 
boating. If a player can't be a superstar, he should just settle 
for being a player and part of the game. The faithful would 
appreciate that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the collegians take over the world's biggest stage --  
the country's television sets -- and you can be sure they'll make 
the most of the opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Dole Heads to Kosovo Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole says he will urge ethnic  
Albanians in Kosovo to sign a proposed peace agreement as soon as 
possible because further delays can only benefit Serb leader 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	After a scheduled departure from Washington this afternoon, Dole  
plans talks with a variety of Kosovo Albanians on Friday as an 
emissary of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an administration diplomatic offensive for a peace  
settlement, the administration also is considering sending 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to Belgrade in the coming days to try 
to win Serb approval of the six-nation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was a key architect of the October cease fire in  
Kosovo that has been widely violated since then. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley pointed to recent  
encouraging signs that the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been 
moving toward acceptance of the plan. The key features of the plan 
include continued Serb sovereignty over the province plus self-rule 
for the majority Albanian population. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Albanians formally agree, Foley predicted, ``pressure  
on the Serbs to do so will mount. '' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that that message will become increasingly clear to  
President Milosevic in the days to come,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement late Wednesday, Dole, former Republican  
presidential candidate who lost to Clinton in 1996, said the peace 
plan is not perfect but provides the best chance to put the people 
of Kosovo on a course of self-rule and liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular importance, Dole said, is the provision calling  
for implementation of the agreement by NATO troops with U.S. 
participation. ``With NATO troops for protection,'' he said, ``the 
people of Kosovo can determine their own agenda and future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said Milosevic's ``aggressive policies continue to threaten  
the entire region. The United States and our NATO allies must act. 
We cannot afford to allow this destabilizing situation to continue 
to spill over into neighboring countries or tear our NATO allies 
apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's assignment pleased Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the  
senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Dole brings credibility in the Balkans,'' Biden told a  
group of reporters. Biden also suggested that Dole's role ``freezes 
some elements of the Republican party'' from criticizing the 
administration's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is eager for a settlement to be reached by  
the time peace talks resume in Paris on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley's remarks were devoid of military threats, suggesting that  
for now, the administration is content to rely on diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, officials expressed concern over military  
deployments by the Yugoslav Army in violation of the October truce. 
They said the violations were not one-sided, pointing to 
provocative actions taken by Kosovar Albanian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary William Cohen predicted that  
without a peace plan and peacekeepers, there was a ``likelihood of 
bloodshed continuing to take place on a massive scale, with 
migrations of tens of thousands of people out of the region 
spilling into the other areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, Cohen said, could ``present us with a military mission in  
the future which would be far more expensive'' than the 
4,000-member U.S. contingent the administration envisions for 
Kosovo under a peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Hits Higher Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, kicking his  
presidential campaign into higher gear, will visit Iowa and New 
Hampshire on the same day this month. 
</P>
<P>
	That swing on March 15 will be followed by a separate trip to  
Iowa later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time we will do Iowa and New Hampshire as  
campaign stops and the first time that we know of that we're going 
to do both on the same day,'' said spokeswoman Patricia Ewing. Gore 
has repeatedly traveled to the early primary and caucus states, but 
called it official travel and billed taxpayers for the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign will pay a portion of his political travels.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has formed a campaign committee and opened  
offices in Washington, but will not formally announce his candidacy 
until late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George Bush's presidential exploratory committee will  
be headed by a diverse and high-profile list of Republicans, aides 
said. They are keeping the list secret until Bush's news conference 
Sunday, though the group is said to include former Secretary of 
State George Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has invited national reporters to Austin, Texas, for a news  
conference unveiling his committee. Several members of the 
committee will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will file its papers with the Federal Election  
Commission on Monday, allowing Bush to raise and spend money as he 
decides whether to seek the presidency. Associates expect him to 
run, though a final decision and formal announcement are several 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, several sources close to Bush, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, say his political director is expected to 
be Maria Cino, former executive director at the Republican House 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A potential Bush rival, millionaire businessman Steve Forbes,  
has a press secretary in mind for his yet-to-be-announced campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Juleanne Glover Weiss, senior policy adviser for Republican Sen.  
John Ashcroft of Missouri, will be Forbes' top spokeswoman if, as 
expected, he seeks the GOP nomination, a source close to Forbes 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft toyed with the idea of running for president, but  
backed out at the last minute. Weiss, 30, has been publicity 
director for the conservative Weekly Standard magazine and 
legislative director for the Project for the Republican Future. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP hopeful, conservative activist Gary Bauer, says he  
has raised $750,000 in 30 days and has qualified for federal 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate must show $50,000 in eligible contributions from  
more than 20 states to qualify. ``Gary has strong support -- 
financially and politically -- all across the country,'' spokesman 
Tim Goeglein said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is still far short of the $15 to $20 million that most  
financial experts say will be needed to compete in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Being a political consultant was never enough for Tom Cole. The  
49-year-old is Oklahoma's state's secretary of state, top adviser 
for Gov. Frank Keating and liaison with leaders of the 
legislature's Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he will be the new chief of staff for Republican Party  
chairman Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My loss is definitely the RNC's gain,'' said Keating, chairman  
of the Republican Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He appointed Cole secretary of state in 1995, after his first  
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole heads up a highly successful Oklahoma-based political  
consulting firm, Cole-Hargrave Snodgrass and Associates. He was 
executive director of the GOP House campaign committee from 1991 to 
1993, an Oklahoma state senator from 1988 to 1991 and state party 
chairman from 1985 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson has been under pressure to strengthen the party's  
political operation after weaker-than-expected results in 
November's midterm elections.

<HEADLINE> Gore Book Recounts Controversies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shortly after Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr delivered his report about President Clinton to Congress, 
Vice President Al Gore convened an emergency session of the small 
team of confidantes that meets regularly at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's concern was how to comport himself during the House  
impeachment debate, according to a new biography of the vice 
president by a former ABC News correspondent. The outcome was a 
strategy in which the second-in-command supported his boss's 
policies, but avoided denouncing the Monica Lewinsky investigation 
as a ``right-wing conspiracy'' or defending Clinton's character, 
according to Bob Zelnick's ``Gore: A Political Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He would not become Clinton's hatchet man,'' writes Zelnick.  
``He would not, Samson-like, tear down the pillars of the 
government he fervently hoped to inherit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, published by Regnery Press, portrays the vice  
president as a politician of conscience, but one whose ``Eagle 
Scout'' image has been sullied in part by the misdeeds of Clinton 
and by his own implications in fund-raising debacles. 
</P>
<P>
	It largely rehashes the controversies surrounding Gore and his  
efforts to raise money, both as a senator and as vice president. 
Zelnick also recounts other flaps of Gore's vice presidency, 
including federal contracts awarded to Molten Metal Technology, a 
contributor to the Democratic National Committee and the 
Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, dismissed the book as a  
right-wing attack on the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The book appears to be nothing more than a regurgitation of  
old news. It's obvious that the radical right, after spending six 
years attacking the president, is now turning its sights on Al 
Gore,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelnick praises the vice president at times, including his ``act  
of conscience and moral courage'' in supporting the 1991 Gulf War 
resolution while in the Senate. But Zelnick also alleges that Gore 
has been willing to forsake some of his commitment to the 
environment and other issues for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Tennessee had long suffered the ill effects of  
pollution coming down the Pigeon River from the International 
Champion Corp. in Canton, N.C. But in 1987, Gore, who wanted to 
build political clout and raise funds in North Carolina, struck a 
deal with the corporation that curtailed pollution to a level that 
was still above the standards set by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, according to Zelnick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's self-proclaimed 'breakthrough' amounted to little more  
than political showboating,'' he writes. The issue eventually came 
back to haunt Gore as vice president, and he directed the head of 
the EPA to reconsider Champion's permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelnick cites other instances of the vice president's  
flip-flopping, including his attempts to ingratiate himself with 
music industry bigwigs after his wife, Tipper, launched her 
campaign against pornography in rock music, and his support for 
tobacco farmers against foreign competition while denouncing the 
health effects of cigarettes after his sister died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between Al Gore Jr. and Al Gore Sr. left a  
strong imprint on the younger Gore and often steered his decisions, 
the book says. As a student at Harvard University, Gore once 
expressed his disenchantment with the Vietnam War in a letter to 
his father, who was a senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have inveterate antipathy for communism -- or paranoia,  
as I like to put it. My own belief is that this form of 
psychological ailment -- in this case a national madness -- leads the 
victim to actually create the thing which is feared the most,'' 
Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who served in Vietnam after college, never became a campus  
activist on this front because of concern for his father's 
political career and for his own future, Zelnick argues.

<HEADLINE> Menendez Won't Run for U.S. Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat,  
said today he will not seek the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. 
Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez had hinted earlier in the week that he would choose to  
give up his place in House leadership and become a candidate. But 
during a news conference today, he said he met Wednesday with House 
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who convinced him to 
remain in the House to help Democrats try to regain the majority in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Many eyes had been on Menendez since Lautenberg announced last  
month that he will not seek a fourth term. With $1.2 million in the 
bank and a spot in national leadership, Menendez was tapped as 
``the person to beat'' by Democratic State Chairman Tom Giblin. 
</P>
<P>
	As vice chairman of the Democratic caucus, Menendez, 45, is the  
fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. He would likely be in line 
for a top leadership post if his party recaptures control of the 
House from Republicans in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	If Menendez ran for the Senate and lost, he would find himself  
not just out of House leadership, but out of Congress altogether.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks Hurricane Mitch Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress to provide  
enhanced trade benefits to countries of Central America and the 
Caribbean to help them recover from the devastation of Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal was announced today -- four days  
before the president travels to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala to inspect the damage from the storm that killed more 
than 9,000 people and left millions more homeless. Clinton has 
asked Congress for $956 million to help rebuild the region. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the new measure  
would eliminate U.S. tariffs on certain textile and apparel 
products. The benefits would apply from Oct. 1, 1999 to June 30, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill would authorize the president to offer enhanced,  
temporary trade benefits to Caribbean Basin countries,'' Berger 
said. He said the benefits would help Caribbean and Central 
American countries ``recover from the serious damage'' of Hurriance 
Mitch and encourage them to adopt policies that could pave the way 
for their participation in a broader free trade agreement in the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Echaveste, Clinton's deputy chief of staff, said that  
Central American leaders, when they met with Clinton in December, 
said that trade concessions were ``at the top of their list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the proposed benefits were a step toward giving the  
Caribbean and Central American nations parity with Mexico, which 
enjoys trade breaks under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
``It's a part of it, it's not full, it's not NAFTA,'' Echaveste 
said. ``It gets closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an attempt to get closer to conditions that exist in  
NAFTA, not just for textiles but also the non-textile areas,'' said 
Peter Romero, acting assistant secretary of State for Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it also was intended to ``make it more attractive for  
investors to rethink Central America and the Caribbean in terms of 
particularly textile investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House press secretary Joe Lockart said ``there  
is a general concern'' about the Senate's handling of the Central 
American relief bill. He said some senators were trying to use this 
bill to ``set up a political fight here,'' much like they did with 
legislation for the International Monetary Fund bailout last year 
and the 1997 flood relief bill. He urged lawmakers not to ``head 
down a partisan path'' on this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an emergency. The need is real. The need is  
desperate,'' Lockhart said. ``These are issues that should be above 
the partisan fighting here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the Hurricane Mitch was the worst natural disaster  
ever to hit the Western Hemisphere. The countries suffered losses 
estimated at between $7 billion to $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> New Rule Ends Senate's Secret Holds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators may still block, but they no longer  
can hide. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the word from Senate leaders Wednesday as they ended an  
age-old practice that individual senators used to delay action on 
bills or nominations they found objectionable while remaining 
anonymous among their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	They can still place holds, but they won't be anonymous.  
</P>
<P>
	In a joint letter distributed to colleagues, Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said 
the change was made to ``address some concerns raised regarding 
this practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the practice -- known as a ``hold'' -- is unfair and  
undemocratic. 
</P>
<P>
	It began decades ago as a senatorial courtesy but has become  
more common and controversial, especially when used to block White 
House nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	By placing a ``hold,'' a single senator could block action on a  
bill, nomination or other business without explanation or being 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we believe that all members will agree this practice of  
'secret holds' has been a senatorial courtesy extended by party 
leaders for many Congresses, it is our intention to address some 
concerns regarding this practice,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	From now on, members who want to delay any legislation or  
nomination must notify the bill's sponsor and the appropriate 
committees. Members must also notify their respective leaders in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The news brought instant praise from two senators who've tried  
to end the practice. Holds are not part of the Senate's formal 
rules but grew out of a century-old tradition by which senators who 
were unable to attend debates or votes would ask their leaders to 
postpone action and the requests would be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an outrageous practice, it should have been changed  
years ago and it comes pretty close to amounting to legislative 
blackmail,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has campaigned to 
eliminate it since joining the Senate since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the delays wasted time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost impossible to run down, in some instances, who's  
holding things up,'' he said. ``This will make it out in the open, 
make us more productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and Wyden have used ``holds'' themselves, but are among  
the few who go public by stating their objections in the 
Congressional Record, the official transcript of House and Senate 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said the change should help boost public confidence in the  
Senate, particularly after the rules required it to shut the people 
out during key decision-making moments in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is sending a message that there's going to be some  
sunshine on the floor of this body,'' Wyden added.

<HEADLINE> Giants Ballpark Has Toxic Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A huge mound of lead-contaminated dirt sits  
in the middle of what will be center field at the San Francisco 
Giants' new ballpark while officials figure out what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	A convoy of trucks hauled about 6,000 cubic yards of the toxic  
soil across the bay to an Alameda County landfill before state 
toxicologists decided they had mistakenly declared it safe to move 
and that the soil is, in fact, hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves 12,000 cubic yards of the dirt smack in the middle  
of what will be Pacific Bell Park while the state conducts more 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants said the problem will not delay completion of the  
$210 million ballpark, scheduled to open in April 2000. ``We're 
certainly expecting to be able to haul to Altamont,'' said Giants 
vice president Jack Bair. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation may force special hearings by the San Francisco  
Environmental Commission, which advises Mayor Willie Brown and the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are toxic contaminants in the dirt, we'd want to look  
into how it will be disposed of and the method of transport,'' said 
Commissioner Steve Krefting. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano also scheduled a  
hearing on the problem, which was first reported in the city's SF 
Weekly newspaper last month. The discovery of the mistaken 
classification, which the San Francisco Chronicle reported about 
Thursday, makes the hearing all the more important, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get to the bottom of this. I understand the drive  
of the Giants to get their stadium, but I don't want to sacrifice 
the citizens' safety. Let's see what the hearing unearths,'' 
Ammiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of downtown San Francisco, including the waterfront and the  
area where the ballpark is being built, was created by filling in 
parts of San Francisco Bay with debris from the 1906 earthquake and 
other sources. The fill contained collapsed buildings that had been 
painted with lead-based paint. As a result, the soil contains 
elevated levels of lead. 
</P>
<P>
	State toxicologists had allowed the transfer of the excavated  
soil to begin last week, telling the Giants that the level of lead 
in the dirt was not dangerous enough to classify it as a hazardous 
material, which costs much more to dispose. 
</P>
<P>
	But late Tuesday, the Department of Toxic Substances Control  
informed the Giants their original classification was in error. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Baker, a spokesman for the department, said scientists in  
the waste evaluation unit mistakenly used a less-stringent federal 
standard to determine that the dirt was not sufficiently poisonous 
to be deemed hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The soil doesn't threaten the health of workers or the general  
population, but could contaminate groundwater, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jim Spagnole, spokesman for the California Environmental  
Protection Agency, said it was possible the remaining dirt could be 
taken to Altamont, even if its lead content exceeds the state 
standard.

<HEADLINE> Blackmun Made Key Abortion Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry A. Blackmun knew he would be remembered  
forever as the author of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But he always hoped 
his 24-year tenure on the high court would yield a broader legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I would be remembered as a person of judicial integrity  
who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one field,'' 
he once told The Associated Press. ``I'd like to be known just as a 
good worker in the vineyard who held his own and contributed 
generally to the advancement of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died today. He was 90, and had retired as a Supreme  
Court justice in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	To those who didn't know him, Blackmun might have seemed a  
cranky old guy. On the bench, he often displayed a judicial scowl 
and could be snappish with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	At other times, his homespun questions hid the intellect of a  
magna cum laude mathematics graduate of Harvard who considered 
becoming a doctor and for years served as general counsel to the 
Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Blackmun took off the judicial robe and put on one of  
the ever-present cardigan sweaters he wore in his offices, warmth 
and humor emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	He could talk at length about his three daughters and his  
grandchildren, about his former law clerks and their families. And 
he could joke about his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1990 interview, Blackmun called himself one of the high  
court's ``three old goats'' whose inevitable departure, he 
predicted, would solidify conservative domination of the court for 
the next 40 or 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 81 at the time. Fellow Justices William J. Brennan and  
Thurgood Marshall were 84 and 82, respectively. Both retired 
shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time will take its toll on the three old goats,'' Blackmun  
said. ``We will be replaced by appointees of the current 
administration or the next one, which is probably going to be 
another Bush administration. So it seems to me that before too long 
the court could be nine conservatives, and that surely will last 
well into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was wrong. Bill Clinton beat George Bush in the 1992 election  
and picked Blackmun's successor, Stephen G. Breyer. Clinton also 
named Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun once was called a conservative, but in later years was  
called a liberal. He believed he always was somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to develop his attitude toward the (Constitution's)  
great phrases,'' he once told an interviewer. ``What does equal 
protection mean? What is cruel and unusual punishment? I would hope 
that I have grown in that respect over the years. But as far as 
shifting from conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his sometimes passionate rhetoric, Blackmun also had a  
passion for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago Cubs, but his  
love of baseball transcended team allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Blackmun the baseball fan who wrote what may be the most  
extraordinary paragraph in American law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1972 decision called Flood vs. Kuhn, the Supreme Court  
allowed major league baseball to keep its exemption from federal 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Blackmun began with what might be called  
an ode to the national pastime. In the fifth paragraph, he embarked 
on a journey through some of the game's most famous names -- 88 
players, owners, managers and even umpires in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are the many names, celebrated for one reason or  
another, that have sparked the diamond and its environs and that 
have provided tinder for recaptured thrills, for reminiscence and 
comparisons, and for conversations and anticipations in-season and 
off-season: Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Tris Speaker, Walter Johnson, Henry 
Chadwick, Eddie Collins, Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, 
Rogers Hornsby, Harry Hooper, Goose Goslin, Jackie Robinson, Honus 
Wagner ... Rabbit Maranville, Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove. The list 
seems endless,'' Blackmun wrote.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' DeShields Breaks Thumb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Baltimore second baseman Delino  
DeShields will be out 5-7 weeks after fracturing a bone near the 
base of his left thumb in Thursday's intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor-league outfielder Luis Matos hit a line drive that struck  
the thumb portion of DeShields' glove as he made the catch for the 
final out. DeShields, who signed a three-year, $12.5 million 
contract this winter after two seasons in St. Louis, removed his 
glove and shook the hand as he headed toward the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields singled to left field in the bottom of the third  
inning and later scored in the A team's 12-7 victory. He was 
replaced by Carlos Casimiro and taken to Dr. Jim Guerra's office in 
Fort Lauderdale for X-rays, which revealed the fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Frank Wren said DeShields' hand will be in a  
cast 3-4 weeks and he'll need another 2-3 weeks of rehabilitation, 
meaning he won't be ready by Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren said the thumb was ``very tender'' when trainer Richie  
Bancells examined it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ball was hit very hard. I don't know if it knuckled on  
him, but it kind of took off at the last moment,'' Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's also battling health problems, utility infielder  
Jeff Reboulet's playing time is certain to increase with DeShields' 
injury. Reboulet, who has been receiving treatment for tendinitis 
in his left heel, will start at second base and bat in DeShields' 
No. 2 slot in Saturday's exhibition opener against Minnesota at 
Fort Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reboulet started at second base for the B team in Tuesday's  
opening intrasquad game and doubled in three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in the game was fine,'' he said, ``but running off the  
field, which is more of a heel-toe action, bothers me more than 
running around the bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Amaral, who signed a two-year deal this winter, also will  
be considered as an alternative to DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt he would be a guy we'd look for to go full-time during  
DeShields' absence,'' Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller said he'll also rotate minor-league  
infielders Jesse Garcia, Jerry Hairston and Carlos Casimiro at 
second, then decide on a long-term option if DeShields' injury 
proves more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough kid. It won't take him long to come back,''  
Miller said. ``The funny thing is, he went up the next time and hit 
a rocket. Obviously, he's down right now, but he'll bounce back. 
Sometimes things happen for a reason, though I don't know what the 
reason is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Mike Bordick has been using this time in camp to get  
acquainted with DeShields, 30, after two seasons with Roberto 
Alomar as his double-play partner. Alomar signed with the Cleveland 
Indians as a free agent this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you play with somebody, the more you learn their body  
language and how they respond. In that regard, it's going to be 
tough,'' Bordick said.

<HEADLINE> Some Tips on Dangerous Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If abducted in a public place, don't go  
quietly, the State Department advises Americans who get in trouble 
abroad. Instead, ``make as much commotion as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If aboard a hijacked plane, observe the characteristics of the  
hijackers, privately think up nicknames for each one for later 
identification, and ``respond in a regulated tone of voice'' if 
spoken to, the department says. When traveling on business, make 
hotel reservations without using a company's name, only its 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	The worldly wise branch of the U.S. government doesn't want to  
restrain people's wanderlust. But it knows how dangerous the world 
can sometimes be. Known for its travel warnings -- the list of 
countries Americans are advised to avoid completely -- the 
department's Consular Affairs Bureau offers a lot more information 
than that for those who know where to find it. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Americans who rely solely on the travel warnings when  
deciding where to go are missing information that could mean the 
difference between life and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the slaughter of eight tourists at the edge of the Bwindi  
National Park, U.S. officials did not highlight Uganda as posing 
special danger. In fact, the area of the attack is described in a 
December consular report as ``generally safe,'' with ``some 
banditry and armed robbery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that same report, publicly available if little-known, is  
full of so much foreboding about Uganda in general that it is 
likely to give all but the most adventurous tourist pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar reports, or ``consular information sheets,'' offer the  
same level of detail on all countries, but tourists often don't 
know that when they book a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans do not like surprises,'' said a State Department  
consular official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``These 
sheets give them lots of foreshadowing of surprises that may befall 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Americans traveling to Russia are told that in the  
Caucasus region, ``local criminal gangs routinely kidnap 
foreigners, including Americans, for ransom.'' Trouble spots are 
noted in countries that tourists don't hesitate to visit -- for 
France, the Paris train lines most popular with thieves are 
described. 
</P>
<P>
	And about Uganda, tourists are told in great detail about the  
criminal and political violence experienced in many parts of the 
country -- and warned not to take food or drink from strangers on 
public transit, because it might be doped. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials question whether much of this information is being  
passed on by travel agents and tour companies, which are more 
likely to stick to the State Department's list of countries to 
avoid -- 28 currently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does a travel agent who's hypothetically trying to sell an  
umpteen-thousand-dollar trip to see gorillas necessarily want to 
tell the customer about the consular information sheet? Well, they 
should,'' the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alistair Ballantine, president of Abercrombie and Kent  
International, an upscale tour group that ran a gorilla camp where 
the assault happened, said the area had been open for seven years 
without trouble for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rely very much upon the State Department and their  
advice,'' he said. ``If there's a full warning on a place, we 
insist on the clients reading and signing the warning.'' But 
because most bookings come through travel agents, he said, ``we 
look to them to pass on current information'' such as that 
contained in consular sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from countries on its don't-go list, the State Department  
has 12 ``public announcements'' in effect for other nations and 
four in effect for worldwide threats. These detail risks that may 
be confined to certain areas of a country or are temporary, 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan attack prompted the department to issue a public  
announcement advising Americans to postpone travel to western 
Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Another such announcement, issued Jan. 5, warned that extremists  
may be planning attacks on U.S. interests in Egypt and that 
Americans there should keep a low profile, vary routes and times of 
travel and treat unfamiliar mail suspiciously. That advice is 
standard for Americans traveling or living in possibly unsafe 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those announcements, however, don't contain the wealth of  
information supplied by the consular sheets. Despite all the 
trouble noted in Uganda in the December report, no public 
announcement was in effect for that country until the latest 
attack.

<HEADLINE> Abbott To Market Arthritis Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Abbott Laboratories has acquired U.S.  
co-marketing rights to the drug Mobic, one of a new class of 
arthritis pain medications that promise relief with significantly 
fewer side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott will sell the drug along with its maker, Germany's  
Boehringer Ingelheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobic, under review by the Food and Drug Administration, will  
likely be the third major new arthritis pain drug introduced this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto and Pfizer already are co-marketing the pain drug  
Celebrex, which has had explosive early sales since it became 
available in January. Merck's Vioxx could be on the market this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The new class of drugs treat pain as well as current  
medications, but are less likely to cause severe stomach problems, 
such as bleeding ulcers, that sometimes occur with older arthritis 
drugs.

<HEADLINE> CBO Enters Social Security Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' chief fiscal analyst is skeptical  
Republicans can really ensure Social Security funds are used only 
to shore up the huge pension program -- because subsequent lawmakers 
could undo their work. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same Congressional Budget Office making that conclusion  
is providing ammunition for the GOP in its growing fight with 
President Clinton over Social Security. A CBO report says Clinton 
would spend billions in Social Security funds for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Crippen, the CBO director, told the Senate Budget Committee  
Wednesday that his agency has ``not found a way'' for lawmakers to 
protect Social Security's surpluses and ensure the dollars not fund 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Any law setting aside money can be undone by lawmakers eager to  
get at the money, CBO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing that concern was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan. He told the House Commerce's finance subcommittee that 
regardless of any promises today, politicians would be tempted to 
spend future budget surpluses on tax cuts or other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, congressional GOP leaders planned to meet again today  
in their quest to develop a plan for fencing off Social Security 
funds. They hope to agree to such a proposal this week so they can 
deflect Democratic accusations that Republicans want to use 
surpluses for tax cuts instead of helping Social Security and 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., and others are considering a plan by Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., requiring that Social 
Security surpluses buy down the publicly held national debt. It 
would take 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to use the money for 
other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only do what you can do,'' Lott said later. ``And a  
lockbox that requires 60 votes in the Senate to get that money ... 
is pretty effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager for arguments to use against Clinton, Republicans were  
thrilled to hear Crippen testify that Clinton's budget would spend 
big chunks of Social Security surpluses in the next few years. 
Clinton's plan would spend $35 billion in Social Security money for 
other programs in fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Crippen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't save Social Security. He raids the Social Security  
trust fund,'' said Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., a 
member of the budget panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it would reserve the entire Social  
Security surplus over the next 15 years, but concedes it would not 
save all of it in every individual year. Even so, White House 
officials said their plan was superior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president proposes to devote 62 percent of the surplus  
over the next 15 years to Social Security,'' said White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv. ``We don't spend one dime of it until we save 
Social Security. All that gets locked in at the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's overall federal surplus would be $98 billion under  
Clinton's plans for using surpluses to bolster Social Security and 
other programs, including investing some of the money in the stock 
market. But without any changes in current law, the black ink would 
be $133 billion, CBO said.

<HEADLINE> Cablevision Might Try To Buy Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Cablevision's chairman is negotiating to buy  
the New York Mets, it's news to Nelson Doubleday, the team's 
co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday is denying reports that Charles Dolan, rebuffed in his  
attempt last year to buy into the New York Yankees, has approached 
him about selling the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an old pal of mine,'' Doubleday told the New York Post.  
``Believe me, if he was interested in buying this team, I would 
know about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday was not immediately available for further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon refused comment on a report  
that Cablevision is willing to pay $500 million to $600 million for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing I can say,'' explained Wilpon, who the Daily  
News said is interested in conjunction with Dolan in developing a 
parcel of property for a new Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision spokesman Charles Schueler neither confirmed nor  
denied there are talks concerning purchase of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is our policy not to comment on rumors and  
speculation in the media, we note that Cablevision has enjoyed 
excellent long-term relationships with the Mets and Yankees as 
their primary television provider,'' Cablevision said in a 
statement. ``We communicate regularly with the ownership of both 
teams and maintain an active interest in the future of those 
relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision already owns the New York Knicks and Rangers, and  
holds television rights to the Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Rangers, 
Islanders, and New Jersey Nets and Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's chances of buying the Yankees ended with last week's  
announcement that the baseball club and the Nets had signed a 
letter of intent to merge the two teams' business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Dolan's attempts to buy the Yankees, under which  
George Steinbrenner would have remained as the general partner, the 
proposed Mets deal would result in Cablevision purchasing the team 
entirely and keeping Wilpon as the general partner.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Vs. Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar jumped against other currencies  
Thursday as U.S. economic fundamentals continued to outshine poor 
performances in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been buying (dollars) today,'' said Hajime Sato,  
assistant general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa 
International Trust Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 123.35  
Japanese yen, up from 121.77 on Wednesday. Also in late trading, 
the euro was quoted at $1.0805, down from $1.0890. The euro dipped 
as low as $1.0790, its first time below $1.0800 since its 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen began during Asian trading  
when investors seized upon remarks by Kazuyoshi Kaneko, who heads a 
newly created Liberal Democratic Party committee to monitor the 
turbulent bond market. The government is trying to dig the country 
out of its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaneko said he was considering new ways to cap the rise in  
long-term interest rates, perhaps by having the central bank buy 
more government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan did just that: It bought  
short-term government bonds, flooding the interbank loan market 
with cash. That sent a key interest rate to an all-time low of 0.02 
percent and undermined the value of the yen. Lower interest rates 
make a country's currency and assets less appealing to foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's problems came as the European Central Bank,  
representing the 11 countries using the new currency, decided not 
to change interest rates during a policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were discouraged because they expected a rate cut to  
stimulate borrowing and spending to move the economy along. The 
euro dropped to another low right after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast with Japan and Europe's economic problems, fresh  
economic reports displayed the U.S.'s strength. 
</P>
<P>
	New orders to U.S. factories surged in January for the second  
consecutive month, retailers reported higher-than-expected sales in 
February and the average level of new applications for unemployment 
benefits in February reached a 10-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4699 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4597, and 1.5253 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5267. The British 
pound fell to $1.6098, down from $1.6134. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8100 German 
marks, up from 1.7960; 6.0716 French francs, up from 6.0241; and 
Italian lire, 1,792.11, up from 1,779.36.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Status May Be Changed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of track's greatest gold medalists says  
the worst scandal in Olympic history is like a drug test for the 
leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an Olympic champion in the long jump and  
heptathlon and now a special assistant to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, said Wednesday that the bribery case built around Salt 
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games had tarnished the five 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' she said. ``We have to get back to the athletes.  
They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other people 
decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For athletes, the 
Olympic rings are a dream. They may have been tarnished, but for 
the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was on hand as the USOC announced a series of  
reforms aimed at avoiding a recurrence of what president Bill Hybl 
called the ``global crisis'' of the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC did not do enough to prevent Salt Lake City  
bidders from setting up a million-dollar scheme to buy IOC members' 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight was abysmal,'' he said at a news conference.  
``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and 
individuals who will not allow this to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl sent President Clinton a letter asking that the  
International Olympic Committee, at the center of the scandal, be 
subject to the same law that the federal government uses to deal 
with corrupt foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he and Hybl called IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about 
the steps the USOC was taking, including the request to the White 
House to label the committee a public international organization 
covered under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee said Samaranch should stay in office although  
``all fingers are pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' she said.  
``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty until the 
results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a four-time Olympic gold-medal swimmer and now a TV  
sports commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni association, 
said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke IOC rules 
``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to make those 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC escaped the brunt of a critical report this week from  
an independent ethics panel led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, which said the IOC had fostered a ``culture of 
improper gift giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hybl said the USOC adopted a series of recommendations from  
the Mitchell report, including an end to overseas assistance 
programs by bid cities and establishment of a watchdog office for 
ethics and conflict-of-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It went beyond the report by placing a permanent staff member in  
Salt Lake to deal with Olympic organizers, something Schultz said 
would be part of the operation for any future U.S. Olympic host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC also said that all board of directors and executive  
committee meetings now would be open, budgets would be quickly 
available to the public and athletes would receive a bigger voice 
in decision-making, including a new committee vice-presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the scandal ``indicates how misplaced the priorities  
of the Olympic movement have become. Our athletes must always come 
first.''

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps May Get More Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Peace Corps' budget would increase by 51  
percent to $365 million over the next four years under a bill 
approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	It would enable the agency to support 10,000 volunteers around  
the world by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would make changes in the law so that Peace Corps  
volunteers and employees will have most of the benefits of being a 
member of the Foreign Service, said Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., 
who introduced the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	During debate on the House floor Wednesday, no one spoke against  
the proposed increase for the Peace Corps, which now has about 
6,700 volunteers in 80 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you take a look at the impact it has on the world  
community ... there is no American program that has been a better 
ambassador for America and its values than the Peace Corps,'' Rep. 
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 326-90, would authorize $270 million for the  
program in 2000, $298 million for 2001, $327 million for 2002 and 
$365 million for 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,  
have introduced similar legislation in the Senate. The White House 
supports the bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Management of the Peace Corps has improved, Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-based staff has been reduced 13 percent, and more of the  
program's resources are being allocated overseas since Mark Gearan 
became director in September 1995, Campbell said. The annual cost 
of a volunteer has been decreased 14 percent since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peace Corps received nearly 10,000 applications in 1998 from  
people wanting to volunteer, Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a resurgent interest in the Peace Corps with  
young Americans and those not so young,'' he said. About 8 percent 
of volunteers are over 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Peace Corps has always enjoyed bipartisan support in the  
Congress, and the proposed increases in this bill really represent, 
I think, a very small investment for a large return,'' Rep. Anna 
Eschoo, D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps volunteers receive living expenses, health care  
coverage and a readjustment allowance after their service. They 
work to help fight hunger, bring clean water to communities, teach 
children, increase crop yields, help start new small businesses and 
work to stop the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The program began March 1, 1961, a few months after President  
Kennedy first proposed the idea of an international volunteer 
organization. Since then, more than 150,000 Americans have 
volunteered in the program in over 130 countries. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> CIA: Bio Weapons Threat Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA sees the threat of biological warfare  
and terrorism as rising but says experts may be exaggerating the 
ease of developing effective weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The preparation and effective use of biological weapons by  
both potentially hostile states and by non-state actors, including 
terrorists, is harder than some popular literature seems to 
suggest,'' CIA counterproliferation official John Lauder told the 
House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That said, potential adversaries are pursuing such programs,  
and the threat that the United States and our allies face is 
growing in breadth and sophistication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA tracks about a dozen nations, including several  
generally hostile to the West -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and 
Syria -- that are developing or already possess offensive biological 
weapons. In many cases, they see biological weapons as a key to 
waging ``asymmetric warfare'' on much more powerful adversaries 
such as the United States, Lauder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the weapon for David-and-Goliath warfare,'' Princeton  
biophysicist Stephen Block said. ``You can take down the giant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony, in a rare public hearing of the intelligence  
committee, included a panel of biological weapons experts who 
demonstrated some of the simple techniques -- a common garden 
sprayer, for example -- for spreading a biological weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obligated to raise the public's awareness,'' said Rep.  
Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the committee. ``I am disturbed by 
what appears to be a rampant proliferation of biowarfare 
capabilities and technologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goss and several witnesses underscored the relative ease of  
developing biological agents such as anthrax by using technology as 
simple as a brewery. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lauder, special assistant for nonproliferation to CIA  
Director George Tenet, said developing effective biological weapons 
is more difficult than popular movies or even weapons experts 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the case of the Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese cult  
responsible for a deadly attack using the chemical weapon sarin on 
the Tokyo subway in 1995. It came after at least three failed 
attempts to carry out biological weapons attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Countering this argument, William Patrick, a veteran of the U.S.  
biological warfare of the 1960s and '70s, brought to the hearing an 
array of common household and garden spray devices and demonstrated 
-- nonlethally -- how they could be used by terrorists to spread 
powdered biological weapons agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Alibek, a former senior official in the Soviet Union's  
offensive biological weapons program, said that despite a 1992 
decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin banning all biological 
weapons activity, ``there still remains doubt that Russia has 
completely dismantled the old Soviet program.'' He said Washington 
must be wary that some of the roughly 60,000 people involved in the 
Soviet bioweapons program could export their expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	Alibek said biological weapons should be considered ``mass  
casualty weapons'' rather than weapons of mass destruction because 
they kill people without causing widespread destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's Lauder said strict U.S. trade and weapons embargoes on  
countries such as Iran and Iraq are having the unintended effect of 
strengthening those countries' indigenous weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biological weapons programs are becoming more self-sufficient,  
challenging our detection and deterrence efforts and limiting our 
interdiction opportunities,'' Lauder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., cautioned against alarming the  
public unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to scare people that biological warfare is going  
to be the warfare of the future,'' Sisisky said. Old fashioned 
tanks and planes will continue to be the main weapons of war, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Scraps Iowa Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An official North Korean delegation has  
canceled plans to attend a seminar in Iowa on conflict resolution 
and decided instead to remain in New York to continue discussions 
on nuclear issues with U.S. officials, the State Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the two countries have been meeting since  
Saturday on U.S. concerns about an underground construction site

	The North Korean decision not to attend the Iowa seminar did not  
signify that a breakthrough in the talks was near, an official 
said. 
</P>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Until now, it's been an Internet fact of life:  
No one roams the Web for free. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing is set in stone online, least of all access plans  
and their price tags. And monthly dial-up fees could go the way of 
the dot matrix printer if others keep giving away what America 
Online -- the biggest Internet provider -- is trying to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's popular unlimited access plan costs $21.95 a month and  
some companies offer restricted monthly plans for $9.95. With the 
advent of free Internet service, however, some Web users are 
deciding 10 bucks a month isn't such a great bargain after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway announced last week that it would throw in a free year  
of its Internet service with any computer purchase of more than 
$1,000. Even more threatening to the stranglehold of 
pay-for-service providers has been the early success of some rivals 
that let customers dial up for free. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 million Britons have signed on with Freeserve, which  
began operating in September and already has surpassed AOL as 
Britain's most popular Internet access provider. 
</P>
<P>
	NetZero, brought to the Web by the same venture capitalists who  
sparked an online stampede last month by giving away 
advertisement-rigged computers at www.Free-PC.com, has signed up 
400,000 customers since it launched a free service in October. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is a fraction of the more than 2 million subscribers  
added since mid-November by AOL, the king of connectivity with 16 
million subscribers, it is hardly a marginal development. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for free Web access, these services want free access  
to your eyes -- and a fixed portion of your computer screen -- for a 
parade of advertisements. Most Web users are used to this. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the free services are successful, Internet access could  
be reduced from a revenue-producer to a mere marketing gimmick -- a 
throw-in like PC software or pin-striping on a new car. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder if consumers will be getting what they bargained for  
from the upstart services, most of which have meager resources. 
</P>
<P>
	David Meier is among the skeptics, though he loves a good  
cyber-bargain. He even guides people to ``free stuff'' on the 
Internet with his site at www.y4i.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would always pay for access, because I don't want  
problems,'' he said. ``I don't want to worry about getting online 
or them being too busy, and I don't want that little box on my 
screen. I'd rather pay the 20 bucks a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those happy with their switch to a free Internet provider  
have doubts, including a young woman who subscribed recently to 
NetZero. 
</P>
<P>
	She sent the Westlake Village, Calif., company an e-mail  
bemoaning companies that go out of business within months leaving 
subscribers ``with a blank look on their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She asked for a heads-up if business went bust: ``How long have  
you been operating, and if you DO go out of business anytime in the 
foreseeable future, will you let all the users know well in 
advance?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the listings that came up in a browser search for ``free  
Internet access'' were many with links to www.Freewwweb.com. But 
the Internet service isn't exactly free. The Connecticut-based 
company charges a one-time fee of about $120 but seems to be one of 
the few NetZero rivals with local dial-up numbers across most of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another service, webCOMBO, charges a one-time fee of $149.95 for  
otherwise free access to its national network. Others such as 
zDial, FreePPP and FreeI charge nothing but only have dial-up 
numbers in a specific region. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online has no plans to get into a price war with new  
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly a very competitive industry, but we believe  
we offer the best value,'' said AOL spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new services are far more vulnerable to financial pressures  
and technological problems than big players like AOL, AT&AMP;T, 
Microsoft Network, EarthLink and MindSpring. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean little or no customer support and the risk that  
the service might suddenly vanish along with your e-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers also have doubts as to whether the advertising revenue  
alone can cover the huge costs of running an Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not funded big time, there's no way you can provide  
good service,'' said Ilan Klein, president of Vizooal Inc., a New 
York-based Internet marketing firm.

<HEADLINE> Hunter: `Sometimes You Want to Cry' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter felt  
more nervous walking on the field at spring training Thursday than 
he ever did in a World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hid his jitters, as he did during his pitching career,  
and strode confidently, if gingerly, on and off the field in his 
first public appearance since being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's 
disease four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Once an overpowering right-hander, Hunter couldn't shake hands  
firmly with former teammates, but he had big hugs for them as he 
participated in pregame ceremonies at the New York Yankees' 
exhibition season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time in my life I was nervous walking on the  
field,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right. It's just my hands and arms don't work  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with typical Catfish humor, he added: ``There's not too  
much muscle there left. But I never had too much to start with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hunter has severe weakness in both his arms and  
hands a year after suffering early symptoms of the progressive, 
neurological disease, formally called amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. He relies on his wife and childhood sweetheart, Helen, 
to dress him and feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you want to cry,'' he said, ``other times you just  
look around and you're thankful that you're living. The main thing 
is, maybe there might be a cure for it one of these days, years or 
whatever. Maybe I can last that long. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people who are a lot worse off than I am. A lot  
of people say, 'Well, you've got this disease, there's really no 
cure for it.' But you never know, there might be a cure right 
around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his spirits are up, Hunter briefly choked up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got my kids,'' he said before pausing, his eyes misty as he  
held back tears. ``That helps. I've got one grandson. It looks like 
he might play ball. His name's Taylor, and he's 3. He's got a ball 
in his hand right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he tries not to worry too much about how fast the  
deadly disease might progress, about how it eventually might put 
him in a wheelchair and wipe out his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get teary-eyed a little bit more than I used to,'' he said.  
``But it might be along with age, too. The main thing is, you only 
live one day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stays busy on his farm in Hertford, N.C., 600 acres of  
cotton, peanut, corn and bean fields and 400 acres of woods. He 
also goes to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore once a month 
or so for treatment and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit around, you think too much,'' Hunter said. ``Like Dick  
Williams said about pitching, 'If you start to think, you're always 
in trouble.' The best thing is not to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Yankees camp, Hunter visited with Williams, his manager  
with the Oakland Athletics. Before the game, he also sat with 
former pitching stars Whitey Ford and Mel Stottlemyre in manager 
Joe Torre's office, swapping stories and laughing with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Yankees manager Clyde King and fellow North Carolina  
buddy Jerry Narron, a catcher with the Yankees in Hunter's last 
season, visited Hunter and his wife at their farm a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was busy redecorating his house, but came out to greet  
them and showed them around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't believe his attitude. He was smiling and upbeat  
and positive,'' King said. ``We expected the worst. Maybe he'd be 
sitting in a chair. But I'll tell you, he lifted our spirits. We 
went down there to cheer him up, and we left there cheered up. 
That's Catfish for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, a right-hander, won 224 games in a 15-year career with  
the Yankees and Athletics, including a perfect game in 1968. He had 
a string of five straight 20-win seasons and won the AL Cy Young 
Award in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Goose Gossage, who came out of the bullpen more than a few times  
for Hunter late in his career and who is now a special pitching 
instructor for the Yankees, had tears in his eyes when he spoke of 
Hunter's illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hits too close to home,'' Gossage said. ``It kind of shocks  
you. It's scary. We're all thinking of him. Really, I think about 
him all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of competitor that Cat was on the mound is going to  
go right into what he's got to battle now. I don't know how he's 
coping with it. But I'm sure that if anybody can cope with it, he 
can. Because of the competitor he is, and because of the 
personality that he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALS is named for Gehrig, the Yankees' Hall of Famer who died  
from the disease in 1941 at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 30,000 Americans have the disease, which attacks  
nerves in the spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, 
causing progressive paralysis leading to death.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Status May Be Changed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of track's greatest gold medalists says  
the worst scandal in Olympic history is like a drug test for the 
leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an Olympic champion in the long jump and  
heptathlon and now a special assistant to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, said Wednesday that the bribery case built around Salt 
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games had tarnished the five 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' she said. ``We have to get back to the athletes.  
They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other people 
decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For athletes, the 
Olympic rings are a dream. They may have been tarnished, but for 
the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was on hand as the USOC announced a series of  
reforms aimed at avoiding a recurrence of what president Bill Hybl 
called the ``global crisis'' of the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC did not do enough to prevent Salt Lake City  
bidders from setting up a million-dollar scheme to buy IOC members' 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight was abysmal,'' he said at a news conference.  
``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and 
individuals who will not allow this to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl sent President Clinton a letter asking that the  
International Olympic Committee, at the center of the scandal, be 
subject to the same law that the federal government uses to deal 
with corrupt foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he and Hybl called IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about 
the steps the USOC was taking, including the request to the White 
House to label the committee a public international organization 
covered under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee said Samaranch should stay in office although  
``all fingers are pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' she said.  
``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty until the 
results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a four-time Olympic gold-medal swimmer and now a TV  
sports commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni association, 
said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke IOC rules 
``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to make those 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC escaped the brunt of a critical report this week from  
an independent ethics panel led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, which said the IOC had fostered a ``culture of 
improper gift giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hybl said the USOC adopted a series of recommendations from  
the Mitchell report, including an end to overseas assistance 
programs by bid cities and establishment of a watchdog office for 
ethics and conflict-of-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It went beyond the report by placing a permanent staff member in  
Salt Lake to deal with Olympic organizers, something Schultz said 
would be part of the operation for any future U.S. Olympic host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC also said that all board of directors and executive  
committee meetings now would be open, budgets would be quickly 
available to the public and athletes would receive a bigger voice 
in decision-making, including a new committee vice-presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the scandal ``indicates how misplaced the priorities  
of the Olympic movement have become. Our athletes must always come 
first.''

<HEADLINE> Alabama Senate Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The shouting in the Alabama Senate this  
week was so intense that a 5-year-old girl visiting her senator 
father cried. Now the shouting has turned into a silent standoff, 
with Democrats staging a boycott in their power struggle with the 
Republican lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Democrats -- a majority of the 35-member Senate --  
refused to show up for work Wednesday and Thursday. That is a 
strong act of protest in a state where the Legislature can meet 
only 30 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, they are suing Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, calling  
him a ``madman'' who violated their constitutional rights by 
pushing through rules dramatically increasing his power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's insane to think one man can run over the majority of an  
elected body,'' said Senate President Pro Tem Lowell Barron, a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle started in November, when Windom became the first  
Republican elected lieutenant governor in Alabama this century. 
That also made him presiding officer in the Senate, which has been 
controlled by the Democrats for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Democrats stripped him of most of his power in  
an organizational session presided over by Gov.-elect Don 
Siegelman, a Democrat who was still lieutenant governor at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Windom snatched the power back on Tuesday, the Legislature's  
opening day, by gaveling through new rules on a voice vote while he 
ignored the shouts and shaking fists of Democrats demanding a roll 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	One visitor to the chamber called it a ``war zone.'' Sen. Rodger  
Smitherman's 5-year-old daughter, Crystal, became so frightened by 
the screaming grown-ups that she started crying. 
</P>
<P>
	The quickly gaveled rules, among other things, allow Windom to  
appoint new committees to consider major bills and to decide which 
committee considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 17 of Windom's allies -- 12 Republicans and five  
Democrats -- did attend the Senate sessions on Wednesday and 
Thursday, that is one short of the number needed for a legal 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state constitution, the Senate has to keep trying to  
meet each day -- including Saturday and Sunday -- until a majority of 
the Senate shows up. Each day that is missed kills one of the 30 
meeting days the Legislature is allowed each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to stay out however long it takes to get our  
right restored to vote in that body,'' Barron said. ``We're 
protecting democracy and there is no price too great to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides expect the boycott to last at least through Monday,  
when a judge is scheduled to hear the Democrats' lawsuit. By that 
time, nearly one-fourth of the legislative session will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom's allies said taxpayers will tire quickly of senators  
drawing their pay and doing nothing, as well as spending taxpayer 
money on a lawsuit over Senate rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman has refused to get involved, saying, ``My job is to  
fix schools, not rules.'' But he is trying to cut Windom's budget 
by two-thirds, prompting Windom to say on Thursday: ``It's another 
indication the whole purpose has been to destroy the constitutional 
office of lieutenant governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the business of the people is on hold, including  
Siegelman's plan to create a state lottery to pay for education 
programs and college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Winton Blount sees no quick end.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to have to melt down some more,'' he said. ``Then  
they will find something in the middle.''

<HEADLINE> Dell, IBM Make $16 Billion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They won't carry labels saying ``IBM Inside,''  
but Dell Computer Corp.'s machines will soon fill up with more 
hard-disk drives, memory chips and other parts made by Big Blue. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and Dell, two of the computer industry's biggest rivals,  
announced a remarkable supply deal Thursday in which Dell agreed to 
buy $16 billion worth of equipment from IBM over the next seven 
years. The companies also arranged to jointly develop new 
technology and give each other sneak previews of future products. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech companies routinely share technology blueprints, but  
the unusually broad agreement between IBM and Dell underscores how 
intense industry pressures have grown, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is the world's biggest maker of computers, but its personal  
computer business been struggling for several years due to sluggish 
sales and price wars that have squeezed profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Dell -- the fastest-growing PC maker and the No. 2  
manufacturer behind Compaq Computer Corp. -- reported last quarter 
that its sales fell short of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM already sells parts to Dell, ``What is new is the size  
and the magnitude of the whole thing,'' said Chris Goodhue, an 
analyst with the Gartner Group research firm in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ensures steady sales for IBM while giving Dell  
consistent supplies and a potential technology edge over its 
rivals. That is key to helping Dell expand its sales beyond mainly 
desktop PCs to more powerful and profitable machines called servers 
which run business computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement also promises to shake up already delicate  
supplier-manufacturer arrangements in the industry, where companies 
seeking the lowest price frequently switch suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal computer makers buy many of the parts that go inside  
their machines from others. Intel Corp., the biggest maker of 
computer chips, arranges for its customers to post stickers on 
their boxes saying ``Intel Inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's deal with IBM allows it to continue to buy parts from  
others, but it has a strong incentive to give a large chunk of 
business to IBM. In particular, analysts say, Dell is likely to 
step up purchases of IBM's hard-disk drives that store computer 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that could steal business from other suppliers  
such as Seagate Technology Inc., the world's largest independent 
maker of computer disk drives. Seagate gets 5 percent of its sales 
from Dell, but last year lost $530 million amid a worldwide 
oversupply of drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagate shares fell 5 percent Thursday, losing $1.62 1/2 to $28 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A Seagate spokesman played down the supply move.  
</P>
<P>
	Dell ``is a key customer for us and we definitely have a  
strategic relationship with them and will continue to do so,'' said 
the spokesman, Phil Montero. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM closed up $4.25 at $171 on the NYSE. Dell's shares rose 94  
cents to $81.87 1/2 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	For IBM, the deal helps ensure a steady and increasing flow of  
business from a company that is already one of its largest 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant growth opportunity,'' said Dave Ernsberger,  
an IBM vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM likely will give Dell a nice discount on the parts, said  
Barry Jaruzelski, a partner at the Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton 
consultant firm. Company officials declined to comment on price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a safe assumption the pricing agreement must be fairly  
attractive for Dell to agree to such an expansive arrangement,'' 
Jaruzelski said.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Ship Beached Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- The New Carissa's haunting of the Oregon  
coast has reached one month, and it's not going to end any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil-laden bow section of the cargo ship has found a new  
beach to menace, running aground early Wednesday near Waldport 
after breaking free from a tug in a storm the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The 420-foot wreck drifted for 14 hours before landing at  
Waldport. It had gone out 50 miles -- and come back to land, 80 
miles farther north. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get that thing,'' said an exasperated Bill  
Milwee, salvage consultant to the ship's Japanese owners. ``She's 
not going to beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It could be several days before crews are able to try again.  
</P>
<P>
	The ship drifted aground at Coos Bay on Feb. 4, and a week later  
was set on fire with plastic explosives and napalm in an attempt to 
keep most of the 400,000 gallons of fuel from leaking out. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spectacular explosion and fire succeeded in burning away  
only about half the oil on board, and the ship split in two, 
streaking the beaches with 70,000 gallons of sticky black goo. Some 
50 birds have died from oil. 
</P>
<P>
	After abandoning an effort to pump the remaining oil out, the  
tug Sea Victory began towing the bow 200 miles out to sea, where it 
was to be sunk with gunfire in deep water. But a storm snapped the 
tow cable and the bow section was on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Waldport, a fishing town of 1,750 about 100 miles  
southwest of Portland, woke up to find the ship squatting just 
offshore from their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came in this morning and saw it sitting there, for a  
minute I wondered if I've been watching too much TV,'' said Darle 
Marquardt, manager of an auto parts store. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of the wreck's arrival, sticky tar balls began  
showing up on the beach. Authorities said it appeared to be residue 
and tanks holding up to 130,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel were 
not leaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers in yellow rain slickers fanned out near the wreck with  
shovels to scoop up the tar balls, and booms were set up to protect 
the fragile estuary around nearby Alsea Bay. Several birds and sea 
lions or seals were coated with oil, but no dead animals had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	State agriculture officials warned against harvesting mussels or  
clams along a 7-mile stretch of beach surrounding Alsea Bay because 
of possible contamination.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied hard today after two days of weak  
performance, boosted by benign economic data, strong retail sales 
reports and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 191.52 at 9,467.40, near the day's high. The 
blue-chip index more than erased the 48-point loss over the 
previous two sessions and ended above 9,400 for the first time in 
more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 18.96 to 1,246.66, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 27.72 to 2,292.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,195 down and 611 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 768.79 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
745.22 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.20 to 590.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.07 to 698.52. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.08 to 394.03.  
</P>
<P>
	The market's recovery, which extended a turnaround in technology  
shares that started late Wednesday, was ``totally justified'' by 
recent economic data and the fact that investors still have a lot 
of money to put to work, said Thomas McManus, portfolio strategist 
at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Once prices get low enough, ``people find out that there's some  
strong underlying demand,'' McManus said. ``After all, there's lots 
of cash in money-market mutual funds, and so there is a lot of 
liquidity, and earnings growth is improving, the manufacturing 
economy is improving, and it doesn't look like (Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan) Greenspan has indicated that he plans to let 
inflation run away any time in the next few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market opened stronger after IBM announced that it had  
agreed to supply Dell Computer with computer parts in a $16 
billion, seven-year pact. Analysts said the arrangement could lead 
to more highly lucrative deals for IBM, whose stock was up 4 3/8 at 
171 1/8 at the close. Dell was up 7/8 at 81 13/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and oil-service stocks rose for the second day in a row,  
after oil prices pushed above $13.25 a barrel, following reports of 
dwindling oil supplies and a temporary interruption of pumping in 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Exxon was up 2 1/8 at 67 13/16. Schlumberger was up  
3 1/4 at 55. Crude oil for April delivery was trading at $12.93 a 
barrel late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	And financial-services stocks rose as bond prices were stable  
after giving ground on Wednesday. The benchmark 30-year Treasury 
bond was about unchanged, yielding 5.69 percent. American Express 
was up 5 3/16 at 113. Salomon Smith Barney started coverage of the 
stock with a ``buy'' rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was quiet following a 10 a.m. Commerce  
Department report that new orders for U.S. factory goods rose 1.7 
percent in January to a $349.6 billion annual rate. While that was 
a record high, it was still a little under economists' expectations 
and as such, didn't raise fears of inflation in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price advances stalled on profit-taking in mid-afternoon,  
but resumed climbing in the final hour. Edward Laux, the head 
trader of listed stocks at ABN/Amro First Chicago, attributed the 
pull-back to nervousness ahead of Friday's release of February 
unemployment data. ``A lot of people thought there would be a 
reasonable spate of profit-taking in front of the unemployment 
number,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts believe the nation's unemployment rate will hold  
at its current 4.3 percent, a 29-year low. But a decline in the 
jobless rate, or a growth in the payroll census more than the 
anticipated 250,000 to 300,000, could spark a sharp sell-off in 
bonds and stocks, Laux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, retail stocks also moved higher amid strong February  
sales figures. Wal-Mart, whose February sales rose 10.3 percent at 
stores open at least a year, was up 2 at 89 3/8.

<HEADLINE>  Leafs' McCauley Taken to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs center Alyn McCauley was  
taken from the ice on a stretcher after being checked hard into the 
boards early in the third period of a game against the New Jersey 
Devils on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley was driven heavily into the end boards by Devils  
defenseman Sheldon Souray at the 6:51 mark of the third period. 
McCauley's left shoulder and head appeared to take the brunt of 
Souray's hit against the glass next to New Jersey goalie Martin 
Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley appeared to lose consciousness and lay motionless on  
the ice for several minutes. He was attended to by four emergency 
personnel including Maple Leafs team doctor Leith Douglas who 
directed the crew to fit McCauley with a neck brace. McCauley was 
lifted onto a stretcher and taken along with his fiancee to Toronto 
Western Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said that he suffered a head injury and that he  
had movement in all of his extremities. He was to spend the night 
in hospital and be re-examined Thursday. While the injury was not 
considered serious, coach Pat Quinn was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was unconscious for quite a while,'' Quinn said. ``We won't  
know anything until the evaluation is complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey was leading 3-2 at the time, and the Devils went on  
to a 5-2 victory. The game was delayed about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	It been a tough season for McCauley, who was playing in just his  
fourth game after missing 22 with a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Howland Might Take Pitt Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Howland, who led Northern Arizona to its  
first NCAA tournament appearance, is set to coach Pittsburgh, 
sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to the situation, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Thursday that Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson 
and Howland reached an agreement Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One source said Howland will be introduced as Pitt's new coach  
on Monday. Howland, who makes $110,000 to $125,000 at Northern 
Arizona, will get a five-year contract worth $375,000 to $400,000 a 
year, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland will replace Ralph Willard, whose five-year tenure at  
Pitt ended Wednesday night with a 64-51 loss to Rutgers in the 
opening round of the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland, in his fifth season at Northern Arizona, has a 78-58  
record in his only head coaching job. He led the Lumberjacks to the 
NCAA tournament last year where they threw a scare into Cincinnati 
before losing 65-62 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Arizona (20-7) finished second in the Big Sky this  
season and play in the conference tournament semifinals Friday in 
Ogden, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Howland's most impressive victories came this season when  
the Lumberjacks won at Arizona State for the first time in 44 
years. It was their first road victory over a Pac-10 team in 26 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Arizona athletic director Steve Holton said Wednesday  
night the school was in the preliminary stages of a coaching 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said Holton acknowledged that Jamie Dixon, an  
assistant at Hawaii and former assistant at Northern Arizona, has 
inquired about the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is definitely somebody we're considering,'' Holton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pitt had just seven players available for Wednesday night's  
game, a fitting close to Willard's years that were marked by player 
injuries and suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with a 63-77 record, including 14-16 this season in  
which the Panthers got into the Top 25 after early-season upsets of 
Xavier and Kentucky in the Puerto Rico Shootout.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Contraceptive Demand High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One night last summer, Anne Dill and her  
boyfriend had a terrifying experience: The condom broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out, I didn't know what to do,'' recalled Dill,  
a 21-year-old senior at Colorado State University. The next day, a 
friend told her about a form of emergency contraception -- a high 
dose of birth control pills that may prevent pregnancy if taken 
within 72 hours after sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Dill called a family-planning clinic for a prescription. Two  
weeks later, her menstrual period started. ``It was a great 
feeling,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few years ago, few women knew about the ``morning-after''  
pills. Now, due largely to Preven, the first marketed emergency 
contraception kit, it is gradually becoming more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	At family-planning clinics, inner-city medical facilities and  
college health centers, doctors say the demand for emergency 
contraception has risen dramatically in the past year. Most women 
may not know the brand Preven, but they increasingly know that 
there's help available if they have unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Some obstetricians and gynecologists are even writing Preven  
prescriptions for patients to keep on hand -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months that the $20 Preven kits were available in  
1998, about 1.3 million were sold, according to IMS Health, a 
market data firm based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Planned Parenthood clinics received 28,000 requests  
for emergency contraception last year, twice the number of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There no question that the availability of a dedicated product  
raises everyone's consciousness level for emergency 
contraception,'' said Gloria Felt, president of Planned Parenthood 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	At Penn State University's main campus in State College, Pa.,  
requests for emergency contraception rose 57 percent last year to 
148. 
</P>
<P>
	Preven is made by Barr Laboratories of Pomona , N.Y., and  
marketed by Gynetics Inc., a Somerville, N.J., company that is 
spending about $30 million this year to advertise Preven. Its 
marketing campaign includes full-page ads in most women's magazines 
with the slogan: ``The condom broke. But her life stayed intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preven pills are no different from other brand-name birth  
control pills that have been used as morning-after emergency 
contraception. But doctors say Preven is easier to use because it 
comes prepackaged in a kit that includes simple directions and a 
pregnancy test. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show Preven is 75 percent effective at preventing  
pregnancy if the pills are taken within three days of sex. By 
contrast, regular birth control pills taken properly are 99 percent 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning-after pills are different from RU-486, the French  
abortion pill, which can end a pregnancy several weeks after it has 
begun. The morning-after pills delay or prevent ovulation, meaning 
no egg enters the uterus to be fertilized. If ovulation has already 
occurred, experts theorize that the morning-after pills may prevent 
fertilization or alter the uterine lining so that a fertilized egg 
doesn't implant and develop into an embryo. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion groups vigorously protest RU-486, though they have  
been far less vocal about the morning-after pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee said in a statement that it  
takes no position on any drug or device that acts to prevent 
fertilization, though it opposes anything that acts after that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Judie Brown, president of the American Life League of  
Stafford, Va., said morning-after pills are ``nothing more than an 
early abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Preven debuted without much political fanfare, Gynetics  
has come under scrutiny for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration, which approved Preven on Sept.  
2, accused Gynetics in January of using false and misleading 
advertising because the materials ``imply that Preven is an 
alternative to regular contraceptive use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gynetics officials say they are in discussions with the agency  
about the ads' language. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also accused the company of minimizing the drug's side  
effects of nausea and vomiting. Gynetics is working on a second 
generation Preven that would reduce the nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Another company, Women's Capital Corp., of Washington, D.C.,  
last month applied to the FDA to get approval for its as-yet 
unnamed emergency contraception. Its pill would have fewer side 
effects and be more effective than Preven, according to a recent 
study in the British medical journal Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, which is known for restricting drugs into the U.S.  
market, was a catalyst for Preven. In 1995, the agency joined 
several women's health groups in seeking a company to market 
emergency contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, public health officials felt hindered in getting the  
message out about morning-after contraception as doctors worried 
about abortion politics, and patients did not know to ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Large drugmakers, such as Johnson and Johnson, parent of birth  
control pill manufacturer Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, showed no 
interest. But Gynetics, which is headed by former Ortho President 
Roderick Mackenzie jumped at the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials were driven by one goal: Reducing the more than  
2.7 million unintended pregnancies each year in the United States. 
About half are due to contraceptive failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Carolyn Westhoff, medical director of a women's clinic at  
New York Presbyterian Hospital, gives prescriptions for Preven to 
her patients even if they don't ask. ``This way, patients are 
prepared in advance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after using emergency contraception, Dill has no  
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only other option was not taking it and having an unwanted  
pregnancy. It would have been worse to have a baby that I did not 
want, or have an abortion,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, emergency contraception may become as easy to buy as  
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	A government project in Seattle that started last spring permits  
pharmacists to prescribe the pills directly to women. In nine 
months ended last December, more than 6,000 prescriptions were 
written.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Justice Blackmun Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun, author of the 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
nationwide and set off one of the most explosive political debates 
in American history, died today at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun served 24 years on the nation's highest court after  
being appointed in 1970 by President Richard M. Nixon. He retired 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died at Arlington Hospital in suburban Arlington, Va.,  
from complications following hip-replacement surgery performed nine 
days ago. He had fallen and broken his hip at home a day before the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lifelong Republican was considered a staunch conservative in  
his early days on the court. By the time he retired, he was 
considered its most liberal justice, but he has told friends the 
court's politics had changed more than his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun often cast liberal votes in cases pitting individual  
liberties against governmental authority. But he generally voted 
against expanding the rights of criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a champion of maintaining a strict separation between  
church and state, 
</P>
<P>
	But towering above all else in Blackmun's high court tenure was  
his role in the 1973 decision and subsequent abortion rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	His authorship of Roe vs. Wade made him the most vilified  
Supreme Court member in history. He received more than 60,000 
pieces of ``hate mail'' because of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters called him a murderer and a butcher. They compared  
him to the Nazi overseers of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun insisted on reading all such mail. ``I want to know  
what the people who wrote are thinking,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1983 interview with The Associated Press on the eve of his  
most famous decision's 10-year anniversary, Blackmun repeated the 
phrase ``author of the abortion decision'' slowly and softly. ``We 
all pick up tabs,'' he said. ``I'll carry this one to my grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of stopping just short of reversing Roe vs. Wade,  
the court in 1992 reaffirmed, by a 5-4 vote, the 1973 ruling's 
central holding -- that women have a constitutional right to end 
their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	A triumphant Blackmun wrote that the victory was good law only  
as long as the current court was intact. But President Clinton's 
election and Justice Byron R. White's decision to retire before 
Blackmun lessened the anticipated impact Blackmun's departure would 
have on legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	When appointing Blackmun, Nixon called him a ``strict  
constructionist,'' a term defined by Nixon aides as a judge who 
leaned toward interpreting existing law rather than making new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was Nixon's third choice to fill the vacancy created  
when Justice Abe Fortas resigned under fire for having accepted a 
$20,000 fee from the family of a financier who went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected Nixon's nominations of two federal appeals  
court judges, Clement Haynsworth of Greenville, S.C., and G. 
Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, who had been a member of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals since 1959, was confirmed by a unanimous Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In his early years on the high court, Blackmun was derided for  
what legal scholars perceived as his dependence on fellow 
Minnesotan and longtime friend Warren E. Burger, the chief justice 
who had been appointed by Nixon a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was called ``Hip Pocket Harry'' and ``The Minnesota  
Twin'' in print. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end of his first decade on the court, Blackmun had  
established himself as an independent force whose vote often was a 
critical one in close cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun also emerged in a new role -- the justice most intent on  
forcing the court to come to grips with the realities of the 
problems it was asked to resolve and with the real-world effects of 
those resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinions often portrayed those realities with passionate  
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court in 1993 ruled that U.S. authorities need not give  
hearings before seizing and returning Haitians who had fled their 
homeland by boats, Blackmun was the lone dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They demand only that the United States, land of refugees and  
guardian of freedom, cease forcibly driving them back to detention, 
abuse and death,'' he wrote. ``That is a modest plea ... We should 
not close our ears to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the court in 1989 disallowed a battered boy's lawsuit  
against the child-custody officials who placed him with his abusive 
father, Blackmun again dissented. ``Poor Joshua,'' he wrote. 
``Victim of repeated attacks by an irresponsible, bullying, 
cowardly and intemperate father and abandoned by (officials) who 
placed him in a dangerous situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before his retirement, Blackmun repudiated his  
career-long acceptance of capital punishment and declared himself 
opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death-penalty experiment has failed. I no longer shall  
tinker with the machinery of death,'' Blackmun wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote for the court when it ruled in 1985 that Congress has  
almost unlimited power to force state and local governments to 
comply with federal laws -- including those requiring overtime pay 
for more than 40-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun also wrote the 1991 decision that said employers may  
not bar women from certain hazardous jobs just to protect fetuses. 
A 1984 opinion he wrote required states to offer ``clear and 
convincing'' evidence of parental unfitness before permanently 
severing all parent-child ties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1977 decision, Blackmun wrote for the court that a blanket  
ban on lawyer advertisements violated free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was born in Nashville, Ill., but was raised in St. Paul  
and Minneapolis. He and Burger first met as kindergarten pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	Their friendship was long lasting, and Blackmun served as best  
man in Burger's 1933 wedding. But on the high court, differences 
between the two jurists strained those boyhood ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun won a scholarship to Harvard, where he earned highest  
honors as a mathematics major. He then went to Harvard's law 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	After practicing law in the Twin Cities for nearly 20 years,  
Blackmun served as general counsel of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minn., from 1950 to 1959. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed 
him to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and three daughters.

<HEADLINE> MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson's first two innings on the  
mound for the Arizona Diamondbacks were routine by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the young University of Arizona batters who faced him, they  
were 31 pitches that are impossible to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like the Eiffel Tower because I'm only  
5-foot-7,'' said 19-year-old Keoni DeRenne, one of two batters who 
hit a ball into fair territory against the Big Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's immense. It was just awesome. Hopefully, they got it on  
videotape because I'd like to show it to my kids someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his trademark glare, at 6-foot-10 towering on the mouned,  
Johnson methodically struck out four of the six batters he faced 
Wednesday. The other two grounded out to shortstop.

<P>
	Erik Torres struck out on three pitches, and was thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have the opportunity to face Randy Johnson, it's like  
a dream come true, it's like a childhood dream,'' he said. ``Yeah, 
three pitches, but those three pitches meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was more or less satisfied with his effort. Of his 31  
pitches, five were call strikes, seven were swinging strikes, six 
were fouls, 11 were balls and two were hit in play. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a couple of breaking balls and change-ups, but mostly  
four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed the breaking ball wasn't there, but  
I'm always that way in spring training,'' Johnson said. ``I just 
went out there to work on my mechanics and my arm strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Diamondbacks, strolled to the mound at Tucson Electric Park under 
bright sunshine in 80-degree weather. In the distance beyond left 
field, the Catalina Mountains provided a scenic backdrop to what 
amounted to a historic moment for the second-year franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks purple was the fourth major-league uniform  
Johnson has worn. He started his career with Montreal and spent 9 1/2 
seasons with the Seattle Mariners. For a half-season last year, he 
on the Houston Astros. Now he's the marquee addition to a 
high-priced rotation that could vault Arizona into National League 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Johnson said, ``not nearly exciting as the  
first start I make in L.A. (the April 5 season opener against Kevin 
Brown in Dodger Stadium) or probably even more so when I make my 
first start at Bank One. But it's going to be an exciting four 
years for this organization and for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't want to hit anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get worried if it's a guy up there making millions of  
dollars, let alone a young kid trying to get a college education,'' 
he said. ``He might be president of the United States someday. You 
never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks eventually won the game 10-2. It was, Johnson  
joked, a little revenge for other games he'd pitched against the 
Wildcats long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Johnson faced the University of Arizona, he walked  
six and was shelled for six runs on 13 hits in a 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1985. He was no Big Unit then, just an extremely tall,  
extremely wild junior at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting back at U of A after all those beatings I used to  
take at USC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in baseball on Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland Indians outfielder Mark Whiten will miss at least  
two weeks of spring training with a stress fracture of his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, expected to open the season as a reserve, complained  
about pain in the foot and underwent tests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Relief pitcher Jeff Shaw couldn't wait any longer for the  
birth of his third child and arrived at the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
camp at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was given permission to report after wife Julie delivered,  
which was supposed to be Feb. 15, then Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie's still healthy, the baby's not in danger, that's the  
most important thing. . . . This one's being stubborn,'' Shaw said. 
The Shaws have been told they are going to have a son. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ron Wright's back appears to be all right. Wright, who missed  
most of last season with a back injury, hit two home runs in a 
Pittsburgh Pirates intrasquad game at Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Pirates are still waiting for outfielder Jose  
Guillen, stuck in the Dominican Republic while awaiting an entry 
visa into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The stars at the St. Louis Cardinals' Jupiter, Fla., camp  
weren't players. ``The real heroes were the groundskeepers,'' 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``They told us a storm was coming 
between 12:30 and 1 p.m., so we moved everything up an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although rain cut short two intrasquad games, there was enough  
time for a 9-8 contest on a field where the wind was blowing out. 
The game on the field where it was blowing in was 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Port St. Lucie, Fla., the New York Mets assigned former  
catcher John Stearns as an advance scout during the regular season. 
Stearns will report on the tendencies of both pitchers and hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Toronto Blue Jays signed six players, including pitcher  
Chris Carpenter and outfielder Shannon Stewart, who agreed to 
three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-baseman Tom Evans, utility player Felipe Crespo and  
right-hander Nerio Rodriguez all signed one-year deals, and 
reliever Robert Person's contract was renewed. That means the Jays' 
entire 40-man roster is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter's and Stewart's deals are believed to be worth  
more than $3 million. It's the first time the Blue Jays have signed 
long-term deals with players with fewer than two years of 
major-league service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter and Stewart said they appreciated the Blue Jays`  
precedent-setting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It`s good for me,'' said Stewart, 25, who batted .279 and  
stole 51 bases in 144 games last season. ``It gives me security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, 23, was 12-7 and had a 4.37 earned-run average in 33  
games last season, 24 of them starts. He was scheduled to start 
against Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and the New York Yankees in 
Toronto's first exhibition game today.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Demands Apology From Moran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp demanded an apology Thursday from  
a congressman who questioned why she is being allowed to return to 
a $94,098-a-year ``makeshift job'' at the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Rep. Jim Moran's comments ``inaccurate, offensive ...  
unseemly,'' Mrs. Tripp's spokesman said she risked her career by 
telling prosecutor Kenneth Starr that Monica Lewinsky was 
pressuring her to commit perjury in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday, Moran told Defense Secretary William  
Cohen that ``one particular employee, who has been paid ... to do 
nothing ... spent much of her year listening to some stupid 
adolescent talk about her sex life. So you've rehired her in some 
makeshift job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had cut many area civilian defense jobs in the name of  
government streamlining, noted Moran, D-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Tripp has had a distinguished 19-year government career  
and, like all federal employees, she had a legal obligation to 
report knowledge of possible crimes,'' said her spokesman, Philip 
Coughter. ``At a staggering personal cost, she fulfilled that 
obligation. ... She awaits the congressman's apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon instructed Mrs. Tripp to work from home for the  
past year. She was brought back to work Wednesday as a public 
affairs specialist at the Defense Department's Manpower Data Center 
in Rosslyn, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	She was director of the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference at  
the Pentagon when she triggered the investigation of the 
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky by giving Starr's office 
her taped phone calls with the young woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee  
on Clinton's fiscal 2000 defense budget, Cohen indicated he would 
respond in writing to Moran, who represents the northern Virginia 
suburbs of Washington, where many Pentagon workers live.

<HEADLINE> Crop Subsidies Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The farm economy is so bad that the federal  
government will pay $3 billion in subsidies for 1998 crops and even 
more for this year under a program that was once rarely used, an 
Agriculture Department official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidies, known as ``loan deficiency payments,'' are  
triggered only when commodity prices fall to very low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department so far has paid $2.2 billion for last  
year's crops, 100 times as much as the year before, with farmers 
expected to make additional claims of $1 billion for commodities 
still in storage. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA predicts subsidies for this year's crops will reach $4  
billion to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has crept up on us very, very swiftly,'' August  
Schumacher, undersecretary for farm and foreign agricultural 
services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	It has become one of the USDA's biggest programs, rivaling the  
$5.6 billion in annual ``market transition'' payments that go to 
all producers under the 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the subsidies has overwhelmed USDA's county offices.  
Some are weeks and even months behind in processing requests at a 
time when growers also are signing up for disaster aid and other 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has turned out to be a super thing,'' Minnesota farmer  
Gerald Tumbleson said of the subsidy program. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog of applications has critics saying that USDA cut too  
deeply into its staff in an effort to streamline the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House last week asked Congress for $43 million to hire  
3,000 temporary employees. The department has 10,000 workers in its 
county offices, down 34 percent since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loan deficiency payments are invaluable to pay off debts  
and to ensure lenders of a positive cash flow,'' said Rep. Bill 
Barrett, a Nebraska Republican who chairs the House general farm 
commodities subcommittee. ``Getting this income to our producers 
should be a No. 1 priority at the department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program was created for cotton and rice in 1985 and expanded  
to wheat, corn, soybeans and other crops in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn has been averaging as little as $1.80 bushel in recent  
months, compared to $2.71 two years ago. Soybean prices are down to 
$4.60 a bushel from $6.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $789 million has gone to corn growers for this year's crop,  
with another $506 million for soybeans and $434 million for wheat.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Doesn't Get Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Ricans who got a rerun of a  
Ted Koppel special instead of an interview with Monica Lewinsky 
were seething Thursday, claiming the blackout was an example of 
their second-class status as U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky's interview with Barbara Walters was billed in  
full-page newspaper advertisements by the local cable TV firm. But 
a terse message Wednesday night announced a blackout due to 
unspecified restrictions, and the special on crime and punishment 
was aired instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a boycott of the Puerto Rican people! As American  
citizens we have the right to know Monica Lewinsky's version,'' 
saleswoman Maribel Rodriguez, 38, complained on a local radio talk 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lack of respect!'' fumed Hermes Ayala, a 24-year-old  
student. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackout actually stemmed from contract issues, but that did  
little to calm many Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's 3.8 million residents are U.S. citizens and serve  
in the military, but they don't pay federal taxes, can't vote for 
U.S. president and have no vote in Congress -- an arrangement many 
view as colonial. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the idea of petitioning Congress to become the 51st state  
has been repeatedly rejected, most recently in December. Many 
Puerto Ricans fear statehood would dilute their Hispanic culture. 
</P>
<P>
	All the local stations broadcast in Spanish, and none are U.S.  
network affiliates. But U.S. networks, including Walters' ABC, are 
available through cable TV outlets that receive signals beamed to a 
satellite from mainland network affiliates. With ABC, that is 
Nashville, Tenn.'s WKRN-TV, received via an intermediary, New York 
City-based Prime Time 24. 
</P>
<P>
	WKRN general manager Mike Sechrist said ABC told the station not  
to beam the interview to satellite -- and thus to Puerto Rico -- 
because of ``the deal they did with the Lewinsky people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Thursday to Cable TV of Greater San Juan, Prime  
Time 24 marketing director Denise Haertel wrote that the company 
had ``worked until late in the evening'' in a failed bid to 
convince ABC not to pull the program off satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite Business News, a newsletter of the satellite industry,  
wrote Thursday that almost a million satellite viewers in the U.S. 
mainland also were affected and charged that the move was ABC's 
``most aggressive participation in the broadcasting industry's 
campaign against the satellite industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told The Associated Press that  
ABC had no choice in the matter because it only had rights to 
distribute the interview in North America. Allowing it to go on the 
satellite might have meant that non-qualifying areas would have 
also received it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Murphy admitted she had not even been aware  
``that any cable outlet in Puerto Rico is entitled to our 
programming.''

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Bill Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic congressman wants to lift the  
federal ban on the medical use of marijuana in states where voters 
have approved it as a treatment for pain, nausea or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do to get marijuana into the hands of people  
suffering is to set aside the federal controls on marijuana, so the 
states can determine this issue for themselves,'' Rep. Barney Frank 
of Massachusetts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank has proposed legislation that would reclassify marijuana  
as a Schedule II drug, meaning that it could be prescribed by 
doctors under certain conditions, just as cocaine and other 
controlled substances are. Prescriptions for such drugs are subject 
to federal and state review. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside the federal ban on marijuana in those  
states -- Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and Nevada 
-- where voters have permitted medical use of the drug. The bill 
would not affect states that have not permitted such use. 
</P>
<P>
	Although marijuana users with a demonstrated medical need don't  
face state prosecution in those six states, they still face 
possible federal prosecution, Frank said. Doctors, too, may shy 
away from prescribing the drug for fear of losing their right to 
prescribe other federally controlled substances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also require the federal government to supply  
marijuana for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank has pressed the issue twice before, and he is not hopeful  
that his latest proposal will pass the Republican-controlled 106th 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the House adopted by 310-93 vote a resolution by Rep.  
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that said marijuana is a dangerous and 
addictive drug and should not be legalized for medical use. 
Supporters said efforts to legalize the drug for medical use send 
the wrong message to teen-agers, and that scientific testing has 
not proved a medical use for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	But the New England Journal of Medicine has editorialized in  
favor of medical marijuana, and the American Medical Association 
has urged the National Institutes of Health to support more 
research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Canada's health minister authorized clinical  
trials to determine if marijuana is a useful medicine for people 
suffering from terminal illnesses and other painful conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	And a report from the International Drug Control Board concluded  
last month that in-depth and impartial scientific studies should be 
conducted into marijuana's possible medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the six states that allow medical uses of  
marijuana, 11 states have reduced the possession of small amounts 
of the drug to a minor civil offense, similar to a traffic 
violation. They are Alaska, Oregon, California, Minnesota, 
Colorado, Nebraska, Mississippi, Ohio, North Carolina, New York and 
Maine.

<HEADLINE> Europe Angered at U.S. Trade Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union filed a complaint against the  
United States before the World Trade Organization Thursday, 
claiming U.S. moves to impose sanctions in the trans-Atlantic 
banana fight violate global trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, European targets of the sanctions, from prosciutto  
producers to cashmere companies, accused the United States of 
trying to destroy their industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration notified U.S. importers that they are  
liable for hefty tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods in 
retaliation for European barriers on banana imports. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed to stand, the tariffs would double the cost of the  
targeted goods, pricing them out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has asked the WTO to invoke a special process under which  
the United States and the 15-nation trading bloc would have 20 days 
to try to settle their differences. If they fail, the EU could then 
ask the WTO to rule on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade Minister Brian Wilson called the U.S. action  
``potentially catastrophic'' for the British cashmere industry, 
which is concentrated in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people there are saddened and utterly bewildered that the  
United States should attack them in this way over a dispute which 
has absolutely nothing to do with them or their industry,'' said 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Italy's consortium of Parma ham producers, Stefano  
Fanti, accused the United States of unfairly targeting Italy to 
force it to pressure the EU to modify its banana import system. 
Some 98 percent of prosciutto in the United States comes from 
Italy, and 94 percent is Parma ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Products from 13 of the EU's 15 nations risk being hit by the  
tariffs. These include Italian and Greek pecorino cheese, French 
handbags, German coffee makers and British biscuits. The 
Netherlands and Denmark have been spared because they sided with 
the United States in the trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington decided to implement the tariffs to punish the  
Europeans for not doing enough to respect a World Trade 
Organization verdict last year which ruled against the EU's 
favorable treatment of a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific 
region countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU says it approved new import regulations to comply with  
WTO demands, but the United States and Central and South American 
banana producers claim the EU's banana import regime is still 
discriminatory.

later years, researchers say. Among 414 men studied from middle age 
into their 70s, even moderately high blood pressure -- and to a 
lesser extent, smoking, drinking and diabetes -- were linked to 
faster aging of the brain. ``If you have risk factors and don't 
treat them, your brain will be a decade older when you hit 70,'' 
said lead author Dr. Charles DeCarli, director of the Alzheimer's

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Baseball commissioner Bud Selig on  
Thursday canceled the owners' meeting scheduled for March 16-18, 
delaying consideration of the proposed sale of the Kansas City 
Royals until at least June. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's decision had been expected because baseball's lawyers  
have not completed their investigation of Miles Prentice's group, 
which in November agreed to buy the team for $75 million. No other 
major issues needed a decision, so Selig called off the meeting, 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked for them to approve it the day we submitted  
it,'' Prentice said. ``I'm disappointed in the sense we haven't 
been approved, but I understand the nature of the process. I have 
to continue to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most baseball sales, especially those involving partnerships  
with a large number of limited partners, take six to nine months 
for approval once an agreement has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the death of founding owner Ewing Kauffman's death, the  
Royals have been run by a board of directors led by Wal-Mart 
executive David Glass. Kansas City hasn't finished first since 
winning the World Series in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice's group includes such local celebrities as golf pro Tom  
Watson and millionaire banker R. Crosby Kemper Jr. and has more 
than 40 investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Logistically it just presents more information they have to  
review,'' Prentice said. ``The size of the group will ultimately be 
its strength.''

<HEADLINE> Smashing Pumpkins Sued for Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- An Ivy League music professor whose  
taste runs more to Gregorian chants than rock 'n' roll claims a 
Smashing Pumpkins concert damaged his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jeffery, a Princeton University music historian, alleges  
he has hearing loss in his left ear and ringing in both ears as a 
result of the concert, the New Haven Register reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffery says the Jan. 25, 1997 performance at New Haven Coliseum  
was his first time at a live rock concert. He says he went with his 
young son. 
</P>
<P>
	The earplugs Jeffery wore did not protect him from the excessive  
noise, according to his lawsuit against the band, the city and 
coliseum. He contends the music exceeded a safe decibel level that 
the defendants ``knew or should have known'' about. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks $15,000 in damages. It also names as  
defendants Smashing Pumpkins members Billy Corgan, James Iha, and 
D'Arcy Wretzky-Brown, and Virgin Records.

<HEADLINE> US-EU Banana Trade Hassle Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If a battle over bananas wasn't bad enough,  
the United States is also fighting with Europe over hormones in 
beef and jetliner noise. The disputes are threatening a 
full-fledged trade war between the world's two largest trading 
partners with consumers likely to be the biggest losers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration insisted Thursday that in the cases  
involving bananas and beef, the United States is fighting to uphold 
an important principle that countries must abide by decisions of 
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva group set up four years 
ago to arbitrate disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	But some U.S. trade experts and European officials believe  
what's really behind the increased tension is the administration's 
need to talk tough at a time when the global economic crisis is 
driving America's trade deficit to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. importers who have found their products on a retaliation  
list in the banana fight say the ultimate losers will be their 
companies and U.S. consumers who soon will be unable to find their 
favorite European import on American store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are caught in the crossfire of something that has  
absolutely nothing to do with us,'' said Brenda Jacobs, an attorney 
for the U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said Wednesday the imposition of 100 percent  
tariffs on $520 million of European imports, effectively doubling 
their price, was intended to block those goods from the U.S. market 
in retaliation for $520 million in lost sales U.S. banana companies 
claim they've suffered because of unfair European trade barriers 
which discriminate in favor of bananas grown in their former 
Caribbean colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration delayed the actual collection of the higher  
tariffs until the WTO gives the go-ahead to impose sanctions, but 
made importers liable to pay the increased duties starting March 3. 
That will have the effect of shutting the goods out of the U.S. 
market immediately, importers said, because no company can run the 
risk of a product suddenly doubling in price. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to textiles, the list includes Louis Vuitton  
handbags from France, Parma ham and feta cheese from Greece, France 
and Italy, German coffee makers and British sweet biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, U.S. Customs  
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his agents will be able to 
administer the complicated tariffs even though his agency had been 
``notified fairly late in the game'' by the U.S. trade 
representative and was having to scramble to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also is holding out the threat of trade  
sanctions in a separate fight with Europe over hormones in beef. 
U.S. trade spokesman Jay Ziegler said talks Thursday with the EU 
``did not achieve any substantial progress'' and the administration 
is aiming for publication by mid-March of a preliminary list of 
European imports to be targeted in the beef dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	American beef producers say they are losing $250 million  
annually in sales because of Europe's ban on using the growth 
hormones in beef. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an another example of rising tensions, the House this  
week voted to ban flights of Europe's supersonic Concorde from the 
United States in retaliation for a ruling that would ban many older 
American jetliners from landing in Europe. U.S. officials say that 
rule is designed to boost the sales of aircraft engines made by 
European companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the banana and beef cases, the administration said a key  
issue is that the EU refuses to abide by WTO rulings, which found 
Europe's banana import rules and its ban on hormone-treated beef 
violations of world trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO's credibility is at stake,'' said White House  
spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	But EU Trade Minister Leon Brittan charged that the Clinton  
administration's decisions are driven by ``internal political 
pressures from American companies and congressmen.'' He warned that 
the EU is considering its own retaliation against American products 
if the U.S. tariffs aren't revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade experts said they also believe the administration's  
tougher stance is driven in large part by a trade deficit that 
ballooned to a record $169 billion last year. It's expected to 
climb even higher this year, triggering rising protectionist 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination,  
Pat Buchanan said trade policies will be a major issue in his 
campaign. Four years ago, he warned the United States would make a 
mistake to turn over its economic sovereignty to the new WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration is feeling the burden to show that the WTO  
is a good investment,'' said Greg Mastel, trade economist at the 
Economic Strategy Institute. ``It was sold as an automatic and 
powerful body to resolve trade issues, and Europe's refusal to 
abide by adverse rulings is showing it is not very automatic or 
very powerful.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Hits Higher Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, kicking his  
presidential campaign into higher gear, will visit Iowa and New 
Hampshire on the same day this month. 
</P>
<P>
	That swing on March 15 will be followed by a separate trip to  
Iowa later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time we will do Iowa and New Hampshire as  
campaign stops and the first time that we know of that we're going 
to do both on the same day,'' said spokeswoman Patricia Ewing. Gore 
has repeatedly traveled to the early primary and caucus states, but 
called it official travel and billed taxpayers for the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign will pay a portion of his political travels.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has formed a campaign committee and opened  
offices in Washington, but will not formally announce his candidacy 
until late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Thursday he is seriously considering  
a challenge to Gore for the Democratic Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I'm reluctant to make that commitment, the pressure to  
run is rather intense,'' he said during an interview at his 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if he ran it would be to win the nomination, but argued  
that he could help the party even if he lost. He might even make 
Gore a better candidate in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic base has to be aroused, inspired and broadened  
to win,'' Jackson said. ``And maybe a good primary campaign makes 
him a better general campaigner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to decide this spring. Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New  
Jersey is Gore's only announced rival. 
</P>

	Texas Gov. George Bush's presidential exploratory committee will  
be headed by a diverse and high-profile list of Republicans, aides 
said. They are keeping the list secret until Bush's news conference 
Sunday, though the group is said to include former Secretary of 
State George Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has invited national reporters to Austin, Texas, for a news  
conference unveiling his committee. Several members of the 
committee will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will file its papers with the Federal Election  
Commission on Monday, allowing Bush to raise and spend money as he 
decides whether to seek the presidency. Associates expect him to 
run, though a final decision and formal announcement are several 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, several sources close to Bush, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, say his political director is expected to 
be Maria Cino, former executive director at the Republican House 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A potential Bush rival, millionaire businessman Steve Forbes,  
has a press secretary in mind for his yet-to-be-announced campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Juleanne Glover Weiss, senior policy adviser for Republican Sen.  
John Ashcroft of Missouri, will be Forbes' top spokeswoman if, as 
expected, he seeks the GOP nomination, a source close to Forbes 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft toyed with the idea of running for president, but  
backed out at the last minute. Weiss, 30, has been publicity 
director for the conservative Weekly Standard magazine and 
legislative director for the Project for the Republican Future. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP hopeful, conservative activist Gary Bauer, says he  
has raised $750,000 in 30 days and has qualified for federal 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate must show $5,000 in eligible contributions from more  
than 20 states to qualify. ``Gary has strong support -- financially 
and politically -- all across the country,'' spokesman Tim Goeglein 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is still far short of the $15 to $20 million that most  
financial experts say will be needed to compete in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Being a political consultant was never enough for Tom Cole. The  
49-year-old is Oklahoma's secretary of state, top adviser for Gov. 
Frank Keating and liaison with leaders of the legislature's 
Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he will be the new chief of staff for Republican Party  
Chairman Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My loss is definitely the RNC's gain,'' said Keating, chairman  
of the Republican Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He appointed Cole secretary of state in 1995, after his first  
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole heads a highly successful Oklahoma-based political  
consulting firm, Cole-Hargrave Snodgrass and Associates. He was 
executive director of the GOP House campaign committee from 1991 to 
1993, an Oklahoma state senator from 1988 to 1991 and state party 
chairman from 1985 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson has been under pressure to strengthen the party's  
political operation after weaker-than-expected results in 
November's midterm elections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Hurricane Mitch Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress to provide  
enhanced trade benefits to countries of Central America and the 
Caribbean to help them recover from the devastation of Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal was announced today -- four days  
before the president travels to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala to inspect the damage from the storm that killed more 
than 9,000 people and left millions more homeless. Clinton has 
asked Congress for $956 million to help rebuild the region. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the new measure  
would eliminate U.S. tariffs on certain textile and apparel 
products. The benefits would apply from Oct. 1, 1999 to June 30, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill would authorize the president to offer enhanced,  
temporary trade benefits to Caribbean Basin countries,'' Berger 
said. He said the benefits would help Caribbean and Central 
American countries ``recover from the serious damage'' of Hurriance 
Mitch and encourage them to adopt policies that could pave the way 
for their participation in a broader free trade agreement in the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Echaveste, Clinton's deputy chief of staff, said that  
Central American leaders, when they met with Clinton in December, 
said that trade concessions were ``at the top of their list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the proposed benefits were a step toward giving the  
Caribbean and Central American nations parity with Mexico, which 
enjoys trade breaks under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
``It's a part of it, it's not full, it's not NAFTA,'' Echaveste 
said. ``It gets closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an attempt to get closer to conditions that exist in  
NAFTA, not just for textiles but also the non-textile areas,'' said 
Peter Romero, acting assistant secretary of State for Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it also was intended to ``make it more attractive for  
investors to rethink Central America and the Caribbean in terms of 
particularly textile investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House press secretary Joe Lockart said ``there  
is a general concern'' about the Senate's handling of the Central 
American relief bill. He said some senators were trying to use this 
bill to ``set up a political fight here,'' much like they did with 
legislation for the International Monetary Fund bailout last year 
and the 1997 flood relief bill. He urged lawmakers not to ``head 
down a partisan path'' on this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an emergency. The need is real. The need is  
desperate,'' Lockhart said. ``These are issues that should be above 
the partisan fighting here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the Hurricane Mitch was the worst natural disaster  
ever to hit the Western Hemisphere. The countries suffered losses 
estimated at between $7 billion to $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Peters Hits Bull's Eye in `Annie' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Anybody can miss a shot,'' sneers sharpshooter  
Frank Butler, the macho leading man of Buffalo Bill's Wild West 
Show. ``I can't,'' chirps confident challenger Annie Oakley, a 
little lady not much bigger than the rifle she totes. 
</P>
<P>
	Durn tootin' she can't -- especially when she is played by  
Bernadette Peters, who hits the bull's eye every time she is on 
stage in a new, aggressively reworked revival of ``Annie Get Your 
Gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No question about it. Peters demonstrates real star power in  
this Irving Berlin musical, now on view at Broadway's Marquis 
Theater. Whether dressed in buckskin and fringe or a frilly ball 
gown, the actress delivers a performance that lifts ``Annie'' out 
of the ordinary and into musical-comedy sublime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Annie Get Your Gun'' is a vehicle show, constructed in 1946  
around the mega-talents of its original star, Ethel Merman. 
Berlin's music and lyrics are brilliant: simple and direct, yet 
funny or heartfelt when required. Its musty book, originally by 
Herbert and Dorothy Fields, is, well, serviceable, a chance for the 
audience to catch its breath between musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The score is an astonishing parade of hits: ``Doin' What Comes  
Natur'lly,'' ``You Can't Get a Man with a Gun,'' ``They Say It's 
Wonderful,'' ``Lost in His Arms,'' ``I Got the Sun in the 
Morning,'' ``Anything You Can Do'' and that theater anthem to end 
all theater anthems, ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peters is not Merman, and you don't want her to be, but she is  
that rarity on stage today -- a genuine Broadway star. Movies and 
television don't do her justice. From her first entrance -- shooting 
the bird off the hat of the play's nominal villainess -- Peters 
injects her own considerable personality into the musical. 
</P>
<P>
	Her backwoods drawl may be more Granny Clampett than Annie  
Oakley, but she is having so much fun, you go along with her 
hayseed impersonation. Even better, Peters knows how to handle 
romance, something Merman never was quite comfortable doing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Merman's vocal delivery was pure foghorn belt, Peters', while  
strong, is more sly, with a hint of sexiness. For example, alone on 
stage and against a backdrop of twinkling stars, Peters delivers a 
meltingly sweet version of ``Lost in His Arms.'' You can hear 
theatergoers sighing their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Director-choreographer Graciela Daniele and her team work  
furiously to disguise the fact that there is not much of a story on 
stage. It is almost as if they were afraid to let the audience hear 
the creaks and groans of the original tale. 
</P>
<P>
	Even designer Tony Walton gets in on the camouflage act with his  
cleverly designed circus set. Daniele has placed the show within a 
show, with Buffalo Bill himself cranking up the curtain and 
announcing that the center ring of his tent will feature the 
romantic tale of Frank Butler and Annie Oakley. It's more of an 
intrusion than a device, particularly with actors announcing scene 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Stone has revised the original while adding more generic  
jokes that the cast puts over with tongue-in-cheek broadness. What 
he hasn't done is beef up the plot, an anemic rivalry between Annie 
and Frank, a competition that continues for two acts despite 
protestations of true love between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wopat plays Frank in a genial, non-threatening manner. He  
has a strong voice, but there's no doubt that this is Peters' show. 
The fine supporting cast, including Ron Holgate as Buffalo Bill, 
Valerie Wright as Annie's rival and Peter Marx as general factotum 
Charlie Davenport, offer enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniele and her co-choreographer, Jeff Calhoun, have concocted  
the busiest dance routines on Broadway. Some of the choreography is 
odd, even weird, particularly in a jazz-tinged rendition by Wopat 
and the boys of ``My Defenses Are Down'' that strains to be 
gymnastic just for the sake of being different. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peters disappears from view, the show sags. The  
undernourished subplot involving the ingenue and her half-Indian 
boyfriend threatens to halt the show. Poor Andrew Palermo and 
Nicole Ruth Snelson are saddled with two Berlin songs -- ``I'll 
Share It All With You'' and ``Who Do You Love, I Hope'' -- that 
remain firmly in the second tier of the master's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, there is that collection of Berlin standards that  
keeps on coming, no matter what the plot does or does not do. And 
even better than that, the show has Peters to sing them -- and make 
them shine like new.

<HEADLINE> Military Pilots Describe Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not just the high pay offered by airlines  
that is coaxing pilots to leave the armed services, a group of 
disillusioned military pilots told a congressional hearing 
Thursday. Also to blame, they said, are the military's poor working 
conditions, constant deployments overseas, broken equipment and 
routines hard on family life. 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of bonus money would keep me on active duty,''  
Marine Capt. James P. Clay told a House Armed Services 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The retiring Harrier jet pilot based at the Cherry Point Marine  
Corps Air Station in North Carolina cited ``low morale and low 
flight hours.'' He said it was ``not uncommon to see days when 50 
percent of the aircraft are not ready for flight.'' He said he gets 
barely 10 hours of flight time per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Lt. Cmdr. Leon W. Smith, who flies E-2C radar planes from  
Norfolk, Va., testified he's leaving in April after 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hangar I've spent most of 11 years working out of -- it's  
pathetic: rats, mice, lead paint, asbestos, no air conditioning,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee on military personnel is studying the  
Pentagon's pilot retention problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy says it was 1,153 pilots short of its 7,712 positions  
last year, a 15 percent shortfall. The Army was down 113 pilots, 
about 11 percent of its 1,059 requirement. And the Air Force 
reported a shortage of 648 pilots, almost 5 percent of its 13,986 
requirement. The Marine Corps said it had no shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	``In simple terms, for every two pilots that walk in, three walk  
out,'' said Lt. Gen. Donald Peterson, Air Force deputy chief of 
staff. The Air Force ended last year 648 pilots short, a shortage 
that could grow to 2,000 in three years, he said. He cited the 
abundance of civilian jobs and ``robust airline hiring'' as leading 
culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department contends that every time a veteran pilot  
walks out the door, it costs taxpayers $5.9 million in lost 
training time and experience. 
</P>
<P>
	But subcommittee Chairman Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said the military  
will never be able to compete with the airlines in terms of salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilot retention is not just about money,'' he said. ``Pilots  
are leaving the military for the same varied and complex reasons 
that all the other people, both enlistee and officer, are leaving 
the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said pay and benefit increases proposed by  
President Clinton, and an even more generous package approved by 
the Senate, would help some. Even so, they predicted the situation 
would get worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its grumbling, the Pentagon itself could do a better job  
in keeping its pilots, Christopher Jehn of the Congressional Budget 
Office told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm completely puzzled,'' Jehn said. ``The services claim they  
are in the midst of a crisis, but aren't using bonuses to the 
maximum.'' For instance, he said the services can pay pilots up to 
$25,000 per year of experience in special annual bonuses, but the 
Air Force pays only up to $22,000, the Navy up to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A CBO study of the pilot shortage concluded it ``may not be as  
large or as daunting as some observers have suggested,'' Jehn said. 
He said the services are counting as shortages many desk-job 
positions held by pilots who do not fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth Engasser Jr., an Apache  
helicopter pilot stationed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, 
Ga., cited long tours in South Korea, Germany, Bosnia and Kuwait. 
He recalled desert stays in tents with 140-degree temperatures 
while ``Air Force pilots live in air conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Lt. Louis J. Schager, an F-14 jet fighter pilot based at  
the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, Va., described 
himself as ``in the minority of late'' because he was staying in 
the service despite the long tours, aging aircraft and dwindling 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most aviators will do their jobs for less compensation, but  
they won't do their jobs for less parts,'' he said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is taking bids for  
all or part of its international tobacco business and could make a 
decision by the end of next week, one analyst who follows the 
industry says. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
Wednesday he thinks RJR would like to be able to include a deal 
involving the international tobacco business in the proxy material 
being prepared for shareholders in advance of the May 12 annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to show shareholders they are building value  
and have found a way of enhancing the value of their holdings,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for proxy materials is March 12. That is the same  
deadline investor Carl Icahn faces for launching a proxy fight for 
control of the company. He has threatened to launch such a fight if 
the company fails to spin off its Nabisco food unit. 
</P>
<P>
	But other analysts said they don't expect a decision on the  
international tobacco business that quickly, saying they suspect 
RJR will need more time to strike the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR declined comment. Its shares fell 18 3/4 cents a share to  
$27.68 3/4 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Its chairman and chief executive, Steven Goldstone, recently  
told analysts that finding a way to give the struggling 
international tobacco business greater stature was a top priority 
for the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hasn't specified whether he favors a sale of the business  
or creation of a joint venture as a way to make it more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The international tobacco division at RJR has seen profits  
shrink in each of the past two years as economic conditions 
deteriorated in key markets in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said the international tobacco business may fetch as  
much as $6 billion if it were sold outright. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the most likely buyers would be Philip Morris Cos.,  
RJR's chief rival in the United States, and Japan Tobacco and said 
France's Seita and Spain's Tabacalera may also make a bid.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Hit Nine-Month High / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose above 7 percent this week, the highest 
level in nine months, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average increased for the fifth consecutive week to 7.06  
percent, the highest level since the the end of May. It had been 
6.89 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase, if sustained, will slightly cool home sales and  
sharply reduce mortgage refinancing, a key support for consumer 
spending during the past year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``New cash flows from refinancings have been a significant  
source of consumer spending but I don't think it will be there this 
year,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The average reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early  
October as worried world investors poured their money into U.S. 
financial markets. That helped send sales of both new and existing 
homes to record highs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the recent climb, the average remains low by  
historical standards, said Freddie Mac economist Robert Van Order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interest rates will probably be even higher in next week's  
survey,'' he said. ``That said, It's good to remember that even 
with interest rates at higher levels ... we are still experiencing 
rates that are comparable to the very early 1970s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.70 percent this week, the highest since mid-June and up 
from 6.51 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.74 percent, up from 5.71 percent the 
previous week and the highest in 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged 1 percent of the loan amount for each type of mortgage.

<HEADLINE>  Rockies' Walker Gets $75M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Larry Walker didn't have to become a free  
agent to cash in on baseball's escalating salary scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who won a batting title and the National League MVP  
award in the past two years, agreed Thursday to a $75 million, 
six-year contract extension with the Colorado Rockies that ties him 
for the sixth-highest average salary in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came less than two weeks after Walker sat in front  
of his locker and openly wondered if 1999 would be his last season 
in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to relax, finally,'' Walker said before the Rockies'  
spring opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``I've been shaking 
for the last three days, not only thinking about six years and all 
the money that's involved, but just the fact that it's over and we 
can quit talking about `What if?' I'm so elated it's sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, will make $5,075,000 this season as he finishes a  
five-year contract. The new deal calls for a $1 million signing 
bonus, $12 million each in 2000 and 2001 and $12.5 million annually 
from 2002-05. 
</P>
<P>
	His new deal, with a $12.5 million average annual value, ties  
him with Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez and New York Yankees 
outfielder Bernie Williams, behind only Los Angeles pitcher Kevin 
Brown ($15 million), Anaheim first baseman Mo Vaughn ($12.33 
million), Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson ($13.1 million) and New 
York Mets catcher Mike Piazza and Baltimore outfielder Albert Belle 
($13 million each). 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied Martinez for fifth in total dollars, trailing Brown  
($105 million), Piazza ($91 million), Williams ($87.5 million) and 
Vaughn ($80 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing was to stay here,'' Walker said. ``I was going  
to say the money doesn't need to be astronomical going through the 
roof, but it is. You think about it, it's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being voted the NL MVP in 1997, Walker hit .363 last year  
to win the batting title. Slowed by offseason elbow surgery, Walker 
dropped from 49 homers to 23 homers, prompting him to adopt a 
rigorous offseason weight training program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks terrific,'' Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said. ``We  
still have to play the games, but he sure passes the eyeball 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The compliments were limited when Walker reported early to  
spring training on Feb. 19. As he questioned Colorado's willingness 
to re-sign him, McMorris lamented the stubborn stance taken by 
Walker's agents, Bob Gilhooley and Pat Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker took an active role in the negotiating sessions earlier  
this week, and his participation paid off as both sides were able 
to agree upon the contract's length. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat in on the meetings, and I know I said some things in  
there that probably I shouldn't have,'' Walker said. ``I wanted to 
get things rolling. I wanted to get things done and over with, so I 
spoke up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another meeting Thursday morning finished the deal as Walker  
proposed creating a foundation that will help children and needy 
families in the Rocky Mountain region and Walker's hometown of 
Maple Ridge, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies agreed to match all donations made by Walker, and  
the foundation will start with an initial commitment of $3,333,333 
split evenly between both sides. Walker wears No. 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that I wanted to do,'' Walker said. ``Jerry and  
(co-owner) Charlie Monfort were behind it 100 percent, too. We're 
excited to be able to put money in a foundation to help the less 
fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's fortunes soared briefly when Walker signed in 1995.  
The Rockies made the playoffs just three years after joining the 
majors as an expansion team but have not returned to the postseason 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoff absence is not for lack of spending. Before the 1998  
season, the Rockies signed pitcher Darryl Kile to a $24 million, 
three-year contract, third baseman Vinny Castilla to a $24 million, 
four-year deal and second baseman Mike Lansing to a $23.25 million, 
four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado locked up outfielder Dante Bichette ($21 million for  
three years) duing the winter and signed first baseman Todd Helton 
to a $12 million, four-year deal earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely sends a message to the players and the fans that  
this ownership group is serious,'' Rockies manager Jim Leyland 
said. ``I think it sends the right message. If it doesn't, I don't 
know what would.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Gov. Sounds Off On Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman gave harsh  
grades Wednesday to both parties in Congress, President Clinton, 
feminist groups and the media for a year of scandal that left 
voters apathetic and annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens of our nation have been turned off by the events  
of the past 16 months,'' Whitman told a National Press Club 
luncheon. ``They feel that Washington is out of touch with them and 
out of touch with what really matters to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a controversy from her own state capital followed Whitman  
down to Washington. Of 24 questions submitted by members of the 
luncheon audience, four were related to diversity within and 
alleged racial ``profiling'' by New Jersey's State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman this week fired State Police Superintendent Carl  
Williams over his comments that minorities were more likely than 
others to be involved in trafficking of some drugs. She told the 
press club gathering that Williams is not a racist but that his 
remarks showed ``a level of insensitivity that was not what we 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assessing blame for public fatigue with the impeachment process,  
Whitman said, ``I think I have to start with my own party, the 
Republican Party. Republicans emerged with a popular image rivaling 
that of Kathy Bates in Stephen King's 'Misery' -- a perception that 
we are mean-spirited, vindictive and obsessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the governor also criticized Democrats for rallying behind  
Clinton while using words like ``indefensible'' to describe his 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said ``media saturation of the story wore on the  
public's interest and patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she accused feminist leaders who continued to support  
Clinton of sending a message ``that if you do good things for women 
as a group, it doesn't really matter what you do to them 
individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest applause line of the day followed a question about  
the difference between Democrats and Republicans now that Clinton 
has adopted so many trademark GOP issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, she said, is: ``We believe in them.''

<HEADLINE> Royals' Ownership Approval Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals may have to go  
through a good part of the 1999 season without an owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Miles Prentice had hoped big league club owners would use a  
March 18 meeting to approve his purchase of the team with a group 
that includes golfer Tom Watson and Kansas City millionaire R. 
Crosby Kemper Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	But the owners called off the session.  
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, a New York lawyer who spent about 14 months pursuing  
the Royals, has the acceptance of the Royals' board of directors, 
but approval is needed from the club owners of both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that owners did not have a full-enough  
agenda, and it's their prerogative to call the meeting whenever 
they want,'' Royals spokesman Mike Swenson said. ``It's not a 
setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Prentice said he was confident owners would  
decide ``as expeditiously as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Wants IDs of Net Chatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Chatting anonymously about your employer  
on the Internet may not be as safe as you think. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon Corp., the Lexington-based defense giant, is suing 21  
online chatters who it believes are employees disclosing company 
secrets. The company has asked Yahoo Inc., which runs the offending 
chat group, to identify the people behind their electronic handles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to and take seriously our responsibility to  
protect proprietary information,'' said Raytheon spokeswoman Toni 
Simonetti on Thursday. ``We'll take legal action necessary to 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case underscores a difficulty with Internet chat groups,  
which encourage the kinds of conversations that might take place 
after work in a bar. But the electronic message boards create an 
illusion of privacy that can embolden people to broadcast their 
thoughts all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Raytheon, a $19.5 billion company with 100,000  
employees, on-line messages were allegedly posted by workers who 
assumed such screen names as RSCDeepthroat, SadNTexas and 
snowbaw198. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages revealed what Raytheon claims are company secrets,  
mostly about manpower projections and financial issues. In the 
complaint filed in Middlesex Superior Court in Cambridge last 
month, Raytheon said the workers violated employment agreements not 
to disclose confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the information revealed in the chat group was  
either speculative, inaccurate or already public. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Yahoo, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif.,  
said the company will comply with a subpoena if one is issued, but 
otherwise won't disclose a user's identification. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very, very strict privacy policies,'' Yahoo  
spokeswoman Diane Hunt said. ``We're careful not to just give out 
user information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon is asking for an injunction against the chatters  
preventing further disclosure of company secrets, compensatory 
damages and attorney fees and expenses. That worried some. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems kind of disturbing that a company would check up on  
employees this way,'' said Scott Charnas, an attorney who works for 
a law firm specializing in labor law and is not involved in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Charnas said he didn't know of any statute preventing Yahoo from  
disclosing the names of its chat group members. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be an expectation of privacy when people sign on  
with these screen names, but that's probably a false expectation,'' 
said Charnas.

<HEADLINE> People Magazine Has 25th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When People magazine first hit newsstands 25  
years ago, it was easy reading, a who-did-what-when -- and pssst, 
with whom -- in a gossipy whisper far from Page One news. 
</P>
<P>
	But the whisper grew louder, leaving its roots in a ``people''  
page in the back of Time magazine to become Time Inc.'s No. 1 
publication, and paving the way for today's personality-crazed 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the weekly and its formula are clear in this  
week's 340-page anniversary issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media have become addicted to soap opera stories,'' said  
Howard Kurtz, media critic for The Washington Post. ``And you can 
see a People-style approach in almost every corner of the media 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What People launched in 1974 with Mia Farrow on the cover was  
the cult of personality, whether famous or obscure, as the ultimate 
audience seducer. Since then, that concept has increasingly powered 
mainstream news. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more papers are going for gossip, for the celebrity  
of the moment,'' said Gene Roberts, managing editor of The New York 
Times until last year and former executive editor of The 
Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line: It pays.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge money,'' said People managing editor Carol Wallace.  
</P>
<P>
	Each week, Time Inc. sells 3.6 million copies of People. Every  
page of advertising costs at least $138,000, leading the industry 
with about $626 million in ads last year alone. The magazine rakes 
in $1 billion in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's more than money, Wallace said: ``At the same time,  
it's not a bad thing to entertain while showing readers what makes 
people in the news tick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The formula shows up in magazines, newspapers and television  
awash in instant fame, spun with embarrassing details that the most 
staid society can't resist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington used to be considered hopelessly boring by the  
likes of People magazine,'' said Kurtz, who in his book ``Spin 
Cycle'' analyzes President Clinton's press machine. ``But in the 
era of Bill and Monica, Paula and James Carville, it's clear that 
the Beltway culture has also been bitten by the celebrity bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even The New York Times, which sets the country's serious news  
agenda for many, is flirting with the who's-who concept with a 
chatty weekday column, ``Public Lives,'' and a daily arts section 
box, ``Footlights,'' which highlights big names around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But the difference between People and the Times ``is like the  
view from two different planets. Most Times stories are built 
around people who are substantive, and you see real depth there,'' 
said Roberts, the former managing editor who now teaches journalism 
at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The editors of People are proud of reaching a mass audience with  
its common touch. ``I love the audience we reach. They want to see 
a celebrity in a bubble bath, or Sophia Loren and a pizza in the 
kitchen,'' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical People reader is a 40-year-old woman with an annual  
income of about $50,000, who leans toward stories about glamorous 
women. Princess Diana was the favorite, with 50 covers; the issue 
on her death was People's best-selling edition at more than 5 
million copies. Elizabeth Taylor was second with 14 and Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis had 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not all celebrity fluff. The most beautiful, sexiest and  
best-dressed people share a world with the worst-dressed, the dead 
and the dying. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, Wallace said, has ``put a face'' on disturbing  
issues like eating disorders and AIDS, with personalities such as 
the late singer Karen Carpenter, who died of anorexia, and an 
ordinary, HIV-positive little boy, Ryan White. ``And even beautiful 
princesses like Diana can get bulimia,'' Wallace said.

	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure's season took another detour  
Thursday when the Florida Panthers found torn cartilage in his 
right knee that will sideline him at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Magnetic resonance imaging tests found a torn meniscus in the  
knee, along with a bone bruise. He was scheduled to undergo surgery 
on Friday to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure is expected out of action from two to three weeks, Panthers  
officials said. That would leave less than a month in the regular 
season, as Florida seeks the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. 
Heading into Friday, the Panthers had 60 points and were in a tight 
race with Montreal, Boston and the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury took place when Bure was bent backward by an open-ice  
check from Colorado's Adam Foote in the first period of Florida's 
7-5 loss Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-scoring Russian continued to play and scored three  
goals in the first two periods as Florida jumped to a 5-0 lead. But 
he sat out the third as the Avalanche roared back with seven 
unanswered goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was getting worse and worse in the second (period),'' Bure  
said after the game. ``With about five minutes to go in the second, 
there was just so much more pain. The doctors said it was not safe 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury happened to the same knee he strained in a Feb. 5  
</P>
<P>
	game at Pittsburgh, causing him to sit out eight games. His  
return lasted just four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, there's no doubt,'' Panthers coach Terry Murray  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure's hat trick Wednesday night was his second since the  
Panthers acquired him from Vancouver in a seven-player trade Jan. 
17. Bure was a holdout for the season's first three months after 
demanding a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing just 11 games this season, Bure's 13 goals ranks  
fifth on the Panthers.

<HEADLINE> Ramon Martinez May Report by Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Ramon Martinez may report to the Boston  
Red Sox training camp by Monday once final details of a two-year 
deal are worked out, general manager Dan Duquette said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, recovering from shoulder surgery after spending the  
past 11 seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, said Wednesday he had 
agreed to a contract that would reunite him with his brother Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	They pitched together with the Dodgers in 1993 when Pedro was a  
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on finalizing the details of bringing him to  
Boston. We're not quite there yet,'' Duquette said before Boston 
opened its exhibition season with a 9-2 win over the Minnesota 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez still has to pass a physical, ``one of the key hurdles  
in an agreement of this type,'' Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was hopeful that Martinez, who has been working out  
in the Dominican Republic, would join the club Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see him in here so we can assess exactly where he  
is in the program,'' Duquette said. It's possible Martinez then 
would return to the Dominican Republic to continue his 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said Wednesday he thought he might be ready to pitch in  
the majors before the All-Star break. He underwent rotator cuff 
surgery on his right shoulder last June 30, and Duquette said the 
usual recovery time is 12 to 14 months before a pitcher can play in 
a major-league game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he comes around like we hope he will he can have an  
impact,'' Duquette said. ``He's a good leader, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox second baseman Jose Offerman, who played with Martinez  
in Los Angeles from 1990-95, was pleased with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling because we've been together in the past.  
Ramon is a good man and a good teammate,'' Offerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 30, was 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA in 15 starts last season  
before he was hurt and the Dodgers bought out his option for 1999. 
He had spent his entire career with the Dodgers, posting a 123-77 
record and a 3.45 ERA. In the past five seasons, he was 61-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez was 19-7 with a 2.89 ERA last season, his first  
with the Red Sox. In 1997, he won the NL Cy Young award with 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette said he still would be interested in adding another top  
starter. He reportedly has shown interest in Kansas City's Kevin 
Appier. That would add even more experience to a veteran rotation 
that includes Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, Tim Wakefield, Mark 
Portugal and Pat Rapp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that,'' Wakefield said of Ramon Martinez's  
impending arrival. ``I've got to worry about getting guys out on 
the field every five days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just keep working hard,'' Rapp said. ``When he (Ramon  
Martinez) is ready, he'll do what he can do. I can only control me. 
I can't control what happens around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Minnesota, Wakefield pitched one inning, retiring the  
side in order in the first on nine pitches. Rapp pitched the next 
two innings, allowing one run on two hits with one strikeout and a 
hit batter.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Gets Into E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., hoping to reverse its  
image as a laggard in the world of electronic commerce, rolled out 
a major package of Internet services and software for online 
shoppers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft announced Thursday it would improve its msn.com Web  
destination to make it easier for shoppers to find products they 
want to buy and compare prices over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Online shoppers will be able to use an electronic ``wallet''  
that includes credit card numbers, passwords and mailing addresses, 
so they don't have to re-enter the information again and again. 
</P>
<P>
	For businesses, Microsoft offered new software, called BizTalk,  
they can use to sell products online. The software will help 
businesses track supply and demand, execute orders quickly and 
accurately and communicate with vendors. The system is already 
being tested by 1-800-FLOWERS, barnesandnoble.com, Best Buy Co., 
Dell Computer Corp. and Eddie Bauer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get more than a million new businesses into e-commerce, we  
need to help their software speak the language of business in a 
consistent way,'' Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was intended to expand Microsoft's existing  
e-commerce efforts, which include MSN Expedia for travel services, 
MSN Carpoint for auto sales and MSN HomeAdvisor for real estate 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the new initiatives would improve  
Microsoft's position in the growing world of electronic commerce. 
Several Microsoft rivals such as IBM and Sun Microsystems have 
already staked major claims in selling e-commerce software, an 
attempt to grab a piece of consumers' estimated $12 billion in 
Internet purchases this year, expected to increase tenfold within a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are talking about e-commerce, Microsoft isn't the  
company that comes to mind,'' said Gartner Group analyst Scott 
Winkler.

<HEADLINE> Will Rules Alter Vegas NASCAR Race? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mark Martin suspects it may be the same old  
thing, new rules or no new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin won the inaugural Las Vegas 400 last March, leading a  
rout in which Ford captured 13 of the top 14 places. NASCAR didn't 
like the look of that race -- and some others as well -- and changed 
the aerodynamic rules before the last race of the season in hopes 
of evening the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin, coming off a victory in Rockingham, N.C., says  
additional downforce will not necessarily make the Winston Cup 
series more competitive or bring slower cars closer toward the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spoilers and air dams making better races is yet to be  
seen,'' he said. ``I think you will be able to run side by side, 
where before it was difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had a 10th-place car at Las Vegas and everybody just  
put spoilers and air dams on, you'd still have a 10th-place car. So 
I think you've got to figure out how to get your car driving as 
good and going as fast as the guy that's leading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rusty Wallace's crew chief thinks the move mandated by  
NASCAR before the final race last year to raise the rear spoilers 
and lower the front air dams -- giving the cars more traction in the 
turns -- could make the second Winston Cup trip to Las Vegas Motor 
Speedway a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The likelihood of a driver being able to run away with the  
thing is not too great,'' Robin Pemberton said. ``The tire grip and 
driver-control aspects really make me feel like this could be a 
race that they talk about for many months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all just hoping that it's us that they're doing the most  
talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won't take much for that to happen. Wallace finished third  
last year in the Las Vegas inaugural, when Martin led a Ford sweep 
of the top seven positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air dam and spoiler rules now in effect are going to  
make the competition really tight,'' Pemberton said. ``The cars are 
going to be able to race two abreast and maybe even three abreast 
in some instances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might help the General Motors cars, badly outrun in Las  
Vegas and not much of a factor for most of 1998. The only Chevrolet 
to prosper last year was that of Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, 
a winner in a record-tying 13 of 33 races. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte's Pontiac won twice, but there were only three  
more GM victories. Fords won the other 15 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, with the new spoiler rules, all the GM cars can be  
better,'' Gordon said. ``I know the Fords haven't slowed up any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is seeking to tie a record with his third straight  
championship and fourth overall. A year ago, he finished 17th on 
the 1 1/2-mile Las Vegas oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``No excuses,'' said Gordon, lapped midway through that race.  
``It wasn't anything mechanical or in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of not being able to run the car  
competitively under the circumstances. We just weren't very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third event of the 34-race season. The first two  
races do not reflect what's in store at many tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Daytona International Speedway, where cars always run with  
power-robbing carburetor restrictor plates, Gordon won the 
season-opening Daytona 500. Chevys took four of the first five 
spots that day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Dura-Lube 400, two weeks ago at North Carolina Motor  
Speedway, was perhaps a better example of the aerodynamic rules. 
Fords took four of the top five spots, but GM managed a top-10 
split. 
</P>
<P>
	But speeds on that 1.017-mile oval are about 12 mph slower than  
those in Las Vegas, where downforce will be a bigger issue because 
the track is banked at just 12 degrees in the corners. At The Rock, 
the banking ranges from 22 to 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, called the Las Vegas finish  
last year ``embarrassing,'' and vowed a massive effort to solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is to make a move toward the top of the standings, Gordon  
can't have another Rockingham. After winning at Daytona, he fell to 
10 spots by finishing 39th at Rockingham -- the victim of rare 
Hendrick Motorsports occurrence, a blown engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody who is competing for the championship can afford two  
bad races in a row,'' Gordon said. ``We just hope we're as 
competitive in Las Vegas as we think we will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd better be. We don't want to dig ourselves a big hole.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Is One To Beat in Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Maybe this event should be renamed in honor  
of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships begin Friday, and  
the Razorbacks have ruled it unlike any other team in NCAA history, 
winning 14 of the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coached by John McDonnell, Arkansas has won 14 indoor and eight  
outdoor NCAA titles in addition to nine cross country championships 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women in the two-day event at the RCA Dome, top-ranked  
Texas will be seeking its second consecutive title after ending 
LSU's five-year reign here last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Division II meet will be run concurrently with the  
perennially powerful Abilene Christian Wildcats defending both the 
men's and women's titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The men are going for their fourth consecutive championship and  
sixth in seven years, while the women have won six straight and 10 
of the last 11 indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, the runner-up to Arkansas last year, is again the top  
challenger to the Razorbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanford will be very tough,'' McDonnell said. ``They are  
doubling and tripling guys. We're not going to do much of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell's team features sophomore Kenny Evans, who won the  
high jump championship as a freshman last year by clearing 7 feet, 
6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Arkansas distance runners are potential champions -- Seneca  
Lassiter (mile), Michael Power (3,000) and Sean Kaley (5,000). To 
give them a better chance at individual victories, McDonnell isn't 
going with what would likely be his best chance for victory in the 
distance medley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be too tough on them,'' he said of Lassiter and  
Power. ``Sharif Karie and Murray Link have come around. They'll run 
the distance medley with Ryan Stanley and James Karanu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a good team but we could have put an awesome team  
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaley, who finished second in the 5,000 last year, will also  
compete in the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tough double but he wants to do it. This is it for  
him. This is Sean's last event as a Razorback. He wants to go out 
strong,'' McDonnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter faces a major challenge in the mile from a pair of  
Stanford runners -- junior Michael Stember and sophomore Jonathan 
Riley. Both have seed times of under four minutes. And Kaley can 
expect to find any of three Stanford juniors -- Brad and Brent 
Hauser, along with Jason Balkman -- on his heels in the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas women have three defending champions returning from a  
team that won the championship by a record 30-point margin last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Suziann Reid is the defending 400-meter champion and her time of  
51.58 is the fastest in the event in college this year. Defending 
high jump champion Eric Aldrich ranks first nationally with a 6-4 3/4 
performance this year and LaKeisha Backus is the defending champion 
in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate may deprive Backus of repeat laurels. Nanceen Perry  
won the 200 in the 1997 championships and her fast time of 23.34 
ranks second nationally this year. LSU's Peta-Gaye Dowdie is 
another title contender in the event, having won the SEC 
championship with a nation-leading time of 22.99.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Medical Marijuana Law Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska's medical marijuana law goes into  
effect today, offering a legal shield to people who smoke the weed 
for a short list of medical ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 percent of the voters in the November election favored  
the measure, which allows marijuana use for ailments including 
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, chronic pain, seizures and muscle spasms, 
provided the patient has a doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows patients to grow limited amounts of marijuana and  
protects doctors who recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing, selling or using marijuana for recreational purposes  
remains illegal and marijuana is still classified with heroin and 
LSD under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a bill introduced in Congress on Wednesday would set  
aside the federal ban on marijuana in the states that have approved 
its use: Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Alaska law calls for identification cards that  
medical marijuana users could show to fend off arrest, the 
Department of Health and Social Services is not yet accepting 
applications for a registry of qualified patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without a card, the law will provide a defense if people  
are arrested for using medical marijuana. Patients will be allowed 
to keep 1 ounce of marijuana, or grow six plants, including three 
flowering plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect that the police would exercise some discretion,  
and ask appropriate questions that would allow them to gain enough 
information to determine if the person is legitimately using 
marijuana for medical purpose or just using it as an excuse,'' said 
Dean Guaneli, the state's chief assistant attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Tuthill wishes the law had come about a few years earlier.  
The retired airline pilot was using marijuana to ease chronic pain 
caused by a severe car crash when a neighbor complained to 
authorities about the marijuana patch on his property in Homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuthill was placed on probation after a plea bargain that  
forbids him from smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have period of times when my pain is so severe that I just  
can't do anything,'' said Tuthill, 48, who says other pain 
medications nauseate him.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Draws for Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Silver Charm, the 8-5 favorite in the  
early line, drew the inside post Thursday for the $1 million Santa 
Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm will carry high weight of 124 pounds and will be  
ridden by Gary Stevens in Saturday's 1 1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, who was scratched from last year's race with a  
foot injury, has 12 wins in 21 career starts and has earned 
$6,683,006. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered Thursday were Sidon, who will be ridden by Gary  
Delahoussaye and carrying 114 pounds; Free House, Chris McCarron, 
123; Puerto Madero, Kent Desormeaux, 122; Dr Fong, Alex Solis, 117; 
and Event Of The Year, Corey Nakatani, 119. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, second choice at 2-1, figures to be the top  
challenger to the favorite. Puerto Madero, who upset third-place 
finisher Silver Charm in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream last 
month, has 11 wins in 16 career starts.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Atlas, who made some of the earliest  
movie trailers and started a company devoted to making the 
previews, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlas became a key figure in the movie trailer industry during  
the past 40 years of their evolution and was an authority on their 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career in MGM's publicity department and later  
worked full time creating previews. MGM was one of the first 
studios with a full-time trailer production staff, and only a dozen 
companies in the world produced trailers at the time Atlas started. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailers grew in popularity with ``talkies'' and over the years  
evolved into a key marketing strategy for new film releases. Today, 
more than 100 companies make trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for MGM and then Columbia, he started his own  
production company, Atlas Organization, in 1973, which made 
trailers for films and Ted Turner's television enterprises.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Rev. W. Frank Harrington, the leader of North  
America's largest congregation in the Presbyterian Church USA, died 
Wednesday of cardio-respiratory failure. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	During Harrington's 28 years at Peachtree Presbyterian, its  
membership went from 2,400 to the current total of nearly 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington began his ministry at First Presbyterian Church in  
Hinesville and served at Fairview Presbyterian Church in North 
Augusta, S.C., before moving to Atlanta.

	REVERE, Mass. (AP) -- Herbert C. Kelley, the head of technical

</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Shirley Satin Simmons, who appeared in  
television commercials and exercise videos with her son, fitness 
guru Richard Simmons, died Sunday. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Simmons, a New York City native, was a tap dancer when she  
met Leonard D. Simmons Sr., a singer and master of ceremonies, at a 
theatrical boarding house in Philadelphia in 1938, according to 
Leonard Simmons Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple married and performed under the stage names Bobby and  
Shirley Leonard. They moved to New Orleans in 1939, where Mrs. 
Simmons tap danced in Bourbon Street variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
	After Leonard Jr. and Richard were born in 1946 and 1948, she  
abandoned show business and went to work selling cosmetics. She 
retired in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	When Richard Simmons became well known through his exercise  
programs and fitness videos, his mother often was with him. She 
appeared in commercials with him and did an exercise video, ``The 
Silver Foxes,'' with the parents of other celebrities, including 
Sylvester Stallone's father and Dustin Hoffman's mother.

	AT&AMP;T: We Don't Want To Buy AOL  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. doesn't want to acquire the  
nation's largest Internet provider, America Online, despite 
persistent rumors about such a deal, AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong said today. ``We are absolutely not interested in, nor 
are we pursuing acquiring America Online,'' Armstrong said, 
responding to a question about whether a deal between the two titan 
companies is in the works. There have been published reports that 
the two companies were thinking about pairing up. AOL, meanwhile, 
had wanted federal regulators, as a condition of approving AT&AMP;T's 
planned merger with cable giant Tele-Communications, to make the 
merged company provide other companies with access to TCI's 
high-speed lines, which reach one-third of U.S. homes. The FCC, in 
clearing the merger last month, refused to to that.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied today after two days of weak  
performance, boosted by benign economic data, strong retail sales 
reports and higher oil prices. At the close of trading on Wall 
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 191.52 at 9,467.40, 
near the day's high. The blue-chip index more than erased the 
48-point loss over the previous The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index rose 27.72 to 2,292.92. The market's recovery, 
which extended a turnaround in technology shares that started late 
yesterday, was ``totally justified'' by recent economic data and 
the fact that investors still have a lot of money to put to work,

	IBM-Dell Pact Boosts Wall Street  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The market opened stronger today after IBM  
announced that it had agreed to supply Dell Computer with computer 
parts in a $16 billion, seven-year pact. Analysts said the 
arrangement could lead to more highly lucrative deals for IBM, 
whose stock was up 4 3/8 at 171 1/8 at the close. Dell was up 7/8 at 81

	Feb. Retail Sales Beat Expectations  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the nation's biggest retailers topped  
expectations in February as the U.S. economy remained strong. Not 
only were consumers buying up discounted winter merchandise, there 
was also great demand for full-priced spring goods as well. The 
healthy results pleased merchants who had anticipated that 
consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 amid expectations 
that global financial turmoil would slow down U.S. economic growth. 
The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer of 
sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was up 
4.5 percent in February. 

</P>
<P>
	Factory Orders Rise 1.7 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories surged in January  
for the second consecutive month, perhaps signaling the start of a 
rebound in American manufacturing after a year of struggling with 
fallout from Asia's economic crisis. Orders increased 1.7 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted $349.6 billion following an even stronger 
2.3 percent increase in December, the Commerce Department said 
today. Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of 
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell last week and, for February, the average level of new 
applications reached a 10-year low. Jobless claims totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 286,000 last week. The department is due to 
report the unemployment rate for February tomorrow. Analysts 
believe it will hold at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent.

	Japan Closer To Approving the Pill  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japese health officials confirmed today that a  
government committee has dropped its resistance to the sale of 
birth control pills. The change comes nine years after it took up 
the question -- and five weeks after an uproar over the speedy 
approval of Viagra. The Health Ministry committee studying the 
safety of the pill concluded yesterday that there was no reason to 
withhold approval any longer, although it stopped short of actually 
approving the sale, ministry official Yasuhide Furusawa said. The 
committee, expected to give its OK in June, first wants to write up 
guidelines for doctors and women, including plans to encourage the 
use of condoms to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus, Furusawa 
said.

	Brazil Raises Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In his first day on the job,  
Brazil's new central banker Arminio Fraga raised interest rates to 
45 percent today in a controversial effort to stamp out inflation. 
Fraga called the increase in the Central Bank's lending rate for 
commercial banks necessary to keep prices from exploding. ``Our 
main commitment is to (control) inflation,'' Fraga told reporters. 
Prices have risen sharply since January, when Brazil stopped 
spending dollars to prop up its currency. The real has lost about 
43 percent of its value since then, which has made imported goods 
and components more expensive.

	German Industry Fighting Tax Reform

<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The lower house of Germany's legislature  
passed a bill overhauling the country's tax system, increasing the 
burden on industry to allow relief for average-income families. 
Bitterly attacked by the conservative opposition and industry, the 
bill passed on the strength of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's 
center-left majority by 312-251 votes, with 27 abstentions. The law 
includes cuts in personal income and corporate tax rates, but also 
scraps a string of corporate tax exemptions.

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's central bank left its  
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3 percent today despite new 
signs of trouble in Germany's economy, the largest in the region. 
Concerns about worsening the euro's slide against the dollar, as 
well as the European Central Bank's determination not to be seen as 
giving in to political pressure, all argued against the bank 
lowering rates for the 11-nation bloc that uses the new currency.

<HEADLINE> Meares Getting Acclimated With NL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- They congregate every morning in a corner  
of the Pittsburgh Pirates' clubhouse -- telling stories, talking 
ball, remembering how it was in their former baseball life in the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's a coincidence the lockers of Pat Meares, Brian Giles  
and Ed Sprague are crowded together in a pocket of the clubhouse 
known as AL Alley, but more likely it's not. 
</P>
<P>
	The three players didn't know many others in their new club and  
their new league, but at least they knew each other. And a friendly 
face beats an unfamiliar one anytime in the transient lifestyle of 
a major league player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an adjustment for everyone,'' said Meares, the shortstop  
who rejected an $11 million, three-year contract offer from 
Minnesota only to sign a $1.5 million, one-year deal with 
Pittsburgh. ``I've got to admit, the Pirates' uniform did look 
strange the first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially since Meares had worn the Minnesota Twins' blue and  
red for 8 1/2 years and planned to wear it a lot longer until an 
unusual contract dispute led his longtime team to effectively 
release him. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little strange,'' Meares said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meares, who drove in a career-high 70 runs last season, was  
offered the multiyear deal last fall even as the Twins prepared to 
pare their payroll from $24 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meares' agent, Steve Comte, thought the shortstop was worth  
more on the open market and they rejected the offer. The Twins 
subsequently pulled it off the table and, rather than go to salary 
arbitration, declined to offer a 1999 contract. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Dec. 20, five days before Christmas. Rather than being a  
millionaire, Meares found himself unemployed and, with most teams' 
offseason moves mostly completed, without many options. 
</P>
<P>
	``I signed with Minnesota in 1990, I was with them for 8 1/2 years,  
so it's difficult going through something like that,'' Meares said. 
``It was tough on my wife and family because they liked 
Minneapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was unusual because teams rarely give up on  
productive players such as Meares without receiving any 
compensation. He had career highs in RBIs (70) and hits (141) last 
season and is a .260 career hitter and reliable if not Gold 
Glove-level fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Unexpectedly finding himself on the open market, Meares sought a  
multi-year contract but wasn't offered one. 
</P>
<P>
	He waited a week after the Pirates offered him a  
take-it-or-leave-it $1.5 million offer before deciding to take it. 
His only other options were as a backup in Cincinnati and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to be patient, and I'm glad I did because that  
approach resulted in us adding a quality major league shortstop,'' 
Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares is more comfortable with the move now, especially since  
Pittsburgh has begun increasing its payroll just as Minnesota is 
cutting salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I was looking at things, Minnesota was going in the  
other direction, and I think this team is on the right track,'' 
Meares said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Meares at shortstop and Mike Benjamin at second base, the  
Pirates have significantly upgraded their up-the-middle defense. 
Shortstop was a comedy of errors and poor offense last season, as 
Lou Collier, Kevin Polcovich and prospect Abraham Nunez combined 
for 45 errors -- or 21 more than Meares. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to catch the ball and get outs for guys,''  
Meares said. ``Nothing against the guys who were at shortstop last 
year, but I'm going to try to bring some level of consistency to 
the position that wasn't there. ... That's tough on a pitching 
staff to have two or three guys playing shortstop a year.''

<HEADLINE> Peters Hits Bull's Eye in `Annie' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Anybody can miss a shot,'' sneers sharpshooter  
Frank Butler, the macho leading man of Buffalo Bill's Wild West 
Show. ``I can't,'' chirps confident challenger Annie Oakley, a 
little lady not much bigger than the rifle she totes. 
</P>
<P>
	Durn tootin' she can't -- especially when she is played by  
Bernadette Peters, who hits the bull's eye every time she is on 
stage in a new, aggressively reworked revival of ``Annie Get Your 
Gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No question about it. Peters demonstrates real star power in  
this Irving Berlin musical, now on view at Broadway's Marquis 
Theater. Whether dressed in buckskin and fringe or a frilly ball 
gown, the actress delivers a performance that lifts ``Annie'' out 
of the ordinary and into musical-comedy sublime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Annie Get Your Gun'' is a vehicle show, constructed in 1946  
around the mega-talents of its original star, Ethel Merman. 
Berlin's music and lyrics are brilliant: simple and direct, yet 
funny or heartfelt when required. Its musty book, originally by 
Herbert and Dorothy Fields, is, well, serviceable, a chance for the 
audience to catch its breath between musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The score is an astonishing parade of hits: ``Doin' What Comes  
Natur'lly,'' ``You Can't Get a Man with a Gun,'' ``They Say It's 
Wonderful,'' ``Lost in His Arms,'' ``I Got the Sun in the 
Morning,'' ``Anything You Can Do'' and that theater anthem to end 
all theater anthems, ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peters is not Merman, and you don't want her to be, but she is  
that rarity on stage today -- a genuine Broadway star. Movies and 
television don't do her justice. From her first entrance -- shooting 
the bird off the hat of the play's nominal villainess -- Peters 
injects her own considerable personality into the musical. 
</P>
<P>
	Her backwoods drawl may be more Granny Clampett than Annie  
Oakley, but she is having so much fun, you go along with her 
hayseed impersonation. Even better, Peters knows how to handle 
romance, something Merman never was quite comfortable doing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Merman's vocal delivery was pure foghorn belt, Peters', while  
strong, is more sly, with a hint of sexiness. For example, alone on 
stage and against a backdrop of twinkling stars, Peters delivers a 
meltingly sweet version of ``Lost in His Arms.'' You can hear 
theatergoers sighing their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Director-choreographer Graciela Daniele and her team work  
furiously to disguise the fact that there is not much of a story on 
stage. It is almost as if they were afraid to let the audience hear 
the creaks and groans of the original tale. 
</P>
<P>
	Even designer Tony Walton gets in on the camouflage act with his  
cleverly designed circus set. Daniele has placed the show within a 
show, with Buffalo Bill himself cranking up the curtain and 
announcing that the center ring of his tent will feature the 
romantic tale of Frank Butler and Annie Oakley. It's more of an 
intrusion than a device, particularly with actors announcing scene 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Stone has revised the original while adding more generic  
jokes that the cast puts over with tongue-in-cheek broadness. What 
he hasn't done is beef up the plot, an anemic rivalry between Annie 
and Frank, a competition that continues for two acts despite 
protestations of true love between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wopat plays Frank in a genial, non-threatening manner. He  
has a strong voice, but there's no doubt that this is Peters' show. 
The fine supporting cast, including Ron Holgate as Buffalo Bill, 
Valerie Wright as Annie's rival and Peter Marx as general factotum 
Charlie Davenport, offer enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniele and her co-choreographer, Jeff Calhoun, have concocted  
the busiest dance routines on Broadway. Some of the choreography is 
odd, even weird, particularly in a jazz-tinged rendition by Wopat 
and the boys of ``My Defenses Are Down'' that strains to be 
gymnastic just for the sake of being different. 
</P>
<P>
	When Peters disappears from view, the show sags. The  
undernourished subplot involving the ingenue and her half-Indian 
boyfriend threatens to halt the show. Poor Andrew Palermo and 
Nicole Ruth Snelson are saddled with two Berlin songs -- ``I'll 
Share It All With You'' and ``Who Do You Love, I Hope'' -- that 
remain firmly in the second tier of the master's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, there is that collection of Berlin standards that  
keeps on coming, no matter what the plot does or does not do. And 
even better than that, the show has Peters to sing them -- and make 
them shine like new.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Reveals All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In her new book, Monica Lewinsky goes beyond  
her affair with President Clinton to disclose many details about 
her private life, from an abortion to antidepressants to a stint at 
an eating disorders clinic. Is all that really necessary? And will 
it sell books? 
</P>
<P>
	Booksellers say the 14-month-long presidential sex scandal  
probably raised the bar on how much private information needed to 
be in Ms. Lewinsky's book to attract the public, which seemed to 
tire long ago of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Starr Report was more lurid than this book,'' said Bill  
Curry, spokesman for Amazon.com, an online bookselling outfit, 
referring to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress 
about his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, issued in September and published in book form,  
caused a stir for containing explicit accounts of Ms. Lewinsky's 
sexual encounters with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The former intern's book does not go into detail about the  
sexual trysts -- ``in terms of sex secrets, there wasn't much 
left,'' says Curry -- but it does give details, some might say 
embarrassing ones, about Ms. Lewinsky's private life, including: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Her stint at an eating disorders clinic when she was a  
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	-- That she lost her virginity at 19 to a married man whose wife  
was expecting a baby. 
</P>
<P>
	-- That after she found out the man was seeing someone else, who  
was younger, she paid ``him back for his treachery by having a 
fling with his younger brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- An abortion resulting from a three-month fling with a Pentagon  
worker that came in the midst of her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	-- That she was taking antidepressants.  
</P>
<P>
	Author Andrew Morton, who interviewed Ms. Lewinsky extensively  
over a three-week period and spoke to her family, friends and 
neighbors, said he considered some key issues -- such as the 
abortion and her affair with a married man -- unavoidable because 
they had already been made public. 
</P>
<P>
	He discussed whether to include the abortion with the publisher,  
St. Martin's Press, but did not consult Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't put it in and it becomes a big issue, I'll be  
criticized for doing a whitewash,'' he said in an interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for other details of Ms. Lewinsky's private life, Morton said  
he decided to include them to show the events that helped shape 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton said Ms. Lewinsky, who did not have veto power over his  
writing, found some parts ``a bit too candid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, she was happy with it, Morton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She thinks it's a vivid warts-and-all portrayal of her,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gennifer Flowers, another Clinton paramour turned author, went  
much further than Ms. Lewinsky, giving explicit details of alleged 
sexual encounters with the president in her 1995 book ``Passion and 
Betrayal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When your integrity and honesty are being questioned, you have  
a tendency to go overboard so people think you're an honest 
person,'' said Ms. Flowers, who is working on another book about 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denied Flowers' claim that they'd had a 12-year affair  
in Arkansas. Last year he said in a deposition in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case that they had sex once. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ms. Lewinsky's book came out, the public supposedly  
had grown weary of the Clinton scandal and all its tawdry details 
about cigars, a stained dress and ``the definition of sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the book, ``Monica's Story,'' topped Amazon.com's ``Hot  
100'' list of best-selling books on Thursday, outselling the latest 
volume recommended by Oprah Winfrey's book club and novelist John 
Grisham's new work. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how long the book will remain popular is uncertain, but if  
history is a guide, it may not be long. Curry said sales of other 
Clinton investigation books were driven by news events of the last 
year, such as the impeachment trial. When the news subsided, so did 
interest in the books, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi To Debut New Ads at Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pepsi-Cola Co., dumping an advertising theme  
viewed as too limiting for a soft drink company seeking mass 
appeal, plans to launch an ad campaign called ``Joy of Cola'' for 
its flagship brand later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The beverage company from Purchase, N.Y., disclosed Thursday the  
first three commercials in the new campaign will debut March 21 on 
the Academy Awards show on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Aretha Franklin has recorded a new anthem for the soft drink  
maker that will be heard in the ads and will make a cameo 
appearance in one of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Marlon Brando and entertainer Issac Hayes will narrate the  
other ads although neither man will be shown in the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Child actor Hallie Eisenberg, who has previously appeared for  
Pepsi in an ad in which she adopts an unusually gruff voice when 
she finds Pepsi isn't served at a diner, will appear in all three 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, the little girl appears to sing the new anthem but it  
is Aretha Franklin's voice. Brando's voice is channeled through the 
girl in another ad in which she has been denied a Pepsi, while 
Hayes' voice comes through her when she poses as a disc jockey in 
the third ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi officials said the new campaign leverages the company's  
``key equities of humor, humanity and music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new theme replaces ``Generation Next'' which had been  
faulted by Phil Marineau, president of Pepsi-Cola North America, 
for appearing to appeal to only a narrow segment of the audience 
that Pepsi should court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola's corporate share of the $56.3 billion U.S. soft  
drink market rose 0.5 percentage point to 31.4 percent last year, 
according to the Beverage Digest/Maxwell report. Coca-Cola Co.'s 
leading share rose 0.6 percentage point to 44.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pepsi-Cola brand's share fell 0.3 percentage points to 14.2  
percent, while industry leader Coca-Cola Classic was flat at 20.8 
percent of the market, the report said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Agree to Budget Frame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders agreed  
Thursday on a framework for the fiscal 2000 budget that they said 
would prevent Social Security surpluses from being used for tax 
cuts, and would stick to spending limits enacted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, announced at the end of weeks of private meetings  
among top House and Senate Republicans, would also allow for a tax 
cut that would begin next year, just as the presidential and 
congressional election campaigns are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's tax reduction would likely be relatively small  
because lawmakers would have to find savings and new revenues to 
pay for them. The cut will probably be about $15 billion next year 
and from $150 billion to $190 billion over the next five years, 
surging to $700 billion to $900 billion over the next decade, said 
Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal represents the GOP's attempt to frame this year's  
fight with President Clinton over what to do with massive budget 
surpluses expected for the foreseeable future. It also seems to 
spell a truce between House and Senate Republicans, whose bickering 
over cutting taxes last year resulted in Congress' first failure in 
24 years to produce its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House and Senate have come together, and we think it is  
historic,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration quickly moved to the attack.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be looking particularly to see if this plan  
does anything to strengthen the solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare, as the president's plan does,'' said White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has had the field virtually to himself since sending  
Congress a $1.77 trillion budget last month for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. In it, he proposed setting aside most of the 
expected surpluses for buttressing Social Security and Medicare, 
and spending the rest on new federally subsidized personal 
retirement accounts as well as on an array of defense and social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional leaders will now take the blueprint to  
rank-and-file Republican lawmakers. Kasich and Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who announced the plan 
with Kasich, will now craft budgets that they hope to push through 
their committees later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the plan were sketchy and in some instances not yet  
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans agreed to try to enact legislation requiring  
that Social Security's annual surpluses -- being amassed to prepare 
for the baby boomers' retirements -- be used to retire government 
debt held by the public. The measure would be aimed at blunting 
Clinton's oft-repeated accusation that the GOP wants to divert 
Social Security funds to pay for tax cuts for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a Domenici plan, those Social Security surpluses could  
only be spent for other purposes with 60 votes from the 100-member 
Senate. Even so, budget experts say such a mechanism is unlikely to 
guarantee that the money would remain untouched because lawmakers 
eager to get at it could simply vote to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their plan would let them to set aside $1.8  
trillion over 10 years to reduce the national debt or to use for 
any overhauls enacted of Social Security and Medicare. Citing 
figures by the Congressional Budget Office, they said that was 
about $150 billion more than Clinton would reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, House and Senate Republicans had clashed over how  
much, if any, of the Social Security surpluses to use to finance 
the tax cuts that many in the party consider their hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was crucial because the Congressional Budget Office  
expects a 2000 surplus of $133 billion -- coming entirely from 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, worried about Clinton's attacks, were  
insistent that none of the Social Security money be used for tax 
cuts, and they prevailed. House Republicans had argued that they 
needed some of those funds to enact a tax cut in 2000 that people 
would notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have already signaled that merely protecting the  
Social Security money, however, will not be enough. They also want 
billions set aside for Medicare, which provides health insurance 
for elderly Americans and is nearly as politically sensitive as 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ``are two-thirds of the way there,'' Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said earlier of GOP plans to protect 
Social Security funds. ``We think Medicare and Social Security 
ought to be locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici, however, said the GOP proposal would ``lock away every  
penny of the Social Security trust fund surpluses for our nation's 
elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that, he said, was better than Clinton. He cited a CBO  
analysis released Wednesday that said Clinton would save only 58 
percent of next year's $137 billion Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running around saying he's the one saving Social  
Security,'' Domenici said. ``If saving the trust fund and not 
spending it is the test, we're 100 percent pure, and he's 58 
percent pure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their plan would also live within next year's  
spending limit of roughly $550 billion for discretionary spending. 
That category covers all annually approved defense and domestic 
programs, but excludes automatic benefits such as welfare and 
payments to holders of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	And they said they would do so while increasing defense  
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not, however, explain how they would stay within those  
limits, which many Republicans concede will be a major problem. 
Because of inflation, just to have the same programs as this year 
will take cuts of at least $15 billion -- not including increases 
desired by both parties for defense, education and other programs.

<HEADLINE> Racial Tensions Tear at N.C. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- For years, racial tensions were expressed  
in glares and overheard whispers in this small town of decaying 
Victorian mansions and brick storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
	But tensions have been running especially high since last week,  
when Trenton's white mayor of 16 years told a reporter that blacks 
are unfit to serve in town government. 
</P>
<P>
	The remark came after a few blacks sued officials of the  
all-white town government in January for not annexing some mostly 
black outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not leaders. A black man would rather work for a  
white person,'' Mayor Joffree Leggett told the Kinston Free Press. 
He went on to say that if three blacks were working together in a 
store, ``within a few years, they'd be stealing from each other and 
they'd be out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-year-old mayor -- at the urging of the three-member town  
board -- resigned this week. But his words have inflamed the 
community and sparked a monthlong boycott of the white-owned 
businesses that line Jones Street, the main drag in this farming 
center of 200 people on North Carolina's coastal plain. 
</P>
<P>
	The state NAACP has met here, promising to support the lawsuit.  
The lawsuit accuses officials of ignoring requests to annex three 
black neighborhoods of about 100 people for fear that such a move 
would lead to the election of a black to the town board. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people say we can't do nothing because of our color,''  
said community activist Johnson Willis, one of the plaintiffs. 
``The people, they are so afraid of blacks. Try us first before you 
condemn us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, a retired Air Force veteran, said that although the town  
board persuaded the mayor to resign, that does not change the 
political realities in a town where whites have all the power. ``He 
spoke for the board, every word he spoke,'' Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 blacks live in Trenton; only 23 are registered voters.  
A black has never been elected to the town board. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenton hasn't annexed any land since the early 1900s. A 1949  
ordinance still on the books bars ``persons of color and/or persons 
of undesirable character and reputation'' from owning land in 
Trenton. But the ordinance is considered unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not give us a voice?'' Willis asked. ``If those people  
were smart, they'd give us one black on the board. Now, they've got 
trouble because of thick-headedness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in town say Willis is the problem. He has filed more than  
30 lawsuits against his hometown in the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's cost us more than $80,000 in legal fees,'' said Charles  
Jones, a town board member and owner of Trenton's only car 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said relations between black and white residents -- with  
the exception of Willis -- have been relatively good over the years. 
He also disputed Willis' claim the mayor's remarks reflect the 
board's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope people with enough sense will realize that this is just  
one old man who made a foolish statement,'' Jones said. ``Right 
now, you've got friends divided with friends. It's just most 
unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the mayor's home this week went unanswered. But he has  
said that in his remarks about three blacks working together, he 
was referring to people like Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the board never received a proper annexation petition  
from the areas. He said he doubts most residents there really want 
annexation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Willis said he submitted a proper petition a decade  
ago, and ``I'm not jumping through that hoop again. They always 
have some stipulations for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Strayhorn, a resident of the largest of the three black  
neighborhoods, Haiti, said the board members are out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't spoke to any of us,'' she said. ``The town  
council members are presumptuous. Quite frankly, I don't think they 
want to know what we think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Koonce, another resident of one of the black  
neighborhoods, said the mayor's comments have helped to rally 
people to the cause, and the pressure won't let up until the town 
board incorporates the areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``To push an issue, you've got to get what pressure you can,''  
Koonce said. ``You can't choke a man by grabbing him around the 
waist.''

<HEADLINE> Mattel Overhauls Executive Suite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc. took another step to revive its  
sales and profits with a broad overhaul of its management team, 
including the departure of two of its top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup, announced Wednesday, includes the resignation of  
president and chief operating officer Bruce Stein, who analysts say 
may have clashed with chairman and CEO Jill Barad over the 
direction of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Baughman, president of the Fisher-Price preschool division,  
will also leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring comes as Mattel rethinks the way it does  
business. Its profits were under pressure last year, and sales of 
its traditional toys -- like Barbie dolls -- have been sliding. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many of its most important retail customers,  
including giant Toys R Us, drastically cut back their orders and 
asked for delivery of inventory closer to the time that they wanted 
to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has been aggressively developing CD-ROMs and other  
high-tech toys to better keep pace with sophisticated interests of 
today's children. It also is exploring new retail channels, like 
the Internet and direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new organizational structure we have developed will  
provide for faster decision making, and encourage action that is 
entrepreneurial and responsive to change,'' Barad said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reorganization, Mattel will be divided into five  
divisions, each headed by a president who will report directly to 
Barad. 
</P>
<P>
	The units will include boys, girls/Barbie, Fisher Price, Mattel  
Media and the Pleasant Company, which makes the American Girl dolls 
as well as focuses on Mattel's direct-to-consumer business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This restructuring is all about cutting costs,'' said Jim  
Silver, who runs The Toy Book, a New York-based trade publication. 
``I think part of the problem Mattel was having is there were too 
many people with the same job. There was too much overlap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts also said the loss of Stein could hurt Mattel. The  
44-year-old is a seasoned toy industry veteran with lengthy 
experience at Mattel, as well as at Sony Interactive Entertainment 
and Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that Bruce Stein was one of those people who was a  
visionary about toys, and really gets where kids are today and what 
they want to play with,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy industry 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stein said in a statement that he ``needed a new  
challenge,'' analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
questioned whether the decision to leave was all his.

<HEADLINE> Gore Fund-Raiser Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Alex Haught, the chief fund-raiser for  
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign in Tennessee, died 
in a car accident. He was 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Haught's car collided with a van Wednesday night, killing Haught  
and injuring two people in the van, which smashed into the front of 
a restaurant, police said. Haught was alone in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued an arrest warrant Thursday charging Jimmy  
Millican, 42, with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and 
driving on a revoked license. They said he ran a red light in the 
crash and appeared intoxicated. A blood sample from Millican was 
sent to the state crime lab to determine alcohol content. 
</P>
<P>
	Millican is to be charged after his release from Vanderbilt  
University Medical Center, where he and his passenger were in 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Haught took a leave of absence as chief of staff for Rep. Bob  
Clement, D-Tenn., to work on the Gore campaign in the vice 
president's home state. He was working with Johnny Hayes, who 
recently stepped down from the Tennessee Valley Authority's board 
of directors to work as finance director of Gore's national 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Haught previously was finance director for the unsuccessful U.S.

<HEADLINE> RJR To Clarify Some Cigarette Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ads touting the true tobacco taste of  
Winston's ``no additives'' cigarettes soon will include a warning 
they are no safer than other cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement announced Wednesday by the Federal Trade  
Commission, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said it would include the 
disclosure to settles charges that its ads are misleading. The FTC, 
which regulates advertising, contends RJR's current ads imply 
Winston cigarettes are safer to smoke because they contain no 
additives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, there's no such thing as a safe smoke,'' said Jodie  
Bernstein, the FTC's director of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, RJR would agree to include a disclosure in  
its ads that states: ``No additives in our tobacco does NOT mean a 
safer cigarette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure must appear in a rectangular box 40 percent the  
size of the surgeon general's cigarette health warning and in a 
clear and prominent place. Reynolds also would instruct its sales 
representatives to place a disclosure on any ads in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 4-0 to accept the proposed agreement, which  
is subject to a 60-day comment period before the FTC decides 
whether to make it final. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Orson Swindle said he was convinced that ``many  
consumers interpret ads containing express 'no additive' claims to 
mean that Winston's are not as harmful as other cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle also noted the ``unusually extensive'' nationwide  
campaign begun by Winston in August 1997 to promote the ``no 
additives'' cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds disputed the notion that consumers equate ``no  
additives'' with safer cigarettes. The company said it never has 
made a direct or implied claim in its marketing materials that the 
products are less hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree with the FTC's premise, and our own research  
demonstrated that smokers do not interpret the phrases to mean that 
Winston is safe or safer than other cigarettes,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Carole Crosslin stressed that RJR publicly has said  
it does not believe the risks associated with smoking are reduced 
with ``no additives'' cigarettes. The disclosure reflects the 
company's position on the issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, Reynolds must include the  
disclosure in all advertising for Winston no-additive cigarettes, 
regardless of whether the advertising contains a ``no additive'' 
claim, for one year beginning no later than July 15. After that, 
Reynolds must include the disclosure in all products that it 
represents as having no additives. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health groups had asked the FTC to investigate R.J.  
Reynolds' ad campaign in 1997, after the company reformulated its 
Winston brand to remove all additives. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups said the settlement was an important first step in  
cracking down on deceptive cigarette ads. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR ``has had a long history of engaging in this sort of  
behavior,'' said John Garrison, who heads the American Lung 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure is not required if Reynolds has scientific  
evidence showing that ``no additive'' cigarettes pose lower health 
risks than other cigarettes.

<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Tony Womack, still not at all happy about  
switching from second base to the outfield, will play in left field 
instead of right for the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he feels a little more comfortable over there,''  
Arizona manager Buck Showalter said Thursday. ``I think the throws 
will be a little bit better for Tony. We'll see how it goes. It's a 
better fit for us as a team. Nothing is set in stone, but that's 
the way we're going to start out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, acquired from Pittsburgh to be Arizona's leadoff hitter,  
has known since he joined the club last week that he was being 
switched to the outfield. Initially, the plan was to have Womack 
play in right. 
</P>
<P>
	But Showalter decided instead to move Luis Gonzalez from left  
field to right and have Womack start in left. Gonzalez has never 
played right field. That means Arizona center fielder Steve Finley 
will have an outfielder on each side with no experience at the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, the NL's steals leader the last two seasons, has made no  
secret that he doesn't like leaving the infield, but said Wednesday 
after his first outfield workout that he knows he must accept the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over. We've got to get ready for the season,'' Womack  
said. ``They traded for me to be an outfielder and now is just the 
time to accept it and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack said Showalter's decision to move him to left makes  
little difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never played either one before but he thinks left is a  
better place for me,'' Womack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said no one should think that the move means Jay Bell  
is a better second baseman than Womack is. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't preclude him playing second again sometime in his  
career. It's not at all that he can't play second base, it's just 
that he can make the move a lot easier than Jay can,'' Showalter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said he will move to right field with no complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's going to make it easier on Tony to do that,  
whatever,'' Gonzalez said. ``This is a good team and I'm not here 
to cause any rumbles. I just want to do whatever helps the ball 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack said he worked on outfield techniques for about a  
half-hour Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still throw like an infielder,'' he joked. He said he's  
figured out the best way to handle any throwing deficiencies. 
``I'll just throw it to the closest guy.''

	On March 5, 1770, the Boston Massacre took place as British  
soldiers who'd been taunted by a crowd of colonists opened fire, 
killing five people. Two British soldiers were later convicted of 
manslaughter.

<P>
	In 1982, comedian John Belushi was found dead of a drug overdose  
in a rented bungalow in Hollywood; he was 33. 
</P>

<P>
	Five years ago: White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned in  
the wake of turmoil over the Clinton administration's handling of 
questions related to Whitewater. A jury in Pensacola, Fla., 
convicted anti-abortion activist Michael F. Griffin of first-degree 
murder in the shooting death of Dr. David Gunn; Griffin was 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Details of President Clinton's deposition  
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against him 
were published in The Washington Post, prompting an angry 
denunciation from the president for the news leak. NASA scientists 
said enough water is frozen in the loose soil of the moon to

<HEADLINE> US-EU Banana Trade Hassle Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fancy French handbags, German coffee makers,  
Scottish cashmere sweaters, and millions of dollars of other 
European imports soon could disappear from American store shelves 
as the world's two largest trading partners, the United States and 
the 15-nation European Union, stood on the brink of a trade war 
over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, EU Trade Comissioner Leon Brittan said today that  
the United States action ``risks a major confrontration,'' hinting 
that the EU would likely retaliate against American goods. But 
Brittan said that any EU retaliation would be ``in accordance'' 
with rules of the World Trade Organization, the global referee of 
trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration on Wednesday began notifying U.S.  
improters that they now are liable for hefty tariffs on $520 
million worth of European goods because of the long-running dispute 
involving European barriers on banana imports. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed to stand, the tariffs of 100 percent effectively  
would double the cost of the targeted European goods, pricing them 
out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the action of a party seeking a rapid settlement''  
of the banana case, Brittan told reporters. He called the U.S. 
response ``unacceptable and unlawful,'' arguing that the United 
States had no authority to impose the penalty tariffs before 
receiving a go-ahead from a WTO arbitration panel. The WTO earlier 
this week postponed a decision asking both sides to supply more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking to retaliate against European  
producers by an amount equal to the lost sales claimed by 
U.S.-based banana companies because of European barriers found by 
the WTO to violate global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over bananas is just one of a number of economic  
tension points between the two trading partners coming at a time 
when America's trade deficit is skyrocketing as the global currency 
crisis pounds American manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States met with a trade delegation from the EU today  
in Washington in an effort to head off possible trade sanctions in 
another long running dispute, Europe's refusal to allow U.S. beef 
treated with growth hormones to be sold in Europe. The U.S. beef 
industry says it is losing $250 million in European sales because 
of the ban, which a WTO panel held was an illegal restraint of 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the food fights, the two trading partners are  
also squabbling over airlines. The House on Wednesday 
overwhelmingly passed a bill threatening to ban Europe's supersonic 
Concorde in retaliation for a ruling that would ban many older 
American jets from landing at European airports. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials emphasized Wednesday that they will not collect  
any punitive tariffs in the banana dispute until the WTO rules on 
the appropriate size of the sanctions. But the did order importers 
of products on the retaliation list to start posting bonds and 
assume liability for the higher tariffs pending the WTO's final 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House today, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart  
said that the credibility of a rules-based trading system 
supervised by the WTO was at stake in the banana fight. ``The EU 
needs to understand how important it is to let the WTO do its 
work,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States contends that American banana companies are  
losing $520 million annually in lost sales to Europe because of 
illegal trade barriers that favor bananas imported from former 
European colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole Food Co., the major  
American companies involved, grow their bananas on plantations in 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans say politics is driving the United States to the brink  
of a trade war with its biggest trading partner. Carl Lindner, the 
head of Chiquita, is a major campaign contributor to both Democrats 
and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States won a WTO case on this issue, the EU  
argued that the matter needed further review because it has changed 
some banana import rules. But the United States has rejected the 
changes as failing to remove the objectionable barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The target list of products, first published last year, includes  
Louis Vuitton plastic handbags from France, sweet biscuits from 
Britain, Parma ham and pecorino cheese from Italy, German coffee 
makers and a host of less fancy imports ranging from plastic 
packing material to batteries.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Saving Open Spaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, celebrating the 150th  
birthday of the Interior Department, urged broad support Thursday 
for a $1 billion-a-year program to set aside treasured lands and 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, addressing a packed auditorium at the Interior  
headquarters, recalled a visit 30 years ago to the Grand Canyon 
when he watched the sunset across the canyon's multicolored cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got over it,'' said the president, adding that  
protection of such natural resources is at the heart of the 
Interior Department's history of land stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used the celebration to call on the Republican-led  
Congress to stop ``wasting precious time battling over senseless 
anti-environmental riders ... which I'm going to veto anyway'' and 
join in approving a permanent guarantee of annual funding for 
protecting open spaces and buying land for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term ``land legacy'' fund would be similar to what  
Clinton proposed as part of his budget last month, but the 
president said Congress should make such funding permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of bills already have been introduced by both Democrats  
and Republicans in the House and Senate that would boost spending 
for land preservation. The money would come from royalties on 
offshore oil leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Interior's block-long granite headquarters is but a few  
blocks from the White House, a presidential visit is a rarity with 
the last such visitor having been Jimmy Carter 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps more than any, the Interior Department really embodies  
the history of our country,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1849 after a rapid expansion of U.S. territory in the  
West, no federal agency played a greater role in the sculpture of 
America. It directed development of the West, parceling out 
millions of acres of land; opened vast areas to logging, ranching, 
mining and the railroads. In the 1880s the department controlled 
the destiny of more than 1 billion acres -- at the time nearly half 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's reach is still substantial as steward of 440  
million acres of land, including 378 units of the national park 
system, 514 refuges, wilderness areas, millions of acres of 
rangeland and such American crown jewels as Yellowstone National 
Park and the Grand Canyon 
</P>
<P>
	The halls of Interior headquarters, a massive building built as  
part of the Depression-era work programs, remind visitors of 
America's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor-to-ceiling murals, painted in the 1930s, show homesteaders  
racing westward vowing Oklahoma or bust; wildcatters working the 
oil fields of Texas; a landscape of barren Southwest desert turned 
to lush green thanks to a government dam and irrigation a dogsled 
team cross the wilds of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a real sense, the history of the Interior Department  
mirrors the history of American expansion and western settlement,'' 
said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who is the 47th person to 
head the department. ``It also dramatizes America's evolving 
relationship with the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Clinton's remarks, the Great American Indian Dancers  
performed a variety of Indian dances. The department in the 19th 
century was charged with dealing with Indians, sometimes with 
horrendous consequences. It remains the federal trust agency for 
Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a department whose primary concern was helping ranchers,  
timber and mining interests exploit American resources, the agency 
now often finds itself challenging those same industries to protect 
those same resources -- the grasslands, threatened species, scenic 
parks and wilderness and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	To expand such protection, Clinton said federal spending should  
be assured year-in-year-out. Congress long has authorized as much 
as $900 million for conservation-minded land purchases, but usually 
only about a third of that has been provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills introduced by Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and Sen.  
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., would establish permanent funding of more 
than $2 billion, including $900 million for land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	A different version, introduced by lawmakers mainly from coastal  
states with offshore oil interests, would calls for even more 
spending, but would earmark nearly $1.2 billion for mitigating 
coastal impacts from oil development. Environmentalists have 
opposed those bills because, they say, they would funnel 60 percent 
of the money to a half dozen states with offshore oil development 
and encourage new oil drilling.

<HEADLINE>  Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- The brother of a German citizen executed  
a week ago was poisoned by cyanide gas in Arizona's death chamber 
despite protests that reached the highest tribunals in Europe and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapped in a black padded chair in the gas chamber, Walter  
LaGrand quietly wept late Wednesday as he apologized to the family 
of a bank manager he and his brother fatally stabbed during a 
botched 1982 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He strained to locate Kathy Hartsock, whose father, Kenneth  
Hartsock, was stabbed two dozen times by the brothers at a bank in 
Marana, near Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my loved ones, I hope they find peace,'' he said as Ms.  
Hartsock clutched a photograph of her father. ``To all of you here 
today, I forgive you and I hope I can be forgiven in my next 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand died 18 minutes after executioners dropped cyanide  
pellets into a vat of distilled water and sulfuric acid, enveloping 
him in a cloud of white, steam-like fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both LaGrand, 37, and his brother, Karl, 35, chose the gas  
chamber in the hope that courts would rule the method a form of 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. In both cases, the 
U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal appeals court's restraining 
order barring Arizona from the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter LaGrand rejected such an offer and said he would  
prefer the more protracted and painful execution in the gas chamber 
to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany, and moved to  
southern Arizona as children after their mother married an American 
serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, asked the International  
Court of Justice in the Netherlands to intervene Wednesday after 
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull rejected appeals from German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The world court has no enforcement powers, but in a special  
hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri Lanka urged the U.S. 
government to prevent the execution. The brothers are the first 
German citizens executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	German officials said the brothers' executions violated  
international law because the brothers were not informed of their 
right to assistance from the German consulate after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials conceded that they violated the Vienna  
Convention but insisted the LaGrands were accorded all the rights 
any U.S. citizen would have received. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hadn't used the gas chamber since 1992, when inmate  
Donald Eugene Harding's death took 11 minutes and was considered so 
gruesome that Arizonans voted to require prisoners condemned after 
November 1992 to be executed by injection.

<HEADLINE> After Lewinsky, What Next for TV? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Closure for Monicagate? Don't hold your breath.  
</P>
<P>
	What was most notable about Barbara Walters' much-hyped  
interview with Monica Lewinsky was how it raised questions about an 
unknowable future, rather than resolving the bizarre twists of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that both parties to this ratings sweeps spectacular didn't  
shine in their prescribed roles. For Wednesday's special ``20/20'' 
edition, ABC News star Walters excelled as the caring but sometimes 
stern aunt trying to get to the bottom of this White House mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been described as a bimbo, a stalker and a  
seductress,'' Walters began, looking sad to have to say it. 
``Describe yourself.'' And they were off and running. 
</P>
<P>
	For the interview, taped in Manhattan on Feb. 20, Walters and  
Ms. Lewinsky sat facing each other from plush wing chairs in the 
studio set of a comfortable living room. But the program also wove 
in file footage and other visuals, as well as Walters in her other 
role as omniscient narrator laying out the saga of Oval Office 
shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the final fade-out, after two interminable hours (and  
more commercials than a viewer could count), the lasting impression 
dwelled not so much on what had transpired, but on what comes next 
in the celebrity pageant Walters presides over. Who will be the 
next notch on her belt? 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky showed herself to be poised and  
well-spoken, and almost eerily prepared. She claimed to have spent 
much of the past year worrying and knitting scarves. But judging 
from her smooth performance, the 25-year-old former White House 
intern might have been working with a media consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	She smiled demurely at the mention of her flashing her thong  
underwear at President Clinton, then described it as ``a small, 
subtle, flirtatious gesture, and that's me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The famous blue dress ... ,'' Walters said a little later.  
</P>
<P>
	``What dress?'' Ms. Lewinsky replied with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	When Walters asked Ms. Lewinsky whether Clinton was a sensuous  
man, she answered, ``I'll get in trouble.'' Responded Walters: 
``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in, Monica. You 
have immunity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But summing up the past year at the program's close, Ms.  
Lewinsky lost her composure. Effectively. She was brought to tears 
when she talked about her and her parents considering suicide 
during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have no idea what this has done,'' she said, glancing  
heavenward, her voice choking -- ``that behind the name Monica 
Lewinsky there's a person and there's a family, and so much pain 
has been caused by all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granted. But what happens next? Ms. Lewinsky seemed to have no  
real plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to make a contribution to society,'' she ventured,  
``a good contribution this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closure there, either.  
</P>
<P>
	For her final question, Walters asked what Ms. Lewinsky would  
tell her children in the future about the incident. ``Mommy made a 
big mistake,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's sitdown with Walters surely furthers her image  
resurrection that began last month with her television debut in the 
form of a prerecorded deposition for Clinton's impeachment trial. 
Taped a few days earlier, it was excerpted for the U.S. Senate and 
broadcast by TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Richly benefiting from low expectations, Ms. Lewinsky impressed  
her audience. Almost instantly the conventional wisdom did an 
about-face. For instance, New York magazine's Michael Wolff 
observed how, much to everyone's surprise, Monica Lewinsky has 
emerged not as damaged goods but as ``one of the major brand names 
of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting, then, that she would have allied herself with Walters,  
the reigning brand name of TV news. 
</P>
<P>
	But was closure for the Lewinsky affair anywhere in sight?  
</P>
<P>
	``This will put an end to it,'' Regis Philbin had proposed to  
Walters with ill-disguised longing when she dropped by ``Live with 
Regis and Kathie Lee'' on Wednesday morning. ``You know, to go to 
you for final absolution, and then it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is over,'' said Walters, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's GOT to be over after YOU!'' Regis erupted.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they were both right.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Boost Aviation Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal aviation-related spending would double  
over the next five years under legislation introduced Thursday by 
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster. The bill would 
require all airport taxes to be used for aviation investment, a 
move that would affect the overall budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration for five years will compete with significantly 
different bills proposed by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John 
McCain, R-Ariz., and the Clinton administration in what could be 
one of the biggest legislative battles of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster, R-Pa., a tenacious advocate of funding for  
transportation programs, has backing in the House in demanding that 
the Aviation Trust Fund, supported by airport user taxes, be spent 
solely on airport projects. But the idea faces strong Senate and 
administration opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in a major highway construction bill, he succeeded in  
boxing off a similar highway trust fund from any effort to spend 
the money for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he said, the airport fund will accumulate some $10  
billion in revenues but because of spending legislation approved 
last year, only $6 billion will be spent on airport improvements. 
The rest is counted toward the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	If the current system isn't changed, he said, the trust fund's  
balance will grow from $10 billion last year to more than $90 
billion in 2009. ``The money is there, it just isn't being spent,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his ``AIR 21'' bill, total FAA funding would grow from $10  
billion this year to more than $20 billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain would reauthorize the FAA for only two years and not  
change the status of the aviation trust fund. Neither would the 
five-year administration proposal, which would increase the airport 
ticket tax from $3 to $5 per airport and institute $1.5 billion in 
new user fees for the air traffic control system. 
</P>
<P>
	All three bills would try to increase competition by adding  
flights from O'Hare in Chicago and La Guardia and Kennedy in New 
York to smaller markets. They differ on increasing flights from 
Washington's Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, approved by the Senate Commerce Committee and  
awaiting floor action, would add 48 slots, or 24 round-trip 
flights, from Reagan National. Half of those new flights would go 
beyond the 1,250-mile limit set in 1986 for flights out of the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster would add only six slots at the Reagan National, and the  
administration bill, which would drop limits on flights into the 
Chicago and New York airports in five years, would not change the 
flights or the distance limit at the Washington airport. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill has drawn strong opposition from lawmakers  
representing the Washington metropolitan area. They say adding 
flights at Reagan National would damage the environment and hurt 
the other two regional airports, Dulles and Baltimore-Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in a Senate floor speech Thursday,  
stressed ``how detrimental this excessive increase in flights will 
be for our hard-fought regional balance, air traffic safety and 
consumer service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He introduced legislation to limit the number of new round-trip  
flights at Reagan National to 12, the number in a similar bill the 
Senate passed last year, 92-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach a House-Senate compromise last year on FAA  
reauthorization stalled over the increased flight issue, with Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the House Judiciary Committee chairman, 
strongly opposing more flights out of O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	A stopgap six-month bill was approved, and that legislation  
expires March 31. The House has already passed another six-month 
extension to give the two chambers time to work out their 
differences.

<HEADLINE>  Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- The brother of a German citizen executed  
a week ago was poisoned by cyanide gas in Arizona's death chamber 
despite protests that reached the highest tribunals in Europe and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapped in a black padded chair in the gas chamber, Walter  
LaGrand quietly wept late Wednesday as he apologized to the family 
of a bank manager he and his brother fatally stabbed during a 
botched 1982 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He strained to locate Kathy Hartsock, whose father, Kenneth  
Hartsock, was stabbed two dozen times by the brothers at a bank in 
Marana, near Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my loved ones, I hope they find peace,'' he said as Ms.  
Hartsock clutched a photograph of her father. ``To all of you here 
today, I forgive you and I hope I can be forgiven in my next 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand died 18 minutes after executioners dropped cyanide  
pellets into a vat of distilled water and sulfuric acid, enveloping 
him in a cloud of white, steam-like fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both LaGrand, 37, and his brother, Karl, 35, chose the gas  
chamber in the hope that courts would rule the method a form of 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. In both cases, the 
U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal appeals court's restraining 
order barring Arizona from the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter LaGrand rejected such an offer and said he would  
prefer the more protracted and painful execution in the gas chamber 
to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany, and moved to  
southern Arizona as children after their mother married an American 
serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, asked the International  
Court of Justice in the Netherlands to intervene Wednesday after 
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull rejected appeals from German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The world court has no enforcement powers, but in a special  
hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri Lanka urged the U.S. 
government to prevent the execution. The brothers are the first 
German citizens executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	German officials said the brothers' executions violated  
international law because the brothers were not informed of their 
right to assistance from the German consulate after their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials conceded that they violated the Vienna  
Convention but insisted the LaGrands were accorded all the rights 
any U.S. citizen would have received. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hadn't used the gas chamber since 1992, when inmate  
Donald Eugene Harding's death took 11 minutes and was considered so 
gruesome that Arizonans voted to require prisoners condemned after 
November 1992 to be executed by injection.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Lewinsky Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from ``Monica's Story,'' by Andrew Morton. The book  
chronicles Monica Lewinsky's relationship with President Clinton. 

</P>
<P>
	On the long flight to Washington (after graduating from college)  
she was mournful at leaving her old life behind, yet could not 
suppress her feelings of anticipation as new horizons beckoned her. 
Contemplating her days to come at the White House, (Ms. Lewinsky) 
thought, ``It's a great addition to my resume. It will be exciting. 
It's only for a short time, and it can't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a rueful smile, she now says, ``How wrong I was.''  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(President Clinton breaks off the relationship.)  
</P>
<P>
	The president told her that he no longer felt happy with their  
relationship, and that he wanted to end it. It was not right for 
him, or his family, nor did he believe it was right in the eyes of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to describe the pain and torment that having an  
extramarital affair gave him as a married man. Then, as his wife 
and daughter Chelsea played nearby in the White House swimming 
pool, he began to reveal the anguish in his soul. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his life, the president said, he had lived a secret  
existence, a life filled with lies and subterfuge. As a little boy 
he had lied to his parents, and, even though he was a smart kid and 
knew the consequences of his actions, he had maintained that hidden 
life, safe in the knowledge that no one knew about it, knew the 
true Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(Ms. Lewinsky learns she is on the witness list for Paula Jones'  
lawsuit against the president.) 
</P>
<P>
	As worried and alarmed as she was, Monica felt a brooding sense  
of outrage that Paula Jones' freedom to sue the president for money 
should take precedence over her right to privacy. As she says, ``It 
was nobody's business what the president and I did. I was never 
harassed. I lost my job because I was his girlfriend and the bottom 
line is that my affair with the president hampered, rather than 
helped my job prospects. In fact, my experience ruined Paula Jones' 
arguments about sexual harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(Ms. Lewinsky, on the aftermath.)  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last ten months I have seen the Special Prosecutor,  
the press, the White House and the public ripping apart layer upon 
layer of my soul. I don't know what I did to deserve that 
humiliation. Certainly I made mistakes and foolish judgments, but 
did they warrant this level of abuse? Yes, I probably am the most 
humiliated woman in the world, but I just can't deal with that 
thought. I have to block it out because it is too much to handle.''

<HEADLINE>  Dell, IBM Make $16 Billion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. will buy an estimated $16  
billion worth of equipment from International Business Machines 
Corp. under a seven-year deal that also calls for the companies to 
jointly develop new computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the agreement today sent the stock prices of  
both companies higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal initially calls for Dell to buy equipment from IBM  
including disk drives, flat-panel displays and memory chips. The 
companies eventually expect broader sharing of technology, 
including co-developing new products. 
</P>
<P>
	For IBM, the deal helps insure a steady and increasing flow of  
business from a company that is already one of its largest 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IBM will be able to make sure its future  
technologies are suited to customer's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Dell gets faster access to leading edge technology  
which could help set its computers apart from competitor's machines 
ranging from personal computers and laptops to central computers 
that manage corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the deal, Dell can continue to buy from a variety of  
suppliers but has a strong incentive to give a large chunk of 
business to IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our share of Dell's business should increase as a result,''  
said Dave Ernsberger, vice president of worldwide sales for IBM's 
technolgy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer makers are under intense pressure to shave costs and  
become more efficient amid a price-cutting war that has hurt even 
Dell, the fastest growing maker and the No. 2 manufacturer of PCs 
behind Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said the deal will help the company boost its  
competitiveness in notebook PCs, storage products and servers, 
which are powerful corporate machines that run networks of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Round Rock, Texas-based Dell reported last month that its  
fourth-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street expectations as it 
was hurt by rivals who bid more aggressively for corporate 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, the world's largest computer company,  
has been struggling for several years to lift sluggish sales of PCs 
and squeeze more profits from machines that have plummeted in 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM stock jumped $7.25, or 4 percent, to $174 per share in  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the 
announcement. Dell shares rose $3.43 3/4, also 4 percent, to $84.37 1/2 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In his first day on the job,  
Brazil's new central banker Arminio Fraga raised interest rates to 
45 percent Thursday in a controversial effort to stamp out 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga called the increase in the Central Bank's lending rate for  
commercial banks necessary to keep prices from exploding. ``Our 
main commitment is to (control) inflation,'' Fraga told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have risen sharply since January, when Brazil stopped  
spending dollars to prop up its currency. The real has lost about 
43 percent of its value since then, which has made imported goods 
and components more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets reacted well to Fraga's announcement. The  
Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Latin America's 
largest, closed up 3.9 percent. The real closed at 2.07 to the 
dollar from 2.14 at Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	But many economists say raising interest rates will have a  
disastrous impact on the deficit and recession. The government 
admits the economy will shrink 3 percent to 4 percent this year, 
and private analysts predict it will be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs said Wednesday that Brazil  
should immediately cut interest rates to 20 percent to create jobs 
and take pressure off the deficit. But Brazilians are afraid of a 
return of the four-digit inflation that plagued the economy for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inflation rate will determine whether or not we have  
problems,'' said Fraga, a former associate of U.S. financier George 
Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga gave himself powers to lower interest rates whenever he  
wanted but said the bank's monetary policy committee would have to 
approve any further increase. 
</P>
<P>
	By next month, Brazil expects to receive about $9 billion from a  
$41.5 billion aid package put together by the International 
Monetary Fund. The money will be available after the two sides 
reach an agreement on ways to fix the economy, which could be 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show of command by Fraga was seen as a positive sign, after  
a month when monetary policy was virtually adrift. Fraga's 
predecessor, Francisco Lopes, was fired on Feb. 2 for failing to 
stop speculation that weakened the real.

<HEADLINE> Subway Pusher Tells of 'Ghosts' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man accused of shoving a woman to her death  
under a subway train in January says he felt a ghostly sensation 
that made him do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Goldstein, who has a history of mental illness, said an  
irresistible force was driving his behavior as he walked on a 
subway platform, according to court papers filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I'm walking, I felt a sensation like something entering me,  
like a ghost or a spirit or something,'' Goldstein said in written 
statements he gave to police following his arrest. As the train 
approached, he felt an overwhelming desire ``to push, kick or 
punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent Wednesday to second-degree murder in the  
Jan. 3 death of Kendra Webdale, a 32-year-old aspiring screenwriter 
from Fredonia, N.Y., outside Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein, 29, said he pushed the woman into the path of the  
train. Police arrested Goldstein at the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Two psychiatrists told the court Goldstein is competent to stand  
trial, but Goldstein lawyer Harvey Fishbein has said his client 
suffers for severe schizophrenia and has for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on Goldstein's competency has been scheduled for March  
23.

<HEADLINE> Briton: Queen Must Open Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A British member of Parliament contends Queen  
Elizabeth II should open the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and the IOC 
would be violating its charter if she fails to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	As the head of state of Australia and some other Commonwealth  
nations -- as well as Britain -- the queen would normally open the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Australian cabinet members have supported Prime Minister  
John Howard's position that the prime minister, and not the queen, 
should have that role. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Kaufman, head of a parliamentary committee on sports and  
culture, said Thursday the Olympic Charter specified the head of 
state -- not head of government -- should have the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no way that the prime minister is the head  
of state of anywhere, including Australia,'' Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So why is the IOC allowing the charter to be violated by Mr.  
Howard being permitted to open the games?'' 
</P>
<P>
	British IOC member Craig Reedie suggested the IOC was flexible  
and that it was seeking ``an opinion from the government of 
Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue I must raise with my colleagues in Lausanne,''  
the Swiss city where the IOC is based, Reedie added. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman was not satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Australian cabinet has decided Mr. Howard should open the  
games. The IOC is said to be relaxed about this,'' Kaufman said. 
``How can it be relaxed about the violation of the charter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Buckingham Palace spokesman said no decision had been reached  
on the queen's role. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem could be eliminated Nov. 6 when Australians vote  
whether to keep the queen as head of state or install an Australian 
president.

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reducing the federal government's reach into  
local education, a congressional priority this year, is attracting 
attention in both the Senate and House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday began debating whether to extend the  
Education Flexibility Partnership Act, a pilot program now in 12 
states, to all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	A key House committee, meantime, cleared a companion bill.  
</P>
<P>
	The measures enjoy broad bipartisan support among Democrats and  
Republicans, including the nation's governors and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat, opposes  
the bill, saying there is no research to prove the five-year 
demonstration project has improved education. He said a November 
report by the General Accounting Office, which audits federal 
programs, found inconclusive results. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone also said poor and minority pupils could suffer if the  
program were expanded because states and school districts could 
evade accountability provisions in the federal law that directs 
education funds to those children. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this piece of legislation really is doing is it is  
essentially saying that we as a national community no longer are 
going to maintain our commitment to poor children in America,'' he 
said. ``That's what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone said the bill does not earmark additional funds for  
other needs -- such as new teachers and early education, nutrition 
and school repair programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ed-Flex program began in 1994 as a pilot effort in six  
states. It was expanded in 1996 to 12 states -- Colorado, Illinois, 
Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Oregon, Texas and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for increased accountability, local school districts  
get greater control over how they can spend federal education 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., rejected arguments that the program  
hurts children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no examples of how in any of those states the poor  
have been exploited or taken advantage of,'' said Wyden, a 
co-sponsor of the bill with Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``We have 
plenty examples of how 'Ed-Flex' has worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden cited a Maryland school able to halve its class sizes,  
from 25 pupils to 12. It also gave low-income Oregon high school 
students opportunities to take college-level computer courses. They 
had been limited to enrolling in the courses offered by their high 
school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased flexibility ``doesn't serve fewer poor kids,'' Wyden  
said. ``It serves more of them and it serves them better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even the bill's sponsors acknowledged the proposal was a  
first step toward addressing a host of issues plaguing public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is no silver bullet,'' Frist said.  
</P>
<P>
	A similar version passed a Senate committee last year, but the  
full Senate did not get to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate could extend into next week with Democrats offering  
various amendments to improve accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected one such proposal by Wellstone on Wednesday,  
while adopting two others by Wellstone and Sen. Edward Kennedy, 
D-Mass., who supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible amendment, which is expected to draw Republican  
opposition, would authorize the remainder of Clinton's plan to hire 
100,000 new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Education and Workforce Committee voted  
33-9 -- with support from 10 of 22 Democrats -- to send its companion 
education bill to the full House. A vote could come as early as 
next week, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S. 280; the House version is H.R 800.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Horse Breeder Faces Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- John T. Lundy, a former president of Kentucky's  
famed Calumet Farms, has been arrested after his indictment on 
charges of bribing a bank to secure loans for his then-failing 
thoroughbred stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-count indictment, returned Dec. 11 by a Houston federal  
grand jury and unsealed Wednesday, names Lundy and his former 
lawyer, Gary Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with one count each of conspiracy to defraud a  
financial institution, scheme to defraud, bank bribery and three 
counts of false statements to bank officials, a federal prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from an investigation into loan activity  
involving now-defunct First City Bancorporation of Houston. Federal 
prosecutors have been investigating how and why First City went 
bankrupt in 1988 and again in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, former First City Bancorp vice chairman Frank Cihak and  
four associates were convicted on fraud and money laundering 
charges stemming from a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme arising 
from loans that led to the bank's 1992 failure. Cihak is serving 
two federal prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy is accused of offering at least $1 million to First City  
loan officials in exchange for approval of a $50 million loan, 
assistant U.S. attorney Julia Hyman told The Associated Press late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation is continuing,'' she said, declining to  
comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials arrested Lundy on Tuesday night in Miami as he  
was arriving from Venezuela. Matthews, once Calumet's chief 
financial officer, was arrested Wednesday in Lexington, Ky. He was 
released on a $10,000 bond and directed to report to court in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	A bond hearing was set for 2 p.m. Friday in Miami for Lundy.  
Neither man could be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments are the latest pieces in a mysterious puzzle  
surrounding the First City investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank was Calumet Farms' biggest creditor and received $20  
million insurance payout after the stables' most famous stud -- 
Alydar -- died under mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hyman declined comment on whether prosecutors believe  
Alydar's death was engineered to help pay off a promised bribe to 
First City. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, a former Calumet groom received prison time and  
probation after his conviction for lying to a grand jury 
investigating the Alydar death. 
</P>
<P>
	Alton Stone was the watchman on duty at the financially  
struggling Lexington farm on the night of Nov. 13, 1990, when the 
1978 Triple Crown runnerup was discovered with a broken right rear 
leg. An investigation ensued because the animal was the most 
heavily insured thoroughbred in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Calumet went into bankruptcy in 1991 under the direction of  
Lundy, the former president. The bankruptcy was the largest farm 
collapse in thoroughbred history, and the $36.5 million Alydar 
insurance claim was the largest of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Alydar ran a close second to Affirmed in each of the 1978 Triple  
Crown races, and their rivalry became etched in racing lore. Alydar 
had the better of it at stud, producing champions who made him the 
world's leading sire when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm's bankruptcy listed debts of more than $120 million. It  
was sold the next year at auction for $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy, who resigned as farm president in April 1991, took over  
the horse-breeding institution when his grandmother-in-law, 
Calument matriarch Lucille Wright Markey, died in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Special Delivery: Rodman-Grams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This postman always clicks twice.  
</P>
<P>
	Readers of this column recently were provided with an e-mail  
address and invited to respond. Predicting which topics would draw 
the most responses was easy; it was much tougher to anticipate the 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a sampling:  

</P>
<P>
	A column on Dennis Rodman, (``Close Cover Before Striking''),  
noted that the Worm's rap sheet from his time with the San Antonio 
Spurs included, among other things, stockinged-feet strikes. 

</P>
<P>
	From Trey McClure:  
</P>
<P>
	``If you researched the reason Rodman took off his shoes ... you  
might find he has a rare skin disease that causes his covered feet 
to heat up more than the average person. The best way for him to 
cool them off is to take off his shoes. ... There needs to be more 
written about Rodman's pre-basketball days, then maybe people would 
understand why he is the way he is.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Trey:  
</P>
<P>
	Excuses, excuses. I can't believe being forced to wear ``Dr.  
Dentons' '' is the reason little Dennis grew up to become such a 
menace. 

</P>
<P>
	A column about golf's Match Play Championships, (``Sure These  
Guys Are Good. But Are They Interesting?'') argued that fans lost 
out when journeymen Jeff Maggert and Andrew Magee wound up in the 
final. 

</P>
<P>
	From Hugh Bursi:  
</P>
<P>
	``Good, but not interesting, was a pretty apt description of the  
article itself. If you wanted to write something interesting, why 
didn't you write about how Tiger choked in his match against 
Maggert?'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Hugh:  
</P>
<P>
	Now it can be told: Tiger choked because he couldn't take off  
his shoes between shots. 

</P>
<P>
	From Don Wozniak:  
</P>
<P>
	``It was refreshing to hear the announcers lavish praise on  
someone other than Tiger. ... If the media only wants to see 
marquee players and juvenile displays of emotion, you are right 
about this event not being interesting. But for showing top-quality 
competition and conduct, there has never been a better telecast.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Don:  
</P>
<P>
	Is it possible you got your channels crossed? I turned on the  
set Sunday hoping to see a marquee player display some juvenile 
emotion, but all I got was top-quality competition and conduct, 
too. After a while, though, I realized I was watching Rodman and 
the Lakers playing Houston. 

</P>
<P>
	A column about Walter Payton and his battle with a rare liver  
disease, (``A Message Worth Repeating''), stirred personal memories 
and even prompted one offer of a liver for transplant. 

</P>
<P>
	From an Interested Party:  
</P>
<P>
	``I know this might be an odd e-mail, but I would really like  
information on what kind of donor Walter Payton needs. ... P.S.: I 
am a very healthy white woman, age 38. Do not drink or do any 
drugs, except prescription. This story has really torn at my heart 
and would really like to help.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Interested Party:  
</P>
<P>
	While still awaiting a transplant, Payton's condition has  
stabilized and he is resting comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, spokeswoman Pam Silvestri of the Southwest Transplant  
Alliance, part of a national network of agencies providing 
information and assistance on organ donation, said Payton's story 
has been the best thing for business since Yankee great Mickey 
Mantle went on the liver-transplant list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our agencies report 20-to-30 requests a month,'' she  
said. ``They're averaging that many every day now, and in the 
Chicago area, it's two or three times that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Incredible'' is the way Silvestri described the number of  
people designating Payton for directed donations -- that is, a 
donation made to a designated recipient if the organ is compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that one reader had offered a liver on the spot, she  
laughed. ``We've got a few of those, too. Tell her as long as she's 
alive, she'll need to hang on to it.'' 

</P>
<P>
	A column on Latrell Sprewell moving to New York, (``The NBA Gets  
Off On The Wrong Foot''), speculated about how a known tough guy 
would make out in an even tougher town. 

</P>
<P>
	From Jeff Gomez:  
</P>
<P>
	``If you feel compelled to write about how he tormented other  
players and coaches and will continue to do so in the future, I 
hope you'd be able to say those same comments to his face. If you 
can honestly answer ``yes,'' then I don't criticize you one bit for 
your article.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Jeff:  
</P>
<P>
	The day Spree asks for a heart-to-heart is the day I enroll in  
the federal witness-protection program. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Agree to Budget Frame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders agreed  
Thursday on a framework for the fiscal 2000 budget that they said 
would prevent Social Security surpluses from being used for tax 
cuts, and would stick to spending limits enacted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, announced at the end of weeks of private meetings  
among top House and Senate Republicans, would also allow for a tax 
cut that would begin next year, just as the presidential and 
congressional election campaigns are under way. But next year's tax 
reduction would likely be relatively small because lawmakers would 
have to find savings and new revenues to pay for them.

<HEADLINE> Norman Returns To Regular PGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Greg Norman should have realized a year ago that  
his left shoulder was falling apart. No other tournament seems to 
gauge the state of his game quite like the Doral-Ryder Open. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time he first made the Florida swing the unofficial  
start of his PGA Tour season, Norman has finished out of the top 10 
at Doral only twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he never shot better than 71 and finished in a tie for  
36th. He proceeded to have his worst year on the PGA Tour -- no wins 
and 53rd on the final money list, the first time he finished 
outside the top 50 since he joined the tour in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Norman failed to break par and missed the cut for the first time  
at 3-over 147. He withdrew from The Players Championship and then 
missed the cut in the Masters. Ten days later, he was on the 
operating table and was done for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	What will this year hold for Norman?  
</P>
<P>
	He could get an early indication today when he plays his first  
72-hole event on the PGA Tour since the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of this year, I could be very, very happy,'' Norman  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be a great place to start.  
</P>
<P>
	Norman has had more success at Doral than any other PGA Tour  
event. He has won three times, and two of those victories include a 
course-record 62. Norman's scoring average at the Blue Monster in 
38 rounds is 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to play again. I love being out there,'' Norman said.  
``I think that's what I missed the most. I didn't miss the game, 
but I missed being out there on the golf course playing at a 
competitive level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly Norman returns to his competitive standards remains  
to be seen. After missing the cut in the Holden International, the 
first time he has done that in Australia in two decades, Norman 
finished second in the Australian Masters when he was beaten by 
Craig Spence with a birdie on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last week, he collapsed down the stretch in the second  
round against Eduardo Romero. Three-up with four holes left, Romero 
squared the match with one of the best shots of the year, a 7-iron 
from 169 yards into a foot on the 18th, then won on the third extra 
hole with a 25-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his peers say winning appears to be only a matter of  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like he has been away from the game at all to  
me,'' Nick Price said. ``He is very strong right now and he has put 
on a bit of weight, which I think he has tried to do. He's still 
got that intensity in his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els said the confidence of being in contention is all that  
Norman is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his game is back,'' Els said. ``It's just pulling the  
trigger and trying to win tournaments now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has fallen to No. 31 in the world rankings,  
Norman is the biggest name at what is usually one of the strongest 
tournament fields of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Norman once said the PGA Tour doesn't really start  
until Doral. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's changed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A look at who is taking the week off indicates that much.  
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, who has been skiing in Idaho when not shooting 59  
on Sunday, decided to go home to Jacksonville for the first time 
since New Year's Day. Tiger Woods opted not to play for the sixth 
straight week. Mark O'Meara is trying to see if the slopes will do 
for him what's it has done for Duval -- he's in Utah this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Els, at No. 4, is the only player in the top seven at Doral this  
week. A year ago, it had five of the top six players in the world 
and nine of the top 10 on the PGA money list. Most of it has to do 
with the Match Play Championship, the first of three $5 million 
world events added to the schedule this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf's elite could no longer wait until Doral to start getting  
their games in shape for the Masters, not with a $1 million carrot 
dangling at the end of the stick at La Costa. And not even a $1 
million increase in the purse at Doral could change some players' 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, players have criticized the redesign of the Blue Course  
two years ago, when Raymond Floyd added a bevy of fairway bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a number of years where Doral stood out from  
everybody else primarily because of its purse and the golf 
course,'' Finchem said. ``It's leveled off a bit. We will look at 
it, but honestly, I can't be overly concerned. We'll have a great 
leader board and a great tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Norman is back on his game, maybe Doral will have a great  
champion again.

<HEADLINE> Debate Continues Over Gibraltar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GIBRALTAR (AP) -- Everywhere you turn on this big British rock,  
ancient cannons face the Spanish mainland. No shots have been fired 
for generations, but the 300-year sovereignty dispute over the 
colony is still very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flap began in January when Spanish fishermen accused  
Gibraltar of violating access rights around the rock, a 
2 1/2-square-mile promontory that juts out from the Spanish shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Madrid and London traded insults and threats and Spain clamped  
down on its border crossing controls, threatening even tougher 
measures to isolate the tiny colony. 
</P>
<P>
	London tabloids stoked British pride over the dispute and a few  
members of Parliament demanded the immediate dispatch of warships. 
</P>
<P>
	Matters calmed a bit after a meeting of foreign ministers on  
Feb. 21, but Spain has pledged a new pressure campaign and still 
wants to retrieve Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
	Towering at 1,300 feet over the western entrance to the  
Mediterranean, Gibraltar has always loomed large in history. It was 
one of Hercules' mythical pillars, the target of countless battles 
and sieges between European and Arab powers and a crucial British 
naval post during two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
	At the threshold of the 21st century, Gibraltar's military value  
is diminishing. But the sovereignty issue is still capable of 
setting Britain and Spain at each other's throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain ceded Gibraltar to England in  
1713 but retained first preference should London ever disown it. 
With Britain shedding its colonies, Spain is pushing that 
prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the limestone rock, the 30,000 Gibraltarians abhor the  
idea of being ruled by Spain, which has laid siege to the colony 
more than a dozen times since 1713. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco blocked overland  
entry to the rock for 13 years beginning in 1969. The measure split 
families and caused job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Spain has not been much friendlier, periodically  
imposing border controls and refusing virtually all official 
cooperation with the rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibraltar accuses Spain of ignoring the will of the colony's  
citizens. In a 1967 referendum, 12,000 Gibraltarians voted to 
retain British ties while just 44 people favored joining Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here feel very strongly British. ... There's no desire  
to break off constitutional links and still less in any deal with 
Spain,'' said Gibraltar's Chief Minister, Peter Caruana. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's position is that it cannot alter Gibraltar's status  
against the wishes of the rock's inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	Most rock residents say they feel Gibraltarian, not British or  
Spanish, but admit they have more in common with their Spanish 
neighbors across the narrow isthmus that constitutes the frontier 
than with their British compatriots thousands of miles to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is we magnify our differences and choose to ignore  
what unites us,'' said a resident who gave his name as Jesus, 60, a 
Spanish-born Gibraltarian who has lived on the rock for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While replete with distinctly English-style bars and fish and  
chip shops, Gibraltar has no agriculture or manufacturing. Almost 
everything is imported from or via Spain. Spanish is the dominant 
language, even among its English bobby-style police officers. 
Heated arguments over Spanish soccer teams are as common here as 
anywhere on the Iberian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	But one main difference is economic. Once totally dependent on  
British aid as a military garrison, Gibraltar has become a thriving 
duty-free tourist town and an offshore financial haven. Wages are 
double those in Spain and prices on many items are half as much. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic success contrasts with the poverty of nearby  
Spanish port towns. Some in Spain complain that Gibraltar also 
profits from money laundering and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar  
presented his British counterpart, Tony Blair, with a report 
documenting Spanish seizures of Gibraltar-based yachts and other 
vessels found transporting drugs under the cover of murky shell 
companies operating in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides give lip service to favoring dialogue, but talks have  
been largely fruitless. Madrid has insisted on dealing only with 
London, while Gibraltar has demanded an equal say in its future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spain demands to talk to the organ grinder not the monkey, but  
it's got to realize that the decisions on Gibraltar's future will 
come from Gibraltar and not from London,'' said Paul Preston, a 
professor of Spanish studies at the London School of Economics and 
author of several books on Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many, Preston believes Gibraltar has no choice but to do  
business with Spain, but he believes Madrid must first make a 
lucrative offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's latest proposal is shared sovereignty, with gradual  
incorporation into Spain, but with strong Gibraltar self-government 
and the right for its citizens to British nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	At the latest talks, however, the mention of Spanish sovereignty  
brought an outright rejection from Gibraltar.

<HEADLINE> D.C. To Court Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seats at RFK Stadium have been realigned.  
Base paths have been carved out of fresh sod for the first time in 
six years, all awaiting the arrival of the Montreal Expos for a 
couple of days next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Next time, maybe they'll stay a lot longer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say that they'll find a much larger and warmer  
welcome than they have in their own home stadium for quite some 
time,'' said Mike Scanlon, part of a group that wants to bring 
major league baseball to the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	It's mere coincidence that the Expos are accompanying the St.  
Louis Cardinals for a pair of exhibition games at RFK on April 2 
and 3. When the event was arranged, the big attraction was supposed 
to be Mark McGwire; now the focus will be on a financially troubled 
team on display in an area that's been trying lure baseball back 
since the Senators left to become the Texas Rangers 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are closer now than we ever have been,'' said Jim  
Dalrymple, who has been working on the task for 14 years as 
executive director of the District of Columbia Sports Commission. 
``I think we've got the right game plan in place. We just need a 
little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of relocation does not sit well with major league baseball  
-- no team has moved since the Senators. But with a Saturday 
deadline approaching for a financing plan for a new stadium in 
Montreal and no money in sight, commissioner Bud Selig is expected 
to give Expos president Claude Brochu permission next week to 
negotiate with out-of-town bidders who could buy the team and move 
it elsewhere as early as the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading contenders would be groups from Charlotte, N.C.,;  
the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia -- the generic name 
for the densely populated suburbs to the west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	For fans in the D.C. region, it's another hill on a roller  
coaster ride that has left them somewhat jaded. It seems there's a 
new team every other year that is rumored to be on the verge of 
coming to the Washington area -- the Astros and Pirates were the 
most recent. 
</P>
<P>
	The group from Northern Virginia, headed by telecommunications  
executive William Collins, has come close twice. Collins made the 
finals in the last round of expansion in 1995 and had a handshake 
agreement to buy the Astros had voters not approved a new stadium 
there by a narrow margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to deal,'' said Scanlon, executive vice president  
of the Collins group. ``We would welcome Claude and any other 
members of his group in our membership group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer Douglas Jemal, who wants a team in the  
district, is also waiting for the go-ahead to negotiate with 
Brochu. Tim Newman, vice president of entrepreneur Don Beaver's 
group in Charlotte, said such talk is ``all premature,'' but that 
Beaver is ``monitoring the situation very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While each bid has promise, all three have their drawbacks,  
starting with how to finance a $300 million stadium and where to 
build it. And, for the two D.C. area groups, there will be certain 
opposition from Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, whose team 
draws heavily from the Washington area and considers the region one 
big market. Of the Northern Virginia bid, Angelos had said that if 
the state of Virginia wants a team, it should be placed in 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baltimore and Washington have always been separate markets,''  
Scanlon said. ``There is no way people in Virginia consider 
themselves a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that Mr. Angelos would make such a statement,''  
said Gabe Paul, executive director of the state-created Virginia 
Baseball Stadium Authority. ``The Orioles, in order to move from 
St. Louis in 1954, had to ask for and receive permission from the 
Senators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte group doesn't have to deal with Angelos, but it's  
biggest drawback could be its plan to have the Expos play in the 
Charlotte Knights' minor league stadium -- expanded to seat perhaps 
25,000 -- during the two years it would take to build a new 
facility. The two D.C. area groups would use RFK, which housed the 
Senators, as an interim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Collins group also has a head start on the financial end.  
The Virginia legislature has approved partial funding for a stadium 
and given Gov. Jim Gilmore authority to negotiate the rest of the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for Northern Virginia is because of the growth of  
this region,'' Paul said. ``How can baseball overlook the No. 7 
(television) market in the country forever?''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Comeback One for Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Theo Fleury simply may have been trying to  
boost the spirits of his new teammates. Or maybe he had a gut 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	With Colorado trailing Florida 5-1 after two periods Wednesday  
night, the Avalanche's newest acquisition -- out nursing a knee 
injury -- predicted his new team would rally to win 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out he underestimated his teammates. Colorado stormed  
back for a 7-5 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine how potent the Avalanche are going to be when Fleury  
does his best work on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm going to get to play with these guys?'' Fleury said in  
amazement after watching the Avalanche score seven unanswered goals 
to match the NHL record for the biggest comeback in a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other teams have rallied to win from a five-goal deficit,  
the last time coming Dec. 26, 1991. That's when the New York 
Rangers climbed out of a 6-1 hole in the first period to beat the 
Washington Capitals 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's feat is likely to go down as the most remarkable  
because of the short time frame the Avalanche had to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche trailed 5-0 when Peter Forsberg broke the drought  
with 1:49 left in the second period, fighting off Florida's Bret 
Hedican to put a backhander behind Sean Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	That only set the table for a six-goal third period, which  
opened with Claude Lemieux's power-play goal after 17 seconds and 
snowballed with a four-goal binge over the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Goals by Adam Deadmarsh and Chris Drury 41 seconds apart tied  
the game at 15:41. Milan Hejduk put Colorado ahead at 17:40, and 
Forsberg scored an unassisted goal 49 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we walked out for the third, we said if we get a  
power-play goal, maybe we have a chance,'' Forsberg said. ``We got 
it right off the bat and after that, we just kept on working. It 
turned out pretty good at the end there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg finished with three goals and three assists, his best  
outing in the NHL and matching a club record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Forsberg? He put on quite a display of his immense  
talent,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley said. ``He was outstanding out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley had raised some eyebrows when he put Forsberg and Joe  
Sakic on the same line in early December. The duo has combined for 
32 goals and 52 assists in 30 games since then, and the rest of the 
Avalanche haven't lagged, either, with 66 goals during the same 
span. 
</P>
<P>
	Mix in Fleury, who tallied 30 goals and 39 assists in Calgary  
before last Sunday's trade, and the Avalanche can match anybody's 
firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 20 games to go, this is a great sign for our season,''  
Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got worse for the Panthers on Thursday, when they learned  
high-scoring Pavel Bure would be lost for at least two weeks with 
torn knee cartilage. He was scheduled for arthroscopic surgery 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure's three goals -- his second hat trick in 11 games this  
season -- had helped stake the Panthers to the 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's as tough a loss as any I've ever been a part of,''  
Florida captain Scott Mellanby said. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second time this season Florida had blown a  
sizeable lead. In December, the Panthers squandered a four-goal 
edge against Ottawa before escaping 6-5.

<HEADLINE>  Leafs' McCauley Taken to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs center Alyn McCauley was  
taken from the ice on a stretcher after being checked hard into the 
boards early in the third period of a game against the New Jersey 
Devils on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley was driven heavily into the end boards by Devils  
defenseman Sheldon Souray at the 6:51 mark of the third period. 
McCauley's left shoulder and head appeared to take the brunt of 
Souray's hit against the glass next to New Jersey goalie Martin 
Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	McCauley appeared to lose consciousness and lay motionless on  
the ice for several minutes. He was attended to by four emergency 
personnel including Maple Leafs team doctor Leith Douglas who 
directed the crew to fit McCauley with a neck brace. McCauley was 
lifted onto a stretcher and taken along with his fiancee to Toronto 
Western Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said that he suffered a head injury and that he  
had movement in all of his extremities. He was to spend the night 
in hospital and be re-examined Thursday. While the injury was not 
considered serious, coach Pat Quinn was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was unconscious for quite a while,'' Quinn said. ``We won't  
know anything until the evaluation is complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey was leading 3-2 at the time, and the Devils went on  
to a 5-2 victory. The game was delayed about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	It been a tough season for McCauley, who was playing in just his  
fourth game after missing 22 with a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For Larry Walker, the first day of the exhibition season  
couldn't have been much better. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies outfielder, who won a batting title and the  
National League MVP award in the past two years, agreed Thursday to 
a $75 million, six-year contract extension, then drove in two runs 
with a home run and a single against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to relax, finally,'' said Walker, who jumped into a  
tie for sixth on the salary scale. ``I've been shaking for the last 
three days, not only thinking about six years and all the money 
that's involved, but just the fact that it's over and we can quit 
talking about `What if?' I'm so elated it's sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, will make $5,075,000 this season as he finishes a  
five-year contract. The new deal calls for a $1 million signing 
bonus, $12 million each in 2000 and 2001 and $12.5 million annually 
from 2002-05. 
</P>
<P>
	His new deal, with a $12.5 million average annual value, ties  
him with Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez and New York Yankees 
outfielder Bernie Williams, behind only Los Angeles pitcher Kevin 
Brown ($15 million), Anaheim first baseman Mo Vaughn ($12.33 
million), Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson ($13.1 million) and New 
York Mets catcher Mike Piazza and Baltimore outfielder Albert Belle 
($13 million each). 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied Martinez for fifth in total dollars, trailing Brown  
($105 million), Piazza ($91 million), Williams ($87.5 million) and 
Vaughn ($80 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing was to stay here,'' Walker said. ``I was going  
to say the money doesn't need to be astronomical going through the 
roof, but it is. You think about it, it's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nearly 19 years after an angry parting with the Boston Red  
Sox, Carlton Fisk is considering returning to the team for which he 
hit one of baseball's most famous homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the field Thursday before Boston's spring training  
opener, Fisk said he had a ``nice conversation'' with general 
manager Dan Duquette in the morning and planned further 
discussions. Although an exact role hasn't been determined, 
Duquette said Fisk could be ``a role model, a liaison'' or a 
catching instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Coral Gables, Fla., Florida Marlins third-base prospect  
Mike Lowell, recovering from surgery for testicular cancer, went to 
the ballpark for therapy. Lowell, unlikely to return by opening 
day, sat in the stands, soaked up some sunshine and watched the 
Marlins' exhibition opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching baseball is a breath of fresh air,'' Lowell said. ``I  
just wanted to catch the game and see some guys play. It's good 
therapy, to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Dunedin, Fla., the Toronto Blue Jays said David Wells will  
be back on the field Friday after four days of treatment for back 
spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Winter Haven, Fla., Mark Whiten's stress fracture in his  
right foot, now expected to keep him off the field 4-7 weeks, could 
give a couple of prospects a chance to prove themselves. Rookie 
outfielders Jacob Cruz and Alex Ramirez will now get longer looks 
as the Indians could be searching for a backup center fielder 
behind Kenny Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Bradenton, Fla., the Pirates have not altered their offer  
to first baseman Kevin Young, who said he is frustrated by the lack 
of progress in contract talks. Young wants a 4- to 5-year contract 
in the $6 million-per-year range, while the Pirates have not budged 
off their offer of $16.5 million over three seasons.

<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., the World Series champions started 1999 the same  
way they ended 1998: with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Spencer had an RBI double during a two-run seventh inning.  
Both starters, New York's Orlando Hernandez and Toronto's Chris 
Carpenter, allowed one run and two hits in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez struck out four and walked one, while Carpenter fanned  
two. Jeff Nelson was the winner and Mariano Rivera got the save as 
four New York relievers combined to allow one run and three hits. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Red Sox 9, Twins (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., newcomer Jose Offerman doubled in one run  
and Nomar Garciaparra tripled in one in a five-run third inning. In 
their first game since Mo Vaughn signed with Anaheim, the Red Sox 
had 16 hits, seven for extra bases. Two were solo homers by Bob 
Hamelin in the fourth and Lou Merloni in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Rapp, signed as a free agent after going 12-13 with Kansas  
City last season, got the win after allowing one run and two hits

</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., the Rockies scored three runs in the eighth  
off closer Gregg Olson, who had 30 saves last year in a big 
comeback season. Derrick Gibson tied it at 6 with a two-run double 
and Chris Sexton doubled past diving Andy Fox at third base for the 
go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Stottlemyre, in his Diamondbacks debut, gave up three runs  
and three hits in two innings. He experimented with a new changeup 
and didn't throw his slider. Colorado starter Brian Bohanon allowed 
two runs and one hit in two innings, struck out three and walked 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 *Athletics 7, Brewers 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, AL Rookie of the Year Ben Grieve hit a grand slam  
off Hector Ramirez to cap a seven-run third inning. Brewers starter 
Bill Pulsipher retired his first six batters, then gave up two 
singles opening the third. Ramirez, a non-roster invitee who 
pitched for Florida's Triple-A team at Charlotte last season, 
allowed six of seven batters to reach base, and five scored. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Phillies 13, South Florida 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Clearwater, Fla., Curt Schilling, coming off consecutive 	
300-strikeout seasons, pitched three perfect innings and struck out 
six. Schilling, who led the National League in innings, strikeouts

<HEADLINE> Russian Gov't Shakeup Rumors Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin fired controversial tycoon Boris  
Berezovsky as head of an alliance of former Soviet republics 
Thursday, and reports that Yeltsin was planning to reshuffle his 
Cabinet again sent Russian lawmakers into a political frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential aides quickly denied any such plans, but Communists  
and other hard-liners who dominate the parliament's lower house, 
the State Duma, took the reports seriously. The issue dominated the 
Duma floor and national television news. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media reports claimed that Yeltsin told Prime Minister  
Yevgeny Primakov he had 10 days to purge the government of all 
Communists, or risk getting booted himself. The alleged threat 
appeared to target two deputy prime ministers, Yuri Maslyukov and 
Gennady Kulik. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov is the highest-ranking Communist in the government,  
while Kulik is a member of the Agrarian Party, a hard-line faction 
that often aligns itself with the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin immediately denied the  
reports, calling them ``complete rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, still in the hospital recovering from a recurring  
ulcer, ``has made no statements on this topic, he has not demanded 
anything from anyone,'' Yakushkin told the NTV television station. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian president abruptly fired the entire Cabinet two  
times last year, contributing to the nation's economic crisis. He 
often acts rashly after recovering from an illness to show that 
he's still in control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of a government shakeup have been circulating in Moscow  
for the past few weeks and have not been quelled by Kremlin 
denials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, (a reshuffle) is bound to happen,'' said  
Sergei Ivanenko, a lawmaker with the liberal Yabloko faction. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky, a billionaire with holdings in oil, media and  
airlines, was named last March to oversee the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, an unruly alliance of 12 former Soviet 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is chairman of the CIS, a mostly ceremonial post. The  
other CIS countries must approve Berezovsky's ouster, but none is 
likely to protest the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister has publicly criticized Berezovsky for  
meddling in the Cabinet's work, and several recent police raids and 
probes have targeted companies believed to be controlled by the 
tycoon.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Re-Sign Cornerback Beasley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Restricted free agent Aaron Beasley,  
who started at cornerback the last two seasons for Jacksonville, 
was one of six players signed Thursday by the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	The others five were reserves; running back Chris Howard,  
linebackers Eddie Mason and Erik Storz and defensive ends Jabbar 
Threats and Lamanzer Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deals were not disclosed, although last month the  
Jaguars tendered the minimum offer of one year and $429,000 to 
Beasley, a three-year veteran who will become an unrestricted free 
agent after next season. He has started 29 of the 34 games he has 
played, and has five career interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats, an undrafted rookie out of Michigan State in 1997,  
spent the last 12 games of last season on injured reserve with a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams saw limited action last season after being drafted in  
the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard was signed from the Denver Broncos' practice squad last  
September after James Stewart went down with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mason and Storz came to the Jaguars in the middle of last  
season.

	Dow Gains 191.52  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied hard today after two days of weak  
performance, boosted by benign economic data, strong retail sales 
reports and higher oil prices. At the close of trading on Wall 
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 191.52 at 9,467.40, 
near the day's high. The blue-chip index more than erased the 
48-point loss over the previous two sessions and ended above 9,400 
for the first time in more than a week. NYSE advancers led 
decliners 1,717-1,187 The Nasdaq ended at 2,293.04 points, up

	GOP Leaders OK Budget Framework  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders agreed today  
on a framework for the fiscal 2000 budget that they said would 
prevent Social Security surpluses from being used for tax cuts, and 
would stick to spending limits enacted two years ago. The GOP plan 
would also allow for a tax cut that would begin next year, just as 
the presidential and congressional election campaigns are under 
way. But next year's tax reduction would likely be relatively small 
because lawmakers would have to find savings and new revenues to 
pay for them.

	Marine Pilot Cleared in Italy Crash  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot charged with  
recklessly flying his jet into an Italian ski gondola cable, 
killing 20 people, was aquitted today. Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, was 
charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count 
each of destroying government property, destroying private 
property, dereliction of duty and failure to plan the flight 
properly. He faced a possible sentence of 206 years if he had been 
convicted of all charges. The crash and its aftermath strained 
relations between the United States and Italy, a NATO ally.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun, who wrote the 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
nationwide and ignited a still-raging moral and political debate, 
died today at 90. He had retired in 1994 after serving 24 years on 
the nation's highest court. Blackmun died at a hospital in suburban 
Arlington, Va., from complications following hip-replacement 
surgery performed nine days earlier. He had fallen and broken his 
hip at home a day before the operation. Blackmun was considered a 
staunch conservative in his early days on the court. But by the 
time he retired, he was considered its most liberal justice.

	Noriega Gets Sentence Reduced

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge reduced Manuel Noriega's prison  
sentence from 40 years to 30 today, meaning the former Panamanian 
dictator could be eligible for release by 2007. Noriega, 62, 
captured after the United States invaded Panama in 1989, was sent 
to prison for money laundering and drug trafficking. The judge said 
he shortened Noriega's sentence after considering the nature of his 
confinement and the ``disparity between the defendant's sentence 
and the sentences served by his co-conspirators'' -- some of whom 
are out of prison.

	Judge Throws Out La. Abortion Law  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal judge today struck down a Louisiana  
law aimed at banning the late-term procedure known as partial birth 
abortion. The law's supporters said it outlawed the procedure 
doctors call dilation and extraction, but U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Porteous sided with those who said the law could be 
interpreted more broadly. Opponents said the law would have 
outlawed all abortions because it forbade any abortion performed 
once any part of a fetus enters the birth canal.

good today, and the Huskies held on for a 57-56 victory over Seton 
Hall in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. Connecticut

semifinals against the winner of the quarterfinal between 
fourth-seeded Syracuse and fifth-seeded Villanova.

<HEADLINE> Cole Named New RNC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tom Cole, Oklahoma's secretary of state and a  
political consultant, was named chief of staff for the Republican 
National Committee today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom brings a wealth of political and administrative experience  
based on his years as a party elected official,'' said RNC chairman 
Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My loss is definitely the RNC's gain,'' said Oklahoma Gov.  
Frank Keating, who appointed Cole secretary of state in January 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson has been under pressure to strengthen the party's  
political operation after weaker-than-expected results in 
November's midterm elections. Cole is president of a nationally 
recognized public relations, strategic planning and polling firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive director of the GOP House campaign committee  
from 1991 to 1993, an Oklahoma state senator from 1988 to 1991 and 
state party chairman from 1985 to 1989.

<HEADLINE> Jury in Gondola Case Deliberates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Eight military jurors began a second  
day of deliberations today on whether a Marine pilot whose jet hit 
an Italian ski gondola cable last year is guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter for the 20 people who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury met for about four hours Wednesday afternoon. Six of  
the eight officers on the jury must vote guilty in order to convict 
Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, has urged jurors to rely on the  
expert testimony. He said his client suffered from an optical 
illusion that made him think his jet was higher than it was, that 
an altimeter on the jet malfunctioned and that the gondola at 
Cavalese, Italy, wasn't marked on American maps. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the only reason the  
mishap happened was because Ashby flew by his own rules. He said 
the pilot ignored speed and altitude limits, which Ashby testified 
he didn't know about. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces more than 200 years in prison if convicted of all  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the jury deliberated, attorneys for Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, the navigator in Ashby's EA-6B Prowler jet, said 
closing arguments made them optimistic that charges against their 
client could be dismissed. Schweitzer faces charges similar to 
Ashby's.

<HEADLINE> Davey Johnson Ready for the LA Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The pressure is on in Los Angeles, and  
Davey Johnson knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bring it on, he says.  
</P>
<P>
	``My first (managing) job was in New York,'' Johnson said  
Thursday from spring training. ``And I played in Japan. My survival 
instincts are intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who haven't won a postseason game since 1988, have  
made sweeping changes since the Fox Group purchased the team from 
the O'Malley family last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, they've switched managers and general managers, and the  
payroll has gone from the middle of the pack in baseball to near 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The obvious goal? Win now.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 56, was hired as manager, succeeding Glenn Hoffman,  
last October -- after Montreal's Felipe Alou turned down the job to 
remain with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Felipe, he's a good man,'' Johnson said. ``He doesn't  
need the stress that will come with this job. I'm more used to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had been out of baseball since resigning as manager of  
the Baltimore Orioles following the 1997 season. He quit the same 
day he was honored as AL manager of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved Baltimore,'' he said. ``I tried to do whatever the  
owner (Peter Angelos) wanted, and I couldn't quite please him. You 
want to do good for your boss. I didn't accomplish that. It was a 
failure on my part because I couldn't win him over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles were the AL wild-card team in Johnson's first year,  
and went wire-to-wire in winning the AL East championship in his 
second and final year. It was Baltimore's first division crown in 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles reached the AL Championship Series both years before  
being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was more to it,'' Johnson said of his leaving the  
Orioles. ``I don't want to go into it. I thought we had nothing to 
be ashamed about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job Johnson did in Baltimore was typical of him. In his 10  
full seasons, none of his teams finished lower than second place. 
His .575 winning percentage (985-727) is the best among all active 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Johnson was unemployed until the Dodgers hired him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always say things work out for the best,'' he said.  
``Somebody's looking out for me. I had a great interview with 
Toronto (last year), they decided to go with a Johnson -- Tim 
Johnson, not Davey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it would seem, Johnson has a much greater opportunity to  
win than his namesake in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a big market,'' he said. ``It's a talented team.  
My job is to give them the best opportunity to win. We have a 
chance to do that. It's miserable to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this camp has gone so far, I'm really pleased with the  
work ethic and attitude. I couldn't ask for any better, it's been 
very gratifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ace pitcher, Kevin Brown, says Johnson is ``dedicated to  
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows what winning's all about,'' Brown said. ``He's not  
the kind of guy who's got to have his fingers on each individual 
person all the time. He has a plan. He understands there's 
different strokes for different guys. I expect to have a lot of 
good years playing under him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said outfielder Gary Sheffield: ``He's a player's manager. He  
has a loose clubhouse. He's gotten straight to the point of what he 
wants us to accomplish and so far, we have. I respect him just like 
I did (former Florida Marlins manager) Jim Leyland. They're real 
intense guys. You know who the manager is on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he hopes the Dodgers' job is the final one of his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is not only to win here, but help the organization get  
back to where they were a few years ago,'' he said. ``(The front 
office) has been exceptional. Now, it's up to me and the players to 
do our job. I'm up for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he believes fans in Los Angeles are similar to  
those in New York, with a few key differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as well informed, maybe less cynical, not quite as hard,  
attitude-wise,'' he said. ``In New York, I think it's who can you 
step on to step up. In LA, it's who can you work with to step up.''

<HEADLINE> Big East Heavyweights Play Thurs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Seton Hall, Georgetown and Rutgers,  
first-round victories in the Big East tournament came with a price. 
Now they get to play the conference heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	Seton Hall draws No. 3 Connecticut, while Georgetown goes  
against No. 9 Miami and Rutgers draws No. 10 St. John's in today's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll take their chances.  
</P>
<P>
	Seton Hall (15-13) lost twice to UConn (25-2) in the regular  
season, including a five-point defeat three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing tough and coming close doesn't matter,'' Pirates coach  
Tommy Amaker said. ``This is the Big East tournament. This is the 
showcase for our league, and they are the best in our league. They 
are sharp and ready to go. We're going to have an unbelievable 
battle just to stay on the court with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown (15-14) lost both games against Miami (21-5), the  
first when John Thompson was still coach of the Hoyas, the second 
after Craig Esherick took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope we shoot a lot better,'' Esherick said. ``A  
lot of how poorly we shot was attributed to Miami's defense. Miami 
has a very good defense, one of the best in the league, if not the 
country, and there's a lot of people that did not shoot well 
against Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers (18-11) was swept by St. John's (23-7), and four  
straight losses at the end of the regular season left the Scarlet 
Knights struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about St. John's physically,'' coach Kevin Bannon  
said. ``They're big when you look at all the positions. They're 
strong. We played them tough. We've been in two wars with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's other quarterfinal, Syracuse (20-10), coming off the  
biggest blowout in tournament history, meets Villanova (21-9). It 
will be the 10th meeting between the schools, most for any matchup 
in Big East tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Seton Hall 79, Notre Dame 69    	
</P>
<P>
	The postseason frustration continued for Notre Dame, which has  
never won a Big East Tournament game. The Irish (14-16) beat Seton 
Hall twice in the regular season, but the Pirates knocked them off 
this time with an efficient defense that capitalized on 23 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we tried to do was really pressure the ball,'' Amaker  
said. ``We tried to at least force them out a little bit further. I 
thought our perimeter defense was pretty good and we got some easy 
baskets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duane Jordan and Rimas Kaukenas led Seton Hall with 18 apiece,  
while freshman Ty Shine had 17. Troy Murphy, Big East freshman of 
the year, led all scorers with 28 on 10-for-16 shooting for Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Syracuse 96, Boston College 55    	
</P>
<P>
	For the third time this season, Syracuse took advantage of a  
matchup mismatch to beat BC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just bigger and stronger than them,'' coach Jim Boeheim  
said as the Orangemen staged the biggest rout in the 20-year 
history of the Big East tournament. ``You don't like to beat 
anybody this way. The game just got out of hand early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etan Thomas had 19 points and Jason Hart 15 as every Syracuse  
player scored, sending BC (6-21) to a seventh straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Villanova 73, West Virginia 61    	
</P>
<P>
	Down 11 points in the second half, Villanova rallied to overtake  
West Virginia (10-19). 
</P>
<P>
	John Celestand scored 26 points and Howard Brown 16 for the  
Wildcats, who came back after West Virginia point guard Jarrett 
Kearse fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia had a 46-32 rebounding edge, and that concerned  
Villanova coach Steve Lappas for today's game against Syracuse. 
``We're going to have to rebound much better or we'll be in deep 
trouble,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Georgetown 68, Providence 66    	
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas saved their 24-year postseason appearance streak with  
a late comeback against Providence, wiping out a 10-point 
second-half lead to edge the Friars on a pair of free throws by 
Ruben Boumtje Boumtje in the last 1:23. Boumtje Boumtje led 
Georgetown with 18 points and contributed nine rebounds to a 57-32 
rebounding advantage 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas (15-14) are assured of a .500 record, the minimum  
necessary for an NIT bid. Providence (16-13) is probably headed 
there, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their offensive rebounding was relentless,'' Providence coach  
Tim Welsh said. ``Their work on the boards just wore us out. You 
get 24 turnovers and they have 16 more shots. That was the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, covering the tournament for a Washington, D.C. radio  
station, asked Boumtje Boumtje a question about being nervous and 
was challenged by his ex-player who said, ``Can I see your press 
credential first?'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Rutgers 64, Pittsburgh 51    	
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers got 11 points apiece from Rob Hodgson, Alvydas Tenys and  
Geoff Billet, with Hodgson also grabbing 11 rebounds. Ricardo Greer 
led Pitt with 14 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deserved this,'' Bannon said. ``We've been right there with  
nothing to show for it the last few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt (14-16) missed its first 10 shots and never recovered,  
finishing with 28.6 percent on 18-for-63. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the final game as Pitt coach for Ralph Willard, who  
announced his resignation at midseason. No replacement has been 
named.

	McCaskey had turned to Chicago's suburbs in search of a new  
location after clashing repeatedly with Chicago Mayor Richard M. 
Daley over the Bears' current home. The cost of a new stadium and 
opposition from residents put a damper on those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in a new ``spirit of cooperation,'' the club has signed a  
letter of intent with the city to extend the team's five-year lease 
at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited,'' Phillips said during a telephone  
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing this lease extension in our opinion is step one to  
ultimately sitting down with the city to discuss a long-term plan 
for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he is ready to begin discussions about a permanent  
home for the Bears in Chicago, adding that he is ``open to all 
possibilities,'' including a renovated Soldier Field. He declined 
to comment on some city officials' opposition to using public funds 
for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which extends through the 2004 football season, is  
similar to the current lease that McCaskey long denounced as the 
``worst in NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the lease agreement, the Bears will have to pay a fixed  
annual rent of $4,616,948, the same rent the team paid during the 
1998 season, officials said. In the past, the rent varied depending 
on the percentage of ticket and skybox revenue the team forked over 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the park district will continue to retain all  
revenue from parking, concessions and stadium advertising. In 
return, the city will maintain the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted we've reached this agreement,'' park district  
General Superintendent Carolyn Williams Meza said in a statement. 
``It ensures that Soldier Field will continue to generate revenues 
to help us improve and maintain our neighborhood park system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new lease also includes an escape clause allowing the  
football team to leave Soldier Field after three years, provided it 
pays the Park District $3 million for the final two years of the 
lease. If the team signs for a long-term home in Chicago, it will 
not have to pay the termination fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips did not know when the lease would be signed and said  
that details still needed to be ironed out.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says a financial overhaul  
bill proposed by the Senate Banking Committee chairman fails to 
protect consumers and would hurt community lending laws -- and he 
would veto the legislation if it is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Wednesday expressed  
the administration's ``strong support'' for a bipartisan compromise 
bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration in principle supports legislation  
that would lift the Depression-era barriers between banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. But the White House has 
threatened to veto several versions in recent years that took an 
approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is more in  
line with the views of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than 
those of the administration. The bill calls for most new financial 
activities to be conducted by affiliated companies within bank 
holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's Senate banking panel and the House Banking Committee  
were voting today on amendments to two separate financial overhaul 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph Nader and other 
consumer advocates have expressed concern that the legislation, by 
allowing banks, brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more 
deeply into each other's businesses, could bring a dangerous 
concentration of economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act ... 
a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore hope 
in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto the bill if it is presented to me in its current  
form,'' the president said in the letter, dated Tuesday and 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton wrote, the bill would ``provide inadequate  
consumer protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official cited as an example a provision in  
the compromise House bill, but absent from Gramm's, that would 
require banks selling securities to make sure they are appropriate 
for a consumer's income and circumstances. The official spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, in response, insisted that his proposal would not weaken  
the community investment law that banks must follow, but would 
``restore its integrity.'' The 1977 law requires banks and thrifts 
to lend to the poor and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's opposition to the law led him to block financial  
overhaul legislation in the Senate's waning days last fall. The 
legislation had squeaked through the House in May by one vote, 
214-213. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his new proposal, banks would not have to get a  
satisfactory community-lending rating from the government to set up 
holding companies to conduct new financial activities.

<HEADLINE> British IOC Member Rebukes IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British IOC member Craig Reedie told Parliament on  
Thursday that the Olympic body should have acted sooner on rumors 
of corruption and vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Reedie called the worst Olympic scandal -- in which nine IOC  
members have resigned or been expelled -- was ``damaging in the 
extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reedie and Princess Anne are the two Britons on the  
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The princess, said to be one of the only IOC members never to  
have accepted gifts, has been critical of the IOC's culture of 
gift-giving but reportedly invoked royal privilege in declining to 
appear before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed to explain why the IOC didn't act sooner on rumors of  
vote-buying, Reedie told a committee on sports and culture that 
disclosures about Salt Lake City were the first concrete evidence 
of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's an accusation the IOC must take on board and must  
deal with,'' he said. ``With hindsight, they should have 
(investigated earlier). Now they are going to have to. The 
challenge is the next six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is dealing with it,'' he added. ``The problem is that  
before you take very serious steps of expelling members from the 
organization, you need evidence of wrongdoing, not rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting of the IOC general assembly March 17-18 is expected to  
approve reforms to bidding procedures, consider a vote of 
confidence for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, and decide the 
fate of additional members implicated in wrongdoing surrounding 
Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the parliamentary panel, Gerald Kaufman, said  
IOC members should be stripped of any sign of privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to deal with the entire matter would be to have a  
very firm rule that (allowed) no gifts of any kind, however small, 
down to a T-shirt, no hospitality of any kind, including an economy 
air fare or grade-three hotel,'' Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody accepting any gift of any kind from the IOC to be  
sacked and anybody caught offering anything of that kind 
automatically to be disqualified.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 191.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied Thursday as benign economic data  
allowed buyers to re-enter the market following several days of 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also lifted by a huge contract signed by IBM to  
supply parts to Dell Computer Co. and rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 191.52 to 9,467.40,  
more than erasing a 48-point loss over the previous two sessions 
and closing above 9,400 for the first time in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite ended higher, closing at 2,292.89, up  
27.69. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.94 at 1,246.64. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's recovery, which extended a turnaround in technology  
shares that started late Wednesday, was ``totally justified'' by 
recent economic data, said Thomas McManus, portfolio strategist at 
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. Plus, he said, investors still 
have a lot of money to put to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Once stock prices get low enough, ``people find out that there's  
some strong underlying demand,'' McManus said. ``After all, there's 
lots of cash in money-market mutual funds, and so there is a lot of 
liquidity, and earnings growth is improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the manufacturing economy is improving and  
inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The market opened stronger after IBM said it would supply Dell  
with $16 billion in computer parts over seven years. Analysts said 
the arrangement could lead to more highly lucrative deals for IBM, 
whose stock rose 3 1/4 to 171. Dell added 15/16 to 81 7/8 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and oil-service stocks rose for the second day in a row,  
after oil prices advanced following reports of dwindling domestic 
supplies and a temporary interruption of pumping in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	While McManus said he worries that higher oil prices could prove  
inflationary, that wasn't bothering investors on Thursday. Dow 
component Exxon rose 2 1/8 to 67 13/16. Schlumberger, an oil field 
services company, added 4 5/8 to 56 3/8. Crude oil for April delivery 
settled Thursday at $13.35 a barrel, up 42 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial-services stocks rose as bond prices stabilized after  
falling earlier this week. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
eased 31.25 cents per $1,000 invested, leaving its yield unchanged 
at 5.69 percent. American Express climbed 5 3/16 to 113. Salomon 
Smith Barney started coverage of the stock with a ``buy'' rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was quiet following Commerce Department report  
that new orders for U.S. factory goods rose 1.7 percent in January 
to a $349.6 billion annual rate. While that was a record high, it 
was still a little under economists' expectations and as such, 
didn't raise fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's price advances stalled on profit-taking in  
mid-afternoon, but resumed climbing in the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Laux, the head trader of listed stocks at ABN/Amro First  
Chicago, attributed the pullback to nervousness ahead of Friday's 
release of February unemployment data. ``A lot of people thought 
there would be a reasonable spate of profit-taking in front of the 
unemployment number,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks also moved higher amid strong February sales  
figures. Wal-Mart, whose February sales rose 10.3 percent at stores 
open at least a year, was up 2 at 89 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 
922.73, up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.20 to 590.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.07 to 698.52. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.08 to 394.03. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo rose 0.09  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt rose 1.20 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 in London added 0.88 percent, and the CAC in Paris 
climbed 2.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Billy Martin Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Billy Martin's widow is entitled to half the  
value of the heirlooms he bequeathed to his son, daughter and 
granddaughter, a state appeals court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The items are ``community property'' of the late baseball  
manager's estate, the court ruled, and as such Jilluann Martin has 
a one-half interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court noted that the  
creditors of Martin's estate might ultimately be the ones to 
benefit from the ruling. If the estate is found to be insolvent, 
the judges said, the heirlooms will be among Martin's assets which 
could be used to satisfy his debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling sends the decade-long battle over Martin's estate  
back for a final disposition to Surrogate's Court in Broome County, 
where Martin had a home and where he died in an auto accident in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line on this is that the ruling confirms the fact  
that Billy's widow has properly handled the financial affairs of 
his estate and clears the way now for the closing of the estate,'' 
Robert Pearl, Jilluann Martin's attorney, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl said creditors and the government have claims of about  
$600,000 outstanding against Martin's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are a Rolex watch and a gun collection which Martin  
bequeathed to his son, Billy Joe, and a New York Yankees' pendant 
he willed to his daughter, Kelly Martin-Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin also stipulated in his 1988 will that his son, daughter  
and granddaughter were to share in proceeds from the sale of his 
Billy Martin Western Wear clothing line, from his books other than 
``Billy Ball'' and from the money remaining from his contract with 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The appellate division judges also directed the Surrogate's  
Court to determine the disposition and value of Martin's book 
proceeds and of the remaining portion of his Yankees contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearl said the items such as the Rolex watch and the gun  
collection have been appraised in the thousands of dollars and are 
``very nominal'' compared with the outstanding debts of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was killed on Christmas Day 1989, when a pickup truck he  
was a passenger in struck a culvert near Binghamton. The driver of 
the truck, family friend William Reedy, was convicted of a 
misdemeanor charge of driving with a blood-alcohol content of more 
than 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Jilluann Martin and Billy Martin's children split a  
settlement reached with the Ford Motor Co. and Reedy's insurance 
company over the accident. At that time, papers in Broome County 
Surrogate Court detailed cash flow problems that the Martins had 
when he died. At the time, the couple was $941,233 in debt to 
credit card companies and the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martins' home outside Binghamton was not ruled part of Billy  
Martin's estate. The 5,200-square-foot structure on 144 acres was 
sold for $250,000 last summer, and Jilluann Martin kept that money, 
her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's ruling largely upheld a determination by the  
Surrogate's Court about the dispensing of the Martin heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Schlather, a lawyer for Martin's children, was not  
immediately available to comment on the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Monica's Career May Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After the mess she helped make at the White  
House, who would hire Monica Lewinsky now? 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, she might find more success than you'd think.  
Employment experts say that with a little image polishing, she 
could have a future in fashion, media, public relations, women's 
issues, even the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her name is a gold mine,'' says Marty Nemko, a career  
counselor in Oakland, Calif. ``I would want her as my 
spokeswoman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd be great in public relations,'' adds Nick Corcodilos,  
who runs the Ask the Headhunter job-search Web site, citing her 
ability to stick to her message through fierce interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal aside, Ms. Lewinsky has exhibited some pretty poor  
work habits. Her e-mails and letters were riddled with spelling 
errors. She was not always truthful and showed signs of petulance 
and laziness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to have to work for this position,'' she groused  
as Clinton's associates pounded the pavement to find her a job. ``I 
just want it to be given to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she has also offered glimpses of the ambitious young woman  
who used a family connection to secure a White House internship in 
1995. By the time President Clinton's impeachment trial wound to a 
close, U.S. senators were fairly gushing about her poise and 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her best bet might be in a very public sort of job.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the entertainment industry, for example, it really doesn't  
matter if you're good famous or bad famous,'' says Laura Berman 
Fortgang, author of the career advice book ``Take Yourself to the 
Top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of precedents. Marv Albert, the sports  
announcer who lost his job with NBC in 1997 after he admitted 
biting a woman during a sexual encounter, is back in broadcasting. 
Donna Rice, whose romance with Gary Hart helped end his 
presidential campaign 1987, modeled blue jeans for a while and now 
crusades against Internet pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Ms. Lewinsky could hit the lecture circuit, offering  
lessons to young women about how to avoid her mistakes. ``I could 
see her becoming a powerful speaker,'' Fortgang says. 
</P>
<P>
	She might even find a job asking questions instead of answering  
them. Barbara Walters, during her daytime talk show ``The View,'' 
invited Ms. Lewinsky on Wednesday to audition for a slot as a host 
on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggest that the impeccably dressed young woman who  
picked out ties for the president might do well in the fashion 
world, or that she turn the tables on the lawyers who pried into 
her personal life by becoming an attorney herself. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is sure: She's highly unlikely to slip into a  
low-profile position befitting a former intern with a bachelor's 
degree from an undistinguished liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine if you came to work one morning and found her in the  
next cubicle,'' says Cathleen Faerber, president of the Wellesley 
Group, a headhunting firm in Lake Zurich, Ill. ``Her presence would 
be so disruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while anyway, Ms. Lewinsky's main job will be promoting  
her book, ``Monica's Story,'' written by Andrew Morton with her 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	She will split a $1.6 million advance with Morton, who also  
chronicled the life of Princess Diana. More media deals are sure to 
follow. But with legal bills estimated at $2 million, she may need 
to scale back the lifestyle that has included sumptuous restaurant 
meals, stays in fancy hotels and house calls from her hairdresser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she's going to walk right into a $90,000 job  
somewhere,'' Faerber says. ``But there is light at the end of the 
tunnel for Monica.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Lewinsky TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Barbara Walters' interview of Monica Lewinsky,  
which aired Wednesday night on ABC: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: One juror, at the grand jury, asked you why you kept having  
affairs with married men. Why did you? Why do you? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I have to say that was the most difficult question to answer  
in my entire experience with the grand jury. It was the most 
pointed question. ... I know I will never have an affair with a 
married man again. ... But, clearly to me, what I've come to see is 
that that happened because I didn't have enough feelings of 
self-worth. So that I didn't feel that ... I was worthy of being 
number one to a man. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: You showed the president your thong underwear. Where did you  
get the nerve? I mean -- who does that? 
</P>
<P>
	A: If you take my word for it, it was a small, subtle,  
flirtatious gesture. And that's me. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Was it saying, 'I'm available?'  
</P>
<P>
	A: I think it was saying, 'I'm interested, too. I'll play.'  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Did you ever say to yourself, 'I'm doing something wrong.  
This is bad for the president. This is bad for the country.' Did 
you ever think about that? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Now with everything that's happened, ... I feel bad that I  
didn't. But I didn't at that time. I was enamored with him. And I 
was excited. And I was enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	A: I think that one of the things that people have not been able  
to look at in this past year is that they looked at this and said, 
'This is about a man and a woman, and not the president and an 
intern.' He was very tender with me. He was very affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Did your mother ever try to break off this relationship?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes! Yes, she did. But anyone who knows me knows that I'm  
stubborn, and from the time I was 2 years old, one of my first 
phrases was, with my hands on my hips, 'You're not the boss of me!' 
And I've been that way ever since. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(Ms. Lewinsky is asked about her blue dress, which became a key  
piece of evidence in the investigation.) 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Ken Starr's people didn't know you had this dress. Why did  
you turn it over to them? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Because I had to. Getting and keeping my immunity became very  
important to me. For I needed to take care of myself and my family. 
No one else was worried about me. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Did you feel you had to then tell the whole truth about  
absolutely everything, including this dress? 
</P>
<P>
	A: You bet. And I did. ... Every man I have met since this thing  
has happened eventually says to me, 'So, what's the real story with 
the dress?' And it's humiliating. I wish I hadn't had it. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(The discussion turns to May 24, 1997, when Clinton ended the  
relationship.) 
</P>
<P>
	Q: You said that when you left Bill Clinton's office that day,  
you sobbed in the arms of (presidential secretary) Betty Currie. 
And there were times when she escorted you into the president's 
office and left and so forth. Do you think that Betty Currie was an 
enabler? 
</P>
<P>
	A: I certainly know that this relationship could not have  
continued the way it did, when I was at the Pentagon and the 
president was obviously at the White House, without Betty. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: In retrospect, do you think that Betty Currie knew about your  
relationship with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	A: She strikes me as the type of woman that probably wouldn't  
even have allowed herself to think that. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(The questions focus on talking points that Ms. Lewinsky  
provided to Linda Tripp.) 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Now Linda Tripp says that she believes that the notion that  
you wrote those on your own is about as likely as you co-authoring 
the Gettysburg Address with Lincoln. ... So her question is, and 
the question of other people is, 'How are you able to use those 
legal terms?' I mean, you're not that informed. You're not that 
smart. Did anyone help you with these talking points? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No. I had been working on my own affidavit with my attorney  
at the time. I've been told by the prosecutors and by my own 
attorneys I should go to law school. I guess I have a knack for it. 
I sat down at the computer and typed it out. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: You learned (on Jan. 16, 1998) that Linda Tripp had taped  
your conversations. ... How did you feel when you learned for the 
first time that she'd taped you? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Gutted and violated and betrayed. And scared.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: I understand that you're restricted in (discussing) the  
events of those days and what happened when you were in the room 
with Ken Starr's people and the FBI agents. But can you tell us how 
you were feeling? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Oh, I was, I was petrified. ... I have never been so afraid  
in my entire life. I wanted to die. I wanted to kill everybody in 
the room. ... I was just very scared. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	(Ms. Lewinsky discusses how she felt after she dealt with  
federal prosecutors.) 
</P>
<P>
	A: I felt very responsible.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Responsible for what?  
</P>
<P>
	A: For everything that was going to happen, and that had  
happened. And, I didn't want him to get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: You were worried about Bill Clinton? More than about  
yourself? More than about your mother? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No. I was worried about my mom more than I was worried about  
the president. And then I was worried about the president, and then 
I was worried about myself. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: If you had to do it all over again, would have had the  
relationship with Bill Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	A: There are some days that I regret that the relationship ever  
started and there are some days that I just regret that I ever 
confided in Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Monica, are you still in love with Bill Clinton?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No. ... Sometimes I have warm feelings, sometimes I'm proud  
of him still, and sometimes I hate his guts. And, um, he makes me 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What will you tell your children, when you have them?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Mommy made a big mistake.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Re-sign Cornerback Bradford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons reached a multi-year  
contract agreement Thursday with unrestricted free agent cornerback 
Ronnie Bradford, who started 24 of the team's last 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradford, 28, signed with the Falcons as a free agent from the  
Arizona Cardinals in 1997 and in two seasons with Atlanta has 91 
tackles, seven interceptions and 24 passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season for the NFC champions, the 5-foot-10, 188-pound  
Bradford, a member of Colorado's 1991 national championship team, 
started 10 of the 14 games he played and finished with 40 tackles 
and three interceptions. He started the Super Bowl against Denver 
and had six tackles and one interception.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses U.N. Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On her testing-the-waters Big Apple tour,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday at the United Nations -- one of 
the posts mentioned for her future -- that women now enjoy ``all 
kinds of possibilities where none had been dreamed of before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for messages in her comments, Democrats trying to  
draft her for the state's 2000 Senate race also hoped she would 
heed her separate counsel to young school girls in sports: ``Dare 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the noisy U.N. Trusteeship Council, where 1,000 filled the  
seats and hundreds more stood against the walls, the chamber 
erupted into a whooping, standing ovation as she stepped across the 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the revolution is on the move,'' Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan quipped with a nod to ``Madame'' Clinton, seated at the 
center of a dais lined with seven women. 
</P>
<P>
	She led the chamber in applauding Annan's line that women are  
not ``an incidental ornament for the men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her own speech, which stretched past 30 minutes, the first  
lady spoke about women's diverse ``life paths'' and ``responsible 
choices.'' She railed against disrespect of women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no longer acceptable to say that the abuse and  
mistreatment of women is cultural. It should be called what it is: 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the United Nations, Mrs. Clinton visited a Chelsea-area  
school to spotlight ``Dare to Compete,'' an HBO documentary on 
women in sports. High school basketball player Sofia Totti earned 
Mrs. Clinton's grin and handshake when she introduced the first 
lady as an athlete, too -- ``hopefully, a runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, weighing her options at the close of her husband's  
term in the White House, made clear on this campaign-style swing 
that she will not ``drop out of the political process,'' as she put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the will-she-or-won't-she guessing continued.  
</P>
<P>
	In between four packed public appearances, Mrs. Clinton met  
privately -- at The Plaza Hotel, and at the Manhattan home of a Wall 
Street friend -- with advice givers from New York politics and 
finance who are pushing her to run for the Senate seat of retiring 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Her spokeswoman divulged nothing of the meetings, and Mrs.  
Clinton said Wednesday she had no announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her allies have suggested Mrs. Clinton might prefer to  
serve as U.S. ambassador or some sort of goodwill ambassador with 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	To staff and delegates there, she spoke passionately about her  
travels -- many of them solo trips -- to Africa, Northern Ireland, 
Romania, India, Ukraine, Central America and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced that she and, most likely, her daughter Chelsea  
would travel later this month to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco ``to 
see firsthand the progress that women are making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German delegate Christl Schraut, who waited at the U.N. entrance  
for a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton, said the first lady is enormously 
popular overseas but could put her talents to better use at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations is well known everywhere, of course. But  
you just can't do or get things in motion as much as you can in 
American domestic politics,'' Schraut said.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure, Senility Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Treating high blood pressure in middle age can  
lower the risk of small, ``silent'' strokes that cause senility in 
later years, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 414 men studied from middle age into their 70s, even  
moderately high blood pressure -- and to a lesser extent, smoking, 
drinking and diabetes -- were linked to faster aging of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The take-home message is, if you've got high blood pressure or  
you smoke or you drink, go see your doctor and treat them,'' said 
lead author Dr. Charles DeCarli, director of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Center at the University of Kansas. ``If you have risk 
factors and don't treat them, your brain will be a decade older 
when you hit 70.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in this month's issue of Stroke, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at five health centers conducted brain scans of men  
who had taken part in a study of twins that dated to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at cardiovascular disease, including  
strokes and small, temporary strokes called transient ischemic 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The men with strokes were the same age as the other subjects but  
had consistently registered higher blood pressure while in their 
40s. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who had suffered strokes had more than three times as much  
damaged white matter in their brains as the other men. 
</P>
<P>
	``People with damaged white matter slow down. They have more  
difficulty doing complicated things,'' DeCarli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study has important implications for the aging U.S.  
population, said Dr. Edgar J. Kenton, a professor of clinical 
neurology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and a 
member of the American Heart Association's stroke council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our population is living longer, and we're starting to see  
that one of the major causes of dementia may no longer be 
Alzheimer's but may be these little strokes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better start looking at middle-aged people who are  
hypertensive and treat them sooner rather than wait until someone 
shows signs of dementia.''

	Feb. Retail Sales Beat Expectations  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the nation's biggest retailers topped  
expectations in February as the U.S. economy continued strong. Not 
only were consumers buying up discounted winter merchandise, there 
was also great demand for full-priced spring goods as well. The 
healthy results pleased merchants who had anticipated that 
consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 amid expectations 
that global financial turmoil would slow down U.S. economic growth. 
The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer of 
sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was up 
4.5 percent in February. It rose 6.4 percent in January and was up 
5.3 percent in February 1998. 

</P>
<P>
	Factory Orders Rise 1.7 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories surged in January  
for the second consecutive month, perhaps signaling the start of a 
rebound in American manufacturing after a year of struggling with 
fallout from Asia's economic crisis. Orders increased 1.7 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted $349.6 billion following an even stronger 
2.3 percent increase in December, the Commerce Department said 
today. 

</P>
<P>
	Jobless Claims Touch 10-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing first-time  
applications for unemployment benefits fell last week and, for 
February, the average level of new applications reached a 10-year 
low. Jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 286,000 last 
week, down 8,000 from the week before, the Labor Department said 
today. The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out the 
volatile weekly totals, declined to 290,750, from 293,000 for the 
four-week period ending a week earlier. That was the lowest average 
since February 1989 and reflected the continued strength of the 
American economy. The department was scheduled Friday to report the 
unemployment rate for February and, in advance, analysts believed 
it would hold at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Advance; Dow Up 97.26  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher at this afternoon although  
below their highest levels of the day, in a broad-based rally that 
included technology, retail, financial and energy shares. Just 
before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 97.26 at 
9,373.14. Earlier, it got as high as 9,448.66, up 172.78. Many 
broader stock indicators were higher as well, although the Nasdaq 
composite was down 7.34 at 2,257.86. 

</P>

	Financial Figures  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has agreed to merge its Canadian  
operations with MetroNet Communications Corp., a local Canadian 
phone service supplier to businesses, in a deal that values 
MetroNet at least $2.3 billion. The deal announced today would 
enable the merged company to offer business customers in Canada 
everything from long-distance to Internet to local phone service. 
It would also extend AT&AMP;T's strategy of creating a one-stop shop 
for telecommunications.

	Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A financial overhaul bill proposed by Senate  
Banking Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, split the committee along 
partisan lines today. It faces a presidential veto because 
President Clinton believes the bill, which would lift the 
Depression-era barriers separating banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies, fails to protect consumers and would hurt 
community lending laws. The measure was adopted and sent to the 
full Senate by the Banking Committee, 11-9, with only the 
Republican senators supporting it. In principle, the Clinton 
administration supports legislation to overhaul the financial 
services laws. But the White House has threatened to veto several 
versions in recent years that took an approach it rejected.

	US-EU Banana Trade Hassle Continues  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said today  
the United States Risks a major confrontation with its imposition 
of tariffs on $520 million worth of European goods in its banana 
dispute with the European Union. He added that any EU retaliation 
would be ``in accordance'' with rules of the World Trade 
Organization, the global referee of trade disputes. The Clinton 
administration yesterday began notifying U.S. importers that they 
now are liable for hefty tariffs on a wide variety of goods because 
of the long-running dispute involving European barriers on banana 
imports.

	German Industry Fighting Tax Reform  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The lower house of Germany's legislature  
passed a bill Thursday overhauling the country's tax system, 
increasing the burden on industry to allow relief for 
average-income families. Bitterly attacked by the conservative 
opposition and industry, the bill passed on the strength of 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left majority by 312-251 
votes, with 27 abstentions. The law includes cuts in personal 
income and corporate tax rates, but also scraps a string of 
corporate tax exemptions.

	Online After-Hours Trading Planned  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long excluded from the world of after-hours  
trading, individual investors may now get the chance to react to 
late-breaking news when it occurs. Beginning this summer, a leading 
Internet brokerage will offer an evening trading session for its 
customers through a new electronic exchange named IndivEx. The move 
by Discover Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., 
may be quite profitable considering how the soaring popularity of 
Internet trading has overwhelmed online trading systems at major 
firms in recent months.

	Goldman Sachs To Vote on IPO  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The partners at Goldman Sachs Group LP, the last  
of Wall Street's large private investment banks, will vote next 
week on whether to sell a stake in the firm to the public. The 
firm's 220 partners are to vote on the deal Monday. If approved, it 
would clear the way for a stock sale of 10 to 15 percent of the 
firm in May or June. Goldman Sachs originally planned to go public 
last year but aborted its attempt in September because turmoil in 
financial markets scared off many investors and ate into Goldman's 
profits.

<HEADLINE> Noriega Sentence Reduced 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge reduced Manuel Noriega's prison  
sentence from 40 years to 30 on Thursday, meaning the former 
Panamanian dictator could be eligible for release by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Noriega, 62, won the reduction from U.S. District Judge William  
M. Hoeveler after arguing that he deserves credit for helping the 
United States pursue its interests in Latin America while he was in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Noriega was captured after the United States invaded Panama in  
1989 and was sent to prison for money laundering and drug 
trafficking. He has spent nearly nine years by himself in a 
two-cell suite at a federal prison near Miami since Hoeveler 
granted him special status as a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeveler said he shortened Noriega's sentence after considering  
the nature of his confinement and the ``disparity between the 
defendant's sentence and the sentences served by his 
co-conspirators'' -- some of whom are out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the defendant may have done to the citizens of Panama or  
to his political opponents are not factors that I can properly 
consider,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no parole in the federal system, but prisoners can earn  
time off for good behavior or other considerations. Hoeveler said 
that with the reduction in sentence, Noriega could be eligible for 
release in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Noriega took control of the Panamanian government in 1983, and  
U.S. officials often praised him for his role in fighting drug 
traffic and paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. But 
relations began to sour in the late 1980s, amid reports of 
Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking and corruption and his 
increasingly independent political stand. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Noriega had asked the judge to reduce his sentence  
to no more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like him to consider looking at his good acts and  
reduce his original sentence for the good things he had done,'' 
defense attorney Frank Rubino said. ``It is indisputable that 
General Noriega did furnish immeasurable help to the United States 
and was an asset to the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. officials bolstered that argument by testifying that  
Noriega's assistance was crucial to U.S. foreign policy objectives 
in South America in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Winters, chief of CIA operations in Panama, said Noriega  
brokered deals with South American leaders, acted as a liaison to 
Cuba's Fidel Castro, provided details on guerrilla and terrorist 
activities and even gave the former shah of Iran a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Davis, the former U.S. ambassador to Panama, testified  
that Noriega has ``done a lot of good, not just for the United 
States government but for the people of Panama.''

	Marine Pilot Acquitted in Crash  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury acquitted a Marine  
pilot today of all charges that he recklessly flew his jet into an 
Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people more than a year ago. A 
whoop went up in the courtroom at the Camp Lejeune Marine base when 
the verdict was announced. Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, was charged 
with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count each of 
destroying government property, destroying private property, 
dereliction of duty and failure to plan the flight properly. The 
crash and its aftermath strained relations between the United 
States and Italy, a NATO ally. 

</P>
<P>
	Italy Stunned by Marine Acquittal  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italians were stunned and indignant today at the  
acquittal of a Marine pilot whose jet severed a cable, sending a 
gondola packed with 20 people to their deaths in the Italian Alps. 
``We had said before that U.S. justice couldn't handle the case, 
and we were right,'' said lawyer Giuseppe Pontrelli, head of a 
citizens' group formed after the Feb. 3, 1998, tragedy. ``We had 
largely predicted a verdict like this, it's not unexpected.''

	Lewinsky Book Goes on Sale  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The inner feelings of Monica Lewinsky on the  
President Clinton scandal are being unveiled in her book that is 
hitting stores today. Included in ``Monica's Story'' are her 
thoughts of hurling herself out a 10th floor window when 
prosecutors first confronted her about the affair; her abortion, 
the result of an affair with a fellow Pentagon worker in 1996 
before her relationship with Clinton ended; and her feeling now 
that Clinton is ``a much bigger liar than I ever thought.''

	Retired Justice Harry Blackmun Dies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The retired Supreme Court Justice who authored

Justice Harry Blackmun was 90. Blackmun served 24 years on the 
nation's highest court after being appointed in 1970 by President 
Richard Nixon. He retired in 1994. The lifelong Republican was 
considered a staunch conservative in his early days on the court, 
but by the time he retired he was considered its most liberal 
justice.

so far she's just keeping them guessing. On her second day in New

	Clinton Threatens To Veto Bank Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A financial overhaul bill proposed by Senate  
Banking Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, split the committee along 
partisan lines today. It faces a presidential veto because 
President Clinton believes the bill, which would lift the 
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies, fails to protect consumers and would hurt 
community lending laws. The measure appeared headed for adoption by 
the Banking Committee with only the Republican senators supporting 
it.

<HEADLINE> Winter Goodwill Games in N.Y.? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Nobody is saying anything, but Turner  
Sports is putting the finishing touches on the first Winter 
Goodwill Games, apparently headed for Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most talked-about, worst-kept secret going,'' a  
sports official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwill Games spokeswoman Amy Phillips said organizers were  
finalizing a location, and that an official announcement wouldn't 
be made until next Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first winter edition of the Goodwill Games, an international  
sports event styled after the Olympics, is planned for February. 
When Turner announced in December that it was exploring the idea of 
a winter version of the games, Turner Sports president Harvey 
Schiller said they likely would be staged in Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Olympics, is the  
other contender. 
</P>
<P>
	While the four summer versions of the games have focused on  
traditional sports, the winter debut will get a little funky to try 
and attract a younger, edgier audience. 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that the Goodwill schedule will include events along  
the lines of ice climbing, snow bicycling and super-modified shovel 
racing. While not Olympian, they are surefire ratings boosters, 
especially in the much-sought-after audience of males in their 
teens and 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sports on the program include Alpine skiing, figure  
skating, speedskating, bobsled, luge and at least one cross-country 
ski event, according to Schiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Dates have not been set, but Schiller said the event probably  
would span 6-7 days, 2-3 days longer than originally planned 
because of the addition of more sports. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lake Placid to stage the full games would require rebuilding  
the bobsled and luge tracks, which have fallen apart since the 1980 
Winter Olympics. That $20 million project has been under way for 
more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews plan to work 16 hours a day so that the new track, which  
will accommodate both sports, will be ready by December, according 
to USA Luge spokesman Sandy Caligiore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodwill Games were the brainchild of media mogul Ted  
Turner, held first in Moscow in the summer of 1986 to try and thaw 
the sports cold war between East and West that had produced two 
straight Olympic boycotts.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses U.N. Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On her testing-the-waters Big Apple tour,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday at the United Nations -- one of 
the posts mentioned for her future -- that women now enjoy ``all 
kinds of possibilities where none had been dreamed of before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for messages in her comments, Democrats trying to  
draft her for the state's 2000 Senate race also hoped she would 
heed her separate counsel to young school girls in sports: ``Dare 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the noisy U.N. Trusteeship Council, where 1,000 filled the  
seats and hundreds more stood against the walls, the chamber 
erupted into a whooping, standing ovation as she stepped across the 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the revolution is on the move,'' Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan quipped with a nod to ``Madame'' Clinton, seated at the 
center of a dais lined with seven women. 
</P>
<P>
	She led the chamber in applauding Annan's line that women are  
not ``an incidental ornament for the men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her own speech, which stretched past 30 minutes, the first  
lady spoke about women's diverse ``life paths'' and ``responsible 
choices.'' She railed against disrespect of women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no longer acceptable to say that the abuse and  
mistreatment of women is cultural. It should be called what it is: 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the United Nations, Mrs. Clinton visited a Chelsea-area  
school to spotlight ``Dare to Compete,'' an HBO documentary on 
women in sports. High school basketball player Sofia Totti earned 
Mrs. Clinton's grin and handshake when she introduced the first 
lady as an athlete, too -- ``hopefully, a runner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, weighing her options at the close of her husband's  
term in the White House, made clear on this campaign-style swing 
that she will not ``drop out of the political process,'' as she put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the will-she-or-won't-she guessing continued.  
</P>
<P>
	In between four packed public appearances, Mrs. Clinton met  
privately -- at The Plaza Hotel, and at the Manhattan home of a Wall 
Street friend -- with advice givers from New York politics and 
finance who are pushing her to run for the Senate seat of retiring 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Her spokeswoman divulged nothing of the meetings, and Mrs.  
Clinton said Wednesday she had no announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her allies have suggested Mrs. Clinton might prefer to  
serve as U.S. ambassador or some sort of goodwill ambassador with 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	To staff and delegates there, she spoke passionately about her  
travels -- many of them solo trips -- to Africa, Northern Ireland, 
Romania, India, Ukraine, Central America and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced that she and, most likely, her daughter Chelsea  
would travel later this month to Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco ``to 
see firsthand the progress that women are making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German delegate Christl Schraut, who waited at the U.N. entrance  
for a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton, said the first lady is enormously 
popular overseas but could put her talents to better use at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations is well known everywhere, of course. But  
you just can't do or get things in motion as much as you can in 
American domestic politics,'' Schraut said.

<HEADLINE>  Marlins' Lowell Fighting Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Marlins third-base prospect  
Mike Lowell, recovering from surgery for testicular cancer, went to 
the ballpark for therapy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell sat in the stands, soaked up some sunshine and watched  
the Marlins open their exhibition season with a 12-3 victory over 
the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The power-hitting rookie hopes to join the Marlins before the  
end of spring training. He's unlikely to be ready for opening day 
April 5, but doctors say his chance of a full recovery is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching baseball is a breath of fresh air,'' Lowell said. ``I  
just wanted to catch the game and see some guys play. It's good 
therapy, to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, 25, was diagnosed with cancer after a small mass was  
found during a routine physical exam. He underwent surgery Feb. 21 
and will start a short course of lose-dose radiation next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins manager John Boles visited briefly with Lowell before  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of gave everybody a boost to have him here,'' Boles  
said. ``He's a big part of us, and we're pleased he's doing so 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Lowell returns, he'll challenge veteran Kevin Orie for the  
starting job at third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to play in the big leagues since I was 6 years  
old,'' Lowell said. ``Then someone tells me there's something that 
could threaten my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely puts things in perspective. You realize how  
precious baseball is and how meaningless baseball is. But since 
it's such a curable cancer, I'm really expecting to make a total 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell said he's walking free of pain, but doctors don't want  
him jogging yet. He said there's no way of knowing whether the 
radiation will make him ill, which would delay his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eager to get back, but I know it's a process,'' Lowell  
said. ``I'll deal with it. It's the hand I've been dealt. It wasn't 
the greatest hand, but I might have a couple of aces up my sleeve 
for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, was acquired Feb. 1 from the New  
York Yankees for three pitching prospects. In the past two 
minor-league seasons he hit .309 with 56 home runs and 191 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Lynx Reintroduction Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- State wildlife officials are revising the strategy  
for reintroducing the lynx to Colorado after the deaths of two cats 
released a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx found dead last week were among five released Feb. 3 by  
the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the Rio Grande National Forest 
near South Fork, in southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The juvenile male and adult female apparently starved to death  
despite the presence of their favorite prey, snowshoe hares, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there will be mortality as there is in any  
reintroduction effort,'' said Gene Byrne, a biologist on the 
state's lynx recovery team. ``Some animals are going to do better 
than others in finding the best habitat and in hunting success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said recovery team members have decided to make two changes:  
wait longer to release female lynx and ensure all lynx released are 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to hold the females longer to ensure that they're  
well-fed before they are released,'' Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The young lynx that died had tried and failed to kill a snowshoe  
hare and pine squirrel, a wildlife monitoring team reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The division plans to reintroduce about 50 more lynx by early  
spring and another 50 could be released next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the program started, lynx were last seen in Colorado in  
1973, near Vail. Activists oppose Vail's current expansion plans, 
saying they will destroy lynx habitat. The Environmental Liberation 
Front referred to the animal when it claimed it set fires causing 
$12 million in damage at the ski area last October.

<HEADLINE> Europe Keeps Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>

<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's central bank left its  
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3 percent Thursday despite new 
signs of trouble in Germany's economy, the largest in the region. 
</P>

	Concerns about worsening the euro's slide against the dollar, as  
well as the European Central Bank's determination not to be seen as 
giving in to political pressure, all argued against the bank 
lowering rates for the 11-nation bloc that uses the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank chief Wim Duisenberg told reporters after the regular  
policy-setting meeting that he was not concerned about the 
fledgling currency's drop against the dollar. The euro is down 
nearly 7 percent from its debut at $1.1668 at the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg said dip was due to the strength of the dollar,  
buoyed by the U.S. economy, and not due to any inherent weakness in 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the level of the euro reached by now, it is  
more or less the level that the German mark had for most of last 
year,'' Duisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the news that rates remained unchanged dropped the  
euro below $1.08, surprising some economists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the currency markets were disappointed,'' said  
Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank. ``That's the 
difference between currency markets and economists. Economists tend 
to be more conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals by political leaders, most vocally German Finance  
Minister Oskar Lafontaine, to drop interest rates have taken on 
added urgency as Germany teeters on the brink of a recession. He 
argues that a crop would stimulate growth in Europe and create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth has slowed in many European economies, but Germany's  
economy, heavily dependent on exports, actually shrunk 0.4 percent 
in last quarter of 1998, compared to 6.1 percent growth in the 
United States over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Raiders, NFL Case Over LA Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed most of a lawsuit  
between the Oakland Raiders and the NFL that includes a battle over 
who owns rights to the Los Angeles football market. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which was issued Tuesday and released Wednesday,  
does not end the legal battle between the Raiders and NFL. The 
Raiders immediately refiled their lawsuit in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George H. King said neither the NFL nor the  
Raiders provided ``sufficient reasons for this court to provide a 
forum'' and dismissed most of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	King said the dismissed claims should be heard in state court.  
However, on the issue of antitrust, the judge ruled that the 
Raiders' allegation had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders claimed the NFL violated antitrust laws by refusing  
to schedule the Raiders' home games in Oakland for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But to prove there was damage from the 1994 schedule, the  
Raiders would have had to shown that their ``relevant market'' was 
the San Francisco Bay area, King said. The team couldn't do this 
because, in 1994, they were still the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling stems from a 1995 lawsuit in which the NFL sued the  
Raiders and owner Al Davis over territorial rights to the Los 
Angeles area, where the Raiders played for 13 years before 
returning to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides claimed victory in King's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pure procedural motion that was made in federal court.  
Now what happened is we simply have to start over in the state 
court,'' Raiders lawyer Jack Quinn said. ``The claims of the 
Raiders are still the same -- they own control and have the rights 
to the Los Angeles market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders refiled their lawsuit in state court but dropped the  
antitrust allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined comment. A league lawyer  
characterized the ruling as a boost for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted with the results. It establishes what we have  
always contended -- that there are no antitrust violations involved 
in our actions with the Raiders,'' Los Angeles-based lawyer Frank 
Rothman said. ``It's just another big win for the league and 
another loss for Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982. The NFL  
sued the Raiders over a failed plan to play in Oakland in 1994, 
when the Northridge earthquake damaged the Los Angeles Coliseum 
earlier that year. The league also sued over revenue-sharing 
discrepancies after the team moved to Oakland the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL claimed the team scheduled games in Oakland without  
league approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders countersued, claiming the league blocked the team's  
1994 move to Oakland, interfered with the move the following year 
and destroyed negotiations between the team and Hollywood Park in 
nearby Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations to build a new stadium in Hollywood Park fizzled  
and the team decided to return to Oakland in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn called the federal judge's ruling ``unfortunate'' because  
the team originally wanted to file in state court, but the NFL 
pushed for it to be filed in federal court. He said 2 1/2 years have 
been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably could have built the same stadium and played  
there,'' Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint, the team alleges that the NFL ``engaged in a  
concerted course of conduct'' to keep the Raiders out of the Los 
Angeles area. The team claims the league reneged on promises to 
fund part of the deal to bring the team to the park. The Raiders 
also want the NFL to pay the team the differential between the more 
profitable Los Angeles market and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor did not immediately return a phone  
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders went  
back to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two opposing groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise along with their own stadium proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is expected set up an expansion vote at an owner's  
meeting in Phoenix on March 14-18. A new team could begin play by 
2002. Houston is the other top contender for expansion.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Hundley Says He's Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Catcher Todd Hundley has a message for  
all interested fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers: He is absolutely 
not a question mark for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago, maybe. But not now.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundley blew out his right elbow in September 1997 while playing  
for the New York Mets, and underwent reconstructive surgery about a 
week later. Following a frustrating 1998 season, he was traded to 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm back, man, I'm back,'' Hundley said Thursday at the team's  
training facility. ``There's no pain, knock on wood. The joint is 
pain-free. The elbow feels the best it has in six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley, 29, admitted that while he may have said otherwise,  
like after the Mets traded him to the Dodgers during the offseason, 
he remained a question mark in his own mind until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really get over the hump until about the third day of  
spring training, after getting as many swings as I got, throwing as 
much as I did,'' he said. ``You don't know it until you really do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are the skills still there? Until you get out and do it, you  
don't know. Now, I'm good to go. I'm no different than anyone else 
-- none whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley won't appear in an exhibition game for about a week, but  
said it's not because he can't play. The Dodgers open the 
exhibition season Friday against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davey and I discussed it,'' Hundley said, referring to manager  
Davey Johnson. ``I just feel I need the practice more. I had bad 
mechanics, that's why I blew out my elbow. It's my decision and 
Davey's decision. It's not because I'm hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't missed a step. I haven't been limited in any way.  
I'll be throwing more on the practice field than I would in 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley, a switch-batter, hit 41 homers for the Mets in 1996 to  
set a big-league single-season record for catchers. His elbow 
bothered him throughout the 1997 season before he blew it out. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned to the Mets last July, they had already  
acquired Mike Piazza. Hundley hit just .161 with 55 strikeouts in 
124 at-bats, and also spent some time in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	He was used in left field by the Mets, an experiment that turned  
out to be a fielding disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't wish this (the surgery and then last season) on my  
worst enemy,'' Hundley said. ``(The surgery) was almost like the 
plague. You don't want to have that surgery, it was the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers hope Hundley can catch at least 120 games this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's been fine, he's done everything,'' Johnson said. ``If you  
saw him today, we took infield, he threw the ball very well. We 
want to take it easy on him. There's plenty of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long spring, I know what he can do.''

<HEADLINE> Blackmun Hoped for Broad Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry A. Blackmun knew he would be remembered  
forever as the author of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But he always hoped 
his 24-year tenure on the high court would yield a broader legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I would be remembered as a person of judicial integrity  
who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one field,'' 
he once told The Associated Press. ``I'd like to be known just as a 
good worker in the vineyard who held his own and contributed 
generally to the advancement of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died Thursday at 90, five years after he retired as a  
Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
	To those who didn't know him, Blackmun might have seemed a  
cranky old guy. On the bench, he often displayed a judicial scowl 
and could be snappish with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	At other times, his homespun questions hid the intellect of a  
magna cum laude mathematics graduate of Harvard who considered 
becoming a doctor and for years served as general counsel to the 
Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Blackmun took off the judicial robe and put on one of  
the ever-present cardigan sweaters he wore in his offices, warmth 
and humor emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	He could talk at length about his three daughters and his  
grandchildren, about his former law clerks and their families. And 
he could joke about his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1990 interview, Blackmun called himself one of the high  
court's ``three old goats'' whose inevitable departure, he 
predicted, would solidify conservative domination of the court for 
the next 40 or 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 81 at the time. Fellow Justices William J. Brennan and  
Thurgood Marshall were 84 and 82, respectively. Both retired 
shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time will take its toll on the three old goats,'' Blackmun  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, only one retired justice remains -- Byron R. White, 81.  
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun once was called a conservative, but in later years was  
called a liberal. He believed he always was somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to develop his attitude toward the (Constitution's)  
great phrases,'' he once told an interviewer. ``What does equal 
protection mean? What is cruel and unusual punishment? I would hope 
that I have grown in that respect over the years. But as far as 
shifting from conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his sometimes passionate rhetoric, Blackmun also had a  
passion for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago Cubs, but his  
love of baseball transcended team allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Blackmun the baseball fan who wrote what may be the most  
extraordinary paragraph in American law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1972 decision called Flood vs. Kuhn, the Supreme Court  
allowed major league baseball to keep its exemption from federal 
antitrust laws. Writing for the court, Blackmun began with an ode 
to the national pastime. In the fifth paragraph, he embarked on a 
journey through some of the game's most famous names -- 88 players, 
owners, managers and even umpires in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are the many names, celebrated for one reason or  
another, that have sparked the diamond and its environs and that 
have provided tinder for recaptured thrills, for reminiscence and 
comparisons, and for conversations and anticipations in-season and 
off-season: Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Tris Speaker, Walter Johnson, Henry 
Chadwick, Eddie Collins, Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, 
Rogers Hornsby, Harry Hooper, Goose Goslin, Jackie Robinson, Honus 
Wagner ... Rabbit Maranville, Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove. The list 
seems endless,'' Blackmun wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He later said he'd never forgive himself for omitting Mel Ott.

<HEADLINE> No Baseball for Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams  
won't be playing baseball for the Texas Rangers this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams told the team Thursday of his decision not to report to  
spring training so he can prepare for the upcoming NFL draft. The 
former University of Texas tailback is expected to be among the 
first several players drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my desire at this time to forgo the opportunity to play  
professional baseball for the Texas Rangers during the 1999 season 
in order to pursue a football career in the National Football 
League,'' Williams wrote in a letter released by the Ramgers. 
``Therefore, I will not be reporting to the Rangers spring training 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers will place Williams on the restricted list, allowing  
the team to retain his rights without him counting against the 
team's major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas acquired Williams from Montreal in December, the day after  
the Expos selected him from Philadelphia in the Rule 5 draft. If, 
and when, he plays baseball, he will be subject to the rules of 
Rule 5 draft, which require him to make the opening day roster or 
be offered back to the Phillies for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia drafted Williams in the eighth round of the 1995  
draft. He's hit .211 in 170 games over four seasons. He played 13 
games last year before returning to school to prepare for his 
record-shattering senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Longhorns, Williams set or tied 20 NCAA rushing records  
and 44 school marks, including most career yards, touchdowns and 
points.

<HEADLINE> Economy Demonstrates Staying Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is demonstrating more evidence of  
staying power. Retailers reported strong sales, orders for factory 
goods rebounded and applications for unemployment benefits hit a 
10-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	``They economy is firing on all cylinders. It's getting a boost  
from increased tax refunds and manufacturing is showing signs of 
life, especially because aircraft and high-tech goods are beginning 
to sell better in Asia,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells 
Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination fueled a stock-market rally. The Dow Jones  
industrial average climbed 192 points to close at 9,467, erasing 
much of this week's and last week's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists, who once were predicting a significant slowdown in  
growth this year, from last year's robust 3.9 percent, are starting 
to revise their forecasts higher. This week, a 34-member panel 
assembled by the National Association for Business Economics 
projected 3 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is ... continuing to make a monkey of economists  
that were looking for a slowdown,'' said Robert Brusca of Nikko 
Securities Co. International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he cautioned that temporary factors, including a stretch  
of mild weather, may be responsible for some of the recent 
strength. It permitted fewer layoffs than usual at construction 
firms ``and it may be the fine weather has encouraged people to get 
out and shop a little more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax refunds, up 18 percent through Feb. 26 from last year,  
according to the Internal Revenue Service, will help support 
spending over the next month or two. But after that higher 
long-term interest rates could start to erode the economy's vigor. 
</P>
<P>
	The average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 7.06  
percent this week, the highest level since the end of May, said 
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. Already, that's sharply cut the 
number of mortgage refinancings, a key factor underpinning consumer 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's reports, the Commerce Department said factory  
orders increased a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent in January 
following an even stronger 2.3 percent increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the nation's biggest retail chains reported  
higher-than-expected sales in February. Not only were consumers 
buying up discounted winter merchandise, there was great demand for 
full-priced spring goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing  
first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell 8,000 last 
week to a seasonally adjusted 286,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out the  
volatile weekly totals, declined from 293,000 for the four-week 
period ending a week earlier to 290,750, the lowest since February 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of January's strength at factories was concentrated in  
aircraft orders, which doubled from December, the largest increase 
in five years. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders 
fell 0.3 in January, the first decline in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	But aircraft wasn't the only high point. Orders jumped 4.9  
percent for electronic equipment, including a 13 percent increase 
for communications equipment. Computer and office equipment orders 
fell 4.8 percent; steel orders, 8 percent, and engines and 
turbines, 27.3 percent.

	DETROIT (AP) -- A loading dock fire early today at the Cobo Hall  
convention center threatened to cut short one of the city's major 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out shortly after midnight on the dock near the  
hall, where the Society of Automotive Engineers has drawn 50,000 
visitors for its annual International Congress &AMP; Exhibition over 
the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was brought under control in about 90 minutes, said  
fire department Battalion Chief Tim McConnell. No serious injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to start looking for the fire's cause  
today, but flames rekindled and firefighters were called back at 
about 6:30 a.m., department spokesman Lee Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire generated thick smoke, caused part of the loading  
dock's roof to collapse and melted metal skirting on the hall's 
exterior. 
</P>

<P>
	Clouds hung over the northern states this morning, bringing the  
promise of rain and snow from the Pacific Northwest across to 
northern New England. Pleasant weather was expected across the 
southern tier. 
</P>
<P>
	Low pressure moving from the Northeast into Canada was allowing  
colder air to filter into the United States, meaning 4 to 8 inches 
of snow in the eastern Great Lakes and rain changing to snow in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Morning snow was accompanied by thunder in Buffalo and  
thunderstorms rattled the region between Boston and New York City. 
Snow-blowing winds of 20 to 30 mph, with gusts above 40 mph, could 
bring visibility to below a half-mile across the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, scattered snow was falling this morning from the northern  
Plains to the Ohio Valley. A few inches were expected to 
accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Northwest was again getting rain and snow, but not  
as much as in recent days. Up to 6 inches of snow was expected in 
the higher Cascades, and only a few inches were forecast for the 
northern Rockies. Rain should remain light in coastal Washington 
and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southeast, bludgeoned by storms Wednesday, was looking  
forward to partly cloudy, dry weather today, though morning winds 
were still brisk. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds could reach 30 mph from Kansas to Texas later today,  
though partly cloudy skies and dry weather should remain in the 
central and southern Plains, as well as in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast in the 20s from the northern Plains to  
the eastern Great Lakes; the 30s from the inland Northwest to

<HEADLINE> Trump Looses Indiana Casino Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Two businessmen who sued Donald Trump and  
Trump Indiana for breach of contract in a dispute over a riverboat 
casino were awarded $1.3 million by a federal jury early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump Indiana, which owns the Trump Casino riverboat in Gary,  
was ordered to pay the damages. Trump himself was not found to be 
at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	William Mays, the owner of Mays Chemical Co., and attorney Buddy  
Yosha claimed Trump used their local prominence in winning an 
Indiana gambling license for the casino, then denied them revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosha and Mays each were awarded $667,062 for claims concerning  
Trump Indiana. Defense attorneys said the men had wanted more than 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we came up quite good on this,'' Trump said today.  
``We're very satisfied. As you know, I was totally exonerated 
personally, and they got no interest in the casino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear the jury didn't buy their story,'' said Richard  
Huser, an attorney from Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump had testified that he never had a contract with the men.  
He said he was wary when the plaintiffs' names appeared on his 
application for the gaming license, identifying them as potential 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's organization used Mays and Yosha as minority-stake  
owners on their proposals to the Indiana Gaming Commission in order 
to be approved for the riverboat license, their attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	But just because their names appeared on the application, Trump  
said, it did not mean they had an agreement. And the plaintiffs did 
not lose money because they didn't invest anything in the 
riverboat, Trump said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were planning to fund their stakes through a promissory  
note. Six other Indiana investors involved in the casino dispute 
settled before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump has defended his Indiana operations, saying his casino and  
a new, $18 million, 300-room hotel has helped revitalize Gary's 
economy.

<HEADLINE> FAA Eyes Northwest Airlines Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is  
seeking a $33,000 fine against Northwest Airlines for arranging to 
have a B-24 bomber fly in formation with a jumbo jet as an honor 
for the jet's retiring pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said last July's maneuver with a 747 carrying 373  
passengers was dangerous, careless and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has proposed the fine against the airline and a  
$1,000 penalty against the Northwest dispatcher who organized the 
event. The FAA has also proposed 90-day flying suspensions for the 
pilots who flew both aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said the enforcement actions are  
pending while Northwest and the individuals respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly agreed that the incident was serious and we took  
steps to ensure that it wouldn't happen again,'' Northwest 
spokesman Jon Austin said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight ended safely, but aviation regulations prohibit  
formation flying involving any aircraft carrying paying passengers.

<HEADLINE>  Hunt for Rebels Continues in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BWINDI NATIONAL PARK, Uganda (AP) -- Hundreds of Ugandan troops  
spread out through the dense rain forests of eastern Congo on 
Thursday in a huge manhunt for the Rwandan rebels who slaughtered 
foreign tourists. At least 15 rebels were reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The search came as rebels warned in leaflets that they would  
launch further attacks. The report by Uganda's private Central 
Broadcasting Service did not say whether the threat was 
specifically aimed at foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Six hundred Ugandan forces were joined by a number of Rwandan  
troops and Ugandan police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint forces killed 15 of the rebels Wednesday in Congo's  
Rutshuru county, 12 miles southwest of Bwindi National Park, which 
the tourists were visiting, said Lt. Col. Benan Biraaro, divisional 
commander of Uganda's southwestern region. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pursuing them and we are going to kill them,'' he said.  
``It won't be a day, it won't be a week, but we will get them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biraaro said rebels were seen wearing clothing they had  
obviously stolen from the tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also reinforced troops on the Uganda border, trying to  
close in on the Congo-based rebels who slaughtered the tourists 
with machetes and axes in southwestern Uganda's Impenetrable 
Forest. The tourists were there to view rare mountain gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadblocks were set up in two villages north of where the eight  
tourists were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI team was in Kampala, the capital, investigating the  
deaths of the two Americans. Four Britons and two New Zealanders 
also were killed. Six other tourists were seized but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives from Scotland Yard were flying to Kampala on Thursday  
night to help investigate the massacre. Simon Bond, a British 
Embassy spokesman in Kampala, said the bodies of the slain tourists 
would be flown out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the State Department said the bodies of the  
Americans -- Rob Haubner, 48, and his wife, Susan Miller, 42, both 
employees of Intel Corp. -- were to be returned to Portland, Ore., 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Uganda's government-owned New Vision newspaper said the army  
arrested a suspect who had apparently helped brief rebels on the 
positions of tourists in the park before the attack that began 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing an unidentified source, said several  
people had been heard helping the rebels before the attack. ``They 
seemed to know which tents were occupied and by who. They only 
missed one (tent),'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The simultaneous raids marred several campgrounds, leaving them  
looted and burned. Papers scattered along the ground Thursday 
included a receipt from a London cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	The charred frame of a vehicle in which one Ugandan park ranger  
was burned to death after being shot by rebels flanked the park 
gate north of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedda Turyananuka, a park ranger, said he opened fire on the  
rebels but soon was overpowered and fled into the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, promised Wednesday to hunt  
down the rebels and appealed for help from the international 
community. He also delivered a harsh ultimatum to the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	``These bandits are not able to permanently engage us because  
they will be wiped out,'' he said. ``Now that they have invited us, 
I think they are going to find out that it was not a wise 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels were among Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994  
after killing more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically 
moderate Hutus in a government-orchestrated genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hutu fighters, who have been carrying out cross-border raids  
from bases in eastern Congo, are angry at the United States, 
Britain and Uganda for providing aid to the Rwandan government. 
</P>
<P>
	American-born pilot and guide Mark Ross, credited with  
negotiating the release of the six survivors, told The Associated 
Press before leaving for Kenya that he would return once the park 
is deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful forest, and the people that ran it were  
exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable,'' he said Thursday. The 
attack ``was a really sad, freaky and, I think, unpredictable 
occurrence, unlike the wildlife which is quite predictable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were abducted at campgrounds on the edge of Bwindi  
National Park, the starting point for visitors hoping to glimpse 
the 320 rare mountain gorillas made famous by the 1988 film 
``Gorillas in the Mist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museveni admitted partial responsibility for the bloodshed,  
saying park rangers should have known an attack was possible.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Suspect Refuses To Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of killing two policemen in  
the U.S. Capitol has been returned to the District of Columbia from 
Missouri after refusing for a month to talk with psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the advice of my attorneys I have no comment,'' Russell  
Eugene Weston Jr. said Wednesday to repeated questions from U.S. 
District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who plans to proceed with a 
competency hearing on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan declined at this time to hear a preliminary assessment  
from a government psychiatrist. Doctors at the Medical Facility for 
Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Mo., where Weston was being 
examined, failed repeatedly in their efforts to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, allegedly gunned down officers John Gibson and Jacob  
J. Chestnut in a corridor of the Capitol on July 24. He was 
returned to the District of Columbia on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sought to have the competency hearing moved up,  
citing Weston's lack of cooperation even against the advice of his 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston was examined by a court-appointed government psychiatrist  
last October who determined that he was incompetent to stand trial 
and recommended indefinite hospitalization. Sullivan, however, 
ordered a second evaluation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Wants Rayburn Items Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONHAM, Texas (AP) -- For the 17 years that Texan Sam Rayburn was  
speaker of the U.S. House, he practically owned the office. Now the 
House wants the office back. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is demanding the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum return  
an enormous crystal chandelier, the original marble House speaker's 
rostrum and a nearly 3,000-year-old urn that was a gift to the 
speaker from the Greek government. Its estimated value: $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those items belong to the American people. They belong in a  
place where all the people in the country can view them,'' said 
Jason Poblete, spokesman for the House Administration Committee in 
Washington. ``Not everyone can travel to the Rayburn museum to view 
those items.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House is also trying to reclaim antique furnishings and  
other items that other speakers took after they left office. But 
the fight has become particularly bitter in Bonham, the small 
northeastern Texas hometown of one of the most powerful politicians 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the suggestion that Rayburn took the items improperly  
is especially insulting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Rayburn was one of the greatest men who ever lived. He had  
more integrity than anyone I've known in my life,'' said H.G. 
Dulaney, director of the Rayburn library in this town of about 
6,000 people near the Oklahoma state line. ``He was the most 
revered man in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sam'' served in Congress for 48 years, from 1913 until his  
death in 1961. His career in Washington spanned the administrations 
of eight presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat co-wrote such landmark laws as the Federal  
Communications Act, the Rural Electrification Act and the 
Securities and Exchange Act, and played a major role in passing the 
New Deal. A master parliamentarian, he was Lyndon B. Johnson's 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, then-House Clerk Robin H. Carle wrote to the  
Rayburn library, demanding the items' return. Ms. Carle said 
Rayburn should have turned over gifts from foreign governments, 
like the urn, to the State Department and then gotten congressional 
approval to take them back. She also charged that he failed to 
obtain proper authorization to take the other items. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Carleton, director of the University of Texas Center for  
American History, of which the library is a part, insisted the 
state has the proper documentation. The library was established in 
1957, before Rayburn had even left office. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, members of the House clerk's office have  
also spoken with custodians of artifacts taken by former Speakers 
Tip O'Neill and John McCormack of Massachusetts, who have died, Tom 
Foley of Washington and Carl Albert of Oklahoma. Former Speaker Jim 
Wright of Texas offered to return some items last year. All five 
were Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to reclaim the items began after the Republicans won  
control of the House in 1995 and took an inventory. Some Democrats 
have decried the effort as partisan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's petty beyond belief,'' former Texas Democratic Party  
chairman Bob Slagle, whose hometown of Sherman was in Rayburn's 
congressional district, told The Dallas Morning News. ``I guess 
when you haven't had power in a long time, it is tough to learn to 
use it with any discretion or honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dulaney, 80, who worked as a secretary for Rayburn and has been  
with the library since it opened, said the artifacts' absence would 
be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	The rostrum, which stood on the dais from 1857 until 1950 when  
the House underwent renovations, is in the library's front hall. 
The glittering chandelier -- which once hung in the White House but 
was moved to the speaker's office because President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt thought the crystals were too noisy -- now lights a 
replica of Rayburn's office. The brown urn sits atop a bookshelf in 
a glass case. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking his head, Dulaney said, ``They've got so much to see in  
Washington, I don't know why they want this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Ms. Carle resigned as House clerk after she was  
accused of using a staff member to perform personal tasks and using 
a government credit card for her own purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Carleton, the UT Center for American History director: ``We  
are pleased to have discussions with whoever becomes the clerk when 
they get that straightened out up there.''

<HEADLINE> Justice: No White House Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House did not apply any pressure to  
the Justice Department before a surprise reversal on whether the 
law that led to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation 
should stay or go, a top Justice official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration withdrew its support for the  
independent counsel law Tuesday, saying the Watergate-inspired 
investigations statute failed its goal of removing politics from 
investigations of senior administration officials. Deputy Attorney 
General Eric Holder said then that Congress should let the law 
expire on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyer Charles F.C. Ruff asked for a day or two to  
``think about'' that position beforehand, ``but they had no 
substantive role in the formulation of the change in policy or the 
positions that I took two days ago,'' Holder said during the 
department's weekly press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder convened a task force at the Justice Department months  
ago to consider them future of the law, which the Clinton 
administration supported the last time it was up for a five-year 
extension. At first, even Attorney General Janet Reno did not know 
about the task force, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted her to be in a position to be able to say in these  
press availabilities, among other places, that, you know, it was 
something ... she had not been involved in,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who has appointed seven independent counsels during her  
six-year tenure, has been the frequent target of congressional 
critics such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, who claims she has been biased 
toward the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago, Holder said, he told Reno the task force  
had concluded the law could not be fixed and should be scrapped. 
She signed off, and the Justice Department made that recommendation 
to the White House in a meeting with Ruff, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And all he said was, `Let me think about this for a day or  
so,' ... and then they came back to us and said that the testimony 
that I was going to give had been cleared. ''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Blackmun Opinions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Supreme Court opinions written by Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun. 

</P>
<P>
	From Roe vs. Wade in 1973:  
</P>
<P>
	One's philosophy, one's experience, one's exposure to the raw  
edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitude 
toward life and family and their values and the moral standards one 
establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and 
color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional  
measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. 
</P>
<P>
	A right of personal privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a  
woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. 

</P>
<P>
	From Bates vs. Arizona State Bar in 1977:  
</P>
<P>
	We are confronted with the arguments directed explicitly toward  
the regulation of advertising by licensed attorneys ... whether the 
state may prevent the publication in a newspaper of (a) truthful 
advertisement concerning the availability and terms of routine 
legal services. We rule simply that the flow of such information 
may not be restrained. 

</P>
<P>
	From Santoski vs. Kramer in 1984:  
</P>
<P>
	Under New York law, the state may terminate, over parental  
objection, the rights of parents in their natural child upon a 
finding that the child is ``permanently neglected.'' (The law) 
requires that only a ``fair preponderance of the evidence'' support 
that finding. 
</P>
<P>
	We hold that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  
demands more than this. Before a state may sever completely and 
irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due 
process requires that the state support its allegations by at least 
clear and convincing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,  
custody and management of their child does not evaporate simply 
because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary 
custody of their child to the state. Even when blood relationships 
are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the 
irretrievable destruction of their family life. 

</P>
<P>
	From Garcia vs. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority in  
1985: 
</P>
<P>
	We revisit (a 1976 decision in which the court) ruled that the  
(Constitution's) commerce clause does not empower Congress to 
enforce the minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act against the states in areas of traditional functions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the present case, a federal district court concluded that  
municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a 
traditional governmental function ... exempt from the obligations 
imposed by the FLSA. The attempt to draw the boundaries of state 
regulatory immunity in terms of traditional governmental functions 
is not only unworkable but also inconsistent with established 
principles of federalism. (The 1976 ruling) accordingly is 
overruled. 

</P>
<P>
	From his concurring opinion in Casey vs. Planned Parenthood in  
1992: 
</P>
<P>
	Just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has  
grown bright. In brief, five members of this court today recognized 
that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her 
pregnancy in its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our  
country since its founding has recognized that there are certain 
fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an 
election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those 
fundamental liberties. Accordingly, that liberty need not seek 
refuge at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this court forever, and  
when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor may 
well focus on the issue before us today.

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Barrasso Breaks Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso  
learned Thursday he might be done for the regular season with a 
broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso was injured while gloving a shot from Montreal's Shayne  
Corson on Wednesday, and X-rays revealed a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury leaves Peter Skudra the Penguins' only goalie with  
any appreciable NHL experience. Backing up Skudra will be rookie 
Jean-Sebastien Aubin, who has started four games, finished three, 
and mopped up parts of five others during the first month of the 
season when both Skudra and Barrasso were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Skudra's first big start will come Friday in Pittsburgh against  
the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any injury, and certainly one to a key guy like Tommy ... is  
going to be tough,'' Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said after 
practice Thursday. ``For us and for him, 4-6 weeks is a long time, 
and I'm sure that's a degree of frustration for Tommy because he's 
had a few injuries this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who's up there in terms of wins in this league, and  
he wishes he could be here to contribute to our games down the 
stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine said Barrasso should be ready for the playoffs.

<HEADLINE>  Kurdish Suicide Bomber Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Kurdish suicide bomber killed herself  
and wounded three civilians outside a police station Thursday in 
southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials said they believe the bomber was a Kurdish  
guerrilla protesting the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the 
rebel Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the wounded were primary schoolchildren, who suffered  
minor injuries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing came one day after the PKK's political wing said the  
rebels would escalate their war for autonomy in southeastern 
Turkey. It took place in the town of Batman, the scene of a 
shootout between Ocalan supporters and police two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Batman bombing was the first suicide attack since Turkish  
commandos captured Ocalan in Kenya on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is awaiting trial on treason charges on the heavily  
guarded prison island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council of Europe said Thursday that its delegation for the  
prevention of torture was allowed to speak privately with Ocalan 
this week when it visited the prison island. It gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, the jailed leader of the small leftist  
Worker's Party, Dogu Perincek, was sentenced to a year in prison 
for separatist propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Perincek also faces charges of aiding the PKK, which carry 20  
years of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The PKK has fought Turkish troops for an independent Kurdish  
state since 1984, a conflict that has cost 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Tests Back From Diamondbacks' Fatal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- An Arizona Diamondbacks minor league  
pitcher was driving drunk when his vehicle overturned Sunday, 
resulting in the death of teammate Ken Robinson, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab results show John Rosengren, 26, had a blood-alcohol level  
of 0.162 -- well above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10, police said. 
He was charged with second-degree murder but released Sunday night 
on $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Rosengren showed signs of being impaired when  
paramedics arrived at the scene of the accident at 1:40 a.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 29, a former major league pitcher, was the lone  
passenger in Rosengren's car that left a Tucson highway and 
overturned. He was declared dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	A relief pitcher for Toronto in 1995 and 1997 and for Kansas  
City in 1996, Robinson was coming off surgery last season -- as was 
Rosengren. They both were in Tucson to await the start of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's funeral is scheduled Friday in Jacksonville, Fla.

<HEADLINE>  Joyner-Kersee Blasts IOC Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of track's greatest gold medalists says  
the worst scandal in Olympic history is like a drug test for the 
leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an Olympic champion in the long jump and  
heptathlon and now a special assistant to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, said Wednesday that the bribery case built around Salt 
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games had tarnished the five 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' she said. ``We have to get back to the athletes.  
They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other people 
decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For athletes, the 
Olympic rings are a dream. They may have been tarnished, but for 
the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was on hand as the USOC announced a series of  
reforms aimed at avoiding a recurrence of what president Bill Hybl 
called the ``global crisis'' of the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC did not do enough to prevent Salt Lake City  
bidders from setting up a million-dollar scheme to buy IOC members' 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight was abysmal,'' he said at a news conference.  
``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and 
individuals who will not allow this to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl sent President Clinton a letter asking that the  
International Olympic Committee, at the center of the scandal, be 
subject to the same law that the federal government uses to deal 
with corrupt foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he and Hybl called IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about 
the steps the USOC was taking, including the request to the White 
House to label the committee a public international organization 
covered under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz later called for an outside agency to investigate the  
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to do the things they said they were going to do,''  
Schultz said a meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington 
Post. ``. . . I would hope they would at least appoint an 
independent group that would take a look at everything they have 
been doing and come back to them and suggest changes in the system. 
I would be satisfied'' if they did those things. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee said Samaranch should stay in office although  
``all fingers are pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' she said.  
``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty until the 
results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a four-time Olympic gold-medal swimmer and now a TV  
sports commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni association, 
said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke IOC rules 
``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to make those 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC escaped the brunt of a critical report this week from  
an independent ethics panel led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, which said the IOC had fostered a ``culture of 
improper gift giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hybl said the USOC adopted a series of recommendations from  
the Mitchell report, including an end to overseas assistance 
programs by bid cities and establishment of a watchdog office for 
ethics and conflict-of-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It went beyond the report by placing a permanent staff member in  
Salt Lake to deal with Olympic organizers, something Schultz said 
would be part of the operation for any future U.S. Olympic host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC also said that all board of directors and executive  
committee meetings now would be open, budgets would be quickly 
available to the public and athletes would receive a bigger voice 
in decision-making, including a new committee vice-presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the scandal ``indicates how misplaced the priorities  
of the Olympic movement have become. Our athletes must always come 
first.''

<HEADLINE> House Plans Vote on Steel Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders have agreed to call a vote on  
restricting steel imports, lawmakers from steel-producing states 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation should reach the House floor before the Easter  
recess, said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who heads the Congressional 
Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the breakthrough we've been waiting for,'' said Rep.  
Jack Quinn, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would limit foreign-made steel imports to the  
levels they were at in July 1997, before a change in worldwide 
conditions triggered a dramatic surge in the amounts arriving from 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	As steel imports increased, prices plunged by about $100 a ton,  
so that it was being offered on the American market for less than 
it cost U.S. producers to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Three U.S. steel mills have filed for bankruptcy, and other  
plants have cut back shifts, hours, or jobs. About 10,000 layoffs 
have been blamed on the import-driven reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen steel workers every day, including today, are losing  
their jobs because people are breaking the trade laws of the United 
States of America,'' said Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration responded to the surge by speeding up  
some of the procedures required to handle trade complaints and by 
offering tax help for money-losing companies. The administration 
said more aggressive responses were not immediately necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has said the  
administration was moving cautiously to avoid trade wars with other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot dismiss out of hand the notion that other countries  
will take retaliatory action or might impose mirror legislation,'' 
she said. ``We have a broad range of interests, economic in 
particular, that we need to protect.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Saving Open Spaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, celebrating the 150th  
birthday of the Interior Department, urged broad support Thursday 
for a $1 billion-a-year program to set aside treasured lands and 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, addressing a packed auditorium at the Interior  
headquarters, recalled a visit 30 years ago to the Grand Canyon 
when he watched the sunset across the canyon's multicolored cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got over it,'' said the president, adding that  
protection of such natural resources is at the heart of the 
Interior Department's history of land stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used the celebration to call on the Republican-led  
Congress to stop ``wasting precious time battling over senseless 
anti-environmental riders ... which I'm going to veto anyway'' and 
join in approving a permanent guarantee of annual funding for 
protecting open spaces and buying land for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term ``land legacy'' fund would be similar to what  
Clinton proposed as part of his budget last month, but the 
president said Congress should make such funding permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of bills already have been introduced by both Democrats  
and Republicans in the House and Senate that would boost spending 
for land preservation. The money would come from royalties on 
offshore oil leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Interior's block-long granite headquarters is but a few  
blocks from the White House, a presidential visit is a rarity with 
the last such visitor having been Jimmy Carter 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps more than any, the Interior Department really embodies  
the history of our country,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1849 after a rapid expansion of U.S. territory in the  
West, no federal agency played a greater role in the sculpture of 
America. It directed development of the West, parceling out 
millions of acres of land; opened vast areas to logging, ranching, 
mining and the railroads. In the 1880s the department controlled 
the destiny of more than 1 billion acres -- at the time nearly half 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's reach is still substantial as steward of 440  
million acres of land, including 378 units of the national park 
system, 514 refuges, wilderness areas, millions of acres of 
rangeland and such American crown jewels as Yellowstone National 
Park and the Grand Canyon 
</P>
<P>
	The halls of Interior headquarters, a massive building built as  
part of the Depression-era work programs, remind visitors of 
America's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor-to-ceiling murals, painted in the 1930s, show homesteaders  
racing westward vowing Oklahoma or bust; wildcatters working the 
oil fields of Texas; a landscape of barren Southwest desert turned 
to lush green thanks to a government dam and irrigation a dogsled 
team cross the wilds of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a real sense, the history of the Interior Department  
mirrors the history of American expansion and western settlement,'' 
said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who is the 47th person to 
head the department. ``It also dramatizes America's evolving 
relationship with the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Clinton's remarks, the Great American Indian Dancers  
performed a variety of Indian dances. The department in the 19th 
century was charged with dealing with Indians, sometimes with 
horrendous consequences. It remains the federal trust agency for 
Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a department whose primary concern was helping ranchers,  
timber and mining interests exploit American resources, the agency 
now often finds itself challenging those same industries to protect 
those same resources -- the grasslands, threatened species, scenic 
parks and wilderness and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	To expand such protection, Clinton said federal spending should  
be assured year-in-year-out. Congress long has authorized as much 
as $900 million for conservation-minded land purchases, but usually 
only about a third of that has been provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills introduced by Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and Sen.  
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., would establish permanent funding of more 
than $2 billion, including $900 million for land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	A different version, introduced by lawmakers mainly from coastal  
states with offshore oil interests, would calls for even more 
spending, but would earmark nearly $1.2 billion for mitigating 
coastal impacts from oil development. Environmentalists have 
opposed those bills because, they say, they would funnel 60 percent 
of the money to a half dozen states with offshore oil development 
and encourage new oil drilling.

<HEADLINE> Michigan QB To Return to Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- For thousands of college kids, spring break  
is a time for sand, sunshine and a carefree existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Henson is spending his spring break in Florida, all right,  
but not on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Michigan's backup quarterback is working out with other  
New York Yankees rookies. But unlike most of them, he plans to 
leave baseball and return to football before the summer's over. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been much speculation about that subject, especially  
since the Yankees have already paid Henson $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be such a speculative question,'' Henson said  
after a workout Wednesday at Legends Field. ``Really, there's no 
doubt in my mind. I'm staying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation stems mostly from the fact that Tom Brady, who  
was the Wolverines' starting quarterback last season, has one more 
year left at Michigan. The feeling was that Henson might decide to 
give up football in favor of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he'll use up all of his eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going anywhere,'' Henson said. ``Coach (Lloyd) Carr  
made a commitment to me two years ago and I made a commitment to 
him, and to my teammates. I know how much they need me there, and I 
know how much I want to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tug between football and baseball is strong both ways  
because Henson excels in both sports. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In football, at Brighton High School between Detroit and Ann  
Arbor, Henson passed for 5,662 yards and 52 touchdowns -- both 
Michigan state records -- in three years as the starter. He owns the 
state record for touchdown passes in a game with six. That earned 
him a scholarship at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In baseball, he holds the national high school record for home  
runs (70), RBIs (290) and runs scored (259). He was named 1998 High 
School Player of the Year by the publication Baseball America. That 
got the Yankees' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He signed a five-year deal worth $2 million with the Yankees  
in July 1998 after they made him a third-round draft pick. He hit 
.316 in 10 games with the Yankees' rookie team in the Gulf Coast 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like competition,'' Henson said after a workout in the  
batting cages beneath the stadium. ``To me, there is nothing quite 
like the competition between a pitcher and a batter. It's one on 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I like hitting home runs. There's no other feeling in all  
of sports like the home run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he's only 19 years old, almost nothing intimidates  
Henson, a 6-foot-5, 225-pounder who plays third base. Lunch with 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was no more stressful than 
grabbing a pizza with the guys back in Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an old football guy,'' Henson said. ``When I was down  
here one other time, my dad and I went to lunch with him. He talked 
about football. I asked him about his role on the `Seinfeld' show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I like about George Steinbrenner is that he wants to  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson almost certainly will make his living playing baseball.  
But he loves football, too. After watching the Wolverines win a 
share of the national championship in 1997, he became fixed on 
leading the school to another title. 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman, he backed up Brady while the Wolverines went  
10-3, winning a share of the Big Ten championship and defeating 
Arkansas in the Citrus Bowl. For the season, Henson passed for 254 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wants to unseat Brady, he knows he'll have to win the job  
when spring drills open next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been afraid to compete,'' Henson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Yankees appear content to wait. Third baseman  
Scott Brosius recently signed a three-year contract. Just about the 
time his contract runs out, Henson will be finished with college. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't pressure him,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman  
said. ``He'll end up doing what he wants to do. He'll make his 
decision at the end of his collegiate career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of player development  
and scouting, said Henson could be in the major leagues in less 
than three years -- maybe even sooner -- if he devoted himself just 
to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has no regrets about agreeing to let Henson pursue his  
football dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``He convinced us that while he loves football, he's passionate  
about baseball,'' Newman said. ``He's an exceptional talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the workout Wednesday, roving hitting instructor Gary  
Denbo called out situations, and Henson was expected to react with 
his bat. Denbo told him to hit an off-speed pitch to right-center 
field. Henson did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has all the qualities we look for in a good young  
hitter,'' Denbo said. ``His eye-hand coordination is outstanding. 
He doesn't mishit balls. He also has good bat speed. He has the 
potential for a lot of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once school is out, Henson will return to Tampa for a few days  
of extended spring training, then report to the Class A team at 
Greensboro, N.C., of the South Atlantic League. He will play 
baseball until two weeks before Michigan opens camp in August, then 
head back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, a lot is being expected of Henson, both by Michigan and  
by the Yankees. That kind of pressure might tend to wilt someone so 
young. But not Henson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I'm a student at the University of Michigan, and I'm a  
New York Yankee,'' Henson said. ``How much more can any kid want?''

<HEADLINE>  Joyner-Kersee Blasts IOC Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of track's greatest gold medalists says  
the worst scandal in Olympic history is like a drug test for the 
leaders of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an Olympic champion in the long jump and  
heptathlon and now a special assistant to the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, said Wednesday that the bribery case built around Salt 
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games had tarnished the five 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' she said. ``We have to get back to the athletes.  
They are the ones who are going to suffer, while other people 
decorate their homes nicely and drive new cars. For athletes, the 
Olympic rings are a dream. They may have been tarnished, but for 
the athletes the rings must still shine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee was on hand as the USOC announced a series of  
reforms aimed at avoiding a recurrence of what president Bill Hybl 
called the ``global crisis'' of the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do any less would mean facing a future that might include  
the loss of the games and noble ideals they profess,'' Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC did not do enough to prevent Salt Lake City  
bidders from setting up a million-dollar scheme to buy IOC members' 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight was abysmal,'' he said at a news conference.  
``We are trying to put in place procedures, policies and 
individuals who will not allow this to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl sent President Clinton a letter asking that the  
International Olympic Committee, at the center of the scandal, be 
subject to the same law that the federal government uses to deal 
with corrupt foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he and Hybl called IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch early Wednesday to tell him about 
the steps the USOC was taking, including the request to the White 
House to label the committee a public international organization 
covered under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased we would call and tell him what we were going  
to do,'' Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz later called for an outside agency to investigate the  
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to do the things they said they were going to do,''  
Schultz said a meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington 
Post. ``. . . I would hope they would at least appoint an 
independent group that would take a look at everything they have 
been doing and come back to them and suggest changes in the system. 
I would be satisfied'' if they did those things. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee said Samaranch should stay in office although  
``all fingers are pointing back in his direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope the IOC continues to clean its house,'' she said.  
``It's just like dealing with drug testing. You're guilty until the 
results come back clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Naber, a four-time Olympic gold-medal swimmer and now a TV  
sports commentator and head of a U.S. Olympic alumni association, 
said anyone who ``willfully and intentionally'' broke IOC rules 
``should immediately and forevermore lose the right to make those 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some heads already have rolled, and I'm not sure we're  
finished yet with the bloodletting,'' Naber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC escaped the brunt of a critical report this week from  
an independent ethics panel led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, which said the IOC had fostered a ``culture of 
improper gift giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hybl said the USOC adopted a series of recommendations from  
the Mitchell report, including an end to overseas assistance 
programs by bid cities and establishment of a watchdog office for 
ethics and conflict-of-interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It went beyond the report by placing a permanent staff member in  
Salt Lake to deal with Olympic organizers, something Schultz said 
would be part of the operation for any future U.S. Olympic host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC also said that all board of directors and executive  
committee meetings now would be open, budgets would be quickly 
available to the public and athletes would receive a bigger voice 
in decision-making, including a new committee vice-presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the scandal ``indicates how misplaced the priorities  
of the Olympic movement have become. Our athletes must always come 
first.''

<HEADLINE>  WWII Croat Commander's Case Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A judge today postponed one of the  
century's last major trials into Nazi-era war crimes because of 
fears the defendant's life could be at risk due to his poor health. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief judge Drazen Tripalo put off proceedings against Dinko  
Sakic until March 15 after a physician told the court Sakic might 
not survive if he were required to sit through the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic, 77, a former commandant of the Jasenovac concentration  
camp that had been known as the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' was 
hospitalized Wednesday after fainting in jail. He displayed 
quivering hands and told the court he felt too weak to follow the 
trial, which was to have begun today. 
</P>
<P>
	International Jewish groups said they hoped the delay did not  
indicate a weakening of Croatia's resolve to press ahead with the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakic is the only known commandant of a concentration camp  
still living and he is likely the most important war criminal to be 
tried for crimes against humanity in former eastern and central 
Europe,'' said Tommy Baer of Richmond, Va., a former president of 
B'nai B'rith International who the organization sent as an 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic is charged with the deaths of 2,000 of the tens of  
thousands of Serbs, Jews, gypsies and anti-Nazi Croats who died in 
the Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II. He has been 
jailed in Croatia since his extradition in June from Argentina, 
where he had lived since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-appointed physician, Dr. Dusan Zecevic, said tests  
indicated Sakic was suffering from circulatory problems and that 
considering his age, his life could be at risk if the trial 
proceeded. The judge ordered Sakic transferred to a prison 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sakic case is emotionally charged because it involves  
conflicts between Croats and Serbs that were reignited after wars 
in the former Yugoslavia this decade. Serbs made up the largest 
number of Jasenovac victims. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II ended in 1945, the communist Yugoslav  
government cited Jasenovac as a symbol of fascist barbarity and the 
dangers of ethnic rivalries, which again exploded when Yugoslavia 
disintegrated starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many Croats fought against the pro-German regime of  
Ante Pavelic, which ran the camps, many others supported the Nazi 
puppet state. President Franjo Tudjman has often said the regime 
was an expression of Croat aspirations for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to quell suspicions that the government was not serious  
about prosecuting Sakic, Croatian authorities have pledged to be 
impartial and agreed to allow the attendance of international 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Dr. Efraim Zuroff of the Israel branch of the Simon  
Wiesenthal Center, said sarcastically Wednesday that he wished 
Sakic ``good health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how many suspected Nazis end up in hospitals  
right before they are going to be brought to trial for crimes of 
the Holocaust,'' Zuroff said after arriving at Zagreb airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The number Jasenovac victims remains in dispute. Estimates range  
from 35,000 to more than 500,000. The U.S. Justice Department 
places the figure at around 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic was arrested after he admitted on Argentine television  
that he was a commander at Jasenovac, but contended that inmates 
died of a ``typhus epidemic.''

<HEADLINE>  Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- The brother of a German citizen executed  
a week ago was poisoned by cyanide gas in Arizona's death chamber 
despite protests that reached the highest tribunals in Europe and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapped in a black padded chair in the gas chamber, Walter  
LaGrand quietly wept late Wednesday as he apologized to the family 
of a bank manager he and his brother fatally stabbed during a 
botched 1982 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He strained to locate Kathy Hartsock, whose father, Kenneth  
Hartsock, was stabbed two dozen times by the brothers at a bank in 
Marana, near Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my loved ones, I hope they find peace,'' he said as Ms.  
Hartsock clutched a photograph of her father. ``To all of you here 
today, I forgive you and I hope I can be forgiven in my next 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand died 18 minutes after executioners dropped cyanide  
pellets into a vat of distilled water and sulfuric acid, enveloping 
him in a cloud of white, steam-like fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both LaGrand, 37, and his brother, Karl, 35, chose the gas  
chamber in the hope that courts would rule the method a form of 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. In both cases, the 
U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal appeals court's restraining 
order barring Arizona from the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter LaGrand rejected such an offer and said he would  
prefer the more protracted and painful execution in the gas chamber 
to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany, and moved to  
southern Arizona as children after their mother married an American 
serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, asked the International  
Court of Justice in the Netherlands to intervene Wednesday after 
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull rejected appeals from German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The world court has no enforcement powers, but in a special  
hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri Lanka urged the U.S. 
government to prevent the execution. The brothers are the first 
German citizens executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hadn't used the gas chamber since 1992, when inmate  
Donald Eugene Harding's death took 11 minutes and was considered so 
gruesome that Arizonans voted to require prisoners condemned after 
November 1992 to be executed by injection.

<HEADLINE> Panel Split on Banking Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Banking Committee voted along party  
lines Thursday to adopt a financial overhaul bill proposed by 
Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and opposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In its current form, it would face a White House veto because  
Clinton believes the bill, which would lift the Depression-era 
barriers between banks, securities firms and insurance companies, 
fails to protect consumers and would hurt community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	House lawmakers, meanwhile, labored to draft a bipartisan  
compromise bill that also would rewrite the financial services 
laws. The Clinton administration, represented by Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin, indicated Wednesday its strong support for such 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	After an all-day drafting session, the House Banking Committee  
adjourned without completing work on the complex bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate bills would create huge financial  
``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking accounts, mutual 
funds, insurance policies and much more. Consumer advocates have 
expressed concern that the legislation, by allowing banks, 
brokerage firms and insurers to merge and get more deeply into each 
other's businesses, could bring a dangerous concentration of 
economic power in fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's measure was adopted and sent to the full Senate by the  
Banking Committee, 11-9, with only Republican senators supporting 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at an impasse before we even start,'' said Sen. John  
Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved a GOP amendment exempting small  
banks -- with less than $100 million in assets -- from the community 
lending laws, which require banks and thrifts to lend to the poor 
and minorities in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every small banker in America chafes under'' the 1977 laws,  
Gramm said, insisting that the government shouldn't dictate to 
banks what people or companies they can do business with. 
</P>
<P>
	In a party switch, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., voted against the  
amendment while Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
	In principle, the Clinton administration supports legislation to  
overhaul the financial services laws. But the White House has 
threatened to veto several versions in recent years that took an 
approach it rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted by Gramm is more in line with the views of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan than those of the 
administration. The bill calls for most new financial activities to 
be conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter this week to Gramm, Clinton said his proposal would  
``undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act 
..., a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and restore 
hope in communities across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his response, Gramm insisted that his proposal would not  
weaken the community investment law that banks must follow, but 
would ``restore its integrity.''

<HEADLINE> Feb. Retail Sales Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the nation's biggest retailers topped  
expectations in February, as the continued strength of the U.S. 
economy encouraged Americans to do lots of shopping last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only were consumers buying up discounted winter merchandise,  
there was also great demand for full-priced spring goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't just good. It's better than good, well above what  
we had expected,'' Michael Niemira, a retail analyst at Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said about today's sales reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Most merchants fared well in February, especially discount  
chains, such as Wal-Mart and Target, and specialty clothing stores, 
including the Gap and Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The only weakness was spotted at the moderately priced  
department stores, such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., 
which have lost business to the lower-priced discounters. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy results pleased merchants who had anticipated that  
consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 amid expectations 
that global financial turmoil would slow down U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	But the economy continues to rage, and unemployment and  
inflation levels remain at the lowest levels in years. That's made 
consumers confident about their personal finances and has raised 
their eagerness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department reported the number of  
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell by 8,000 to 286,000 last week, and the average level of new 
applications reached a 10-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, warned that any signs of economic weakness in  
coming months could cause a sharp downturn in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there is strong consumer confidence now, but I am still  
very cautious about the rest of the spring season,'' said Walter 
Loeb, who runs the retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. ``It 
gets much harder from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February is the first month of most retailers' fiscal year.  
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 4.5 percent in February. It rose 6.4 percent in January and was 
up 5.3 percent in February 1998. 
</P>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks, struggling to find some  
offense, got their best scorer back Thursday when they reactivated 
guard Steve Smith from the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	He was expected to play in Thursday night against Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Offers Online Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch introduced online trading Thursday  
for a small group of wealthy customers, becoming the first 
full-service broker to tip-toe into Wall Street's fastest growing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Averting -- or probably delaying -- a potential clash with its  
commission-paid brokers, the huge firm limited the service to just 
55,000 customers with special accounts that aren't charged on a 
per-trade basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Those accounts, which can only be opened with a minimum of  
$100,000 in assets, represent about 1 percent of the 5 million 
accounts at Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	While most traditional investment firms already allow their  
customers to view their accounts on the Internet, all had been 
resisting the move into online trading. Notably, Merrill Lynch did 
not issue a news release on the new service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They fear broker backlash. Online trading will reduce the  
power of the broker in the customer relationship,'' said Bill 
Doyle, an industry analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, it's absolutely unavoidable,'' he added,  
forecasting that the number of online trading accounts will surge 
from 5.3 million to 8.4 million in 1999. Likewise, the assets in 
online accounts are expected to grow from $233 billion to nearly 
$400 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissions charged for online trades are just a fraction of  
the trading fees at full-service firms such as Merrill Lynch, 
Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Prudential 
Securities and PaineWebber. Those firms often command fees of more 
than $100 or $200 per trade. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Charles Schwab, the biggest online broker, charges  
about $30 for each Internet trade. Industry pioneer ETrade charges 
about $15 a trade, while upstarts such as Ameritrade charge as 
little as $8. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional firms have maintained that their customers want  
more personal service and don't mind paying more for trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial consultant works closely with clients for  
long-term investing. The financial consultant is an overall part of 
their financial planning,'' said Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Bobbie 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	But Doyle said Merrill's move will pressure other full-service  
firms to offer online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional firms often dismiss the assets held at the  
online brokerages as play money,'' he said. ``But real money is 
moving into online trading, and it's something these firms can't 
afford to ignore.''

<HEADLINE> New Base Closing Process Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is signaling it  
wants to work with congressional critics in hopes of finding common 
ground to permit additional rounds of base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested he's open to a new  
formula that could restrict the type of bases that might be closed 
at the beginning of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most frustrating aspects is that every single  
community ... feels compelled to hire high-priced PR firms ... 
high-priced legal teams'' to try to fight potential closings, Cohen 
told the House Appropriations defense subcommittee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current process, all military bases in the country are  
essentially on the block in each new round of base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants Congress to authorize two new rounds of  
base closings, one in 2001 and another in 2005. But having gone 
through four rounds since 1989, Congress has little appetite for 
further closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Republicans accuse Clinton of manipulating the  
process to save defense jobs in electoral-rich California and Texas 
as part of his 1996 re-election effort. House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, predicted this week that Congress would not approve 
any further base closings ``under this president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohen, a Republican who represented Maine in the Senate, has  
been quietly working on Capitol Hill in hopes of finding a new 
formula that overcomes most GOP objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, Congress authorizes an independent  
nonpartisan commission -- the Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission -- which then decides which bases should be closed, 
supposedly without political interference. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Congress' sharpest critics of the system, including  
Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Pat Roberts, R-Kan., both members 
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have suggested that the 
scope of future base-closing reviews be limited at the outset to 
just certain type of bases -- principally those for which the 
Pentagon clearly has an overabundance. 
</P>
<P>
	That could keep cities near other military bases -- ones not  
likely to be closed down -- from panicking unnecessarily, they 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen met privately on Monday with Inhofe and afterward  
indicated interest in such a plan, both in an appearance Tuesday 
before the Senate Budget Committee and Wednesday's House testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that you folks sitting in Washington can really  
appreciate what every community near a proposed realignment ... 
goes through,'' Inhofe told Pentagon officials at a separate Senate 
Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday. ``They pay $100,000 
for a consultant, and many of them are getting fleeced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only 10 percent of the bases are deemed to have surplus  
capacity, ``why put the (other) 90 percent of the installations 
through that?'' Inhofe asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen on Wednesday suggested that it would be hard to entirely  
remove the suggestion of political interference from the process. 
If the Pentagon made the initial cuts, charges would surely arise 
that politics played a role, he suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Inhofe has proposed a process under which either the  
Pentagon or the congressional General Accounting Office come up 
with the initial list -- or at least determine the category of base 
to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., another advocate of such an  
approach, told Cohen at Wednesday's hearing that the list should be 
narrowed in the beginning ``rather than have every single base and 
post in the country go through the cost, the analysis, the 
examination and the frustration and upset that comes with 
determining whether you're going to be around or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with you,'' Cohen said. ``There's got to be a way of  
somehow minimizing the cost and expense to communities who suddenly 
feel they've got to put on the best possible presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted he had been on both sides of the situation -- first  
as a senator from Maine with bases targeted for closure, and now as 
defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Base-closing rounds, in 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1995 closed 70  
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes 2nd German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- The brother of a German citizen executed  
a week ago was poisoned by cyanide gas in Arizona's death chamber 
despite protests that reached the highest tribunals in Europe and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapped in a black padded chair in the gas chamber, Walter  
LaGrand quietly wept late Wednesday as he apologized to the family 
of a bank manager he and his brother fatally stabbed during a 
botched 1982 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He strained to locate Kathy Hartsock, whose father, Kenneth  
Hartsock, was stabbed two dozen times by the brothers at a bank in 
Marana, near Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all my loved ones, I hope they find peace,'' he said as Ms.  
Hartsock clutched a photograph of her father. ``To all of you here 
today, I forgive you and I hope I can be forgiven in my next 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand died 18 minutes after executioners dropped cyanide  
pellets into a vat of distilled water and sulfuric acid, enveloping 
him in a cloud of white, steam-like fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both LaGrand, 37, and his brother, Karl, 35, chose the gas  
chamber in the hope that courts would rule the method a form of 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. In both cases, the 
U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal appeals court's restraining 
order barring Arizona from the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand accepted the state's last-minute offer of lethal  
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter LaGrand rejected such an offer and said he would  
prefer the more protracted and painful execution in the gas chamber 
to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were born in Augsburg, Germany, and moved to  
southern Arizona as children after their mother married an American 
serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, asked the International  
Court of Justice in the Netherlands to intervene Wednesday after 
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull rejected appeals from German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to stop the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The world court has no enforcement powers, but in a special  
hearing, Judge Christopher Weeramantry of Sri Lanka urged the U.S. 
government to prevent the execution. The brothers are the first 
German citizens executed in the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only Arizona,  
California, Maryland, Missouri and Wyoming offer the gas chamber as 
an optional method, according to the Death Penalty Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona hadn't used the gas chamber since 1992, when inmate  
Donald Eugene Harding's death took 11 minutes and was considered so 
gruesome that Arizonans voted to require prisoners condemned after 
November 1992 to be executed by injection.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Survivor Wants To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The only survivor of eight Ukrainian children  
brought for medical treatment after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear 
accident is asking for permission to stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir ``Vova'' Malofienko, 14, of Short Hills, N.J., has  
leukemia, but doctors say he has a good chance of reaching 
adulthood if he stays in the United States, Rep. Steven Rothman 
told a House subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the seven other children died after returning to homes  
near the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived about 30 miles from Chernobyl. Of the eight children  
brought from Chernobyl in 1990, seven of the eight are dead,'' 
Rothman, D-N.J., told the House Judiciary Committee's immigration 
subcommittee. Doctors believe ``that given the continued existence 
of the poisons in the atmosphere at Chernobyl, if he returns he 
will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee approved a one-page bill granting Vladimir, his  
mother and his father legal permanent residence in the United 
States. The bill now goes to the full committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Robert Torricelli, both New Jersey  
Democrats, introduced the same bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir's father is an engineer and his mother is an  
accountant, so the family isn't likely to need public assistance, 
Rothman said. ``They will not be living off the government of the 
United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir entered the United States on Aug. 7, 1990, as a  
non-immigrant visitor.

<HEADLINE> Group Endorses Microsoft Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a significant new twist to the landmark  
Microsoft antitrust case, one of the computer industry's most 
prominent trade groups is endorsing the breakup of Microsoft Corp. 
in a secret 40-page report circulated among its board and sent to 
government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Software and Information Industry Association proposed what  
some legal experts describe as the ``death-penalty'' for Microsoft 
-- splitting it up into companies selling separate products, such as 
Windows software, business programs and Internet content, or 
breaking it up into three or four ``Baby Bills'' or 
``Mini-Microsofts'' each with identical product lines. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a mandatory breakup of Microsoft ``deserves the most  
careful attention of the government and the court.'' But it doesn't 
distinguish which breakup plan it recommends, calling it a 
``Hobson's choice'' and ``ultimately an antitrust policy question 
with no clear answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The breakup proposal by the trade association is significant  
because Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the 
1,400-member group, formerly known as the Software Publishers 
Association. Its board includes executives from Netscape, Oracle 
Corp., IBM Corp., Symantec Corp., as well as Dow Jones &AMP; Co. and 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based group ``concludes that a structural  
reorganization of Microsoft can avoid the drawbacks associated with 
conduct-based, behavioral relief,'' such as constant government 
oversight and the risk that Microsoft might find loopholes in any 
restrictions imposed by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's executive director, Ken Wasch, declined to comment  
about the report, which was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has said previously that it's premature to consider  
what remedies it could face, and has argued it's not losing at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether the industry group's breakup proposal will  
be persuasive to government lawyers, who have indicated they are 
looking at a range of possible remedies to recommend to the judge 
if they win their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech scheduled for later today on the Senate floor,  
Republican Slade Gorton of Washington criticized government lawyers 
even for pondering remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they have even won their case, Mr. President, antitrust  
division officials are contemplating punishments,'' Gorton wrote in 
a draft of his speech. ``Before they have proven any consumer harm, 
they are devising consumer remedies. ... What happened to letting 
Justice take its course?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it loses, Microsoft's future could include behavioral  
restrictions, such as limits on deals with computer makers and 
Internet companies. It agreed to rescind some of those limits last 
year shortly before Gates testified during Senate hearings in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers acknowledge they also are seriously  
considering a requirement that Microsoft allow other companies to 
modify Windows sell it themselves, so-called ``compulsory 
licensing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it wins, the government has urged the judge to organize a  
special hearing to consider Microsoft's fate. In its lawsuit filed 
last May, it asked him to outlaw some of Microsoft's contracts, and 
asked him to force Microsoft to ship Netscape's rival Internet 
software in Windows or allow computer makers not to distribute the 
company's own browser. 
</P>
<P>
	But that ``must-carry'' proposal was widely seen as made moot  
after America Online's decision to buy Netscape for $4.2 billion, 
because AOL could choose to distribute Netscape's software to its 
more than 16 million subscribers, more than any other Internet 
provider.

<HEADLINE> Some Tips on Dangerous Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If abducted in a public place, don't go  
quietly, the State Department advises Americans who get in trouble 
abroad. Instead, ``make as much commotion as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If aboard a hijacked plane, observe the characteristics of the  
hijackers, privately think up nicknames for each one for later 
identification, and ``respond in a regulated tone of voice'' if 
spoken to, the department says. When traveling on business, make 
hotel reservations without using a company's name, only its 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	The worldly wise branch of the U.S. government doesn't want to  
restrain people's wanderlust. But it knows how dangerous the world 
can sometimes be. Known for its travel warnings -- the list of 
countries Americans are advised to avoid completely -- the 
department's Consular Affairs Bureau offers a lot more information 
than that for those who know where to find it. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Americans who rely solely on the travel warnings when  
deciding where to go are missing information that could mean the 
difference between life and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the slaughter of eight tourists at the edge of the Bwindi  
National Park, U.S. officials did not highlight Uganda as posing 
special danger. In fact, the area where Rwandan rebels butchered 
the two Americans, four Britons and two New Zealanders is described 
in a December consular report as ``generally safe,'' with ``some 
banditry and armed robbery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that same report, publicly available if little-known, is  
full of so much foreboding about Uganda in general that it is 
likely to give all but the most adventurous tourist pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar reports, or ``consular information sheets,'' offer the  
same level of detail on all countries, but tourists often don't 
know that when they book a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans do not like surprises,'' said a State Department  
consular official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``These 
sheets give them lots of foreshadowing of surprises that may befall 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Americans traveling to Russia are told that in the  
Caucasus region, ``local criminal gangs routinely kidnap 
foreigners, including Americans, for ransom.'' Trouble spots are 
noted in countries that tourists don't hesitate to visit -- for 
France, the Paris train lines most popular with thieves are 
described. 
</P>
<P>
	And about Uganda, tourists are told in great detail about the  
criminal and political violence experienced in many parts of the 
country -- and warned not to take food or drink from strangers on 
public transit, because it might be doped. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials question whether much of this information is being  
passed on by travel agents and tour companies, which are more 
likely to stick to the State Department's list of countries to 
avoid -- 28 currently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does a travel agent who's hypothetically trying to sell an  
umpteen-thousand-dollar trip to see gorillas necessarily want to 
tell the customer about the consular information sheet? Well, they 
should,'' the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from countries on its don't-go list, the State Department  
has 12 ``public announcements'' in effect for other nations and 
four in effect for worldwide threats. These detail risks that may 
be confined to certain areas of a country or are temporary, 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan attack prompted the department to issue a public  
announcement advising Americans to postpone travel to western 
Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Another such announcement, issued Jan. 5, warned that extremists  
may be planning attacks on U.S. interests in Egypt and that 
Americans there should keep a low profile, vary routes and times of 
travel and treat unfamiliar mail suspiciously. That advice is 
standard for Americans traveling or living in possibly unsafe 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those announcements, however, don't contain the wealth of  
information supplied by the consular sheets. Despite all the 
trouble noted in Uganda in the December report, no public 
announcement was in effect for that country until the latest 
attack. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Soar in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Friday  
in Tokyo, while Japanese stocks advanced following an overnight 
rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.52 yen in early trading, up 0.94 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
123.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 246.76 points,  
or 1.74 percent, to 14,430.21 in the first 30 minutes of morning 
trading. On Thursday, the average gained 13.09 points, or 0.09 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rose on buying by Japanese  
banks and overseas funds who used the release of Japanese price 
data as an excuse to buy the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's overall wholesale price index for February was up  
0.2 percent from January but was 3.8 percent lower than the 
year-earlier month, the Bank of Japan said Friday. The data fell 
within analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the data were considered neutral, currency investors were  
using it to buy dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 133.27 yen, up from  
133.13 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were sharply higher in response to  
the overnight gain on Wall Street and the dollar's strength against 
the yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial Average  
climbed 191.52 points to close at 9,467.70, boosted by benign 
economic data, strong retail sales reports and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, traders said Sony and Toshiba shares were heavily  
sought by buyers following the announcement Thursday that Sony 
Computer Entertainment Inc., a Sony unit, and Toshiba had agreed to 
set up a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	It will produce in Japan the 128-bit central processing unit for  
the next generation PlayStation game console. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 11.65 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,116.76 
points. The TOPIX rose 5.30 points, or 0.48 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Around 70M Saw Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 70 million people watched at least  
part of Barbara Walters' two-hour interview with Monica Lewinsky, 
according to preliminary Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In bookstores, there were signs of both Monica mania and intern  
overload today as workers stacked the just-released ``Monica's 
Story'' onto shelves and display racks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research gave ABC's Wednesday night show a 33.9  
rating and 47 share in its overnight measurement of 44 large 
markets, meaning just under half of the working televisions were 
tuned in to the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The metered markets measure 63 percent of the nation's viewers.  
More precise numbers for the country as a whole were to be made 
available later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky interview Wednesday night probably won't quite  
match the ratings of the decade's biggest one-on-one. Oprah 
Winfrey's prime-time interview of Michael Jackson in 1993 had a 
39.3 rating and 56 share. 
</P>
<P>
	If the national numbers are similar, as expected, it would mean  
about 33 million households were watching ABC. The 70 million 
figure is the number of viewers who watched some or all of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, the ratings for the interview were strongest at  
the beginning of the second hour. For many major television events, 
there's an initial curiosity factor and viewership drops off as it 
gets later. 
</P>
<P>
	But ABC said the rating was 32.8 for the first half hour, 34.5  
for the second 30 minutes and 35.0 between 10-10:30 p.m. Only in 
the final half hour did it slip to 33.3. The share remained at 49 
for the last hour, despite competition from ``Touched By an Angel'' 
on CBS and ``Law and Order'' on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia was tops among the metered markets with a 39.2  
rating and 53 share, followed by Boston, Dallas, San Francisco and 
Los Angeles. Jacksonville seemed the least interested, scoring a 
23.6 rating and 33 share. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the program had a 33.3 rating and 46 share.  
</P>
<P>
	But ABC, which scheduled the interview during the last day of a  
ratings ``sweeps'' month and asked advertisers to pay five times 
the normal rate for a ``20/20'' episode, said the numbers were 
``stupendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's book, a collaboration with Princess Diana  
biographer Andrew Morton, was being snapped up on the Internet. The 
confessional was No. 1 on the bookseller lists of Amazon.com and 
barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those pop culture phenomenons,'' said Ben Boyd,  
a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com. He said the book was selling 
2.8 copies per minute for a few hours late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer reaction seemed mixed in an early spot check of  
bookstores today around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had nobody calling looking for it,'' said Lee Schwartz,  
owner of The Book Center in Cumberland, Md. ``It seems like most 
people are saying, `I just don't want to hear about it anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody who comes to our store has shown any interest in the  
Monica Lewinsky affair. In fact, they're sick of it,'' said Steven 
Elliot, of the Kendall Book Shelf in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Wind To Test Wright Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOFFETT FIELD, Calif. (AP) -- NASA engineers have mounted a  
full-scale replica of the Wright brothers' original biplane in a 
wind tunnel to learn more about its stability, control and 
handling. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope the tests will help the plane buffs who plan to  
fly the replica in 2003 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 
first flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17, 1903. 
</P>
<P>
	``By understanding the flying characteristics of the Wright  
Flyer, we gain a better understanding of the Wright brothers' 
science and engineering skills, as well as an appreciation of the 
process that led to the development of the airplanes we fly 
today,'' said Craig Hange, a wind tunnel test engineer at NASA's 
Ames Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of volunteers from the American Institute of Aeronautics  
and Astronautics built the replica using data from the original 
airplane provided by the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	The wings are fabric, the supports are wood, and there are no  
wheels to land on -- just skids. 
</P>
<P>
	The replica, perched in the cavernous wind tunnel this week,  
will be subjected to conditions it would face traveling 30 mph 
about 10 feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	California Institute of Technology aeronautics professor Fred  
Culick, 63, is slated to be the first to fly the plane four years 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazing up at the 600-pound biplane Wednesday, he said he's  
looking forward to actually feeling what Orville Wright felt on 
that first flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Orville won a coin flip with Wilbur to determine who would be at  
the controls; the plane went about 120 feet on a flight that lasted 
about 12 seconds. It was the first engine-powered flight of a 
heavier-than-air machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Culick said he'll be wearing a helmet and a safety harness.  
</P>
<P>
	``I may be foolhardy, but I'm not crazy,'' Culick said.

<HEADLINE> Secret Service Gets New Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brian L. Stafford, former head of President  
Clinton's security detail, was being sworn in today as the 20th 
director of the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford replaces Lou Merletti, who retired two months ago to  
run the security operation for the Cleveland Browns football team. 
Merletti fought to keep Secret Service agents from testifying in 
the Monica Lewinsky investigation, but the courts ruled against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford, a 28-year veteran of the Secret Service, is a native  
of Sharpsville, Pa. He served in the Army prior to joining the 
agency, serving a tour of duty in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971. He was 
head of Clinton's security detail for about a year, but did not 
testify in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who oversees the agency, was  
swearing Stafford in., said spokesman Jim Mackin.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T: We Don't Want To Buy AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. doesn't want to acquire the  
nation's largest Internet provider, America Online, despite 
persistent rumors about such a deal, AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely not interested in, nor are we pursuing  
acquiring America Online,'' Armstrong said, responding to a 
question about whether a deal between the two titan companies is in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been published reports that the two companies were  
thinking about pairing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong made his remarks after giving a speech to the American  
Enterprise Institute here. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, meanwhile, had wanted federal regulators, as a condition of  
approving AT&AMP;T's planned merger with cable giant 
Tele-Communications, to make the merged company provide other 
companies with access to TCI's high-speed lines, which reach 
one-third of U.S. homes. The FCC, in clearing the merger last 
month, refused to to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said it's in AT&AMP;T's financial interest to get as many  
companies as it can onto its high-speed networks. The company, 
along with the cable industry, opposes government-mandated access 
to cable companies' high-speed lines into their customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, AT&AMP;T and cable companies support voluntary agreements  
for businesses offering competing services to gain access to the 
lines, which allow people to surf the Internet and receive data at 
speeds considerably faster than normal phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	If AOL can spare time from lobbying on the cable access issue,  
``We'd be happy to sit down and negotiate'' a deal giving AOL 
access to TCI's lines, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AT&AMP;T-TCI merger has won all major regulatory approvals.  
Armstrong said he hopes to close the deal March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Armstrong, in his speech, said U.S. companies --  
backed by the U.S. government -- need to work on lowering the fees 
U.S. carriers must pay foreign telephone companies to complete 
calls to many countries. Armstrong believes the fees, which get 
passed onto customers, are artificially high, forcing U.S. callers 
to pay $5 billion a year more than they should for many 
international calls. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint asked the Federal Communications  
Commission last week to help force foreign carriers in Kuwait, 
Cyprus and Netherlands Antilles to lower their fees. AT&AMP;T and 
WorldCom have also complained to the FCC that fees charged by 
Mexican carriers are too high.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not just the high pay offered by airlines  
that is coaxing pilots to leave the armed services, a group of

<HEADLINE> Mets Seek Final Pieces to Puzzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- With their starting rotation,  
bullpen and everyday lineup pretty much in order, New York Mets 
manager Bobby Valentine is looking for the accessories to finish 
the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with the exhibition opener Friday night against the  
Montreal Expos, Mets manager Bobby Valentine will be playing the 
numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on whether or not New York goes into the season with  
11 or 12 pitchers, the Mets still need to make a decision on five 
or six bench players to complete the 25-man roster for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring injury, New York's starting rotation of Al Leiter, Rick  
Reed, Bobby Jones, Masato Yoshii and Hideo Nomo is set. 
Left-handers coming out of the bullpen include Allen Watson, Dennis 
Cook and John Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	From the right-handed side are Greg McMichael, Turk Wendell and  
Armando Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Mets decide to go with a 12th pitcher, they could  
take Jason Isringhausen, Paul Wilson or Jeff Tam north. 
</P>
<P>
	The oft-injured Isringhausen threw about 50 pitches during two  
innings of simulated game conditions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks healthy and he feels healthy, and right now that's  
more important than how he looks,'' Valentine said. ``He threw all 
his pitches, and I think he's going to go on from here and pitch an 
inning in a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen underwent two arthroscopic procedures in 1996 to  
repair his right shoulder and right elbow. Last April, he broke his 
right wrist while with the Triple-A team in Norfolk, and was placed 
on the disabled list in March to recover from the previous season's 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the pitching is set, New York will add backup catchers,  
infielders and outfielders to the roster, plugging in needs for 
left-handed and right-handed hitting as well as speed off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Todd Pratt leads the race to fill in behind Mike Piazza,  
based on his .275 average in 41 games last year with New York and 
his ability to also play first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder Matt Franco also has the versatility factor, having  
the ability to serve as an emergency catcher, and he hits from the 
left side. Luis Lopez is a switch-hitting middle infielder who 
spent 117 games in New York last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Duncan also is in the mix after spending a year in Japan  
and the 1997 season as the starting second baseman for the New York 
Yankees' championship team 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the guys who play the infield and hit right-handed  
will be in competition here,'' Valentine said while discussing 
Duncan. ``You wonder how he could contribute to the long season, 
guys who have more experience have a better idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets starting infield is set with John Olerud at first,  
Edgardo Alfonzo at second, Rey Ordonez at shortstop and Robin 
Ventura at third. 
</P>
<P>
	Backing up an outfield of Bobby Bonilla, Brian McRae and Rickey  
Henderson could be Roger Cedeno who came over from the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and Jerome Allensworth, who played 34 games last year with 
the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said the battle will continue for the final roster  
spots throughout the spring training schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as things develop, guys could work their way into a  
situation that could increase their chances of making the team,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers To Idle Another 5M Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department on Thursday  
accepted nearly 5 million acres of land into the Conservation 
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to take environmentally 
sensitive acreage out of production. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana had the largest amount approved, 638,178 acres, followed  
by North Dakota with 603,235; Texas, 554,800; Kansas, 403,030; and 
Minnesota, 380,547. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 29.8 million acres nationwide enrolled in the program,  
with about 3.5 million acres of that under contracts that expire 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Land put in the program must be planted with trees, grass and  
other cover. In exchange, farmers are guaranteed payments for 10 to 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers offered 7.1 million acres in the latest sign-up  
period. The offers are evaluated according to the cost and 
environmental benefits of idling the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased with the results of this sign-up,'' said  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ``Our nation's farmers and 
ranchers continue to demonstrate their commitment to the 
environment and to America's long-term productivity.'' 
</P>

	The latest round of contracts will cost taxpayers $200 million a  
year.

<HEADLINE> Senate Holds Internet Smut Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal requiring certain schools and  
libraries to use Internet software to block material inappropriate 
for children would undermine efforts by communities to solve the 
issue, a Senate panel was told Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress must understand that there is no one-size-fits-all  
solution that the federal government can impose that is better or 
more thoughtful than the solutions communities adopt,'' Candace 
Morgan, associate director of the Fort Vancouver Regional Library 
in Washington state, told the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan bill is intended to shield minors from sexually  
explicit material on the Internet by requiring schools and 
libraries that get federally subsidized hookups to install and use 
special computer software to block access to such sites, and the 
proposal got some support at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation ... is an absolute necessity,'' said Bruce  
Taylor, president of the National Law Center for Children and 
Families. ``The libraries and the schools are not going to use 
these technologies unless someone makes them do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill -- sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the panel's  
chairman, and Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., its senior Democrat -- 
recommends no specific blocking device and would let schools, 
school boards, libraries and other authorities decide what material 
should be blocked or filtered. It does require that libraries have 
at least one computer fitted with the software. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing featured a testy exchange between Morgan and McCain,  
who disagreed with the librarian's contention that the bill would 
require libraries and schools to have the filtering software up and 
running at all times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your testimony does not coincide with what the intent and the  
language of the legislation says,'' snapped McCain, who is 
exploring a run for president in 2000. ``I'm sorry that you would 
not read English the same way that everybody else does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., is sponsoring a companion measure in  
the House.

<HEADLINE> Walker Signs 6-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- National League batting champion Larry Walker  
agreed today to a six-year extension of his contract with the 
Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, in interviews, had been pressuring the Rockies to come  
up with a deal before the season began, hinting he might choose to 
become a free agent if they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed. But a statement said  
the Rockies will help Walker fund a foundation for children and 
families in need in the Rocky Mountain region and Walker's native 
British Columbia. The Rockies and Walker together will provide 
$3,333,333 to get the foundation going. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, won the 1998 National League batting title with a  
.363 average. In 1997, he was the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	His defensive play has earned him two consecutive Gold Gloves.  
He is the Rockies career leader with a batting average of .335, 
slugging percentage of .643 and on-base percent of .414. His 
lifetime average, including his seasons at Montreal, is .305. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker signed a four-year free-agent contract with the Rockies  
before the 1995 season. It included a 1999 club option.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Howland To Coach Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Northern Arizona basketball coach Ben Howland  
reportedly will be the new head coach for the University of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic said today that Howland declined comment,  
but that sources at Pittsburgh and Flagstaff confirmed he had 
signed a contract, details of which were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland, who interviewed for the position earlier this week, was  
en route Wednesday night to Ogden, Utah, where the Lumberjacks 
(20-7 12-4), runners-up to Weber State (22-7, 13-3) in the Big Sky 
Conference regular season, will participate in the conference 
playoffs this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland, 40, led the Lumberjacks to a 75-57 record in five  
seasons, including back-to-back conference championships. Northern 
Arizona also made the NCAA playoffs last year for the first time 
and still hopes to do so this season. The winner of the conference 
tournament gets an automatic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh was expected to hold off introducing Howland as its  
new coach until after the weekend. Pittsburgh lost to Rutgers 64-51 
in Wednesday night's first round of the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Under coach Ralph Willard, Pittsburgh is 14-16 overall and 5-13  
in the conference this season. The Panthers have had only one 
winning season in his five with the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard announced at midseason that he was leaving Pitt after  
the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Holton, Northern Arizona's athletic director, said he had  
nothing to announce Wednesday night, but that the Lumberjacks were 
in the preliminary stages of a coaching search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said Holton acknowledged that Jamie Dixon, an  
assistant at Hawaii and former assistant at Northern Arizona, has 
inquired about the job. ``He is definitely somebody we're 
considering,'' Holton said.

	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- The rap star known as Coolio changed his  
plea to no contest and faces sentencing April 9 on a charge of 
carrying a concealed weapon in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio, 35, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., entered the  
plea Wednesday in Superior Court, the day of a pretrial hearing. He 
originally pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio was in his military-style Hummer when a sheriff's deputy  
stopped him in September for allegedly driving on the wrong side of 
a street in suburban Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapper told the deputy that he had a gun in a door pouch,  
prosecutors said. The deputy allegedly seized a 9mm semiautomatic 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio was convicted of a similar offense in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Dell, IBM Make $16 Billion Deal </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. will buy an estimated $16  
billion worth of equipment from International Business Machines 
Corp. under a seven-year deal that also calls for the companies to 
jointly develop new computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the agreement today sent the stock prices of  
both companies higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal initially calls for Dell to buy equipment from IBM  
including disk drives, flat-panel displays and memory chips. The 
companies eventually expect broader sharing of technology, 
including co-developing new products. 
</P>
<P>
	For IBM, the deal helps insure a steady and increasing flow of  
business from a company that is already one of its largest 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IBM will be able to make sure its future  
technologies are suited to customer's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Dell gets faster access to leading edge technology  
which could help set its computers apart from competitor's machines 
ranging from personal computers and laptops to central computers 
that manage corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the deal, Dell can continue to buy from a variety of  
suppliers but has a strong incentive to give a large chunk of 
business to IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our share of Dell's business should increase as a result,''  
said Dave Ernsberger, vice president of worldwide sales for IBM's 
technolgy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer makers are under intense pressure to shave costs and  
become more efficient amid a price-cutting war that has hurt even 
Dell, the fastest growing maker and the No. 2 manufacturer of PCs 
behind Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said the deal will help the company boost its  
competitiveness in notebook PCs, storage products and servers, 
which are powerful corporate machines that run networks of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Round Rock, Texas-based Dell reported last month that its  
fourth-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street expectations as it 
was hurt by rivals who bid more aggressively for corporate 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, the world's largest computer company,  
has been struggling for several years to lift sluggish sales of PCs 
and squeeze more profits from machines that have plummeted in 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM stock jumped $7.25, or 4 percent, to $174 per share in  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the 
announcement. Dell shares rose $3.43 3/4, also 4 percent, to $84.37 1/2 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Falcons-Kanell Deal Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons moved close to reaching  
contract terms with Danny Kanell on Thursday, a move that would 
provide backup for quarterback Chris Chandler and reunite Kanell 
with coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've reached an agreement in principle on most things,''  
general manager Harold Richardson said. ``There are still some 
things to be worked out.'' He said a deal could be completed on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell played for Reeves with the New York Giants, where he was  
the starter for most of last season before being benched in 
November after a 3-7 start. He completed 160 passes in 299 attempts 
for 1,603 yards, 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell, who was replaced by Kent Graham, was released by the  
Giants last month after they signed Kerry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 fourth-round draft pick out of Florida State, Kanell also  
was sought by the Miami Dolphins, where his father served as team 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell started 20 games in three seasons in New York. In 1997,  
he completed 156 of 294 passes for 1,740 yards, 11 TDs and nine 
interceptions after taking over for Dave Brown in midseason and 
helping the Giants win the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was fired by the Giants after the 1996 season and is in  
his third season in Atlanta. He guided the Falcons to the NFC title 
last season.

<HEADLINE> Storms in Northwest, South Kill Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Powerful winds and large waves whipped the Pacific Northwest  
coast on Wednesday, knocking out power to tens of thousands and 
interrupting ferry service across Washington state's Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South, tornadoes and strong storms tore across several  
states. 
</P>
<P>
	A 36-year-old man was killed in Washington when a tree fell on  
the car he was driving. In Alabama, a 23-year-old man was killed 
when a tree slammed into his trailer home in Milbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you just heard a big boom,'' said Stephanie  
Clecker, 17, who lives nearby the trailer home. ``Glass started 
flying everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Gov. Gary Locke declared a state of emergency in five  
counties in the western part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	At the peak of the wind storm, gusts reached as high as 68 mph  
in Snohomish, northeast of Seattle, the weather service said, while 
35-foot seas and sustained 60 mph winds were reported off the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 people were without electricity early  
Wednesday as falling tree limbs felled power lines, but most had 
power restored by noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger ferry service in the Puget Sound area was canceled  
Wednesday morning, affecting about 45,000 people, state ferry 
spokeswoman Susan Harris-Huether said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also closed the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge across  
Seattle's Lake Washington, bringing morning commuter traffic to a 
near-standstill. There was damage to the draw span of the bridge 
and crews said it could not be repaired until at least Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 cars use the Evergreen Point bridge each  
day, which connects Seattle to the eastern suburbs -- including 
Redmond where Microsoft headquarters is located. The damage leaves 
the Interstate 90 floating bridge, three miles to the south, as the 
only cross-lake span. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Washington coast, heavy seas combined with high tides to  
flood the town of Raymond's downtown area with up to 2 feet of 
water. Two apartment complexes were evacuated, and nearly 40 people 
sought shelter at a Red Cross facility. Downtown was reopened late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes touched down in Florida and Texas late Tuesday and  
early Wednesday, damaging dozens of homes and causing minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, a thunderstorm packing strong winds ripped through  
a construction site south of Richmond on Wednesday, injuring 16 
people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Search dogs were brought in to help officials account for  
everyone at Chaparral Virginia Steel Recycling construction site, 
said Janet Clements, spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people injured at the construction site were taken to a  
Petersburg hospital with neck and back injuries and cuts. They were 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the injured were treated at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Two emergency workers en route to the construction site were  
injured in an automobile accident. One was in stable condition and 
another was critical. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, winds topped 60 mph knocked down trees and  
power lines as a cold front swept through the state and dumped up 
to 7 inches of snow in the mountains and spawning thunderstorms and 
hail. Power outages left more than 100,000 North Carolina utility 
customers in the dark for a time. 
</P>
<P>
	In east Texas, several Tuesday night twisters nearly demolished  
six homes and damaged as many as 25 others. Several people suffered 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado in the Florida Panhandle damaged about 55 homes, with  
20 sustaining major damage.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Don't Necessarily Help Studios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Oscar can jump-start a career, boost box  
office or get its director, producer or stars a better table at the 
hottest restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	But it can't protect a movie studio from going belly up.  
</P>
<P>
	Three studios and one production-acquisition house with films  
receiving Academy Award nominations this year are either dead or 
face uncertain futures, the result of corporate upheaval in the 
movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	PolyGram Films and its specialty label Gramercy Pictures have an  
armload of Oscar nominations: Gramercy's ``Elizabeth'' with seven 
nominations including best picture and PolyGram's ``What Dreams May 
Come'' with two nominations for its stunning visuals. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Seagram Co. purchased the PolyGram parent PolyGram NV,  
the domestic distribution offices of PolyGram Films are being shut 
and foreign operations melded into Seagram-owned Universal Studios. 
Gramercy is likely to be sold or folded into another studio, 
perhaps Universal's specialty label, October Films. 
</P>
<P>
	That is if October Films stays in the Seagram family. October,  
whose ``Hilary and Jackie'' picked up nominations for actresses 
Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, is another candidate to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, most of the operations of long-struggling Largo  
Entertainment, which produced ``Affliction,'' were closed by its 
corporate parent, JVC Entertainment of Japan, just days before two 
of its actors, Nick Nolte and James Coburn, received Academy Award 
nominations for best actor and supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the back-room turmoil won't be evident on the  
screen. The films will remain in release, with vigorous advertising 
and Oscar campaigns. The executives who got the boot will probably 
get new jobs and, this being Hollywood, higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But it does give some insight into how things work in the movie  
industry -- to a degree how they've always worked -- in this 
community that novelist Budd Schulberg likened nearly 60 years ago 
in ``What Makes Sammy Run?'' to a gold rush boom town whose chief 
products are movies, ambition and fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bittersweet,'' said Barr Potter, Largo's chairman and  
chief executive, who will remain at the company to help with the 
shutdown. ``It's just an example of the extremes that one goes 
through in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was, perhaps, worse in the early 1990s, before the start of a  
Hollywood economic surge. Consider that the 1991 best-picture 
winner was ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' whose producers picked up 
the Oscars while the film's studio, Orion, was in the throes of 
bankruptcy. The movie also won Oscars for director Jonathan Demme, 
co-stars Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster and screenwriter Ted 
Tally. But with the Hollywood economy showing signs of cooling, and 
movie production costs continuing to soar, fear and uncertainty are 
as strong as they have been in years. Many studios, worried about 
staking too much on a single picture, are entering into financial 
partnerships with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of deals are done with more and more frequency,''  
said Miramax West Coast President Mark Gill, whose studio's 
best-picture nominee ``Shakespeare in Love'' is being financed and 
released in a partnership with Universal Studios. ``The rivalries 
are put aside, frankly, to moderate risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the co-production deals and the shifting corporate  
ownership of studios and their art house divisions, lines are now 
blurred all over the Hollywood map. It isn't always clear who 
should get credit -- or who will be around this time tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the tale of this season's second costume drama, about  
the behind-the-scenes intrigue during the reign of England's Queen 
Elizabeth, has plenty of its own real-life drama behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth'' began life as a Working Title production for the  
Dutch-owned film and music company PolyGram NV, the same 
producer-studio partnership behind the Oscar-nominated ``Four 
Weddings and a Funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced for about $22 million, ``Elizabeth'' was distributed  
through PolyGram's Gramercy Pictures, which handles lower-budget, 
artier films. After becoming a hit last September in the United 
Kingdom, the film came to the United States, where it built an 
audience and endeared itself to the Academy, which nominated it for 
the seven Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	But a cloud has hung over Gramercy ever since Seagram, the  
Canadian liquor and entertainment giant, purchased PolyGram last 
year for $10.2 billion. Seagram already had a Hollywood studio in 
Universal and a specialty division in October Films, and suddenly 
PolyGram and Gramercy were looking expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram sold off pieces of PolyGram -- MGM got most of the film  
library, a company called Carlton Communications Inc. got the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, a Saudi prince, Muhammad Bin Bandur Abdul Aziz, was  
reportedly willing to pay $400 million to $600 million for the rest 
of PolyGram, but the deal never happened. 
</P>
<P>
	So Seagram merged PolyGram's international businesses with  
Universal and started laying off employees in the domestic PolyGram 
office, leaving Gramercy in limbo. Gramercy still could be sold, or 
it could be merged into October Films. 
</P>
<P>
	But studio officials remained committed to ``Elizabeth,''  
despite the uncertainty. There was a vigorous Oscar campaign and a 
healthy marketing push, including television ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also has received a strong distribution commitment; it  
has been put in expanded release since the Oscar nominations, 
earning a modest box-office boost from the Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also caught in the Seagram-PolyGram whirlwind is ``Hilary and  
Jackie,'' which was released by October Films, whose own future is 
hardly clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade papers have reported that media mogul Barry Diller, who  
had purchased Universal's television operations from Seagram, may 
have his eye on October, though a sale to Diller has reportedly 
been rejected by October's partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Just who will ultimately own and control October remains a  
question, though the film is shielded from the turmoil. It, too, 
has an Oscar campaign and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the major players would comment beyond a recent  
Universal statement that ``the process of integrating PolyGram 
Filmed Entertainment into Universal's film operations has now 
begun'' and that Gramercy's fate, like that of PolyGram's video and 
TV operations, is ``still currently under evaluation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More coldly certain is the fate of PolyGram Films' U.S.  
distribution offices, which didn't survive Oscar season, even as 
its Robin Williams film, ``What Dreams May Come'' competes for 
awards for art direction and visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
	People started clearing out their desks last month in the  
Beverly Hills offices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the corporate parents are still behind the film, which is  
getting a strong Oscar campaign in ads in the trade papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Largo's shutdown was long expected. Formed 10 years ago, it had  
produced or acquired ``G.I. Jane,'' ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' 
and ``Affliction.'' But it has struggled in recent years; JVC 
stopped its production financing last year, leaving Largo 
essentially a sales agent. Then last month, JVC discontinued even 
those activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affliction,'' however, got a big Oscar push and remains in  
theaters (the movie is being distributed by Lions Gate). In the 
meantime, executives are mopping up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no specific plans at the moment,'' said Potter. ``I'm  
focusing on tying up all the loose ends. And once that's behind me, 
I'll be making every effort to find my next situation and explore 
any interesting opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> Tourist Killers Make More Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Uganda sent hundreds of troops into  
neighboring Congo and beefed up police and military presence today 
after rebels who slaughtered eight foreign tourists reportedly 
threatened further attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The search was focusing on dense jungle just over the border,  
where the rebels are based. Rwandan soldiers also were involved in 
the manhunt, which began in earnest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI team, meanwhile, was in Kampala investigating the deaths  
of two Americans among those killed Monday in remote campgrounds in 
southwestern Uganda's Impenetrable Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Britons and two New Zealanders also were killed. Six other  
tourists were seized but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Ugandan side of the border, police reinforcements were  
sent into the western districts of Kasese and Bundibugyo after 
rebels distributed letters warning they would launch further 
attacks, the private Central Broadcasting Service reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It said roadblocks had been set up in two villages in those  
areas, which are north of the Kisoro district where the tourists 
were killed. The report did not say how many forces were deployed, 
but Ugandan officials said a battalion of about 600 soldiers was 
sent into Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, on Wednesday promised to  
hunt down the rebels and appealed for help from the international 
community to track them down. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels were among Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994  
after killing more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically 
moderate Hutus in a government-orchestrated genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hutu fighters, who have been carrying out cross-border raids  
from bases in eastern Congo, are angry at the United States, 
Britain and Uganda for providing aid to Rwanda's new Tutsi-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ugandan commander said soldiers tracked the rebels to a base  
in Congo's Virunga National Park on Tuesday, killing some before 
they scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Uganda's government-owned New Vision newspaper reported today  
that government forces killed 15 rebels in a gunbattle, and that 
the insurgents were retreating. It did not specify where or when 
the fighting occurred, or whether those killed had anything to do 
with the tourists' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	New Vision also said the army arrested a suspect who had  
apparently helped brief rebels on the positions of tourists and the 
locations of their belongings in the park before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing an unidentified source, said several  
people had been heard briefing the rebels before the attack. ``They 
seemed to know which tents were occupied and by who. They only 
missed one,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were abducted Sunday at campgrounds on the edge of  
Bwindi National Park, the starting point for those hoping to 
glimpse rare mountain gorillas portrayed in the 1988 film 
``Gorillas in the Mist.'' 
</P>

	American-born pilot and guide Mark Ross, credited with

	``It's a beautiful forest and the people that ran it were

<HEADLINE> Ice Cube Enters Contract Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rappers Ice Cube and Mack 10 backed out of  
deal to feature their likenesses on clothing and threatened their 
business partners with violence, a lawyer told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessmen Chris Word and Charles Palmer accuse the rappers of  
breach of contract and are seeking unspecified damages over the 
Beverly Hills deal they say the musicians abandoned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants decided on their own they would breach the  
contract, break it,'' the businessmen's lawyer, David Wiggins, told 
jurors as the trial began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rappers' lawyer, Irwin Evans, said the four men discussed  
starting a business but never entered into a partnership deal. He 
told jurors the dealings got off to a bad start when Word and 
Palmer forged Ice Cube's name on a lease agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	An accountant for the rappers found the business had atrocious  
bookkeeping, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My clients sought to take control of this business ... only  
after they had put in an excess of $70,000 and not seen a penny,'' 
Evans added.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky let the public share her  
anguish -- about her relationship with President Clinton, her sex 
life with others and the main players in the drama that led to a 
historic impeachment trial. After sharing her innermost feelings 
about her presidential affair and her loathing for Kenneth Starr in 
an ABC interview, Ms. Lewinsky says her major worry now is ``doing 
something to lose my immunity'' from prosecution. Months before her 
immunity deal with Starr was sealed last summer, Ms. Lewinsky filed 
a false affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying an affair with 
the president.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Killed Because He Was Gay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYLACAUGA, Ala. (AP) -- Two men charged with the murder of a man  
whose body was set afire told investigators they killed him because 
he was homosexual, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Monroe Butler Jr., 21, was arrested Monday and Steven  
Eric Mullins, 25, was arrested Wednesday in the Feb. 19 slaying of 
Billy Jack Gaither, 39. Both men confessed, Coosa County Sheriff's 
Deputy Al Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said both men knew Gaither, whose charred remains were  
found Feb. 20 by a passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mullins and Butler stated the reason they killed him was  
because he was a homosexual,'' he said. ``We believe this to be the 
true motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither met with the two men in Sylacauga, a community about 40  
miles southeast of Birmingham, on the night he was killed, police 
said. He had last been seen in a bar he frequented. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the statements, Mullins called Gaither and asked  
him to go to the bar, where they met and apparently left together. 
Authorities said the men apparently took Gaither to a remote 
location, bludgeoned him to death and set fire to his body, using 
an old car tire as a pyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said members of Gaither's family told investigators that  
he was homosexual. He said this morning that he couldn't say which 
family members had divulged the information, but ``through our 
investigation, we know for a fact that he was gay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither's father, however, told The Birmingham News that his son  
was not homosexual and that he thought the motive was robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Gaither said his son cared for him after 13 operations.  
``He said he would never leave me alone,'' Gaither said. ``I think 
he's the kind of son everybody would want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his family and Butler's family have known each other for  
years. ``As a matter of fact, the boy's grandmother baby-sitted 
Billy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have been charged with murder. At a hearing today,  
Mullins' bond was set at $500,000. Butler remained in the Coosa 
County Jail on $500,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> State, Local Spending on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending by America's state and local  
governments has reached $1.39 trillion, a level approaching what 
Washington pays out. 
</P>
<P>
	The total was from 1995-96, the most recent period for which  
figures are available, the Census Bureau reports in data being 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1996 the federal government had spending of $1.56  
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the state and local governments had an overall surplus  
that year, Uncle Sam posted a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local income totaled $1.51 trillion, leaving a surplus  
of $119 billion. Washington had income of $1.45 trillion, for a 
$107 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal aid to state and local governments more than made the  
difference. Some $235 billion of state and local income came from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, 1996 spending by state and local governments was up  
3.4 percent from the year before. On the other hand, state and 
local governments' income increased by 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings include:  
</P>
<P>
	--State and local governments spent more than half their money on  
four areas. Topping the list was education ($399 billion), followed 
by public welfare ($193 billion), highways ($79 billion) and 
hospitals ($71 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	--Taxes continued as the primary source of government revenue.  
State governments relied primarily on general sales tax ($139 
billion) and individual income taxes ($133 billion). Local 
government got most of its income from property taxes ($199 
billion). 
</P>
<P>
	--State and local governments had an outstanding debt of $1.2  
trillion, interest payments on debt of $69 billion and cash and 
security holdings of $2.3 trillion. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> AP's Herbert Kelley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REVERE, Mass. (AP) -- Herbert C. Kelley, who headed technical  
services for The Associated Press in Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
and helped oversee AP's transition into the computer age during 30 
years with the news cooperative, is dead at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died Tuesday of a heart attack at his home on Revere  
Beach, said Jean Bethune, his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Herb was the best; a class act,'' said John Reid, AP vice  
president for technology. ``He was justifiably proud of all his 
accomplishments during his three decades with the AP, but he was 
even prouder of the people he worked with. He was mentor to a lot 
of us. We have lost not only a valued colleague, but a dear and 
special friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley began with the wire service in the days when it moved  
stories over land lines at 55 words a minute. Now, transmissions 
via satellite can reach 1,000 times that speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley began working in the Boston office and rose through the  
ranks, taking charge of northern New England operations and then 
Southern California in 1975. He rose to deputy director of 
communications operations for the entire AP before coming back to 
Boston in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include daughters Lisa DeGrandis of Boston, June  
Durante of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Kathy Mahoney of Peabody; 
son Herbert of Hopkinton; sister Pat Hawes of Peabody; and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	A wake was scheduled for today at the Buonfiglio Funeral Home in  
Revere, and a funeral Mass will be held Friday at St. Anthony's 
Roman Catholic Church in Revere.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Canada, MetroNet To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has agreed to merge its Canadian  
operations with MetroNet Communications Corp., a local Canadian 
phone service supplier to businesses, in a deal that values 
Metronet at at least $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today would enable the merged company to  
offer business customers in Canada everything from long-distance to 
Internet to local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also extend AT&AMP;T's strategy of creating a one-stop shop  
for telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, the biggest U.S. long-distance provider, initially plans  
to merge its AT&AMP;T Canada operations with Metronet's business in a 
company to be called AT&AMP;T Canada Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would have annual revenue of about $925 million,  
more than 4,000 employees and over $2.3 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will be carried out in several stages. After the  
first stage, Metronet shareholders would indirectly own 69 percent 
of the merged company and AT&AMP;T would have the remaining 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage of the deal will occur after the companies  
receive regulatory approval for the merger. AT&AMP;T has agreed to buy 
all of Metronet's shares for at least 75 Canadian dollars per share 
-- $49.50 at current exchange rates -- or the appraised fair market 
value of Metronet shares at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the minimum price, that would value Metronet's 45.5 million  
shares at about $2.3 billion. The payment would be cash, stock or 
some combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, but  
it must be approved by MetroNet shareholders at a meeting expected 
to be held in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But if AT&AMP;T doesn't purchase the shares before June 30, 2000,  
the minimum price per share would be increased by 16 percent a year 
through June 30, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's stock was up $1.12 1/2 to $84.50 a share in early New York  
Stock Exchange today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, MCI WorldCom announced an agreement with Bell  
Canada that will allow the U.S. company to extend its phone service 
into Canada.

<HEADLINE> Charges Upgraded on Womack, Burnim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A judge has raised misdemeanor  
assault and battery charges against Virginia sophomore tailback 
Antwoine Womack and senior defensive back Adrian Burnim to felony 
malicious wounding charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemming from a campus fight last month were  
upgraded Wednesday at the request of assistant prosecutor Steven 
Buck. Each football player now faces two malicious wounding counts, 
as does a third person, Kevin D. Cromartie, who is not a student. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were charged after becoming involved in a Feb. 7 fight  
with two University of Virginia students, Jonathan Dean and Cabal 
Thornton, who sustained cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck said he asked for the upgraded charges ``because of the  
brutality of the attack and the severity of the injuries. It was an 
unprovoked attack. It was an attack from behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction of malicious wounding carries a sentence of up to 20  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Cavaliers football players also were charged. Devon  
Simmons and John Duckett still face two counts each of misdemeanor 
assault and battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck said the attack resulted from a year-old grudge that  
Cromartie had against Dean.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns signed running back Terry  
Kirby on Thursday, making him the sixth former San Francisco 49er 
to join the expansion club. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby, 29, played three seasons with Miami and three with San  
Francisco. He was a third-round pick by the Dolphins in 1993 out of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby has 2,272 career yards rushing on 594 carries, and has  
caught 246 passes for 2,498 yards. He has caught 50 or more passes 
in three of his six NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry brings us tremendous versatility at the running back  
position,'' said Dwight Clark, vice president of football 
operations for the Browns. Clark previously held the same position 
with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby ``not only is a proven running back, but one of the most  
successful receiving backs,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby is the brother of former Indians outfielder Wayne Kirby.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Owner Claims L.A. Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis is pressing  
his claim to own the rights to professional football in Los 
Angeles, adding yet another twist in the campaign to bring the NFL 
back to the nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying Davis' claim has no legal merit, an NFL spokesman said  
Thursday that Davis' decision to sue the league in Los Angeles 
Superior Court won't derail the process of choosing where to put 
the league's next expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials are considering bids from two groups in Los  
Angeles and another in Houston for a new NFL team that could begin 
play in 2002. Owners are expected to vote on the proposals when 
they meet March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be prepared to move forward on expansion  
regardless of the pending litigation,'' said NFL spokesman Greg 
Aiello. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders went  
back to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from Davis' attorneys were not immediately  
returned Thursday. In statements Wednesday, they described U.S. 
District Court Judge George H. King's ruling as a victory because 
they originally wanted to pursue the claim in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	King on Tuesday threw out Davis' claim the Raiders owner owns  
the Los Angeles market, saying federal law did not apply to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	King also dismissed Davis' claim the NFL violated antitrust laws  
in 1994 when the league refused to facilitate the Raiders' move 
from Los Angeles to Oakland by scheduling games there. 
</P>
<P>
	King said Davis was free to refile his claim in Los Angeles  
Superior Court, and Davis did just that Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the new lawsuit also is dismissed, it represents an  
unwelcome development for the NFL, said Mark Eschenfelder, 
professor of sports economics at Robert Morris College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly given the NFL's track record with Al Davis, they  
have to be cringing,'' said Eschenfelder. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis successfully sued the NFL in 1982, winning the right to  
move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. Davis moved the team 
back to Oakland in 1995 after the Los Angeles Coliseum was damaged 
by an earthquake. The NFL sued, claiming the team scheduled games 
in Oakland without league approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders countersued, saying the league blocked the team's  
attempt to move in 1994, interfered with the move in 1995 and 
destroyed negotiations to build a new stadium the Los Angeles 
suburb of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with fan turnout in Oakland, Davis last month began  
talks with Oakland city officials about moving back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise, each with a stadium proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz is heading one campaign and his  
backers include Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner. The group wants to 
build a combined stadium and shopping mall in suburban Carson. 
Developer Ed Roski Jr. and billionaire Eli Broad are proposing to 
renovate the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is scheduled to meet with Ovitz  
on Friday and tour the Carson site.

<HEADLINE> Secret Service Director Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brian L. Stafford, former head of President  
Clinton's security detail, was sworn in Thursday as the 20th 
director of the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford, 51, replaces Lou Merletti, who retired two months ago  
to run the security operation for the Cleveland Browns football 
team. Merletti fought to keep Secret Service agents from testifying 
in the Monica Lewinsky investigation, but the courts ruled against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford, a 28-year veteran of the Secret Service, is a native  
of Sharpsville, Pa. He served in the Army prior to joining the 
agency, serving a tour of duty in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971. He was 
head of Clinton's security detail for about a year, but did not 
testify in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian has distinguished himself and the Secret Service thorugh  
his professionalism, integrity and commitment to duty,'' said 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who oversees the agency.

<HEADLINE> After Lewinsky, What Next for TV? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Closure for Monicagate? Don't hold your breath.  
</P>
<P>
	What was most notable about Barbara Walters' much-hyped  
interview with Monica Lewinsky was how it raised questions about an 
unknowable future, rather than resolving the bizarre twists of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that both parties to this ratings sweeps spectacular didn't  
shine in their prescribed roles. For Wednesday's special ``20/20'' 
edition, ABC News star Walters excelled as the caring but sometimes 
stern aunt trying to get to the bottom of this White House mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been described as a bimbo, a stalker and a  
seductress,'' Walters began, looking sad to have to say it. 
``Describe yourself.'' And they were off and running. 
</P>
<P>
	For the interview, taped in Manhattan on Feb. 20, Walters and  
Ms. Lewinsky sat facing each other from plush wing chairs in the 
studio set of a comfortable living room. But the program also wove 
in file footage and other visuals, as well as Walters in her other 
role as omniscient narrator laying out the saga of Oval Office 
shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the final fade-out, after two interminable hours (and  
more commercials than a viewer could count), the lasting impression 
dwelled not so much on what had transpired, but on what comes next 
in the celebrity pageant Walters presides over. Who will be the 
next notch on her belt? 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky showed herself to be poised and  
well-spoken, and almost eerily prepared. She claimed to have spent 
much of the past year worrying and knitting scarves. But judging 
from her smooth performance, the 25-year-old former White House 
intern might have been working with a media consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	She smiled demurely at the mention of her flashing her thong  
underwear at President Clinton, then described it as ``a small, 
subtle, flirtatious gesture, and that's me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The famous blue dress ... ,'' Walters said a little later.  
</P>
<P>
	``What dress?'' Ms. Lewinsky replied with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	When Walters asked Ms. Lewinsky whether Clinton was a sensuous  
man, she answered, ``I'll get in trouble.'' Responded Walters: 
``Not in any more trouble than you've already been in, Monica. You 
have immunity here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But summing up the past year at the program's close, Ms.  
Lewinsky lost her composure. Effectively. She was brought to tears 
when she talked about her and her parents considering suicide 
during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have no idea what this has done,'' she said, glancing  
heavenward, her voice choking -- ``that behind the name Monica 
Lewinsky there's a person and there's a family, and so much pain 
has been caused by all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granted. But what happens next? Ms. Lewinsky seemed to have no  
real plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to make a contribution to society,'' she ventured,  
``a good contribution this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No closure there, either.  
</P>
<P>
	For her final question, Walters asked what Ms. Lewinsky would  
tell her children in the future about the incident. ``Mommy made a 
big mistake,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's sitdown with Walters surely furthers her image  
resurrection that began last month with her television debut in the 
form of a prerecorded deposition for Clinton's impeachment trial. 
Taped a few days earlier, it was excerpted for the U.S. Senate and 
broadcast by TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Richly benefiting from low expectations, Ms. Lewinsky impressed  
her audience. Almost instantly the conventional wisdom did an 
about-face. For instance, New York magazine's Michael Wolff 
observed how, much to everyone's surprise, Monica Lewinsky has 
emerged not as damaged goods but as ``one of the major brand names 
of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting, then, that she would have allied herself with Walters,  
the reigning brand name of TV news. 
</P>
<P>
	But was closure for the Lewinsky affair anywhere in sight?  
</P>
<P>
	``This will put an end to it,'' Regis Philbin had proposed to  
Walters with ill-disguised longing when she dropped by ``Live with 
Regis and Kathie Lee'' on Wednesday morning. ``You know, to go to 
you for final absolution, and then it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is over,'' said Walters, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's GOT to be over after YOU!'' Regis erupted.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they were both right.

<HEADLINE> Canal Plus, BSkyB Merger Talks Stall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Merger talks between British Sky Broadcasting PLC  
and France's Canal Plus SA to create a Europe-wide pay-television 
service have stalled over issues of management control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. media empire controls BSkyB,  
came to Paris on Wednesday to talk with Canal Plus chairman Pierre 
Lescure, but left without agreeing to a deal. Canal Plus has 
insisted that its management and primary shareholder remain French 
in the event of a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks have been suspended because there was no agreement  
on our fundamental conditions,'' a Canal Plus spokeswoman said 
Thursday. ``However, they have not been broken off altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdown of the talks came as the French government sternly  
warned Canal Plus on a potential merger, noting that Murdoch 
opposes government regulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canal Plus must bear in mind that the government will examine  
with the greatest vigilance any possible linkup -- no matter what 
the form -- with Murdoch's group,'' Culture Minister Catherine 
Trautman said Wednesday before parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. had no comment on the merger talks Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. owns 40 percent of BSkyB, the largest pay-TV provider  
in Britain with 7 million subscribers, and has been trying to 
expand its European holdings for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Canal Plus has 11 million subscribers in 10 countries, making it  
the biggest pay-TV company in Europe. Vivendi SA owns 34 percent of 
the company.

<HEADLINE> Big East Heavyweights Play Thurs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Seton Hall, Georgetown and Rutgers,  
first-round victories in the Big East tournament came with a price. 
Now they get to play the conference heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	Seton Hall draws No. 3 Connecticut, while Georgetown goes  
against No. 9 Miami and Rutgers draws No. 10 St. John's in today's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll take their chances.  
</P>
<P>
	Seton Hall (15-13) lost twice to UConn (25-2) in the regular  
season, including a five-point defeat three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing tough and coming close doesn't matter,'' Pirates coach  
Tommy Amaker said. ``This is the Big East tournament. This is the 
showcase for our league, and they are the best in our league. They 
are sharp and ready to go. We're going to have an unbelievable 
battle just to stay on the court with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown (15-14) lost both games against Miami (21-5), the  
first when John Thompson was still coach of the Hoyas, the second 
after Craig Esherick took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope we shoot a lot better,'' Esherick said. ``A  
lot of how poorly we shot was attributed to Miami's defense. Miami 
has a very good defense, one of the best in the league, if not the 
country, and there's a lot of people that did not shoot well 
against Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers (18-11) was swept by St. John's (23-7), and four  
straight losses at the end of the regular season left the Scarlet 
Knights struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about St. John's physically,'' coach Kevin Bannon  
said. ``They're big when you look at all the positions. They're 
strong. We played them tough. We've been in two wars with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's other quarterfinal, Syracuse (20-10), coming off the  
biggest blowout in tournament history, meets Villanova (21-9). It 
will be the 10th meeting between the schools, most for any matchup 
in Big East tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Seton Hall 79, Notre Dame 69    	
</P>
<P>
	The postseason frustration continued for Notre Dame, which has  
never won a Big East Tournament game. The Irish (14-16) beat Seton 
Hall twice in the regular season, but the Pirates knocked them off 
this time with an efficient defense that capitalized on 23 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we tried to do was really pressure the ball,'' Amaker  
said. ``We tried to at least force them out a little bit further. I 
thought our perimeter defense was pretty good and we got some easy 
baskets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duane Jordan and Rimas Kaukenas led Seton Hall with 18 apiece,  
while freshman Ty Shine had 17. Troy Murphy, Big East freshman of 
the year, led all scorers with 28 on 10-for-16 shooting for Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Syracuse 96, Boston College 55    	
</P>
<P>
	For the third time this season, Syracuse took advantage of a  
matchup mismatch to beat BC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just bigger and stronger than them,'' coach Jim Boeheim  
said as the Orangemen staged the biggest rout in the 20-year 
history of the Big East tournament. ``You don't like to beat 
anybody this way. The game just got out of hand early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etan Thomas had 19 points and Jason Hart 15 as every Syracuse  
player scored, sending BC (6-21) to a seventh straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Villanova 73, West Virginia 61    	
</P>
<P>
	Down 11 points in the second half, Villanova rallied to overtake  
West Virginia (10-19). 
</P>
<P>
	John Celestand scored 26 points and Howard Brown 16 for the  
Wildcats, who came back after West Virginia point guard Jarrett 
Kearse fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia had a 46-32 rebounding edge, and that concerned  
Villanova coach Steve Lappas for today's game against Syracuse. 
``We're going to have to rebound much better or we'll be in deep 
trouble,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Georgetown 68, Providence 66    	
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas saved their 24-year postseason appearance streak with  
a late comeback against Providence, wiping out a 10-point 
second-half lead to edge the Friars on a pair of free throws by 
Ruben Boumtje Boumtje in the last 1:23. Boumtje Boumtje led 
Georgetown with 18 points and contributed nine rebounds to a 57-32 
rebounding advantage 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas (15-14) are assured of a .500 record, the minimum  
necessary for an NIT bid. Providence (16-13) is probably headed 
there, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their offensive rebounding was relentless,'' Providence coach  
Tim Welsh said. ``Their work on the boards just wore us out. You 
get 24 turnovers and they have 16 more shots. That was the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, covering the tournament for a Washington, D.C. radio  
station, asked Boumtje Boumtje a question about being nervous and 
was challenged by his ex-player who said, ``Can I see your press 
credential first?'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Rutgers 64, Pittsburgh 51    	
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers got 11 points apiece from Rob Hodgson, Alvydas Tenys and  
Geoff Billet, with Hodgson also grabbing 11 rebounds. Ricardo Greer 
led Pitt with 14 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deserved this,'' Bannon said. ``We've been right there with  
nothing to show for it the last few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt (14-16) missed its first 10 shots and never recovered,  
finishing with 28.6 percent on 18-for-63. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the final game as Pitt coach for Ralph Willard, who  
announced his resignation at midseason. No replacement has been 
named.

<HEADLINE> GOP To Strengthen Education Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first, muted clash of the new Congress,  
Republicans are maneuvering to strengthen their standing on 
education, a top issue with the public. Democrats are determined 
not to be outflanked. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, according to congressional aides in both parties, is  
that GOP-drafted legislation to loosen federal strings on school 
aid is likely to pass the Senate by an overwhelming margin next 
week. But not before a politically charged struggle over Democratic 
amendments for hiring more teachers and funding after-school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education was ranked as the most important issue by the single  
largest number of people'' in the 1998 elections, Mark Mellman, a 
Democratic pollster, said Thursday as the two parties jockeyed for 
position in the Senate. ``And those people voted overwhelmingly 
Democratic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we've found a way to make it work,'' conceded Jan  
Vanlohuizen, a pollster whose clients include the GOP Senatorial 
Campaign Committee. GOP governors fared well last year among voters 
who care about education, he said, in contrast to candidates for 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they need to show that education is a priority and I  
think they need to show it in a non-punitive way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long gone is the public talk among Republicans -- prevalent when  
the GOP gained control of the Congress in 1994 -- of abolishing the 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	And there has been little GOP emphasis thus far this year on  
establishing federally-funded voucher programs to allow children to 
attend private schools. While that issue has gained some appeal 
among those seeking an alternative to poorly performing inner city 
schools, it is not supported as strongly by the public as much as 
other GOP education proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former high school teacher and  
wrestling coach, has identified education as a top priority. 
Hastert, whose wife is a kindergarten teacher, journeyed to a 
District of Columbia elementary school earlier this week to read to 
school schildren to underscore his personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Already a bill to loosen federal strings on education aid has  
cleared a House committee and is expected on the floor next week. 
House Republicans will be introducing another measure next week to 
allow special education accounts, with interest to accumulate 
tax-free, that can be used for school expenses. That draws support 
of 90 percent of the public, according to a survey Vanlohuizen's 
firm, Voter Consumer Research, did last fall for Senate 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the  
chairman of the Budget Committee, floated a proposal for a 40 
percent increase in federal school funding over the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	And setting on a schedule for the post-impeachment era, Majority  
Leader Trent Lott decided on an early debate on legislation backed 
by governors of both parties to reduce federal restrictions on 
money that goes to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats swiftly decided to seek passage of an amendment to  
complete the hiring of 100,000 teachers, and another for 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there are issues of higher importance to  
American families than these issues,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer of 
California said Thursday at a news conference where she and other 
Democrats disputed GOP claims they were pushing dilatory 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before those two issues could be brought up, though, the  
Senate bogged down during the day on preliminaries. Democrats 
sought approval of an amendment calling for $150 million for 
programs to keep dropouts in school. Republicans tried to supplant 
that proposal with one for money for special education programs, 
and appeared surprised when Democrats led by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., decided to embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
	By evening, Republicans were charging Democrats with mounting a  
filibuster against a bill that has the backing of the White House 
and governors of both parties. Democrats denied it, and said Lott 
would fail with an effort prevent votes on their politically 
appealing amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	A test vote was set for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the way to passage of the underlying education  
measure was eased on Tuesday with a compromise on a call by Kennedy 
for greater accountability on the part of states in exchange for 
the ability to spend money more freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, dubbed ``ed flex'' would expand a pilot program  
to all 50 states. It gives local school districts greater 
flexibility over federal education as they seek improved schools.

<HEADLINE> 'Backdoor' Immigration Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A program that allows foreigners to  
temporarily remain in the United States rather than return to a 
country racked with political turmoil or suffering devastation from 
a hurricane has turned into a ``backdoor'' immigration program for 
illegal aliens, critics told a House subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Temporary Protected Status program allows the attorney  
general to allow foreigners to stay in the United States for six to 
18 months if their home countries become embroiled in political 
violence or suffer devastation because of natural disasters. Not 
everyone in the program is an illegal alien; some are on expiring 
student visas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conclusion of this period, they are supposed to leave the  
United States. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service has 
said it doesn't know how many actually do. In some cases, U.S. 
officials have simply allowed them to stay permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience has shown that in every case, where large numbers  
of people have been granted temporary protection, they have 
eventually received permanent status,'' Mark Krikorian, executive 
director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told 
the House Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee. 
``Temporary protection would simply be a lie if it were used as a 
backdoor to permanent immigration or as a fig leaf to cover 
political unwillingness to enforce the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, for example, Cubans were granted temporary  
protection, Krikorian said. But Congress gave them the right to 
remain permanently when it passed the 1966 Cuban Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 1970s, thousands fled the communist takeover of  
Indochina, and they too were granted temporary protection until 
Congress in 1977 made their status permanent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said he  
doesn't question whether the program should exist. ``The question 
is whether it is really temporary and to what extent TPS invites 
fraud,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said there may be valid  
reasons why foreigners stay rather than return home. Offering help 
to those returning to their countries could encourage more to 
leave, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 220,000 people have applied for temporary protection  
against deportation since the program began in 1991, and about 
24,450 foreigners hold the status currently. That doesn't include 
the tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans already in the 
United States and otherwise in danger of deported who got their 
first chance to apply to stay here in December because of Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants applying for temporary protection must tell the INS  
their whereabouts and submit fingerprints. They must pay an 
application fee of $175, including $100 for a work permit.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Lawyers Agree on Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones will get $200,000 from the  
$850,000 settlement that ended her sexual harassment case against 
President Clinton, one of the attorneys said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest will go to her attorneys and the Rutherford Institute,  
which also assisted Mrs. Jones in her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was paid in November but held up by the courts when  
Mrs. Jones' former and current lawyers could not agree on how it 
should be split up. The agreement was noted but not detailed in an 
order entered in federal court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Joseph Cammarata said that he and fellow attorney Gilbert  
Davis would get $350,000 from Mrs. Jones, who they represented in 
the earlier stages of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata said he was satisfied with the agreement, which  
promises them money from future earnings Mrs. Jones expects to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke will get  
$283,000. That firm took the case after Cammarata and Davis 
withdrew from the case. The Rutherford Institute is to get 
$100,000, Cammarata said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be resolved in the Jones-Clinton case is whether the  
judge will cite Clinton for contempt of court because of his 
conflicting testimony about his relationship with former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In her lawsuit, Mrs. Jones claimed that Clinton, when he was  
governor of Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little 
Rock hotel in 1991. Clinton denies the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was dismissed in April. While that dismissal was on  
appeal, Clinton and Mrs. Jones settled. After former and current 
lawyers began to argue over who would get how much, the judge 
ordered the check held by the court until the dispute was resolved.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Doesn't Tip Her Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dropping a hint about a call to civic duty,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton is tantalizing New Yorkers who look at the 
first lady and see their next senator. But so far she's just 
keeping them guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	On her second day in New York, Mrs. Clinton was giving a speech  
at the United Nations today about the upcoming Women's Rights Day 
and later was previewing an HBO documentary on women in sports at a 
school in Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's visit to the Big Apple had the feel of a campaign  
rally even as she remained coy on whether she will be a candidate. 
Democrats used her visit Wednesday -- her first to New York since 
saying she was giving careful thought to a Senate bid -- to woo the 
fence-sitting first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	And some of her supporters were anything but subtle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think it's time for a woman to represent New York in  
the United States Senate?'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., blared to 
an overflow crowd of about 900 mostly female donors who plunked 
down up to $1,000 apiece to soak up the Hillary phenomenon at a 
Democratic National Committee luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, standing behind Schumer, smiled as the crowd  
erupted in applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her aides sought to portray her jaunt to New York as  
just another of many forays here, Mrs. Clinton's words were just 
vague enough to stoke her boosters' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the  
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
``We cannot say `I won't be involved in politics because I don't 
like the negativity. I don't like all of the ads on television.'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She alluded only once to the Senate race.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that there were some who thought that, uh, I might  
have an announcement to make,'' she said, pausing and holding the 
crowd in breath-catching suspense. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't.''  
</P>
<P>
	Groans followed.  
</P>
<P>
	The aura of mystery surrounding Mrs. Clinton's political  
flirtation is spawning a parlor game in Democratic circles. The 
buzz after her speech placed odds on her running. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she's not running she's giving a good impression of someone  
who is,'' New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone said. ``I 
think every indication now is that she runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until she does decide, she is a huge cash draw for the  
Democrats. Wednesday's luncheon raised $500,000, a record for the 
DNC's Women's Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Even political veterans marveled at the sea of awestruck  
supporters, cameras and clamoring reporters hanging on the first 
lady's every word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not believe the amount of press,'' said former Rep.  
Geraldine Ferraro, who once ran as vice president on the Democratic 
ticket and lost to Schumer in the Democratic Senate primary last 
year. ``It's like a presidential announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began Wednesday with a visit to a middle school in  
the Queens, where she discussed the virtues of arts education, and 
capped the day with a private dinner at the home of Roger Altman, a 
former Treasury Department officials whose deep pockets could be 
crucial to financing a New York campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's visit came as Monica Lewinsky's face was again  
plastered on the covers of New York City's tabloids in anticipation 
of the former White House intern's interview broadcast Wednesday 
night about her affair with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton would be a formidable candidate, she would  
also face what looks to be a tough battle against her most likely 
Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Her lead 
against Giuliani, which had surged into the double digits in 
earlier polls, shrank to just four points, equal to the margin of 
error, in a survey released Wednesday by the Marist College 
Institute for Public Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	And not everyone was gushing. One man outside the Plaza Hotel  
held aloft a placard reading ``Hillary Clinton: Doormat of the 
Year.''

<HEADLINE> Maurice Greene Looks To Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- Maurice Greene is the world record-holder  
at 60 meters, yet he still has something to prove in the World 
Indoor Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is coming off a ``very disappointing'' second place in  
the USA Championships last weekend, his first defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't run like I wanted to,'' Greene said Thursday. ``I  
know I let down my fans. I have to do something here to regain 
them. Now, I can make up for it. have a lot of faith in my 
ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who set the world record of 6.39 seconds last year at  
Madrid, Spain, ran 6.40 in the semifinals of the USA Championships 
at Atlanta, but clocked only 6.49 in the final, losing to Tim 
Harden's career-best 6.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had an excuse.  
</P>
<P>
	He slightly injured his left hamstring in the semifinals, and  
was cautious in the final, coming out of the blocks last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started easy in the final,'' Greene, the 1997 world outdoor  
champion at 100 meters, said. ``Something didn't feel right in my 
leg. I didn't know the problem. I didn't know whether it was a 
career-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to be no big deal. It's fine now. I expect to  
have a good race here. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there, I was uncomfortable and nervous. I told myself I  
wasn't going to rely on my start. If I could get out of the blocks 
safely, I would be fine. I relied on the middle part of my race. I 
just wanted to finish healthy. I wasn't 100 percent certain I was 
going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Greene's start was horrible and that proved  
costly. Still, he ran fast enough to make the U.S. team and earn a 
chance for redemption against Harden. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he feels fit enough to break the record again, but  
winning will be his major aim when the three-day championships 
begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always determined to set the world record,'' he said.  
``But hopefully I can run technically correct and everything will 
fall into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Greene failed in several attempts to break Donovan  
Bailey's 100-meter world record of 9.84, and he blamed that on 
trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking about the world record, but I wasn't running my  
race to break it,'' said Greene, whose best in the 100 is 9.86. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he has taken a different attitude -- less talking and  
faster running. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Harden are the favorites to return the world indoor  
60-meter title to the United States for the first time since Lee 
McRae won in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	While the sprinters will compete for less than seven seconds,  
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie will be running longer than anyone. 
He is attempting an unprecedented double in the 1,500 and 3,000 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie, the defending champion in the 3,000, will have two  
advantages -- the 3,000 semifinals have been eliminated, meaning the 
event will be strictly a final on Friday; Morocco's Hicham el 
Guerrouj, the two-time defending champion in the 1,500, is 
bypassing the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie's races will be spread out evenly, with the 1,500  
semifinals Saturday and the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure that I am capable of that effort,'' said the world  
record-holder at 5,000 and 10,000 meters outdoors. ``The problem 
might be with the 1,500 (final).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 600 athletes from 123 countries will compete  
in the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gebrselassie, the men's defending champions are  
Kevin Little, United States, 200; Sunday Bada, Nigeria, 400; Wilson 
Kipketer, Denmark, 800; Anier Garcia, Cuba, 60 hurdles; Charles 
Austin, United States, high jump; Igor Potapovich, Kazakhstan, pole 
vault; Ivan Pedroso, Cuba, long jump; and Yuri Belonog, Ukraine, 
shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's winners returning from the 1997 Paris championships  
are Gail Devers, United States, 60; Jearl Miles-Clark, United 
States, 400; Maria Mutola, Mozambique, 800; Gabriela Szabo, 
Romania, 3,000; Stacy Dragila, United States, pole vault; and Vita 
Pavlysh, Ukraine, shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	The entries also include five world record-holders, 12 world  
indoor record-holders, 15 world outdoor champions from 1997 and 
seven Olympic gold medalists from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven finals are on Friday's program -- the men's triple jump,  
shot put and 60 hurdles and the women's pole vault, high jump, 60 
hurdles and pentathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony will be attended by Emperor Akihito and  
Empress Michiko.

<HEADLINE> Italy Stunned by Marine Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italians were stunned and indignant Thursday at the  
acquittal of a Marine pilot whose jet severed a cable, sending a 
gondola packed with 20 people to their deaths in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had said before that U.S. justice couldn't handle the case,  
and we were right,'' said lawyer Giuseppe Pontrelli, head of a 
citizens' group formed after the Feb. 3, 1998, tragedy. ``We had 
largely predicted a verdict like this, it's not unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the defense committee in the lower house of  
parliament, Valdo Spini, said he was ``disconcerted and 
indignant.'' The verdict, he said, ``does not render justice for 
the innocent victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema is in the United States and is  
scheduled to meet with President Clinton on Friday, and the case 
may come up in their talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Italians, two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the accident. Attorneys for 
the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident caused an uproar in Europe and strained relations  
between Italy and the United States. Italy is a NATO ally and hosts 
a number of military bases important to the United States and to 
the alliance. The accident prompted calls in some quarters to close 
down the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	It took place during a training mission in the Italian Alps out  
of the Aviano base. Marine pilot Capt. Richard Ashby's EA-6B 
Prowler, a four-man radar-jamming jet, ripped through the cables in 
a valley near Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of many dead and such clear responsibility, this  
verdict is an act of arrogance and prevarication,'' said Achille 
Occhetto, president of the lower house's foreign affairs committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Greens in parliament, Mauro Paissan, called  
the verdict ``outrageous'' and an ``offense to the twenty dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Injustice has been done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	An Italian prosecutor, Franantonio Granero, opened an  
investigation in hopes of prosecuting the crew in Italy. But an 
Italian court overruled him last year, saying the United States had 
jurisdiction under a NATO treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incomprehensible, I wouldn't know what else to call it,''  
Granero said of Ashby's acquittal. ``It's absolutely impossible to 
figure out how they could reach such a verdict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only positive reaction came from the Italian lawyers who  
defended Ashby in the Trento investigation, Antonio and Bruno 
Malattia. They said the trial was ``scrupulous'' and the verdict 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, is awaiting trial on  
similar charges. Charges against the back-seat crew were dropped.

<HEADLINE> Senator Against Selling IMF Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A proposal to sell some of the International  
Monetary Fund's vast gold reserves would be disastrous for Nevada's 
mining industry as well as the emerging countries the IMF is trying 
to help, Sen. Richard Bryan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting additional gold on the open market would drive low  
prices even lower in an industry already reeling in Nevada and the 
West, the Nevada Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had hundreds and hundreds of miners laid off,'' Bryan  
said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's had a real impact on Nevada families, on sales tax  
revenues. Entire communities in the mining areas of the state have 
been hurt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The metal has languished in the $280-$290 an ounce range for  
months, below the break-even point for many mines. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put additional downward pressure on the price of gold by  
selling from the International Monetary Fund's reserves could cause 
additional mine closings and major layoffs in the industry,'' the 
senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, met Tuesday  
night with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to urge him to join in 
opposition to such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He promised to take a look at it,'' Bryan said.  
</P>
<P>
	The senator said he also told the treasury secretary that such a  
selloff could harm poorer countries that produce gold. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, mining represents 37 percent of Ghana's exports, 36  
percent of Mali's and 24 percent of Guyana's, according to 1997 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan said he got word this week from some Nevada gold producers  
that the sale of IMF gold was back on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF spokesman William Murray said the suggestion has been  
floating around for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been notions kicking around among our shareholders,  
particularly the UK, back starting in 1992, to sell a modest amount 
of IMF gold to help finance soft loans to the world's poorest 
countries,'' he said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a bailout like Russia or Brazil or Asian countries,''  
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF critics in Congress have opposed bailout efforts in the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Rep. Jim Saxton was among House Republicans who last  
year complained that the IMF should be selling off some of the gold 
reserves or borrowing from global capital markets rather than 
seeking aid from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF's assets include more than 100 million ounces of gold. It  
has sold some of those reserves from time to time since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent proposal called for the sale of up to 5 million  
ounces to help cover a financing gap for a loan operation known as 
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Japan and Germany, the two biggest IMF shareholders  
after the United States, have opposed touching to gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy IMF Director Stanley Fischer told Congress in September  
he opposed the sale of gold reserves because they provide 
assurances to members of the organization's financial viability. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Thursday that no sale of gold is imminent and that  
if it ever took place, it would occur over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be dumped on the market. We're not in the business  
of disrupting financial markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation IMF was created after World War II to keep an eye  
on the global monetary and economic system. Part of its role is to 
provide financial and technical assistance to countries that are 
under severe economic strain, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its potential effect on Nevada's No. 2 industry,  
which has seen some 1,800 layoffs in the past 15 months, Bryan 
doesn't think the proposal would work anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to ease the debt replacement problems, but  
these countries are so far in that there's no way they're ever 
going to be able to get themselves out,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Cable Car Verdict Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Eight military jurors announced they  
reached a verdict today after a second day of deliberations on 
whether a Marine pilot whose jet hit an Italian ski gondola cable 
last year is guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the 20 people 
who died. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors announced they would soon return to the courtroom to  
announce the verdict. Six of the eight officers on the jury must 
vote guilty in order to convict Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission 
Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors deliberated for four hours on Wednesday, and about  
three hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, has urged jurors to rely on the  
expert testimony. He said his client suffered from an optical 
illusion that made him think his jet was higher than it was, that 
an altimeter on the jet malfunctioned and that the gondola at 
Cavalese, Italy, wasn't marked on American maps. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the only reason the  
mishap happened was because Ashby flew by his own rules. He said 
the pilot ignored speed and altitude limits, which Ashby testified 
he didn't know about. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces more than 200 years in prison if convicted of all  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened on the final leg of a 42-minute training  
route through the Italian Alps. Afterward, Italians demanded that 
U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the jury deliberated, attorneys for Capt. Joseph  
Schweitzer, the navigator in Ashby's EA-6B Prowler jet, said 
closing arguments made them optimistic that charges against their 
client could be dismissed. Schweitzer faces charges similar to 
Ashby's.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Discuss Lewinsky Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joseph E. Jones kept coming back to Monica's  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Whenever Barbara Walters pressed Ms. Lewinsky on some painful or  
embarrassing subject -- the cigar, the blue dress, Linda Tripp -- she 
``answered with a smile, as if she was making light of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Jones, whose Alamo, Calif., company helps lawyers evaluate  
witnesses and jurors, the message in the smile was clear: ``She 
wants people to like her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and other experts on the subtleties of communication were  
fascinated by Ms. Lewinsky's manner in the interview that aired 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert R. Butterworth, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles,  
was impressed by Ms. Lewinsky's willingness to talk about 
everything -- ``She was actually so open that it was somewhat 
frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there was little evidence of the emotional, moody  
Monica and noted that she acknowledged she was on anti-depression 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the medication is masking a lot,'' he said, though  
``she did blush when she talked about phone sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All agreed that Ms. Lewinsky was well-prepared. Ray McGraime, a  
consultant on body language, noticed that she often looked up and 
to the right when she answered a question -- a tip-off, he said, 
that the answer was rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is being very well-schooled,'' McGraime said. He said the  
70 million Americans who watched the ABC interview saw ``a work in 
progress,'' a new Monica being remade by advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's no longer a victim of an affair. She's a victim of the  
legal system,'' he said. She is ``going to go to a more `sensual 
woman' look, which is more marketable. Now, it's Monica Inc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gone were the demure pearls. Instead, Ms. Lewinsky pulled her  
hair back, exposing her neck -- it's ``a sexual thing,'' McGraime 
said. The same with her bright red lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraime is not convinced that Ms. Lewinsky was totally  
truthful. He said that whenever she shook her head while answering 
a question, she most likely was fibbing, whether she knew it or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	She shook her head when she said she didn't expect a job as a  
result of her liaison with President Clinton, when she said she saw 
Clinton as a man, not as the president, and when she said she 
believed oral sex was not really sex. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that when she showed her thong to the president, it was  
``a small, subtle, flirtatious gesture.'' According to McGraime: 
``She didn't believe that, and nobody else who was watching 
believed it, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said there were moments when Ms. Lewinsky showed real  
pain, such as when she talked about the effect of the scandal on 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth said he got the impression that regardless of her  
denials, Ms. Lewinsky still carried a torch for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a part of her deep inside that is still living in this  
fantasy land,'' he said. ``The door is not completely closed.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. 3-Year-Old Helps Save Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEMMES, Ala. (AP) -- Three-year-old McKenzie Moorer knows her  
colors and that's how she knew something was wrong with her 
2-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	While her father, Frank, snoozed Tuesday night, and her mother,  
Amanda, was washing the dishes, McKenzie and Taylor were playing in 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
	Then McKenzie arrived on the run and told her mom: ``Taylor's  
not red anymore like my crayon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her of course she's not red, she's not supposed to  
be,'' Mrs. Moorer said. ``And then she came back in with her blue 
one and said she is the color of my blue crayon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother realized something was seriously wrong, ran to Taylor  
and found that she had stopped breathing. Using CPR she learned in 
a maternity class, Mrs. Moorer revived the child, who began gasping 
for air and crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was in good spirits Wednesday at Springhill Memorial  
Hospital, and gave McKenzie a big hug when she awoke from a nap, 
Mrs. Moorer said. Doctors planned to conduct tests to determine 
what caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie's teacher at Moffett Road Baptist Child Development  
Center crafted her a medal Wednesday that read ``McKenzie Moorer, 
Hero.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Canada, MetroNet To Merge </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., forging a deal that will help extend  
its strategy of one-stop telecommunications services into Canada, 
plans to merge its Canadian business with MetroNet Communications 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday places a value of at least $2.3  
billion on MetroNet, a local Canadian phone service supplier to 
businesses. The merged company will be able to offer business 
customers in Canada everything from long-distance to Internet to 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. long-distance companies have been looking toward Canada to  
help expand their business. On Wednesday, MCI WorldCom announced an 
agreement with Bell Canada that will allow the U.S. company to 
provide its service to Canadian customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, the biggest U.S. long-distance provider, initially plans  
to merge its AT&AMP;T Canada operations with Metronet's business in a 
company to be called AT&AMP;T Canada Corp. The new company would have 
annual revenue of about $925 million, more than 4,000 employees and 
over $2.3 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will be carried out in several stages as the two  
companies await regulatory approval. After the first stage, 
Metronet shareholders would indirectly own 69 percent of the merged 
company and AT&AMP;T would have the remaining 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second stage, AT&AMP;T is to buy all of Metronet's shares for  
at least 75 Canadian dollars per share -- $49.50 at current exchange 
rates -- or the appraised fair market value of Metronet shares at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the minimum price, that would value Metronet's 45.5 million  
shares at about $2.3 billion. The payment would be in cash, stock 
or some combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, but  
it must be approved by MetroNet shareholders at a meeting expected 
to be held in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But if AT&AMP;T doesn't purchase the shares before June 30, 2000,  
the minimum price per share would be increased by 16 percent a year 
through June 30, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's stock rose $1.12 1/2 to $84.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> RJR To Sell International Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is taking bids for  
all or part of its international tobacco business and could make a 
decision by the end of next week, one analyst who follows the 
industry says. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
Wednesday he thinks RJR would like to be able to include a deal 
involving the international tobacco business in the proxy material 
being prepared for shareholders in advance of the May 12 annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to show shareholders they are building value  
and have found a way of enhancing the value of their holdings,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for proxy materials is March 12. That is the same  
deadline investor Carl Icahn faces for launching a proxy fight for 
control of the company. He has threatened to launch such a fight if 
the company fails to spin off its Nabisco food unit. 
</P>
<P>
	But other analysts said they don't expect a decision on the  
international tobacco business that quickly, saying they suspect 
RJR will need more time to strike the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR declined comment. Its shares fell 18 3/4 cents a share to  
$27.68 3/4 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Its chairman and chief executive, Steven Goldstone, recently  
told analysts that finding a way to give the struggling 
international tobacco business greater stature was a top priority 
for the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hasn't specified whether he favors a sale of the business  
or creation of a joint venture as a way to make it more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The international tobacco division at RJR has seen profits  
shrink in each of the past two years as economic conditions 
deteriorated in key markets in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said the international tobacco business may fetch as  
much as $6 billion if it were sold outright. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the most likely buyers would be Philip Morris Cos.,  
RJR's chief rival in the United States, and Japan Tobacco and said 
France's Seita and Spain's Tabacalera may also make a bid.

<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson's first two innings on the  
mound for the Arizona Diamondbacks were routine by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the young University of Arizona batters who faced him, they  
were 31 pitches that are impossible to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was almost like the Eiffel Tower because I'm only  
5-foot-7,'' said 19-year-old Keoni DeRenne, one of two batters who 
hit a ball into fair territory against the Big Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's immense. It was just awesome. Hopefully, they got it on  
videotape because I'd like to show it to my kids someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his trademark glare, at 6-foot-10 towering on the mouned,  
Johnson methodically struck out four of the six batters he faced 
Wednesday. The other two grounded out to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Torres struck out on three pitches, and was thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have the opportunity to face Randy Johnson, it's like  
a dream come true, it's like a childhood dream,'' he said. ``Yeah, 
three pitches, but those three pitches meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was more or less satisfied with his effort. Of his 31  
pitches, five were call strikes, seven were swinging strikes, six 
were fouls, 11 were balls and two were hit in play. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw a couple of breaking balls and change-ups, but mostly  
four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed the breaking ball wasn't there, but  
I'm always that way in spring training,'' Johnson said. ``I just 
went out there to work on my mechanics and my arm strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Diamondbacks, strolled to the mound at Tucson Electric Park under 
bright sunshine in 80-degree weather. In the distance beyond left 
field, the Catalina Mountains provided a scenic backdrop to what 
amounted to a historic moment for the second-year franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks purple was the fourth major-league uniform  
Johnson has worn. He started his career with Montreal and spent 9 1/2 
seasons with the Seattle Mariners. For a half-season last year, he 
on the Houston Astros. Now he's the marquee addition to a 
high-priced rotation that could vault Arizona into National League 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Johnson said, ``not nearly exciting as the  
first start I make in L.A. (the April 5 season opener against Kevin 
Brown in Dodger Stadium) or probably even more so when I make my 
first start at Bank One. But it's going to be an exciting four 
years for this organization and for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't want to hit anybody.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get worried if it's a guy up there making millions of  
dollars, let alone a young kid trying to get a college education,'' 
he said. ``He might be president of the United States someday. You 
never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks eventually won the game 10-2. It was, Johnson  
joked, a little revenge for other games he'd pitched against the 
Wildcats long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Johnson faced the University of Arizona, he walked  
six and was shelled for six runs on 13 hits in a 7-3 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1985. He was no Big Unit then, just an extremely tall,  
extremely wild junior at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting back at U of A after all those beatings I used to  
take at USC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in baseball on Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland Indians outfielder Mark Whiten will miss at least  
two weeks of spring training with a stress fracture of his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiten, expected to open the season as a reserve, complained  
about pain in the foot and underwent tests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Relief pitcher Jeff Shaw couldn't wait any longer for the  
birth of his third child and arrived at the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
camp at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was given permission to report after wife Julie delivered,  
which was supposed to be Feb. 15, then Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julie's still healthy, the baby's not in danger, that's the  
most important thing. . . . This one's being stubborn,'' Shaw said. 
The Shaws have been told they are going to have a son. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ron Wright's back appears to be all right. Wright, who missed  
most of last season with a back injury, hit two home runs in a 
Pittsburgh Pirates intrasquad game at Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Pirates are still waiting for outfielder Jose  
Guillen, stuck in the Dominican Republic while awaiting an entry 
visa into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The stars at the St. Louis Cardinals' Jupiter, Fla., camp  
weren't players. ``The real heroes were the groundskeepers,'' 
manager Tony La Russa said. ``They told us a storm was coming 
between 12:30 and 1 p.m., so we moved everything up an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although rain cut short two intrasquad games, there was enough  
time for a 9-8 contest on a field where the wind was blowing out. 
The game on the field where it was blowing in was 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Port St. Lucie, Fla., the New York Mets assigned former  
catcher John Stearns as an advance scout during the regular season. 
Stearns will report on the tendencies of both pitchers and hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Toronto Blue Jays signed six players, including pitcher  
Chris Carpenter and outfielder Shannon Stewart, who agreed to 
three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-baseman Tom Evans, utility player Felipe Crespo and  
right-hander Nerio Rodriguez all signed one-year deals, and 
reliever Robert Person's contract was renewed. That means the Jays' 
entire 40-man roster is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter's and Stewart's deals are believed to be worth  
more than $3 million. It's the first time the Blue Jays have signed 
long-term deals with players with fewer than two years of 
major-league service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carpenter and Stewart said they appreciated the Blue Jays`  
precedent-setting move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It`s good for me,'' said Stewart, 25, who batted .279 and  
stole 51 bases in 144 games last season. ``It gives me security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, 23, was 12-7 and had a 4.37 earned-run average in 33  
games last season, 24 of them starts. He was scheduled to start 
against Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and the New York Yankees in 
Toronto's first exhibition game today.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Champ at Odds Eith the Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Laurent Boudouani, the WBA super  
welterweight champion from France, isn't pleased being a 4-1 
underdog to David Reid, the only boxing gold medalist for the 
United States at the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about that,'' Boudouani said. ``Saturday night,  
I will show them they are wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight in a 3,300-seat ballroom at the Boardwalk Convention  
Center will be the 33-year-old Frenchman's fifth defense of the 
154-pound title he won in 1996. His record is 38-2-1, with 32 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, on the other hand, will be fighting as a pro for only the  
11th time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've been pushed into this fight because of my  
talent,'' the 25-year-old Reid said of the influence of trainer Al 
Mitchell and promoter America Presents. ``They believe in my 
talent, and they know how far to push me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to make predictions because anything can happen,  
but I will predict this -- I will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who says he doesn't pay any attention to odds,  
nevertheless agreed with Boudouani that they are out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got it 50-50,'' Mitchell, head coach for the 1996 Olympic  
team, said Thursday. ``You can throw the odds out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fight between a young athlete, a good athlete, and  
veteran not past his prime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the HBO telecast set to start at 10:15 p.m. EST will be  
a 10-round heavyweight bout between veteran Lou Savarese and 
unbeaten, but untested Lance Whitaker. It is scheduled to start at 
10:25 p.m., with the title fight to begin 15 minutes after it ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very fast and has a good right hand,'' Boudouani said of  
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he can see the fight going either way.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he can't handle David's speed, he's in trouble,'' Mitchell  
said Boudouani. ``If he can, David's in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The champion also must be wary of Reid's power, especially the  
right. Both of Boudouani's losses, one in 1991 and the other in 
1993, were by knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Boudouani, of course, is much more experienced than Reid.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great champion,'' Reid said. ``I've seen a lot of tapes  
of his fights. He can fight, he can move real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger from Philadelphia boxed in world-class amateur  
competition, and has not been babied as a pro. He has been in with 
some good journeymen and two former but faded world champions -- 
Jorge Vaca and Simon Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Reid's seven wins within the distance was a single  
right-hand knockout of Vaca in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, Reid demonstrated poise and heart. He was cut  
over the right eye and knocked down twice in the late rounds while 
winning a 12-round decision over previously unbeaten James 
``Cowboy'' Coker last Oct. 24 at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said one of the knockdowns was more of a slip, but admitted  
a punch had landed. His winning margins were four, six and eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Savarese, who stopped former heavyweight  
champion James ``Buster'' Douglas in the first round in last his 
fight, on June 25, 1998, has a 38-2 record, with 32 knockouts. Both 
losses came in 1997, when he dropped a 12-round decision to George 
Foreman and was knocked out in the fifth round by David Izon. 
</P>
<P>
	Savarese, of New York, stands 6-foot-4, but he is four inches  
shorter than Whitaker, whose nom de guerre is Mount Whitaker. 
Savarese figures to offer the toughest test so far for the 
27-year-old Whitaker, from Van Nuys, Calif., who is 18-0 with 16 
knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Experts Find New L.A. Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers using a new technique have mapped  
a hidden fault that may have caused a 1987 Los Angeles earthquake. 
But government experts say the new work doesn't affect their 
current estimate of the region's earthquake risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologist John H. Shaw of Harvard and Peter M. Shearer of the  
Scripps Institute of Oceanography used oil company seismic records 
and other data to definitively locate a deep ``blind thrust'' fault 
that runs under downtown Los Angeles. A report on their study will 
be published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault was the source of the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier Narrows  
earthquake that caused eight deaths and $358 million in damage, 
Shaw said. It was a magnitude 5.9-6.0 quake. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of a blind thrust fault in the area described by  
Shaw and Shearer was already known, said Lucy Jones, the chief 
scientist for southern California of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
She said the new study ``is a nice refinement'' that slightly moves 
the fault's location, but does not increase the agency's assessment 
of the area's quake risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A blind thrust fault is not clearly obvious on the surface. Such  
faults release energy by suddenly rising, a motion that is 
particularly destructive to buildings on the surface, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have suspected for years that these kinds of faults existed  
in the Los Angeles basin, but we've only been able to infer their 
presence,'' said Shaw. ``What allows the faults to escape detection 
is that their motion is consumed by the folding of rocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rock folding is ``a telltale'' sign of a hidden fault, even  
though the folds are not actually seen on the surface, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining the oil company seismic profiles with other data  
for the first time, Shaw said he and Shearer were able to plot both 
the vertical and horizontal path of the blind thrust fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault goes from Coyote Hills, in northern Orange county,  
near the town of Brea, and runs for about 25 miles to the west, to 
beneath downtown Los Angeles. It is about 12 1/2 miles wide. It is 
about two miles deep in the center of the Los Angeles basin, and 
then dips to 10 miles as it continues northward. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire fault system covers an area of roughly 250 to 300  
square miles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault is broken into three segments. Sudden ruptures along  
any one of those segments could produce quakes of 6.5 to 6.6 
magnitude, Shaw said, and if all three ruptured at the same time, 
there is a potential for a magnitude 7 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on an annual fault deformation rate of about two  
millimeters, Shaw estimated that segments of the fault will rupture 
about every 250 to 1,000 years, while all three might rupture 
together on a frequency of 500 to 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, said Shaw, is that nobody knows when the fault last  
experienced a quake of 6.5 or high magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Wald, a seismologist with the USGS in Pasadena, Calif.,  
said the study ``is an important step forward'' in understanding 
the complex of faults underlying the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a much clearer picture of what's down there,''  
said Wald.

<HEADLINE> Pitt To Hire Howland As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The University of Pittsburgh will hire Ben  
Howland of Northern Arizona as its new basketball coach, two 
sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to the situation, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said today that Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson 
and Howland reached agreement Wednesday night to replace Ralph 
Willard, who resigned earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Arizona (20-7) plays Friday in the Big Sky Conference  
semifinals in Ogden, Utah. Howland was expected to be introduced as 
Pitt's new coach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howland will get a five-year contract worth $375,000 to $400,000  
a year, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Arizona 
Republic. Howland makes $110,000 to $125,000 at Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Andrews, a Pitt spokeswoman, said there would be no  
announcement on a new coach today. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard, who had a 63-77 record in his five seasons at Pitt,  
including 14-16 this season, coached the Panthers for the last time 
Wednesday night in a 64-51 opening-round loss to Rutgers in the Big 
East 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Arizona athleic director Steve Holton said Wednesday  
night he had nothing to announce, but that the Lumberjacks were in 
the preliminary stages of a coaching search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said Holton acknowledged that Jamie Dixon, an  
assistant at Hawaii and former assistant at Northern Arizona, has 
inquired about the job. ``He is definitely somebody we're 
considering,'' Holton said.

<HEADLINE> Meat Packer Resumes Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- A Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary linked to  
a deadly bacteria outbreak resumed deli-meat processing this week 
using what it calls unprecedented safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators at the southwestern Michigan plant haven't yet  
pinpointed the source of the Listeria contamination, which prompted 
Sara Lee to recall 15 million pounds of meat in December. The 
outbreak has been tied to 14 deaths and six miscarriages in 22 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokesman Jeffrey Smith said Wednesday the company has  
implemented new steps to ensure that its ``Premium Turkey Breast'' 
produced at the Bil Mar Foods division is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we are taking unprecedented steps,'' including an  
intensified program checking contact surfaces for pathogens, as 
well as enhanced training,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal meat inspectors and food safety experts are on hand to  
make sure the plant's safety procedures are being followed and are 
working, said Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for the Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	If the turkey breast passes federal inspection, it could be back  
at deli counters by the middle of March. 
</P>
<P>
	Processing at the plant began Monday, and Smith said the plant  
hopes to add ham and roast beef products next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The restart does not apply to sliced luncheon meat or hot dogs.  
Those products will be made at other plants while Sara Lee 
reconfigures production lines.

<HEADLINE> Musical `Titanic' Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Titanic,'' the Tony Award-winning musical,  
will close March 28 after a nearly two-year Broadway run and 
without fully recouping its more than $10 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical will have played 804 performances at the  
Lunt-Fontanne Theater where it opened April 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Titanic'' was plagued by numerous technical problems during  
its month-long preview period, leading many to believe it would 
quickly close. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially budgeted at $10 million, its producers put another $1  
million into the show to keep it running until the Tony Awards, 
where it took the all-important prize for best musical. That win 
plus interest in the then upcoming film boosted box-office sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to describe the joy and pride we all feel for  
this show,'' producer Michael David said Wednesday in a statement. 
``It is also why closing `Titanic' has been a particularly 
difficult decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides best musical, `Titanic'' won four other Tony Awards --  
prizes for book, score, sets and orchestrations. A touring 
production is currently playing in Denver.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Sued for Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- A black family has sued  
McDonald's, alleging one of its restaurants denied them service 
last summer because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Knight and her family claim a manager told them that  
they were refused service at the fast-food restaurant in Colton 
because ``we've been having a problem with blacks lately,'' 
according to court documents filed Tuesday in San Bernardino 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks an unspecified amount of punitive and  
compensatory damages, said the family's lawyer, Scott Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's officials said they had yet to receive the documents  
and had no comment on the pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have zero toleration of discrimination of any kind in our  
restaurants,'' said McDonald's regional spokeswoman Karen Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incident took place July 11.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Knight, two other adults and nine children stopped at the  
restaurant but found the door locked. As they returned to their 
car, they saw several white patrons who knocked on the door and 
were admitted into the restaurant, the court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Knight and her family returned, knocked on the door and were  
admitted but not allowed to order even though others had ordered 
and were eating in the dining area. A manager told them the dining 
area was closed, no more orders were being taken and that no 
McDonald's employees would serve them, the court papers said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Lowell Fighting Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Marlins third-base prospect  
Mike Lowell, recovering from surgery for testicular cancer, went to 
the ballpark for therapy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell sat in the stands, soaked up some sunshine and watched  
the Marlins open their exhibition season with a 12-3 victory over 
the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The power-hitting rookie hopes to join the Marlins before the  
end of spring training. He's unlikely to be ready for opening day 
April 5, but doctors say his chance of a full recovery is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching baseball is a breath of fresh air,'' Lowell said. ``I  
just wanted to catch the game and see some guys play. It's good 
therapy, to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, 25, was diagnosed with cancer after a small mass was  
found during a routine physical exam. He underwent surgery Feb. 21 
and will start a short course of lose-dose radiation next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins manager John Boles visited briefly with Lowell before  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of gave everybody a boost to have him here,'' Boles  
said. ``He's a big part of us, and we're pleased he's doing so 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Lowell returns, he'll challenge veteran Kevin Orie for the  
starting job at third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to play in the big leagues since I was 6 years  
old,'' Lowell said. ``Then someone tells me there's something that 
could threaten my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely puts things in perspective. You realize how  
precious baseball is and how meaningless baseball is. But since 
it's such a curable cancer, I'm really expecting to make a total 
recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell said he's walking free of pain, but doctors don't want  
him jogging yet. He said there's no way of knowing whether the 
radiation will make him ill, which would delay his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eager to get back, but I know it's a process,'' Lowell  
said. ``I'll deal with it. It's the hand I've been dealt. It wasn't 
the greatest hand, but I might have a couple of aces up my sleeve 
for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, was acquired Feb. 1 from the New  
York Yankees for three pitching prospects. In the past two 
minor-league seasons he hit .309 with 56 home runs and 191 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Interior Department Marks 150 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the Interior Department's block-long  
granite headquarters, the story of America is emblazoned on 
floor-to-ceiling murals. 
</P>
<P>
	The art works, painted in the 1930s, show homesteaders racing  
westward vowing Oklahoma or bust; wildcatters working the oil 
fields of Texas; a landscape of barren Southwest desert turned to 
lush green thanks to a government dam and irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Having been at the center of history, the department today marks  
its 150th birthday, and President Clinton is among those who will 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth cabinet agency, created in 1849, no federal agency  
played a greater role in the sculpture of America. It directed how 
the West was to be developed, opened vast areas to timber, 
ranching, mining and the railroads and in the 1880s controlled the 
destiny of more than 1 billion acres -- at the time nearly half the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's reach is still substantial as steward of 440  
million acres of land, including 378 units of the national park 
system, 514 refuges, wilderness areas, millions of acres of 
rangeland and such American crown jewels as Yellowstone National 
Park and the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in taking part in the anniversary celebration, will be  
the first president since Jimmy Carter to visit the Interior 
headquarters a few blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He will use the occasion to press for congressional approval of  
his $1 billion ``land legacy'' initiative unveiled last month and 
urge that a permanent fund be established to ensure at least that 
much money is spent each year to preserve treasured lands and green 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	It was land and concern about its management that prompted  
creation of the Interior Department, which now has nearly 70,000 
employees, in 1849. At the time, the United States had completed a 
rush of expansion. Texas had been annexed a few years earlier, 
California was added after the war with Mexico and new lands were 
added in the Northwest after a boundary dispute was settled with 
Britain. In three years the country grew by nearly a million square 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	A new department was needed to, among other things, direct the  
settlement and exploitation of the West. Over the years the 
department would reflect the dual demands of overseeing the 
development of America's vast natural resources and, beginning with 
President Theodore Roosevelt, protect and preserve those resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a real sense, the history of the Interior Department  
mirrors the history of American expansion and western settlement,'' 
says Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who is the 47th person to 
head the department. ``It also dramatizes America's evolving 
relationship with the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior in the 1800s directed -- at times with harrowing  
consequences -- how the U.S. government was going to deal with the 
Indians. And it parceled out land -- millions of acres -- to the 
railroads, to ranchers and to homesteaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the turn of the century, the department began a  
push over three decades to turn millions of arid acres into lush 
farmland by damming the West's most powerful rivers and building 
massive irrigation systems. The dams brought water, flood control, 
electric power and new recreational areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a department whose primary concern was helping ranchers,  
timber and mining interests exploit American resources, the agency 
now often finds itself challenging these interests to protect those 
same resources -- the grasslands, threatened species, scenic parks 
and wilderness and open spaces.

<HEADLINE> Few Lifers Eligible for Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Michigan prisons hold about 200 inmates sentenced under the  
state's lifer law for drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, state legislators amended the law to allow for parole  
after 20 years, or even 15 years if the inmate meets certain 
criteria, including cooperating with police and having no other 
serious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	JeDonna Young was the first inmate paroled since the change.  
About a half-dozen inmates sentenced under the law are eligible for 
parole this year, said Matt Davis, a state prison spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those held under the lifer law, 44.6 percent are first-time  
offenders and 86 percent had no prior prison record, says Laura 
Sager, director of the Michigan project of Families Against 
Mandatory Minimums, which lobbied to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of a lifer law believe it is justified because of the  
ripple effects of drugs dealing and associated violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Sager believes the changes signal a growing realization  
the law's harshness was out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judges should have the ability to determine individual  
sentences,'' distinguishing between a first-time offender and a 
drug kingpin, she says.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi To Debut New Ads at Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With help from singer Aretha Franklin and actor  
Marlon Brando, Pepsi-Cola Co. plans to launch an ad campaign called 
``Joy of Cola'' for its flagship brand later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The beverage company from Purchase, N.Y., disclosed Thursday the  
first three commercials in the new campaign will debut March 21 on 
the Academy Awards show on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Aretha Franklin has recorded a new anthem for the soft drink  
maker that will be heard in the ads and will make a cameo 
appearance in one of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Marlon Brando and entertainer Issac Hayes will narrate the  
other ads although neither man will be shown in the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Child actor Hallie Eisenberg, who has previously appeared for  
Pepsi in an ad in which she adopts an unusually gruff voice when 
she finds Pepsi isn't served at a diner, will appear in all three 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, the little girl appears to sing the new anthem but it  
is Aretha Franklin's voice. Brando's voice is channeled through the 
girl in another ad in which she has been denied a Pepsi, while 
Hayes' voice comes through her when she poses as a disc jockey in 
the third ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi officials said the new campaign leverages the company's  
``key equities of humor, humanity and music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new theme replaces ``Generation Next'' which had been  
faulted by Phil Marineau, president of Pepsi-Cola North America, 
for appearing to appeal to only a narrow segment of the audience 
that Pepsi should court. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola's corporate share of the $56.3 billion U.S. soft  
drink market rose 0.5 percentage point to 31.4 percent last year, 
according to the Beverage Digest/Maxwell report. Coca-Cola Co.'s 
leading share rose 0.6 percentage point to 44.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pepsi-Cola brand's share fell 0.3 percentage points to 14.2  
percent, while industry leader Coca-Cola Classic was flat at 20.8 
percent of the market, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pollution Reaches West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The air that people breathe in Seattle today  
may contain chemicals that spewed from a factory in China last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first published study of airborne chemicals from Asia  
reaching the United States, researchers measured carbon monoxide, 
radon, aerosols, hydrocarbons and other chemicals in air arriving 
at Cheeka Peak Observatory in Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed to be the first time anyone has detected Asian  
pollution in the United States, said Dan Jaffe, a professor at the 
University of Washington, Bothell, and lead author of the report in 
the March 15 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffe, who first reported his findings last December at a  
meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, added 
more detail in the published paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the mid-1970s, the production of such pollutants as  
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide has been increasing in Asia as 
more factories opened and more cars came into use. These pollutants 
previously have been tracked into the central North Pacific by 
NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	In March and April, 1997, the researchers recorded 10 instances  
of pollutants arriving at their observatory on the Olympic 
Peninsula, he said. They traced those air masses backwards to find 
the source of the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals included carbon monoxide, radon, hydrocarbons and  
peroxylacetyl nitrate, which Jaffe described as a precursor of 
smog. ``Chemists in LA (Los Angeles) are very familiar with it,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the air normally contains what are called background  
levels of these chemicals, the amounts measured in air arriving 
from Asia topped those amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the scientists measured 146 parts per trillion of  
peroxylacetyl nitrate in air samples arriving from Asia, jumping to 
201 parts per trillion on the strongest day. By comparison, air 
samples not containing Asian air had just 71 parts per trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	They concluded that 22 percent of the carbon monoxide arriving  
at Cheeka Peak originated in East Asian emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The concentrations of the pollutants measured were not high  
enough to be an acute hazard to health, Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air masses took about six days to travel from Asia to North  
America along the westerly winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffe was reluctant to be critical of Asian countries.  
</P>
<P>
	``We make pollution too. Everybody's pollution goes somewhere  
else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Cahill, a professor of atmospheric science at the University  
of California at Davis, who was not part of Jaffe's team, said 
measuring these pollutants and detecting their source is very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he believes Jaffe's group is correct and has found  
evidence of chemical pollution arriving from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small world,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cahill is studying dust crossing the Pacific Ocean from Asia and  
noted that at the same time the chemical measurements were being 
made, there was also a dust plume stretching from Asia to North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The dust particles he found included arsenic, copper, nickel,  
zinc and sulfur, which are not natural but are clearly from 
industry from Asia, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
	With new techniques, scientists are able to tell the difference  
between coal sulfur dust from Shanghai and typical industrial 
pollution from Manchurian smelters, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian air was carried on relatively low-level winds, between  
the surface and 2 miles high, rather than the powerful 
high-altitude jet streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cahill said dust pollution traveling great distances is a  
problem in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	He has traced dust from northern Africa across the Atlantic  
Ocean, into Texas, north through the Midwest and back into the 
ocean again across Maine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And 11 years of data from the Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii,  
Cahill added, indicate that mountain ``is effectively a suburb of 
Beijing each spring.''

<HEADLINE> French Sailor to Quit Solo Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- French sailor Isabelle Autissier,  
rescued in her capsized yacht two weeks ago, will not compete in 
any more solo around-the-world races. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, the first woman to circumnavigate the globe alone,  
said she made up her mind before she left Charleston last September 
at the start of the Around Alone race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be my last Around Alone, but I did not  
want to say anything to anybody,'' she said in The (Charleston) 
Post and Courier on Thursday. ``I think it's time for me to do 
something else. I had 10 wonderful years, but I think now it's 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke from Punta Del Este, Uruguay, the next-to-last leg of  
the nine-month race, after arriving as a passenger aboard winner 
Giovanni Soldini's FILA. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier leaves the sport as a star in France, despite never  
having won the Around Alone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1994-95 Around Alone, her mast had to be repaired twice  
and she had to be rescued by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago in the Vendee Globe, a solo around-the-world race  
without stopovers, she was disqualified when she had to stop for 
repairs. She sailed on anyway to finish an unofficial second. 
</P>
<P>
	She was favored to win this Around Alone, but her lead was soon  
lost. Sailing near the bottom of the world, Autissier was in her
