<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Serena Williams glanced down, pouted her lips and
surveyed the size of her mouth. Not big, not big at all.
</P>
<P>
   This did not match the measurement Martina Hingis made on
Wednesday when she described the Williams family as having a ``big
mouth.'' But Williams assured everyone Thursday that there was an
explanation for Hingis' assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been the type of person that ... says things,
just speaks her mind,'' Williams said. ``I guess it has a little
bit to do with not having a formal education. But you just have to
somehow think more. You have to use your brain a little more in the
tennis world.''
</P>
<P>
   They're so cute at this age. Here was the 17-year-old Williams,
one hour removed from pulling the ponytail of the qualifier Jelena
Kostanic, 6-4, 6-2, in the second round of the U.S. Open, and now
she was blistering a return to the 18-year-old Hingis. While these
two have all but shouted out ``Food Fight!'' on the pristine
grounds of the National Tennis Center, a rather civilized and
orderly Day 4 unfolded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After fourth-seeded Monica Seles hustled past Silvia Farina,
6-2, 6-3, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport needed just 45 minutes to
beat Ruxandra Dragomir, 6-0, 6-2. There was only a minor shake-up
among seeded women's players when a lively Magui Serna, ranked No.
42 in the world, upset 14th-seeded Sandrine Testud, 6-3, 6-3.
Testud, the first of the seeded women to fall, was admittedly flat
and fatigued from a rigorous schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, in a draw that has taken a hit from the
injury departures of Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter, normalcy was
restored when second-seeded Andre Agassi flicked away the qualifier
Axel Pretzsch like lint off his sleeve, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi symbolized a day of simplicity for all the seeded men on
the schedule. Twelfth-seeded Richard Krajicek and 15th-seeded
Nicolas Kiefer also won easily. Only 10th-seeded Marcelo Rios
dropped a set, but he rallied to beat George Bastl, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   When night fell, though, an injury had forced another top player
to withdraw. Eighth-seeded Carlos Moya retired in the third set of
his match against Nicolas Escude, apparently because of a back
injury, trailing by 1-6, 4-6, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Serena Williams slipped behind the dais in the interview
room she opened up as if she were in bloom. She gladly described
how she is more extroverted and how her sister, third-seeded Venus
Williams, is more introverted. And she let everyone in on her
current plans, like learning Portuguese and plundering in fashion
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into wedding dresses,'' she said. ``I'm trying to add
color to wedding dresses. I mean pure white, but with trims. I mean
with a lavender, even a black and red, burgundy trim around it. I
think that would be really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she exuded an effervescent personality that was
nearly carbonated. But there is the other side, like the articulate
but cunning way she can race to return a dig against an adversary
like Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   But who started this? Hingis' remarks on Wednesday were in
response to Richard Williams and his pre-Open prediction that the
Williams sisters would meet in the final. In character, the brazen
Hingis did not hold back when she said: ``They always talk a lot.
It's more pressure on them. Whether they can handle it or not, now
that's the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams handled it, all right. She had an answer or two
for Hingis as her father, Richard, sat back and seemed to savor the
ruckus. ``I don't think there's more pressure on them,'' Richard
Williams said Thursday before his daughters played their doubles
match. ``I think pressure is doing what I did, working 9 to 5. I
still believe there will be two Williamses in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Martina said is not a shock. I think she has the right to
say what she wants to say. I'm going to ask her for her autograph.
I love her. If you see her, tell her I love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure thing. But love was not in the air at his daughter's news
conference. As Serena Williams beamed while discussing the moment
she received her high school diploma, she slipped in a sly aside at
an opponent she could soon face if the two meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty excited when I got my diploma,'' Williams said.
``A lot of people can't say that, but I guess they pursue other
things. In a way, I guess it's better for them. For instance, like
Martina Hingis, she was No. 1 when she was 16. That's something
I've never done personally. I still haven't won a Grand Slam and
she's won five. She's pursued other things, and I'm pursuing
education. I'm catching up in tennis, though.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Williams smiled, bared her teeth and all but hissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, she's No. 1, so she can say whatever she would like
to say,'' Williams said, summing up her response to Hingis. ``I
personally don't think my mouth is big, if you're just looking at
it.''

UCLA'S MITCHELL READY FOR GOOD BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The All-American receiver's hurt, the quarterbacks
are new, and the offensive line's littered with freshmen. But
Freddie Mitchell's healthy, and based on his performance last year,
he may be all UCLA needs Saturday against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell accounted for two touchdowns and gained 250 all-purpose
yards in the season opener against Texas before breaking his right
leg a week later at Houston. (He returned three months ahead of
schedule and played 11 snaps in the Rose Bowl.)
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's season, although brief, left a dramatic impression:
Despite touching the ball only 14 times, he accounted for three
touchdowns and 375 total yards. That's 27 yards per touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays healthy, the sky's the limit for Freddie,''
offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``He has so much talent, it's
scary. He's a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a sophomore from Lakeland, Fla., is UCLA's best
all-around player. He's a fearless kick and punt returner. He's an
elusive runner. He throws a tight spiral on the flanker pass, and
Saturday, to fortify the suspension-depleted secondary, he'll play
cornerback in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the Bruins need Mitchell to replace injured
receiver Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are putting pressure on me now that Danny's
gone, and I like that,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have confidence in me. They told me, `Freddie, you
can fill Danny's shoes better than anyone.' I'm mentally stronger
from the injury. My routes are crisper. I know the offense better.
I'm ready three ways: mentally, spiritually and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially official: Farmer is listed as doubtful on the daily
medical report, but he admitted Thursday he doesn't expect to play
because of his sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty unlikely,'' Farmer said. ``I don't want to
sacrifice the rest of the season for one game. I'm thinking I
should take the time off to make sure it's totally healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Review of the week: UCLA senior defensive tackle Pete Holland, a
history major and six-time member of the honor roll, has agreed to
review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: ``The Dark
Side of Camelot'', by Seymour M. Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book's allure lies in (the disparity between) its contents
and what we associate with President John F. Kennedy. He has been
bronzed a dynamic president and a champion of civil rights. What's
not etched in collective memory about Kennedy is what Hersh's book
conveys: JFK's father's bootlegging and organized crime
connections; vote buying; blackmail; and poolside trysts with
countless partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiction sells better under the guise of fact, and some of
`Camelot's' contents are juicy enough to blur the line. Despite
this, `Camelot' will please the fact junkies as well as history
fans thirsting for a great read.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3{ sacks (out of four)
</P>
<P>
   Good hands man: According to UCLA's practice statistics,
receiver Brad Melsby has not dropped a pass since training camp
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I can ever remember a receiver not
dropping a ball,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``That's incredible.''

FLOOD OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS OFF B.C. COAST STIRS ANGER, AND WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ They spent $38,000 each for the privilege of
spending 10 weeks at sea in a rusting, rickety ship, being fed a
bowl of rice and two glasses of water a day, heading for what they
were told was the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven weeks, three ships crowded with 450 Chinese
have been seized off the coast of British Columbia, the passengers
hauled off to a detention center near Victoria. The latest and
largest shipload _ 190 people _ was captured Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come because they are told Canada is the golden mountain,
everybody is rich and within two years everybody pays it off,''
said Kevin Doyle, a Victoria lawyer who waited Thursday as Canadian
immigration officials began interviewing the latest group.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are still piecing together the story of the latest
illegal arrivals. But some information has been gleaned from
stories told by the 123 Chinese on a boat discovered off Vancouver
Island on July 20, and a second boatload of 131 people sent ashore
at the southern tip of the Queen Charlotte Islands on Aug. 11,
translators and attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese or their families paid or pledged the huge sum for
the voyage from China's Fujian Province, directly across the strait
from Taiwan. It is a province that has benefited from a burgeoning
market economy, but also has seen growing poverty, especially among
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination was a North American country with among the
most liberal immigration laws in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Chinese may also be headed to New York, and an
illegal economy in which they hope to work off the amount paid or
pledged to their passage.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them have produced any identity papers. Nor has any
written agreement been made with smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the ships, those who had paid $10,000 of their passage
were allowed up on deck. The others were kept below, 50 to a room,
with a bucket for a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a costly and dangerous trip from Fujian Province to
Canada, many illegals take the risk. They can claim refugee status,
which in most cases allows a person to remain in Canada for 11
months. Adults are usually released into Canadian society.
</P>
<P>
   Many simply vanish; an estimated 70 percent of refugee claimants
from Fujian Province from previous seizures have failed to report.
</P>
<P>
   George Varnai, regional manager for Immigration Canada, told
Voice of America earlier this week that many refugee claimants who
disappear are bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly some common wisdom out there, that's all it
is, common wisdom, that many of them, certainly from the Fujian
Chinese population who disappear, may in fact be smuggled or going
to the United States without status,'' Varnai said.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of more than 440 illegal immigrants has caused a
political uproar _ and a possible upheaval of public opinion _ in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The apprehension of three boats in a little more than a month
has raised questions about the security of the coastline. The
British Columbia government is being forced to care for 75
children, as young as 6 years old, from the first two boats. The
cost comes to more than $550,000 a month. Another 29 juveniles were
on the boat apprehended this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the real public anger was stirred when 86 passengers from
the first boat were released _ everybody on board claimed refugee
status _ and five of the illegals promptly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do in Canada is say, `I am a refugee.' They
process you, they turn you loose and away you go,'' said John
Reynolds, a member of Parliament from the opposition Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want these people down there'' in the United States,
Reynolds said. ``We certainly don't want them. In 25 years I've
never seen an issue that made people so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds argued that Canada should use its trade with China ``as
a hammer'' to get the Chinese government to stop ships filled with
illegals from leaving Fujian Province, and to make China take back
the human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   At a coffee shop not far from the Canadian Armed Forces base at
Esquimalt, where the latest arrivals are being processed, opinion
seemed unanimous: Send them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must show that we won't tolerate this. Otherwise, how many
boats will we see off our coast?'' asked Shirley Clarke, a
saleswoman and self-described progressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government has defended the immigrants' right to
apply for refugee status. Anybody who arrives in Canada ``by boat,
plane, train, car or on foot'' has the right to make a refugee
claim and have that claim heard, Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Immigration Canada has tightened procedures. It has so far
refused to release any of the 74 people from the second ship who
have claimed refugee status. People can be held if it is determined
they are unlikely to appear before refugee adjudicators.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 58 of those aboard the second ship have been found
subject to ``exclusion orders'' either because of suspected illegal
activity or possible involvement in the smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected immigrants will be sent out of Canada to China,
Immigration Canada spokesperson Janis Harper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has taken a somewhat contradictory
position. It has said that Canada should not grant refugee status
to the illegal passengers. But its embassy in Ottawa has yet to
indicate that China will take back any of the boat people from
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   The new world of Canada doubtless looked attractive as the
latest 190 passengers began processing Thursday. The Olympic
Mountains loomed across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Chinese
passed the time by tossing Frisbees and playing volleyball with
Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers assigned to guard them.
</P>
<P>
   They face a potentially difficult reception from security
officers at home. Earlier this week, an immigration board turned
down the refugee application of a 16-year-old boy from the first
boat. The teenager claimed to have been a Christian who had been in
hiding after public security agents saw him distributing leaflets
for an unregistered Protestant meeting in his village.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not believe the young man, who ``blanked out''
under the board's questioning, said his lawyer, Don Bohun. When
asked to name the central figure in Christianity, he identified the
villager in charge of the prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bohun fears what will happen if his client is returned home. A
recent phone contact brought news that the teenager's mother is in
hiding, and that security officials have broken down the door of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he would get a prison sentence of four years,''
Bohun said. ``He said that what he is really afraid of is that he
will be beaten when he gets back to his village for the trouble he
has caused.''
</P>
<P>
   One young man aboard the second boat did leave China once
before, was caught in the United States and sent back home. ``He
was arrested, he was repeatedly beaten with an electric baton, and
he was released only when his relatives came up with money to pay
the officials,'' said Doyle, who is representing the man.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stem anger in Canada, Immigration Minister Caplan said
Wednesday that the arrival of fall storms will help solve the
problem by preventing illegal voyages.

FOR JOHN ROBINSON, BE IT DENTON, TEXAS, OR THE ROSE BOWL, COACHING
IS FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Ten seasons ago, John Robinson was coaching a
Los Angeles Rams team that wound up losing to the San Francisco
49ers in the NFC Championship Game. Four times, he coached a
Southern California team that won the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the 64-year-old Robinson made his Nevada-Las Vegas
coaching debut at Fouts Field. He's taking over a
bottom-of-the-barrel program that has gone 6-39 the past four
seasons. North Texas proved the perfect welcome mat. The Rebels
ended a 16-game losing streak (and a 26-game road losing streak)
with a 26-3 victory over the Eagles, giving Robinson his 105th
victory as a college coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win for us in terms of finishing off the
past,'' Robinson said. ``This team is 1-0. We're on a winning
streak now.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLV's main shortcoming in its opener was three lost fumbles.
Otherwise, last year's defense (their term, not mine) showed
significant improvement on the 35 points a game it allowed last
season. Robinson's first recruiting class featured seven
junior-college players expected to help immediately. One of those,
running back Jeremi Rudolph, gained 97 yards and scored the Rebels'
first two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly inflated attendance of 19,011 witnessed Robinson's
Return. Not exactly like playing on New Year's Day in Pasadena,
right, coach?
</P>
<P>
   `` It doesn't matter where you're playing, it could be a parking
lot,'' Robinson said. ``It's the game that matters. \RTonight\S was
fun for me because I never saw doubt in \Rhis players\S eyes. They
looked like they knew what they were doing. Our kids played like
winners. We didn't look like a team that had lost 100 million in a
row or some damn thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The game. Being called ``coach.'' The juice that flows before
kickoff. The satisfication _ if only for one night _ of turning a
bunch of losers into winners. Coaching is a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you get away from it, you say, `Damn, I'm not having
as much fun,''' said Robinson, who signed a three-year, $350,000
contract in December. ``And when I say that now, people look at me
like I'm not very smart. I think it becomes really hard to walk
away. I hate to use the word, but you're almost addicted. There's
an addiction, a certain kind of feeling when you're committed to
something. I guess if you left coaching for some kind of crusade,
maybe you wouldn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviving UNLV is a crusade for only the most fervent. Robinson
likens the Rebels to an expansion team. Taking a page from Jerry
Jones, Robinson is in charge of everything from jocks to socks. He
redesigned the uniforms, helped sell season tickets, he speaks to
any group of 10 or more people. He's done everything but deal
blackjack at The Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, everything about your program shrinks,''
Robinson said. ``I'm trying to get people on campus and in Las
Vegas to think about us again. I think I understand the big
picture. I understand what needs to be done. I can get out and
hustle funds. I'm pretty much the right guy for this job based on
my skills. I won't be here for much more than five years, then pass
it on. I'm in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLV's itinerary of Denton, Waco, Reno, Laramie, Albuquerque and
Colorado Springs is far from glamorous. For Robinson, the days of
Student Body Left and Right, Rose Bowl trips, NFL Sundays and
network perks are ancient history. He's coaching in his 39th
season, but he's never passed this way before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unique,'' said Robinson, whose team plays at Baylor on
Sept. 11. ``We've got a tremendous distance travel to be a
nationally respected program. I don't have any illusions about this
is going to be a miracle. I know better than that. But I don't want
to come in and say, check back with us in two or three years. We
want to win now, have a winning season.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLV 26, North Texas 3 was a start.

BANK OF NEW YORK DISMISSES SECOND EMPLOYEE IN LAUNDERING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS description of position in 3rd graf;   CHANGES `lax' to `few'
in 11th graf;   CLARIFIES wording in 12th graf.)  (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York said Thursday that it had
dismissed a second employee involved in its investigation into
possible money laundering at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, was discharged for failing
to cooperate with the bank's internal investigation into the
suspected money laundering, a person close to the inquiry said. The
bank refused to elaborate on the ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kudryavtsev joined the bank in 1994 and was an international
bank associatein the East European division in New York, a low
level position akin to an administrative assistant, the person
close to the investigation said. Ms. Kudryavtsev could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   She was discharged six days after the bank had ousted a vice
president in the East European division, Lucy Edwards. Ms. Edwards,
who worked in London, was dismissed for ``gross misconduct,'' said
a person with direct knowledge of the dismissal, including the
falsification of bank records, failure to cooperate with
investigators and for never telling the bank that she was married
to Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin had opened accounts at the bank in the name of a company
called Benex. Federal investigators say at least $4.2 billion, and
perhaps up to $10 billion, was channeled through Benex accounts at
the bank over 18 months starting some time early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although little is known about Berlin, investigators say they
believe that the money came from criminal activities, political
graft and corporate embezzlement in Russia and that it was being
laundered for figures in organized crime in Russia. Some of the
money was also probably capital flight, Russian executives and U.S.
law-enforcement authorities said, secreted out of the country last
year, when Russia faced a grave financial crisis and its banks and
currency collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports have speculated that some of the money may have
been diverted from loans to Russia by the International Monetary
Fund or from food-aid programs. But the IMF and the U.S. government
said they had no hard evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and his wife, who was born Lydmila Pritzker and emigrated
to the United States from Russia more than 20 years ago, lived in
the in the New York area until a few years ago, when the bank
transferred Ms. Edwards to London.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank nor any employees, including the two who were
dismissed, have been charged with wrongdoing by legal authorities.
According to Reuters, Ms. Edwards issued a statement Thursday
through her lawyer in London in which she ``strenuously denied''
the allegations on which the bank based her ouster. The statement
said that Ms. Edwards was ``pursuing the remedies available against
the bank, and we have notified the bank accordingly.'' The
statement did not say what the allegations were, and neither has
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in New York for both Ms. Edwards and her husband, T.
Barry Kingham, told Reuters, ``Both Peter and Lucy firmly deny any
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the exact sources of the money and the extent to
which the movement violated any laws will take many months, perhaps
years, U.S. officials said. Layers of companies were used to
disguise the origins and destinations of the money, and many of the
companies were registered in places like the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and Antigua, which have strict bank-secrecy laws and few
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials said the only hope that they had
of eventually getting to the bottom of the activity at the bank was
with the full cooperation of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior bank officer whom investigators say they are
looking at closely is Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who was in
charge of the East European division in New York and worked closely
with Ms. Edwards. The bank suspended Ms. Kagalovsky, with pay,
after the allegations of money laundering became public Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, a
prominent Russian businessman, have denied wrongdoing. She and her
husband own a condominium on E. 47th St. in Manhattan. Contrary to
earlier reports, the apartment has a mortgage, her husband said
last week in an interview in Moscow.

FLOOD OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS OFF B.C. COAST STIRS ANGER, AND WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ They spent $38,000 each for the privilege of
spending 10 weeks at sea in a rusting, rickety ship, being fed a
bowl of rice and two glasses of water a day, heading for what they
were told was the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven weeks, three ships crowded with 450 Chinese
have been seized off the coast of British Columbia, the passengers
hauled off to a detention center near Victoria. The latest and
largest shipload _ 190 people _ was captured Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come because they are told Canada is the golden mountain,
everybody is rich and within two years everybody pays it off,''
said Kevin Doyle, a Victoria lawyer who waited Thursday as Canadian
immigration officials began interviewing the latest group.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are still piecing together the story of the latest
illegal arrivals. But some information has been gleaned from
stories told by the 123 Chinese on a boat discovered off Vancouver
Island on July 20, and a second boatload of 131 people sent ashore
at the southern tip of the Queen Charlotte Islands on Aug. 11,
translators and attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese or their families paid or pledged the huge sum for
the voyage from China's Fujian Province, directly across the strait
from Taiwan. It is a province that has benefited from a burgeoning
market economy, but also has seen growing poverty, especially among
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination was a North American country with among the
most liberal immigration laws in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Chinese may also be headed to New York, and an
illegal economy in which they hope to work off the amount paid or
pledged to their passage.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them have produced any identity papers. Nor has any
written agreement been made with smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the ships, those who had paid $10,000 of their passage
were allowed up on deck. The others were kept below, 50 to a room,
with a bucket for a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a costly and dangerous trip from Fujian Province to
Canada, many illegals take the risk. They can claim refugee status,
which in most cases allows a person to remain in Canada for 11
months. Adults are usually released into Canadian society.
</P>
<P>
   Many simply vanish; an estimated 70 percent of refugee claimants
from Fujian Province from previous seizures have failed to report.
</P>
<P>
   George Varnai, regional manager for Immigration Canada, told
Voice of America earlier this week that many refugee claimants who
disappear are bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly some common wisdom out there, that's all it
is, common wisdom, that many of them, certainly from the Fujian
Chinese population who disappear, may in fact be smuggled or going
to the United States without status,'' Varnai said.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of more than 440 illegal immigrants has caused a
political uproar _ and a possible upheaval of public opinion _ in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The apprehension of three boats in a little more than a month
has raised questions about the security of the coastline. The
British Columbia government is being forced to care for 75
children, as young as 6 years old, from the first two boats. The
cost comes to more than $550,000 a month. Another 29 juveniles were
on the boat apprehended this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the real public anger was stirred when 86 passengers from
the first boat were released _ everybody on board claimed refugee
status _ and five of the illegals promptly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do in Canada is say, `I am a refugee.' They
process you, they turn you loose and away you go,'' said John
Reynolds, a member of Parliament from the opposition Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want these people down there'' in the United States,
Reynolds said. ``We certainly don't want them. In 25 years I've
never seen an issue that made people so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds argued that Canada should use its trade with China ``as
a hammer'' to get the Chinese government to stop ships filled with
illegals from leaving Fujian Province, and to make China take back
the human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   At a coffee shop not far from the Canadian Armed Forces base at
Esquimalt, where the latest arrivals are being processed, opinion
seemed unanimous: Send them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must show that we won't tolerate this. Otherwise, how many
boats will we see off our coast?'' asked Shirley Clarke, a
saleswoman and self-described progressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government has defended the immigrants' right to
apply for refugee status. Anybody who arrives in Canada ``by boat,
plane, train, car or on foot'' has the right to make a refugee
claim and have that claim heard, Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Immigration Canada has tightened procedures. It has so far
refused to release any of the 74 people from the second ship who
have claimed refugee status. People can be held if it is determined
they are unlikely to appear before refugee adjudicators.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 58 of those aboard the second ship have been found
subject to ``exclusion orders'' either because of suspected illegal
activity or possible involvement in the smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected immigrants will be sent out of Canada to China,
Immigration Canada spokesperson Janis Harper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has taken a somewhat contradictory
position. It has said that Canada should not grant refugee status
to the illegal passengers. But its embassy in Ottawa has yet to
indicate that China will take back any of the boat people from
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   The new world of Canada doubtless looked attractive as the
latest 190 passengers began processing Thursday. The Olympic
Mountains loomed across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Chinese
passed the time by tossing Frisbees and playing volleyball with
Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers assigned to guard them.
</P>
<P>
   They face a potentially difficult reception from security
officers at home. Earlier this week, an immigration board turned
down the refugee application of a 16-year-old boy from the first
boat. The teenager claimed to have been a Christian who had been in
hiding after public security agents saw him distributing leaflets
for an unregistered Protestant meeting in his village.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not believe the young man, who ``blanked out''
under the board's questioning, said his lawyer, Don Bohun. When
asked to name the central figure in Christianity, he identified the
villager in charge of the prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bohun fears what will happen if his client is returned home. A
recent phone contact brought news that the teenager's mother is in
hiding, and that security officials have broken down the door of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he would get a prison sentence of four years,''
Bohun said. ``He said that what he is really afraid of is that he
will be beaten when he gets back to his village for the trouble he
has caused.''
</P>
<P>
   One young man aboard the second boat did leave China once
before, was caught in the United States and sent back home. ``He
was arrested, he was repeatedly beaten with an electric baton, and
he was released only when his relatives came up with money to pay
the officials,'' said Doyle, who is representing the man.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stem anger in Canada, Immigration Minister Caplan said
Wednesday that the arrival of fall storms will help solve the
problem by preventing illegal voyages.

PALMER WANTS TO GIVE USC DEFENSE A REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ USC fans may expect a lot from quarterback Carson
Palmer, but probably no more than the sophomore demands from the
Trojans' offense Saturday against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should score every time we touch the ball,'' Palmer
said. ``To be realistic, I'd like to put 35-40 points on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   That may sound unrealistic, but USC did average 26 points a game
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer sees it as a form of payback for the defense, which was
forced to spend too much time on the field last season because the
offense often sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to pick up last year for the defense,'' Palmer said.
``And do what they did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Turf fans: USC players gave a resounding thumbs up to the new
artificial turf that was installed two weeks ago at Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' USC tailback Chad Morton said. ``It's probably
the best turf I've ever been on. It almost feels between a turf and
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Even USC coach Paul Hackett was effusive about the new surface,
which feels much softer than normal turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's marvelous. It's got a sponge bounce to it,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   No paradise: Whether USC plays in El Paso or Honolulu, senior
offensive lineman Travis Claridge remains the team's toughest
critic on road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not impressed,'' Claridge said after arriving in Hawaii.
``(Fellow lineman Faaesea Mailo) told me to wait and look around a
little bit. The airport is just dirt and gravel, it's like landing
in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury wins job: Sophomore David Newbury has won the kicking
battle over David Bell and will do the placekicking against Hawaii.
Bell will continue to do kickoffs, which he also did last season.
</P>
<P>
   Clark hurt: An already thin secondary got a little thinner
Friday when cornerback Tanqueray Clark sprained his ankle in
practice. Hackett said Clark would be ready for the game, but if he
can't play, the Trojans are down to Eric Reese and freshman walk-on
Kevin Arbet at the nickel back position.
</P>
<P>
   Big shirts: USC players arrived wearing cardinal and gold
Hawaiian shirts. All except the team's linemen, anyway. No shirts
were made in size XXXL, so most of the linemen wore blue Hawaiian
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal and gold versions were not exactly wowing the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably give it to my dad,'' wide receiver R. Jay Soward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so cheap seats? Tickets for the USC-UCLA game at the
Coliseum are the second-most expensive in all of college football
this season. The $46 price tag trails only the $54 it costs for the
cheapest ticket to the Stanford-Cal game. The Pac-10 may not
dominate the polls, but it's ahead in ticket prices. Ranking No. 3
on the list is the $41 cost of tickets to see Arizona host USC and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Six games are tied for fifth at $40, all of which involve
Oklahoma, Texas and Nebraska.

OK, DAD, TENNIS DOES PROBABLY NEED ALL-WILLIAMS FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No Pete Sampras. No Connors. No McEnroe. No Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   It loomed as a drab fortnight at the U.S. Open Tennis
Championships in New York. But fortunately, Richard Williams and
Martina Hingis couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see an all-black final for the first
time,'' said Williams, who happened to be talking, not so modestly,
about his own kids, Venus and Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans want it,'' Williams went on to tell Laura
Vecsey of the ``Seattle Post-Intelligencer''. ``I think the media
needs it. I think the United States needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Williams apparently was speaking on behalf of the
United States and its territories, as he is wont to do. He also
mused about the high price of a New York hamburger _ $6 _ which he
cited as the reason for missing daughter Venus' opening match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of money,'' Williams said. ``So I decided
that for $6, I was going to take 90 minutes and eat my hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis returned her verbal volley on Wednesday, when she was
asked about Williams' boast of an all-beaded, all-black finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always has a big mouth,'' Hingis said, tartly, referring
to Venus. ``They always talk a lot. It's happened before. It's
going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this isn't McEnroe and Connors, fussing and snarling long
into the Open's TV night, but it'll have to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is hurt, his immediate tennis future uncertain after
revealing a herniated disk. Two-time defending champ Patrick
Rafter, with a torn rotator cuff, pulled out in the middle of the
first round. Graf is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Mikael Tillstrom, ranked No. 130 in the world and the man who
took Sampras' place in the draw, would have made a nice story. But
he was whisked away in the first round before anyone could even ask
him where he was from.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, Sweden?
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the braided Sister Act, the Williamses, and the
trash-talking Miss Swiss, Hingis, whose own mouth has drawn tennis
hot water before. A Martina-Venus semifinal might be just the jolt
that this tournament needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' and Rafter's withdrawals reminded how fragile the
current tennis marquee can be. Sampras' domination on the circuit
is both a bane and a blessing. The game needs him, dull though his
image may be. One wise-rump columnist in New York observed that the
wince on Sampras' face as he gingerly eased into a chair Monday was
the most expression he had ever seen from the four-time U.S. Open
champ.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the senior Williams, a new storyline was swiftly
scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams vs. Williams. If papa Richard can speak for the entire
country, let me add, speaking on behalf of all media, that I
endorse the idea, too.
</P>
<P>
   The dad is wacky, but this is tennis.
Obsessive/protective/eccentric behavior on the part of parents
seems to be the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's father, Peter, went straight from the Mom-and-Pop seats
at Wimbledon to jail for not reporting all of his daughter's
millions. Jim Pierce, brow-beating father of Mary, was banned from
her matches for five years. And then there's tennis' most famous
single mom, Samantha Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams apparently can't help it that the media keep
following him around, baiting him for his thoughts on everything
from Serena's high school grades (''brilliant'') to one of Venus'
past opponents (''a big white turkey'').
</P>
<P>
   Hingis said this week that the father's ramblings will put more
pressure on the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Serena later scoffed at that notion, adding, ``She's always the
type of person who says things. I guess it has a little bit to do
with not having a formal education.''
</P>
<P>
   Meow. Advantage, Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The old man was probably premature in his proud prediction. One
day tennis truly could see an all-Williams final at a major
tournament. But that is supposed to be two, maybe three, years away
at the U.S. Open unless Venus _ according to her dad _ leaves the
tour to become a lawyer, doctor or spokeswoman for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \Rthe all-sister final\S would be great for tennis,''
Williams told the ``New York Post.'' ``I think the world needs it.
The world is looking for something different to brighten things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could brighten tennis up is Venus and
Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are bold words about two players who have yet to win a
Grand Slam event. And it may have been the thing that was on the
underdog-loving New York crowd's mind when it vocally pulled
against Venus in her match against Anne-Gaelle Sidot the other
night.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a spicy script for an Open that, frankly, dearly
needed one.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get caught at the $6 hamburger stand.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets finalized a contract agreement Thursday morning with
forward Charles Barkley, sources close to the talks said, ensuring
Barkley's return to Houston for his 16th season in the NBA.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley has not officially signed, and contract talks Wednesday
and Thursday were held over the phone. Barkley is not expected to
sign the one-year contract until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets officials, citing team policy about discussing player
transactions, would not comment on Barkley's contract status before
the deal is completed, although Rockets vice president Carroll
Dawson said Wednesday the negotiation with Barkley was ``going
along as good as it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something could happen very soon,'' Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, 36, is coming off a comeback season in his third year
with the Rockets. He averaged 16.1 points, 12.3 rebounds and 4.5
assists in 42 games, missing eight games with early-season knee
surgery. He was second in the league in rebounding last season.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley reached several career milestones last season, becoming
only the third NBA player ever to collect 20,000 points, 10,000
rebounds and 4,000 assists, milestones also reached by Wilt
Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He is one of only 11 players
with 20,000 points and 11,000 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is 13th all-time in scoring with 23,468 points and is
fourth among active players. He averaged 19.2 points and 13.5
rebounds in his first season with the Rockets and 15.2 points and
11.7 rebounds in the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 22.3 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent after each of the past two seasons, he played last
season for $1 million, allowing the Rockets to remain well enough
below the salary cap to work a sign-and-trade deal with the Chicago
Bulls to acquire Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   After his third season with the Rockets, he became a free agent
again but with ``Larry Bird'' rights, allowing the Rockets, already
well over the salary cap, to exceed the cap to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rockets announced the addition Thursday of
perhaps the league's biggest player.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the team signed 7-3, 330-pound center Thomas
Hamilton, who played with the Rockets' Rocky Mountain Revue team in
Salt Lake City this summer and has been working with Rockets
coaches and trainers the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' agent, Mark Bartlestein, said Thomas chose to sign a
two-year, $1.1 million deal with the Rockets because he felt they
offered the best chance for him to realize his potential.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that if
elected president he would force schools in poor areas to perform
by threatening to take away federal money from those that fail and
allow parents to use it for private schools. Addressing a Hispanic
business association lunch, Bush, a Republican, dismissed most
existing federal educational programs as failures. But in a
departure from traditional Republican thinking, he outlined a
strategy that would increase the role of the federal Department of
Education by adding to it the Head Start program for preschoolers
and using federal funds to reward high-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the conservative preference for local control, Bush
said Washington should stay out of the business of setting
standards for schools, leaving that up to state and local
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government must be humble enough to stay out of
the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough to give
states and school districts more authority and freedom, and strong
enough to require proven performance in return. When we spend
federal money, we want results _ especially when it comes to
disadvantaged children.''
</P>
<P>
   Education, which played only a modest role in the last
presidential election, has emerged as a top concern of voters and
the two parties are vying to demonstrate it has the means to
improve the nation's schools. Vice President Al Gore, who is
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, devoted his first
major policy speech last spring to his plans for how the federal
government could bring about what he called ``revolutionary
change'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized his performance in Texas, where testing and
accountability have led to improved schools. But he has not used
state money there to reward or punish schools in the way he is
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Thursday carefully avoided using the politically sensitive
expression school vouchers. Vouchers, backed by many conservatives
and strongly opposed by many liberals, involve giving credits to
parents that could be used to remove children from public schools
and placed in private schools partly or wholly at government
expense.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said in his speech here Thursday that he would withdraw
federal funding from schools whose students tested poorly and that
parents of the children in those schools would receive as much as
$1,500 that could be used to send children to private schools or
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other leading Democrats oppose the use of school
vouchers, insisting they would weaken public schools by siphoning
away needed government funding. Secretary of Education Richard
Riley reacted to the speech by saying, ``No matter how you dress it
up, how long you delay it, or what you call it, a voucher is a
voucher. ... Vouchers undermine our public schools _ which educate
about 90 percent of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Presidential candidates, there is a division
over the issue of vouchers. Republicans Steve Forbes and Pat
Buchanan, favor them, while fellow Republican Elizabeth Dole, a
former teacher with a master's degree in education, supports having
the federal government give tax money back to local schools, which
she says know where it is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, has said he doubted
vouchers were ``the answer to the problems of public education,''
but he has also said he could be willing to give states more
control in spending federal education money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush threaded together ideas of Democrats and Republicans for
his speech and many liberals reacted to Bush's plan quite
positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent are policies and initiatives we could support
and do support,'' said William L. Taylor, vice chair of the
Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, an association of former
federal officials who study education policy.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that while he favored the right of youngsters in
failing schools to opt out and go to schools that are succeeding,
they should be restricted to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would fundamentally alter two major federal
programs, Head Start, which offers everything from day care and
meals to poor children, and Title I, which is the main fund of
federal dollars for poor schools. He would refocus both on
improving reading ability and other basic skills. He added that he
would allow private agencies to compete for and administer some of
those programs, which currently involve almost $13 billion a year
in spending, if the children in them test poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, federal money will no longer follow
failure,'' he said. ``Public funds must be spent on things that
work.'' Bush did not address whether the private agencies would
then be tested, what kind of bureaucracy would be required to
handle the bidding for the contracts or what would happen to the
schools that lost federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, regarded as the frontrunner among the Republican
candidates, described federal programs as involving ``high hopes
and low achievement, grand plans and unmet goals.'' Indeed, one of
the most frequently used words in his speech here Thursday was
``failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start where educational failure has its highest
price,'' said Bush. ``I want to begin with the disadvantaged
children in struggling schools, and the federal role in helping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to reorganize what he characterized as a confusing
maze of federal programs with little emphasis on measurable
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized by some of his opponents for being
short on specifics about policy, and he said Thursday's address
would be the first in a series of policy speeches on education,
which he described as one of his highest priorities. He spoke to
the Latino Business Association at the Los Angeles Convention
Center, and peppered his remarks with Spanish to a highly
appreciative audience, made up largely of entrepreneurs and small
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The line that drew that strongest applause was: ``Some say it is
unfair to hold disadvantaged children to rigorous standards. I say
it is discrimination to require anything less, the soft bigotry of
low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ideas Bush outlined Thursday have been a part of his
educational strategy in Texas. He inherited some of those programs
from his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, as well as other
state administrations, but he has pursued testing and a focus on
teaching reading skills vigorously. Test results have risen
considerably in the state, particularly for minority students, but
the gap between white and minority children remains large.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bush did not address many of Gore's education proposals. Gore,
for instance, has proposed making preschool universally available,
offering tax breaks to encourage saving for college, reductions in
the size of classes in public schools, testing of teachers to make
sure they live up to basic standards, and ensuring that students
develop a basic competency with computers by the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, focused on teaching reading, particularly to
young children. He said that children should begin learning to read
at ages 3 and 4, and he insisted that the best method was phonics.
He said that the Head Start program should be changed to focus on
teaching reading to these young children and that the program
should be transferred from the Department of Health and Human
Services to the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush equated failure to learn to read at a young age with a
propensity to turn to crime later in life. ``More and more, we are
divided into two nations, separate and unequal, one that reads and
one that can't, one that dreams and one that doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his clearest set of rewards and penalties for
schools that receive federal funds under the Title I program. He
said that the disadvantaged students at those schools would be
tested every year, with the tests written and administered by the
states, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that show improvement, he said, would receive additional
federal grants. Bush has said he strongly favors reducing taxes and
cutting the federal budget, and he did not discuss how he would pay
for the grants Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that test poorly, he added, would receive warnings. If
they continued to fail to show improvement for three years, the
Title I funds they receive would be divided up, matched by
additional federal money and given to the state. The state would
pass the money to the parents of the children in those schools _ as
much as $1,500 each per year _ and it could be used for tutoring,
switching the students to charter schools, semiautonomous public
schools, different public schools or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools
to cheat poor children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Effective reform requires accountability. Someone
should be praised when schools succeed, and someone must be
responsible when schools fail.'' He also insisted that, in spite of
the breadth of these federal initiatives, control over schools
would be placed largely in local hands, a policy that is central to
the conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for each state, and not the federal government, to
devise the standards by which each student would be measured, Bush
succeeded in allaying the fears of some conservatives who worry
about centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is betting where I personally always bet, that state
policy-makers and parents are likeliest to do right by kids,'' said
Chester E. Finn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, which
studies educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to emphasize that he would remain flexible in
certain respects. He said that he would back bilingual education,
something many conservatives have fought bitterly, particularly in
California, if it proved effective in the form of better test
scores. He also said that he would back language immersion programs
if they could be shown to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is not the varying methods, but the common
standards and goals,'' Bush said. ``The standard is English
literacy. The goal is equal opportunity.''

ESPN HAS CHANGED FANS' HABITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ There's the story of the priest who called ESPN
and asked that they show a Saturday night UCLA-Nebraska football
game at 6 p.m. because ``I have a 5 p.m. Mass and would have to
find a priest to replace me if you show it earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the wife in Austin, Texas, in the early '80s who
filed for divorce. She named ESPN a co-defendant because she said
her husband paid more attention to the all-sports cable network
than to her.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Sara Marie Dusendang, representing Michigan in
the Miss Teen USA pageant, was asked on the air: ``In your
generation, which has had the greatest impact: MTV, CNN or ESPN?''
</P>
<P>
   She picked ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   They might sound like urban myths, but what's amazing is that
they are all true.
</P>
<P>
   They're examples of how ESPN has altered the course of sports
during the past two decades and made a visible impact on American
culture and society.
</P>
<P>
   As a business, ESPN, carved out of a small New England town of
60,000 outside Hartford, Conn., helped ignite the explosion of
cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   It has affected sports rights fees, college recruiting and
scouting in ways considered both good and evil. It has given
nonmainstream sports a platform to show people what they've got.
</P>
<P>
   As a TV network, it has become a loyal friend.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago _ Sept. 7, 1979 _ the first ``SportsCenter''
show went on the air, although then it was known as ``Sports
Recap.'' Does anyone remember what life was like before that?
</P>
<P>
   Providing 24 hours of sports programming a day to fanatics who
schedule their work shifts, vacations, even wedding plans around
what's on the network is one thing. But the effect it has had on
their spouses, kids, friends and even perfect strangers is far more
revealing of today's human nature.
</P>
<P>
   There were just more than 1million homes with access to ESPN at
first _ most of the country didn't know cable TV existed. Today,
more than 76million homes take in more than 4,900 hours of live and
original programming a year from ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most-widely distributed basic cable network, slightly
higher than CNN. ESPN officials say they're unaware of any cable
system in the country that (begin ital)doesn't(end ital) have the
channel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sister stations formed
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, the company replicated itself in 1993 with a
second channel called ESPN2 that started in 9million homes and now
is in 65million. Three years after that came an all-news third
channel called ESPNEWS, available to 13million homes. A fourth
channel, ESPN Classic, was bought in '97 and is in 20million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that an ESPN International Network, broadcast in 21
languages to more than 160 countries. The most popular sports
Internet site on the Web, ESPN.com, belongs to them. So does the
ESPN Radio Network, ESPN The Magazine, a pager service, a computer
game and software division and a book publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   It went from losing $30million its first year and $41million in
Year No.3 to a company that, when it figured out cable companies
actually would pay to have ESPN on rather than vice versa, would
become the most profitable network in all of TV, making a reported
$1.6billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts estimate ESPN is worth $8billion as a subsidiary
of The Walt Disney Company, which purchased the 80percent majority
interest in ESPN that Cap Cities/ABC had in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like riding a booster rocket,'' said Chris Berman,
the anchor whose personality and charisma has been symbolic of the
network almost from the beginning. ``Twenty years really isn't that
long. But I think we've been ahead of our time a little bit on
every turn. We didn't just fill a void. We took a chance and we did
it for the right reasons. Maybe that's why it's been so
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ley, another 20-year man, suggests: ``We don't have viewers,
we have fans, and that's the key. People feel a kinship. You can't
walk into a restaurant _ or, now some are called sports bars _
without seeing ESPN on the TV sets. We've become a part of the
fabric as Americans embrace sports. I'd like to think we had a role
in creating that, for better or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what I do, this is mecca,'' said Bill Seward, an ESPNEWS
anchor the past three years who grew up in Sherman Oaks, attended
Notre Dame High and was a successful high school football coach in
Southern California before returning to a broadcast career he
started at Loyola Marymount University.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Family's brainchild
</P>
<P>
   When businessman-sports fanatic Bill Rasmussen and his son
decided to create a channel to televise the Hartford Whalers'
then-World Hockey League games and University of Connecticut
athletic events 20 years ago, it was definitely going against the
flow. The three major networks were putting on a combined 18 hours
of sports events every weekend and the public accepted it. Cable
was something for those who lived in areas that couldn't pick up
reception. Same with satellite dishes. VCRs were rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of cable was more a rural model that developed into
an urban television product, but I believed cable TV and national
sports made sense,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice
president of programming who came on board in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding impact wasn't so predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the medium was enhanced by having nearly 10 times
as many channels available. Society, already developing a fast-food
mentality, suddenly had an appetite for sports TV. Enough wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't need to live in Los Angeles any more to wonder how
the Dodgers were doing. ESPN told you. And showed highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson's mention of ESPN during a ``Tonight Show''
monologue in the mid-'80s was the only tangible evidence to those
in Bristol that someone was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Events like celebrity arm wrestling may have made up ESPN's
early programming logs, and Australian Rules Football strangely
gave the network its first word-of-mouth national exposure. But
once the NCAA men's basketball postseason tournament coverage
caught on in 1980, a year after the famed Larry Bird-Magic Johnson
final, the public soon became familiar with the phrase ``March
Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a balding character named Dick Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   ``College basketball has been phenomenal on TV, and I know I'm
biased with my passion, but it's true,'' said Vitale. ``It was no
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, CBS jumped on the rights to the postseason that ESPN
created and estimates are that the network will need to pay more
than $3billion to keep the tournament as negotiations on a new
contract continue.
</P>
<P>
   A month after doing the first tournament games, ESPN carried the
NFL draft, which sounded absurd because it was just a bunch of guys
on phones in a hotel. But ESPN made something of it, and got linked
to the NFL connection without any huge rights fees involved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Many high points
</P>
<P>
   College football followed in 1984. The America's Cup live
coverage overnight from Australia, when Dennis Connor was trying to
recapture the trophy in 1987, became a huge benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, basketball, hockey and _ finally _ the NFL, first for
a half season, now a full Sunday night regular-season package. In
the '90s, auto racing has been a huge success. Just two weeks ago,
ESPN registered its most-watched NASCAR event, the Pepsi 400 from
Brooklyn, Mich., pulling in a 5.3rating.
</P>
<P>
   Women's sports rarely had an outlet before ESPN came along.
</P>
<P>
   Women's NCAA basketball on ESPN went from a total of two games
in 1984 to a high mark of 63 in 1996, right after the Atlanta Games
and when ESPN took the championship game away from CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up about 30percent of the ESPN viewership. Just as
importantly, ESPN made a point to hire women and minorities to
cover sports, breaking away from the Anglo male image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first woman I ever saw anchor was on ESPN,'' said Chris
McKendry, an anchor and reporter who recently covered the Women's
World Cup Soccer tournament. ``Before it gave me a job, ESPN gave
me a role model. Women didn't have to be into sports to recognize
what it was doing, giving other women an option that was never
there. It was a great feeling of strength and equality, in addition
to making women's sports accessible to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   For sports heroes like Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and John
Elway, their careers were played out bigger than life from start to
finish on ESPN. Kids growing up knew not only what they looked
like, but could see practically every one of their performances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Highlight show the glue
</P>
<P>
   As the hourlong ``SportsCenter'' highlight shows scheduled
throughout the day acted as the glue holding the network schedule
together, sports was easy to digest. Observed political writer
George Will: ``If someone surreptitiously took everything but ESPN
from my cable television package, it might be months before I
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of `Honey, I Shrunk the Sports World,''' said
``SportsCenter'' anchor Dan Patrick, with the outfit for the past
10 years. ``We made it more manageable to follow teams and teams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable and ESPN has made America more nationally interested in
sports,'' said John Walsh, ESPN's executive editor. ``We've been
raised on collecting knowledge and then spewing it to friends at
work. Something like `SportsCenter' has become a document of sports
in the last quarter century. It's become a video history of what
sports is about and how it's played.''
</P>
<P>
   More so, the hip image it created was catching on with the
college-age audience who could watch at all hours. Starting with
Berman's litany of nicknames for athletes and Dick Vitale's
infectious college basketball jargon, it bled over onto the
``SportsCenter'' set, where the attitude and phrases of anchors
like Patrick, Keith Olbermann, Craig Kilborn and Stuart Scott were
mimicked by kids on the playground, as well as the men in the gyms.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first advertising slogans on cable was for the
all-music video station that started about the same time, telling
viewers to exclaim ``I want my MTV.'' More seemed to want ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   No cable operator can even consider taking it off for something
else, even as rising subscriber fees and cable bills have caused
some to consider making it a pay-per-view option someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's called a destination network,'' said John
Trierweiler, a vice president of marketing for Time Warner in the
west San Fernando Valley. ``If CNN created the `information'
channel, ESPN created the `sports' channel. It has a very loyal
audience. Taking it (off for something else) won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Programming glut?
</P>
<P>
   With ESPN's runaway success, growing pains came. Social
commentators debate whether its impact has been beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Are more sports events on TV a good thing? In his book
``Trivializing America _ The Triumph of Mediocrity,'' Norman Corwin
says that ``when sports are permitted to hog the (TV) listings,
which they often do, they become trivial in the same way that for
much of anything becomes surfeit and loses importance and value as
a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman contends: ``We'll know from viewers when enough is
enough. They're the ones who have to be more discerning. Yes,
sports are still special, but they used to be discerned for you. I
don't watch sports every night. I can't. But I do like to know it's
there if I want that option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we evolved and helped expose sports, the fans'
demands changed, (which) forced sports to evolve,'' said Norby
Williamson, ESPN's assistant managing editor and director of news.
``It's become such a different universe in such a short time. We
may have started the ride, but the fans have driven it.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, sports will never be the same because of what
ESPN started a mere two decades ago.

ESPN'S WORLD KEEPS GETTING BIGGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ After 20 years of establishing itself as the
self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports, ESPN's logo seems to
say enough.
</P>
<P>
   It used to stand for Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network. Now it's just ESPN Inc. At this point, that's about all it
thinks it needs to keep succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it brings some sort of financial gain to Disney, ESPN
says its vision of Tomorrowland will continue to be a commitment to
its fans. And brand identification plays a large part.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, ESPN's continued branching out will probably
mean move involvement in the Internet, which ironically has not
been a proven money-maker for many advertisers at this point in its
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to grow in ways we're able to interact with the
fans,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's senior vice president in charge of
programming. ``The convergence of computers and TV and the printed
word is where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each business unit of ESPN will grow. Will there be a day when
ESPN has the rights to everything? Yes, but I'm not sure if it's
the same configuration of the world today. Maybe it will be in a
digital universe that distributes all medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover's latest project is called Enhanced Television, or ETV.
The technology allows viewers of games on TV to access additional
information from a Web site while predicting plays and competing
against others. It debuted on ABC during last year's national
championship college football game and will be going through beta
tests this season on ESPN and ABC's NFL broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Two other services the company plans to offer are ESPNOW, an
out-of-market pay service, and ESPN Extra, another digital service
with Internet ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans' expectation level keeps going up, so we have to keep
putting the bar higher,'' said Glover.
</P>
<P>
   From Disney's marketing end, the ESPN name will perpetuate
though the third ESPN Zone restaurant, which opens Sept. 15 in New
York's Times Square. The 42,000-square foot, three-story eatery
will be duplicated next year in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., but
one for Los Angeles doesn't seem to be on the short list.
</P>
<P>
   It won't, however, continue with ESPN The Store. Disney
announced earlier this week that its three retail outlets in
Glendale, Torrance and Santa Ana would be closed as of Oct. 1
because sales were less than desirable. ESPN apparel and the like
will be pushed on ESPN's on-line store and its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   As for new events, the network that created its own Extreme
Games (now called the X Games, copied by NBC with its Gravity Games
scheduled to air next month) has an event planned for next year
called the Great Outdoors Games. That will include competition in
bass fishing, tree chopping, target shooting, archery and hunting
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Programming never seems to be out of ESPN's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The network's loyalty to the NHL has been renewed as Disney just
tied up the TV rights through 2004 and will do up to 200 games a
year on ESPN and ABC. College basketball and motor sports love what
ESPN has done for them in the past. Major League Baseball's future
commitment may be in peril as they go to court in November to
settle a dispute about Sunday night games that were moved from ESPN
to ESPN2 because of NFL commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Some feel ESPN's biggest problem in the future will be that it
spreads itself too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Someone used an analogy with Chris Berman, wondering ``if you're
the guy who starts out by making really good snow cones and
suddenly you start making hamburgers and other things, will the
snow cones continue to taste as good as they used to?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unbelievable effort to present our information with
the same heart today as we had 20 years ago,'' the ESPN studio host
said. ``We are owned by Disney and are more branded with the things
we do. If you don't branch out, maybe you don't know what you're
capable of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be smart and remember why we're here in the first
place. I like to think we still make pretty good snow cones.''

FOR CAPRIATI, SELES, TENNIS IS FUN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jennifer Capriati was angry _ and that was a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Down 6-5 in the first set of her second-round match Thursday,
Capriati took her seat during the changeover and listened to her
opponent complain to the chair umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to hold up my hand before every serve?'' Seda
Noorlander asked. ``She is serving too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after Noorlander lodged her complaint, Capriati shot
back an angry reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I go at my pace, you know,'' Capriati hissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can hold up her hand. Or hold up her racket if she's not
ready. But she has to play to the pace of the server.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati then stormed back onto the court _ only to drop the
final game and lose the first set.
</P>
<P>
   But then Capriati made a forceful move, ripping through the next
two sets to sweep into the third round of the U.S. Open with a 5-7,
6-1, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, pumping her fist, acknowledging the roar of the
grandstand crowd, Capriati beamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows, other than me, how hard it was to get
here,'' Capriati said after her victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the few years when I wasn't winning, I didn't have the
fight. If I lost the first set, I would just see it as a losing
battle, but now I'm in better shape, I feel I can run all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis matters again to Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   Her shoulders and arms are strong from pumping iron. She has the
ground strokes and the footwork and the game plan it takes to win,
thanks in large part to her work with coach Harold Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, Capriati's famous brown eyes have a steely
stare that, dare we say, reminds us of the court shark, Chris
Evert.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dangerous comparison, we understand, since the last time
Capriati was held up as the next American tennis princess, look
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Too much pressure. Too much, too soon. But that's an old story
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to talk about me now, not about the past,''
Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, with the way she snapped back to win Thursday, and
the way she won her first tournament this past spring at
Strasbourg, Capriati can let her game do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she meets Natalie Tauziat. After that, there could be a
fourth-round meeting with Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   No one would pick Capriati to get beyond Seles _ not the way
Seles is hitting the ball, and not with the way Seles says she is
back in love with tennis again.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have expected Capriati to make it this far?
</P>
<P>
   The Open may be the ideal place for Capriati to demonstrate her
newfound confidence. It was here in 1993 where Capriati's
well-publicized five-year meltdown began, when she lost a
first-round match and then walked out of tennis and into an
agonizing series of police-blotter blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific that she's trying to put her life back
together,'' Seles said after winning her own second-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still so young. She's a very tough competitor, and she
definitely has the game. I think it's terrific that she realizes
she needs to do things now and not wait too much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Capriati, Seles has been knocked from the highest reaches
of women's tennis, but while Capriati's troubles seemed all about
burnout and the emotional confusion of a rebellious American teen,
Seles was up against some truly serious stuff.
</P>
<P>
   There was the courtside stabbing at the hands of a madman who
sliced open her back, an attack which kept her off the court and
scared for years. There was the death of her father after an
agonizing bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the bombing of Seles' war-torn Yugoslavian
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't relate to Jennifer. I mean, it's hard for me because I
never had those problems,'' Seles said about the drug arrests of
Capriati four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But like Capriati, Seles has regained her love of tennis,
gushing that ``this might be the first time in my life that I've
had no outside problems, and it's really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this is not an Open in which Seles or Capriati are
picked to go all the way, not when Venus Williams and Lindsay
Davenport and Martina Hingis are the top seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been good to see Capriati and Seles regain the sense
of purpose that allows them to play up to their crowd-pleasing
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Seles is having fun again. Capriati is redirected toward success
on and off the court. Both developments are good for women's
tennis.

ESPN HAS FOXY COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ If ESPN started it all, Fox wants to have the
last word.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, without ESPN's ``SportsCenter,'' there probably
wouldn't be a Fox Sports News. But according to those who are the
prime competitors for cable-sports viewers, the trick for the
``little company that could'' is to keep its foothold in a very
slippery TV environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough to stay on top because TV is a business where
the genres go on but shows don't,'' said John Terenzio, the
executive producer of the Los Angeles-based Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   ``In TV, longevity is always a scary thing because you feel
eventually the run will end. The audience is constantly looking at
the new products that arise from the genre. To stay on top is very
hard, but that's the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN deserves the credit. They're a fantastic cable network
and have the strength to keep going strong. But they will have to
change with competition to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Fox Sports has spent more than $1
billion to build a regional sports network geared to do what ESPN
does and beyond. Its 22 regional cable stations reach 58million
homes compared to 76million for ESPN. The third major competitor,
CNN, also reaches 76million homes, but its sports-only CNN-Sports
Illustrated channel goes to only 15.2million homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one level, we're all the same for the viewer, just as the
nightly news is on CBS, NBC and ABC,'' said Terenzio. ``We try to
occupy along with a system set up over the prime-time hours that
delivers regional news, rather than having a single national
sportscast that repeats throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings clearly indicate there is room for both of us.
We're still going through a growth spurt. I think competition is
great for everyone. David Letterman and Jay Leno are better than if
just one of them were the ones to replace Johnny Carson. We see
ways they've adjusted to us. It's all the normal growth pattern.
And who benefits? The viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, ESPN tried to emulate Fox's regional blueprint.
Two years ago, it introduced plans to start ESPN West, which would
be the cable home for the Angels and Mighty Ducks. Three months
before its scheduled launch, the plans were scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN West's failure, industry analysts agree, is a large reason
Disney is about to sell both teams.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, meanwhile, has been a distant competitor to ESPN and Fox.
Although CNN established credibility first with its half-hour
sports-highlight shows inserted into an all-news format, the focus
has remained with national news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand we can get blown out by a live major sports
story _ they're the monster because they're all-sports,'' said CNN
anchor Bob Lorenz, who does many West Coast, 11 p.m. ``Sports
Tonight'' shows as well as anchoring NFL and NBA studio shows.
``They may have set a standard for sports programming, but there's
no reason to think we can't (do it) and often do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of those three cable beasts, local TV sportscasts
continue to become less and less important, unless they play their
strong hand _ coverage of local sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports News plans next year to add a local segment from its
22 regional channels incorporated into the national newscast. ESPN
hasn't revealed any plans to do the same but hasn't ignored that
aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't cover the depth of what goes on locally on our
`SportsCenter,' so that puts the challenge back on us,'' said Dick
Glover, ESPN's executive vice president of programming. ``Our goal
eventually is to be the one source for everything from a rec-league
schedule or college football's national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Seward, a former KCOP and KCBS sportscaster in Los Angeles,
went to ESPNEWS because he felt the career path was better laid
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way ESPN is pointed, it will be increasingly
difficult for local sportscasts to keep its audience,'' said
Seward. ``In certain markets, the local sportscaster can develop a
decent following, but the sportscast itself can't keep up when
there's a big dish beaming news 24 hours a day. Who are you going
to turn to?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 500-channel universe someday, with the way our lives go,
we don't have the ability to watch news at a scheduled time, but
something like ESPNEWS will be able to always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports News' most visible and vocal anchor, Keith Olbermann,
may have the most unique perspective on this subject, having worked
at both CNN and ESPN, plus in the Los Angeles market at KCBS and
KTLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the winner's right to (write) history, and
ESPN has been the one writing history,'' said Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in TV is reputation and inertia, and they have a
few more years to go to steer out of the skid they've been in. I
believe they're totally unprepared for the next wave that TV has to
adjust to. I see ESPN as already having peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is nationally dominant anymore. If I'm planning ESPN,
I'd have ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNEWS divide into an East, Central and
West time zone. Otherwise they might collapse under their own
national weight. Look what's happening to all news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN doesn't have a monopoly anymore. We can quibble about
who's got more viewers, whether it's a 5-to-1 ratio or 100-to-1.
But a year ago, no one talked about any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   They sure do now. &QL;

ESPN FINDS PERFECT HOME IN BRISTOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ Two miles off Connecticut Interstate 84, exit
33, the row of brick buildings with giant satellite dishes spread
out all over the lawn seems to jump out on the highway like some
sort of secret NASA control center.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be alarmed. It's only the self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader
in Sports making its presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   To locals, this is better known as ``The Mum City,'' after the
flowers that bloom here. Bristol is also home to the American Clock
and Watch Museum as well as the New England Carousel Museum. The
Lake Compounce amusement park down the road is the oldest in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a sports empire start here?
</P>
<P>
   Because about 20 years ago, a guy named Bill Rasmussen had an
idea for something called the Entertainment and Sports Programming
Network, and he was told Bristol would be a feasible place for it
to work.
</P>
<P>
   According to ESPN lore, Rasmussen, a former Hartford Whalers
publicist, bought a parcel sight unseen for $18,000 in this small
suburb of Hartford. By dumb luck, it turned out to be a perfect
place. Scientific Atlanta, which provided the satellite equipment,
told him a nearby mountain was perfect to shield airwaves from New
York (which is about two hours to the southwest) to New England.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, industry folk have wondered why ESPN execs
tend to bristle at the suggestion of leaving Bristol behind.
</P>
<P>
   When Getty Oil bought a huge piece of the dream early on, there
was talk of moving to Century City.
</P>
<P>
   Since Disney has been in charge the last three years, wouldn't
it make more sense to consolidate and move all this to Burbank with
everything else?
</P>
<P>
   Or what about staying in the East and moving down to Orlando,
Fla., at the DisneyWorld complex?
</P>
<P>
   Answers ESPN president George Bodenheimer: ``I'd be hesitant to
disturb something that isn't broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, ESPN has grown to like Bristol as much as the city has
liked the attention. With abundant land and plans to keep
expanding, the Bristol Campus (as the ESPN compound is called)
maintains a small-town, family atmosphere. Try doing that in a
10-story building next to the L.A. freeway system.
</P>
<P>
   The place that started with one building, three satellite dishes
and 70 employees now has seven buildings, 25 dishes and more than
2,100 on staff, scattered across 43 acres of former cow pastures
and mud swamps. There are now as many ESPN employees working in its
Argentina offices as there were in Bristol when the company
launched in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson used to make jokes about ``beautiful downtown
Burbank,'' but Bristol has been just as comically maligned. A city
that one-time ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann joking called a
Godforsaken place has been a God-send as far as Disney is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to want to work here,'' said ESPN anchor Dan Patrick.
``You're not here for the weather or the ambiance. Bristol is what
it is _ a blue-collar town with no beach. We're here to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here and living in central Connecticut is a great
blessing,'' said anchor Bob Ley, looking out his office window at
the mountains full of green trees. ``They don't allow you to get
enamored with yourself. The impact of what we do isn't thrown in
our face every day. It's easy to focus on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Seward, an ESPNEWS anchor for the last three years, grew up
in Sherman Oaks and attended Notre Dame High before heading out to
work in small towns as a local sportscaster. One of his stops was
in New Hampshire. But he also came back to Los Angeles to work at
KCOP-Channel 13 and KCBS-Channel 2 before deciding to go back east
to further his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big-city boy used to stores open all the time,'' said
Seward. ``Because I've been in this part of the country, it's not
such a culture shock anymore. This is a great setup if you're
married with kids. But single people like me have to made
adjustments. The perspective changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Jaffe, who hires all of ESPN's on-air talent as well as most
of the behind-the-scenes producers, realizes the city has some
limitations, but maintains Bristol is ``a destination spot'' for
those aspiring sports anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a lot of kidding, but California has also
mudslides and earthquakes,'' said Jaffe, a former TV news director
in San Jose and Sacramento. ``I don't think the career decisions
made here are based on geography or climate, urban or rural. People
are here to work, and they find out this is a pretty good place.''

ESPN PUTS ITS MARK ON HOLLYWOOD

<P>
   Some examples of how ESPN has become apart of the Hollywood
lexicon:
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   In ``There's Something About Mary'' (1998), Ted Stoehmann (Ben
Stiller) seems to give up on trying to impress Mary Jensen Matthews
(Cameron Diaz):
</P>
<P>
   Matthews: ``You wanna go upstairs and watch `SportsCenter?'''
</P>
<P>
   Stoehmann: ``Naw, I'll quit while I'm ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews: ``You're not that far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kingpin'' (1996), ESPN covers the bowling final between Roy
``The Rubber Man'' Munson (Woody Harrelson) and Ernie ``Big Ern''
McCracken (Bill Murray). An interview from the movie:
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reporter: ``So Roy, where have you been for the last 15
years?''
</P>
<P>
   Munson: ``Well, I uh, well, ya see, I uh... drinking. A lot of
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reporter: ``I see. Well, are you still drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Munson: ``No. I uh... I put... uh... why, you buying?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jerry Maguire'' (1996), ESPN's Mike Tirico and Mel Kiper
Jr. have cameos during the NFL draft scenes, while ``Up Close''
host Roy Firestone interviews Arizona Cardinals star Rod Tidwell
(Cuba Gooding Jr.) and, predictably, makes him get emotional and
cry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Coldblooded'' (1995), a dark comedy about a young
hit-man-in-training named Cosmo Reif (Jason Priestly) and his
mob-linked mentor named Steve (Peter Reigert) trying to teach him
the ropes:
</P>
<P>
   Steve: ``What are you doing tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo: ``I don't know. Guess I'l watch whatever game's on
ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve: ``You lead a very boring life.''
</P>
<P>
   (Long pause).
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forget Paris'' (1995), NBA referee Mickey Gordon (Billy
Crystal) describes his sports memorabilia-laden house as ``a shrine
to ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Days of Thunder'' (1994), NASCAR driver Cole Trickle (Tom
Cruise) explains his ability to car owner Harry Hogge (Robert
Duval):
</P>
<P>
   Hogge: ``What do you know about stock car racing?''
</P>
<P>
   Trickle: ``Well... watched it on television, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogge: ``You've seen it on television?!''
</P>
<P>
   Trickle: ``ESPN. The coverage is excellent. You'd be surprised
at how much you can pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogge: ``I'm sure I would.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Chris Berman appears as himself in six movies:
``Necessary Roughness'' (1991), ``The Program'' (1993), ``Little
Big League'' (1994), ``Celtic Pride'' (1996), ``Eddie'' (1996) and
``Kingpin'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Dick Vitale appears in six movies: As himself in ``He Got
Game'' (1998), ``The Sixth Man'' (1997), ``Blue Chips'' (1994) and
``Hoop Dreams'' (1994), as a court reporter named Hal Gibson in
``Jury Duty'' (1995) and as a baseball announcer in ``Naked Gun:
From the Files of Police Squad'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Dan Patrick appears as himself in ``The Definite Maybe''
(1997), ``BASEketball'' (1998) with Kenny Mayne and ``The
Waterboy'' (1998) with Lee Corso and Chris Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Robin Roberts appears as herself in ``He Got Game''
(1998) with Stuart Scott and in ``Tin Cup'' (1997) with Jimmy
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night,'' the ABC prime-time comedy-drama that premiered
last season, is based on creator Aaron Sorkin's infatuation of ESPN
``SportsCenter'' when it was co-hosted by Dan Patrick and Keith
Olbermann. It won the 1999 Television Critics Association Award for
Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``E.R.'' (1995), Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney) says it
as he's leaving the hospital: ``Tonight I want to sit in my
Barcalounger with my own can of beer and watch Irish hurling on
ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fox's ``Beverly Hills 90210'' (1995), Kelly Taylor (Jennie
Garth) is reading a list of 10 bad things about guys on campus. No.
5 is ESPN. Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestly) and Steve Sanders (Ian
Ziering) then sing the ESPN ``SportsCenter'' theme song:
``Da-Da-DAH, Da-Da-DAH.'' Brandon then asks: ``What about ESPN2?''

ROCKETS SHOOT PAST LIBERTY IN FIRST GAME OF WNBA CHAMPIONSHIP
SERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was deep into the game against the Liberty
Thursday night before it looked as if Houston guard Cynthia Cooper
had broken a sweat. By then the New York Liberty was out of breath,
out of gas and seemingly out of chances to subdue the Comets in the
first game of the Women's National Basketball Association
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had almost single-handedly run the Liberty ragged and
gave great pause to think about what will happen when this
best-of-3 series shifts to Houston this weekend. Cooper, who had 29
points, was the catalyst for the Comets' runaway 73-60 victory over
the Liberty before 17,113 at Madison Square Garden Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like I was unstoppable,'' Cooper said. ``I just
felt like my team needed me. I felt like I needed to put my team on
my shoulders in the second half when they made that run.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who was 10 of 10 from the free throw line, stepped up
her offense and defense and left the Liberty in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one in a million,'' Liberty forward Sue Wicks said. ``I
don't know anybody who can stop her on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   An infrequent basis would have helped the Liberty Thursday
night. The Comets, who shot only 44 percent from the field and were
outrebounded by the Liberty, 42-35, absorbed every wave and every
rally that the Liberty could throw at them and answered with a
drive to the basket here and a 3-point basket there to show why
they have won back-to-back WNBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty closed to within 38-35 on a 3-pointer by guard
Sophia Witherspoon _ who finished with 18 points to lead the
Liberty _ at 12 minutes 55 seconds of the second half. But that was
as close as the Liberty could come. Cooper ripped off eight points
in an 11-3 run that effectively closed out the Liberty's hope of a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were as aggressive as we were in the
Charlotte series,'' said Teresa Weatherspoon, who was held to five
points, but had 10 assists. ``I didn't attack the basket in the
first half. In the second half, I started to attack the basket, but
they were up by then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had come back from a 1-0 deficit in the Eastern
Conference championship to win two in a row and the series from
Charlotte, but this series will prove much more difficult. Houston
is the best team in the league, and in order for the Liberty to win
the WNBA championship, New York must take two games from the Comets
in Houston. The Comets have never lost a playoff game at home and
have lost only two games there in the last two seasons. Their
present streak is 14 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York will come back Saturday and play very good,'' Comets
coach Van Chancellor said. ``They've got a lot of pride and they're
a veteran team with playoff experience. If they were young, it
might be different. I think this is a team that will come back
fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty coach Richie Adubato hopes that the three officials who
worked Thursday night's game won't be in Houston Saturday. Adubato
thought the referees let the Comets get away with too much physical
play and that the Liberty didn't get the calls. Adubato got hit
with a technical foul for complaining about the officiating at
19:09 of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were struggling,'' Adubato said. ``You have to be able to
get a foul shot every now and then. We know there are some pretty
good people out there. We hope the league will send us three pretty
good people for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Liberty has no one to blame but its own players.
The New York defense could not slow Cooper. And the Comets were
able to get 15 points from guard Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   In the decisive Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals against
Charlotte last Sunday, the Liberty had set a playoff record in
field-goal percentage by shooting 55 percent. Thursday night,
however, the Liberty was not as proficient.
</P>
<P>
   On a couple of occasions, guard Sophia Witherspoon, who scored
nine first-half points, drove to the basket and had her shots fall
off the lip of the rim. The Liberty finished the game shooting 40.7
percent from the field, but hit only 5 of 18 from 3-point range. It
was the first time in three games that the Liberty was held below
50 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing,'' Weatherspoon said, ``is that our backs
have been to the wall all season long, and now our backs are
against the wall again.''  &QL;

NEW YORK _ The question: What team is within one victory of
claiming its third straight WNBA championship?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is the Comets. On Thursday night, the
Comets had an answer for everything the New York Liberty threw at
them. The result?
</P>
<P>
   A 73-60 victory before a Madison Square Garden crowd of 17,114
that put the Comets in position to wrap up another title Saturday
when the best-of-three series shifts to Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, who have been amazing through a tragedy-filled
season, used a stifling defense to dispose of the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Defense and Cynthia Cooper's 29-point explosion made Thursday's
game easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge, to get this first game,'' squealed Tina
Thompson. ``This is the first time for us. This is definitely very
big. It does take a lot of pressure off you.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times the Comets have started a best-of-three playoff
series on the road. This is the first time they have returned home
with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty coach Richie Adubato blamed his team's problems on what
he called a poorly officiated game. The Comets made 23 of 29 foul
shots while the Liberty was 7-of-15 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have given the people an excellent game if we had
gotten any kind of calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the Liberty's inability to thwart Cooper, Thompson
and Sheryl Swoopes probably had more to do with the outcome. Cooper
scored 20 points in the second half and had 10 in a span of 3:21
immediately after the Liberty had cut a 15-point deficit to 38-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we try to put the ball in her hands,'' said coach
Van Chancellor. ``Give the ball to Coop, watch her work her magic,
then sit back and reap the rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Cynthia Cooper is great at what she does,'' New York's
Sophia Witherspoon said. ``She lulls you to sleep. You know what
she is going to do, but when she lulls you to sleep, she is so
quick at doing it that she just blows by you.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, Thompson and reserve center Tammy Jackson all came up
big. Thompson, who was excellent in keeping the Liberty's Sue Wicks
in check, scored 11 points and had three assists and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson came off the bench and was a terror on the boards,
grabbing eight rebounds to go with her five points. Swoopes
squeezed in 15 points and threw a net over the Liberty's 3-point
ace, Crystal Robinson, holding her to 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one area of our game tonight that we wanted to focus on
was playing really good team defense,'' Swoopes said. ``We didn't
want to allow any of their players to go off. Obviously, Crystal
Robinson's a huge part of their offense, and Kym Hampton and Vickie
Johnson. And I thought overall we just played really good team
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon came off the bench to lead New York with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, with the Comets shadowing at every turn, missed
seven of its first eight shots and turned the ball over 10 times in
the first half. Five times in the opening period, the Comets forced
New York to use all but the final seconds on the 30-second clock.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Thompson and a pair of free throws by Cooper gave
the Comets an 18-7 lead midway through the half.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon scored four points to bring the Liberty within
22-18. A 3-pointer by Sonja Henning (eight points) answered that
rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were up 29-20 at the break, then used a 3-pointer by
Cooper, a fast-break layup by Swoopes and a free throw by Cooper
after a technical foul on Adubato to bump the lead to 35-20.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-3 run by the Liberty brought New York within 38-35. Cooper
then grabbed the game by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt at that point, I needed to step up
offensively,'' said Cooper, who was 8-for-16 from the field and
10-for-10 from the free-throw line, with six assists and four
steals. ``I really had been trying to pass the ball and get my
teammates involved earlier and really show a different part of my
game. At that point, when they came within three points, I just
felt I had to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicks said, ``Cooper is one in a million. I don't know anybody
that can stop her on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just try to stop someone else, I mean Sheryl
Swoopes went on a little tear on us from the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two people like that are dropping them on you, it is
really tough. So it was not just Coop; they had a nice team game
tonight.''

COWBOYS LOSE, BUT AVOID SERIOUS INJURIES TO STARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In a game that was all about staying healthy,
the Cowboys were able to declare a moral victory. The Texas Stadium
scoreboard reported otherwise, of course _ Jacksonville 27, Dallas
6 _ but with the regular-season opener at Washington only nine days
away, the Cowboys needed to get out of last night's preseason
finale without any serious injuries among their starting players.
Mission accomplished, although the Cowboys finished the preseason
1-4. Mission accomplished, although the first-team offense scored
only three touchdowns and three field goals in five starts. There
was one very scary moment on the second play of the game last night
when Flozell Adams nearly turned this otherwise meaningless game
into Fright Night for the Cowboys. The 6-foot-7, 335-pound starting
left tackle went face-down on the artificial turf with a sprained
left knee, but the injury is not believed to be serious. Adams was
evaluated on the sideline and might have been able to return to the
game, but he was held out for precautionary reasons. Adams'
replacement, Tony Hutson, filled in adequately, but the Cowboys do
not want to go into the Washington game a week from Sunday with
anyone except Adams protecting Troy Aikman's blind side. Neither
does Aikman, who went through the preseason without being sacked.
``Offensively, our goal tonight was to get in and out of here with
a minimal amount of guys getting banged up,'' Aikman said. ``It
looks like Flozell is going to be OK.'' Right guard Everett McIver
had a rough night, as he was penalized twice for false starts. On a
third-and-one from the Cowboys40, Jacksonville left defensive
tackle Gary Walker came through and slammed Chris Warren for a
2-yard loss. The Cowboys' first-team offense went scoreless in two
possessions last night, but Aikman said he wasn't terribly
concerned. ``We didn't spend enough time on the field to get a real
evaluation of how the first team performed,'' said Aikman, who
completed 2 of 5 passes for 25 yards. ``I am encouraged with what
we're capable of doing in terms of moving the ball. ... I'm excited
about getting the season started.'' The household names were long
gone before any of the stragglers, now able to tail-gate outside
Texas Stadium, could turn off their grills and find their seats.
And most of the crowd was represented by empty blue chairs in the
fourth quarter. Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin were done
for the night with slightly less than nine minutes left in the
first quarter. Both series were mostly uneventful, with the
exception being a 24-yard pass play from Aikman to Raghib
``Rocket'' Ismail on a deep crossing route that looked like vintage
Steve Young to Jerry Rice. On the catch, Jacksonville strong safety
Donovin Darius was in the same zip code as Ismail, but barely.
Among the Cowboys receivers, rookies Wane McGarity and MarTay
Jenkins, along with first-year receiver Jason Tucker from TCU,
continued to make it difficult for the coaches to set the final
53-man roster, which needs to be done by Sunday. Another highly
competitive position is defensive tackle, which Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones has termed ``my biggest concern right now ... inside against
the run.'' Jacksonville had 482 yards of total offense, including
164 yards on the ground. There were some plays inside by NFL Europe
standout agent Brandon Noble and 6-foot-7 Darren Benson, along with
wide-body Nathan Davis and second-year veteran Michael Myers, who
was given the job of replacing Leon Lett at the start of preseason.
Rookie Dat Nguyen was an early replacement for starting middle
linebacker Randall Godfrey, who already had a sprained ankle.
Nguyen played well in his extended playing time. The Cowboys
finished up feebly as they netted 1 yard in the fourth quarter with
Mike Quinn at quarterback. But then again, the Cowboys were able to
mount only two scoring drives all night: two 41-yard field goals by
Richie Cunningham. ``It was not a good-looking effort,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. ``We played hard but not our hardest'' of the
preseason. The Jaguars, who are picked by many to represent the AFC
in Super Bowl XXXIV, opened the scoring with an 88-yard punt return
by Reggie Barlow for a touchdown. Barlow zigged and zagged through
a maze of white jerseys, scoring with 11:09 left in the first
quarter. The Cowboys still haven't touched him. Jacksonville's
Tavian Banks spoiled a decent goal-line stand by the Cowboys,
scoring on third-and-goal from the Dallas 1 midway through the
third quarter, giving the Jaguars a 17-0 lead. The only second-half
touchdown was scored by Jacksonville on a 9-yard pass from
second-string quarterback Jay Fiedler to Will Moore.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ Based on public reaction this week, you would think
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan had benched John Elway rather than
Bubby Brister.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're talking about Bubby Brister, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   The media and fans have been blistering Shanahan since he gave
Brister the bad news Monday that he was being replaced as the
Broncos' starting quarterback by Brian Griese. The indignation is
thicker than smog. Shanahan is being portrayed as some quarterback
rube who lacks a conscience and doesn't fully understand what it
takes to play the position.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but the last time we checked, Shanahan had led the
Broncos to back-to-back Super Bowl victories. After tonight's last
preseason game against the 49ers, they get serious about becoming
the first team in history to win three consecutive Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan didn't do what Vince Lombardi, Chuck Noll and Jimmy
Johnson did by being stupid. Shanahan and offensive coordinator
Gary Kubiak are two of the best quarterbacks coaches in the NFL.
They know better than any fan or reporter what it takes to play the
most important, glamorous and pressure-packed position in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Brister was not happy with the decision. He thought
about walking out on his teammates, coaches and fans but wisely
reconsidered and returned to practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a podium in the media room at the Broncos' practice facility,
Brister blasted Shanahan, who has such complete control of the
organization and has instilled such military-style discipline in
his players that his authority isn't questioned often, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan got ripped by one of his subordinates, and it
wasn't pretty. Check that. It was pretty ugly.
</P>
<P>
   During his diatribe, Brister stopped short of calling Shanahan a
liar, but everyone in the room got his point _ he thought his head
coach had lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   The way Brister figured it, there was no competition for the
starting job. He was secure. So what if Brister stunk it up in the
preseason and Griese played like his father, Bob Griese, who is in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, if Brister had known they were competing for the No. 1
job, he would have been more careful and not thrown interceptions
on his first pass in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Get real. The Broncos are trying to three-peat. There's no room
for sentiment. Right or wrong, Shanahan is paid millions to make
decisions he thinks will help the Broncos win. Owner Pat Bowlen
will give Shanahan anything he wants, and all he has to do is win.
</P>
<P>
   Brister should be more grateful. After all, he is a 37-year-old
journeyman who was rescued from the quarterback scrap heap by
Shanahan in 1997 after other teams had deleted his telephone number
from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so bad for Brister in 1996 that he returned to
Louisiana, sat out the season and pondered his next career move.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the recommendation of a former teammate in
Philadelphia, Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, Shanahan reached
into the trash can, pulled out Brister's resume, shook off the
coffee grounds and put in a call to a quarterback no one else
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   After a tryout, Shanahan made an offer that Brister accepted. It
was a wise move by both of them.
</P>
<P>
   As Elway's backup, Brister posted a 5-0 record in two seasons,
including 4-0 last year when Elway was injured. Brister became one
of those great American success stories, the feel-good kind that
make us warm all over.
</P>
<P>
   When Elway finally retired, Brister was elevated into the most
visible position in the state, and that includes the governor's
office. Brister seemed to relish the role. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Brister was replacing a legend. But Brister was admired
and respected because he had achieved such distinction the hard
way. He wasn't a first-round pick or a multimillionaire free agent.
No, Brister was a blue-collar survivor who said and did all the
right things. It made for what appeared to be a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Until the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   We can debate all day whether Shanahan handled the situation
correctly. Perhaps Brister did deserve to start a few
regular-season games, but what if the Broncos started badly and
failed to recover enough to earn the home-field advantage in the
playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   As Shanahan pointed out, the decision wasn't made just on
Brister's performance in preseason games. The offseason program and
training camp were taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Shanahan said he thought Brister was more suited
to coming off the bench. He called Brister a warrior. He said he
would want Brister behind him in a street fight.
</P>
<P>
   What Shanahan didn't say is that he thinks Griese has a chance
at greatness. Not good or real good. Great.
</P>
<P>
   If Griese struggles, as many close to the Broncos believe he
will at first, Shanahan can return him to the backup role to reduce
the pressure while he continues the learning process.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brister can be promoted again. Going from backup to
starter is a role that fits Brister, one that he has played since
he entered the league with Pittsburgh. He has been up and down more
than a roller coaster. Brister has been called a lot of things in a
mediocre career, but he never has been called a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan knows what makes Brister tick. Brister may explode like
a bomb with a short fuse, but he also can gather himself quickly,
fade into the background and go about his business of preparing for
the time when his next opportunity comes.
</P>
<P>
   And that time will come.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great coaches, Shanahan is a psychologist, too. He
knows when his players need to be patted on the back and when they
need to be kicked in the butt.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan put on his steel-toed boots this week and gave a kick
that made Jason Elam envious. The public outcry continues to
reverberate through the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   If you're betting on Shanahan or Brister, the smart money says
you've got to like Mike.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros' mostly abominable Mets series was revealing. It told us
exactly how helpless and vulnerable they are when the starting
pitching breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   The season, heretofore one of somewhat miraculous proportions
given the resilience they have shown in the face of a numbing run
of misfortunes, has 27 games left, period, if what we saw was the
beginning of a trend, as opposed to a temporary hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: They can't make the playoffs that way.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Even should they by accident, they won't go very far.
</P>
<P>
   New York rather clearly established that the Astros' most viable
route to the postseason will be as division champions. The Mets,
for all practical purposes, have slammed the wild-card door shut on
Houston's foot by hammering out 21 hits one night and 18 more two
nights later. Although their lead over the Astros is only 2{ games
with a month to go, it's hard to picture them _ much less the
surging Braves _ making a U-turn.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, suddenly every day is (Bobby) Valentine's Day. If not
for Jose Lima's applying a tourniquet between the two merciless
killings, the Astros would be free-falling into Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   But enough gloom and doom. The good news is obvious: Mike
Hampton takes the mound tonight. The same Mike Hampton who hasn't
pitched a bad game since May 30, which was the only bad game he had
pitched since his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6-0 since the All-Star break and, at 17-3 overall,
possesses the flashiest winning percentage in either league at
present, a few points north of Boston's Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hampy receives only a slight nod over Lima _ 18-7
total, 3-0 of late _ as the Astros' current staff ace. And Shane
Reynolds, his most recent outing notwithstanding, ain't exactly
chopped liver occupying the third spot.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we still must like the Astros' odds of turning the
Astrodome's final days into happy ones. It's as simple as one, two,
three. You can't feel bad about taking your chances in September's
sprint to the finish line with a rotation of Hampton, Lima and
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker already has penciled in his rotation for the rest
of the way. He can't, or won't, recount it from memory, but there's
a possibility the aforementioned will receive as many as 19 of the
27 starts, if the tightness of the Central race mandates same. Each
figures to be asked to pitch at least once on three days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine with me,'' Reynolds said. ``Sure, I've done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Hampton said. ``It's time to suck it up and put
everything on the line. You can't afford to be tired now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the spirit, lads.
</P>
<P>
   What Dierker will own up to is that Lima and Hampton will pitch
against the Reds in the last week, and that all three will go
against the Dodgers on the closing weekend, leaving Reynolds, by
logical deduction, to start the first game of the playoffs _
hopefully, opposite anyone except the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   He was 14-9 with a 3.47 ERA until a week ago, after which
back-to-back starts vs. the New Yorkers saw Shane as in shame
surrender 18 hits and 11 earned runs in 9 desultory innings,
resulting in two additional L's on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Scott Elarton and Chris Holt, the fourth and fifth
starters, will be asked to shore up a bullpen that is in dire need
of shoring up. Elarton, in particular, should profit personally,
given the tendinitis gnawing at his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate scheduling will aid and abet Dierker's plan to put the
ball in the hands of Hampton, Lima and Reynolds as much as possible
in September. The Astros have four days off between the middle of
the month and the end of the season (Oct. 3), plus one more before
the first playoff game, assuming a sudden-death showdown isn't
needed to decide the division race.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton may have seven starts left, counting the one tonight,
while Lima and Reynolds may get six each. Surely, then, Hampton and
Lima can each win 20 games. Were Shane also to reach 20, albeit a
long shot now, surely the Astros would easily win the Central.
</P>
<P>
   If none of them do? Curtains for certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the way we've been playing,'' Dierker
said, ``but you have to be realistic. We don't have our whole team
out there. When you have the three starters we do, though, you feel
like you always have a chance to stop a (losing) streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly stated, the Big Three plus little Billy Wagner hold the
Astros' fate in their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the challenge,'' Lima said. ``I want to be a horse
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Good. Because, chances are, it's going to be a horse race.

NORTH TEXAS' MISTAKES COSTLY AS UNLV BREAKS LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ The mistakes seemed to pile one on top of
the]one another last night, much as one would expect from two teams
with a combined three victories in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For Nevada-Las Vegas, it was a blocked extra point and two
fumbles in the opponent's end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   For North Texas, the miscues were larger and much more damaging.
A missed field goal. A blocked field goal. A personal foul on a
field goal that negated the kick and set up a touchdown, followed
by an interception return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was not only UNT having more _ and bigger _
mistakes, but the fact that the Rebels committed all theirs in the
first half, including two lost fumbles. After taking a slim 3-point
lead into the half, UNLV played mistake-free during the second
half, ending its 16-game losing streak with a 26-3 victory in the
season opener for both teams at Fouts Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many mental mistakes,'' UNT running back Ja'Quay
Wilburn said. ``If we're going to be a good football team, we can't
make them. I expect a lot of sprints on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles are running hard at the next practice, it won't be
because of Wilburn. The junior from Odessa rushed for a game-high
113 yards on 22 carries, marking his fourth consecutive 100-yard
rushing game.
</P>
<P>
   But even Wilburn couldn't help the Eagles overcome their
mistakes, which started with a motion penalty on their second drive
that, two plays later, forced a missed 51-yard field goal attempt
by Jason Ball.
</P>
<P>
   After a 9-yard touchdown run by UNLV's Jeremi Rudolph in the
second, the Rebels blocked a 41-yard Ball attempt. Ball answered,
however, by hitting a 24-yarder as time expired in the half,
cutting the UNLV lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams stayed there into the fourth quarter when the
Rebels put together the scoring drive that proved to be the
difference. After stalling at the UNT 6, UNLV settled for a 23-yard
field goal by Tim O'Reilly. However, O'Reilly was hit by a UNT
defender, and UNLV coach John Robinson opted to take the points off
the board and take the first down.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off as Rudolph went in from the 3 on the next play,
turning what would have been a 6-point UNLV lead into a 13-3
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only up by 6, so we had to do that,'' Robinson said.
``If they score and kick one, they wouldn't let me fly home with
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That turnaround started the snowball for UNT. Down by 10 with 10
minutes remaining, the Eagles were forced into a passing mode. UNLV
knew that, and Kevin Thomas stepped in front of a Jason Attaway
pass on third-and-10, returning the interception 49 yards for a
touchdown and a 19-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It \Rthe penalty and touchdown\S was really irrelevant since
we didn't get a score,'' UNT coach Darrell Dickey said. ``But it
did change our thinking a little bit.
</P>

QUICK CHANGE: DALLAS STARS WILL REVAMP OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars will begin using a new form of offense
this season that is designed to take advantage of improved
quickness, coach Ken Hitchcock said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   By adding players such as Juha Lind, Blake Sloan, Pavel Patera,
Derek Plante and Jon Sim and dropping older veterans such as Pat
Verbeek, Dave Reid and Tony Hrkac, the Stars will be able to try to
create more offense with a game that will stress passing. Hitchcock
said the Stars will institute the strategy change ``from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance with just two or three new players up front
to really change our game and really stretch some people out with
quickness,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're going to be a team that uses
direct passes rather than just jam \Rthe puck\S in and then try to
chip it out.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans, that should mean a much more exciting brand of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the dump-and-chase style in which defensemen simply
chip the puck in with the hope that their forward teammates will
recover it, the Stars plan to take advantage of the passing skills
of players like Sergei Zubov and Mike Modano to make plays entering
the offensive zone. That, in theory, could result in more
one-on-one scoring opportunities on breakaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means making a lot more lateral plays and coming out of the
zone similar to the way Detroit comes out of the zone,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings have been known as a highly skilled team for years
and have taken advantage of their ability to control the puck. But
can the Stars change just like that? And should they mess with the
plan that won them a Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk involved, but we're willing to take a step back
for that potential upside,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're going to have
different personnel this year and we have to adjust to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Stars' defensemen also will try to make more
plays in the offensive zone, ``activating'' when the team is in
possession of the puck. That's a direct result of the Stars being
able to recover from mistakes because of their improved team speed,
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will retain the same in-your-face forechecking system
without the puck, Hitchcock said, in hopes of putting pressure on
opposing teams and forcing more turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars conclude their two-day rookie camp today at the Dr
Pepper StarCenter in Irving, take physicals tomorrow and will be on
the ice in Vail, Colo., on Sunday morning for their first official
workout of training camp. \Nsubheds:Keane to wear `A` Winger Mike
Keane will take over as the fourth alternate captain in place of
defenseman Craig Ludwig, who announced his retirement this week.
Keane will join Joe Nieuwendyk, Mike Modano and Sergei Zubov as
alternate captains in support of captain Derian Hatcher. The Stars
use two alternate captains for each game. \Nsubheds:Team awards
Mike Modano won the Bill Masterton Award as Most Valuable Player on
the Stars for the fifth time in the past seven seasons, the Stars
announced yesterday. Modano was selected in a vote by Stars
players.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher was given the Memorial Cup as top defenseman, and
Grant Marshall was selected Most Improved in a vote by local media.
Brent Severyn was given the Community Service Award by the Stars
front office.
</P>
<P>
   No player qualified for the team's Rookie of the Year Award.

BERG AGREES TO TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aki Berg officially is returning to the Kings and the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old defenseman and the Kings agreed to terms
Thursday on the one-year deal that had been all but finalized since
last weekend. Berg will receive $762,500 this season. Bonuses could
push his salary higher.
</P>
<P>
   The base salary, however, falls $137,500 shy of what Berg said a
week ago was the minimum he'd be willing to play for on a one-year
contract. But Berg, who played last season in his native Finland
when he and the Kings couldn't strike a deal, decided to capitulate
so he could return to the NHL. He and his representatives became
convinced the Kings would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Berg will be with the Kings when they report Saturday, and when
they step onto the ice for the first time Sunday for the start of
training camp. It is uncertain whether the same can be said of
right wing Glen Murray and defenseman Mattias Norstrom, the last
two significant unsigned players.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are believed to be closer to reaching a deal with
Murray ($675,000 last season) than with Norstrom ($900,000).

THE CLINTONS SETTLE ON ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE

(DW) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
on Thursday settled the question of where the first family will
live once their lease on the White House expires, signing a
contract to purchase a a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home
set in the wooded suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a home in New York removes one of the chief
obstacles in Mrs. Clinton's path as she prepares for a run for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, indebted by over $5 million in legal bills that
have accumulated because of the legal inquires that have marked the
Clinton presidency, were able to purchase the five-bedroom home in
Chappaqua after Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe,
personally secured the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that McAuliffe had put up $1.35 million of
his own money with Bankers Trust. Under the terms of the mortgage,
McAuliffe will receive the money back, with interest, once the
Clintons either pay back the mortgage or, as is more likely,
refinance it in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate on the loan is to be determined at closing,
which is set for Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of where the Clintons would live was announced in
a three-paragraph statement issued by the temporary Press Office of
the White House _ a room in the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about seven
miles from the Clintons are vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently concludes what has certainly been one of the more
unusual house-hunting expeditions embarked on by any American
family, complicated by the Clintons' station in life, the fact that
they have not owned a home in 16 years, and Mrs. Clinton's
political ambitions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased about the house,'' Mrs. Clinton said as she
left a fund-raiser for her presumed Senate campaign Thursday
evening in Cazenovia and headed to another one in Syracuse. ``It's
beautiful. We like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, emerging from the Syracuse fund-raiser, Mrs. Clinton
declared to cheers: ``As of today, Bill Clinton and I are the
newest homeowners in the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' she added, ``we're so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a house came after the Clintons, trailed by a
presidential-size entourage of assistants, Secret Service agents
and reporters, toured homes in New Rochelle, Greenberg, Purchase,
Mamaroneck and Pound Ridge, all in Westchester County. They spent
two hours in the Chappaqua house last Saturday; Mrs. Clinton had
seen the home before, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about this was normal _ except that they are the
first family,'' said Kathy Sloane, a broker with Brown Harris
Stevens in Manhattan, who guided the Clintons through the process.
</P>
<P>
   The house was shown to the public for only three days. After
that, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife Cheryl, who have owned the
home for just over 18 years, invited closed bids on the house. The
bids were opened at 3 p.m. on Sunday, and the Clintons were
informed shortly thereafter that the Weisbergs were prepared to
sell to them, according to family associates.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bids were submitted on the house, according to family
associates. It was unclear last night whether the Clintons, who
offered just over the $1.675 million asking price, had made the
highest bid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear sense of relief Thursday among Mrs. Clinton's
political advisers, who are concerned that charges of carpetbagging
could hurt the first lady, since she has never lived in New York.
Her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, traveled to
Arkansas to underscore the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has begun to visit New York regularly, but her
trips have been marred by images that have made her campaign
advisers wince _ of her either leaving to return to Washington, or
spending the night as a guest of friends and supporters.
Accordingly, the first lady's advisers have been pressing her to
settle on a house as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The closing date is Nov. 1. Mrs. Clinton's aides said the first
lady would begin spending a good amount of time there as soon as
possible after that. (One complication of the Clintons' nomadic
ways is that they don't have enough of their own furniture to fill
a house, particularly one this size, a friend of the family said.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that for the
remainder of Clinton's term, the president and Mrs. Clinton
intended to treat their Chappaqua home much the way other First
Families have treated their own private residences. ``The Clintons
will continue to live in the White House,'' Lockhart said in a
telephone interview from Washington. ``As with other presidents,
this house will be their private home and they will spend as much
time there as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   New York elections tend to be decided in the suburbs, which Mrs.
Clinton will now call home. But Mrs. Clinton's aides said that
while political considerations entered the Clintons' deliberations,
they were not predominant. That said, the Clintons clearly avoided
communities like Scarsdale and Bedford, which are well-known across
New York as among the state's wealthiest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chappaqua, if not quite as well-known as Scarsdale, is
known as one of the more exclusive, and upper-middle-class, bedroom
communities of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the Clintons will put down $350,000
on the $1.7 million house, drawn from their blind trust, Lockhart
said. That represents a down payment of about 20 percent. The
remaining financing comes in the form of a securities-backed
mortgage from Bankers Trust for $1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the collateral on the loan is $1.35 million put up
by McAuliffe. Thus, this transaction seems to assure McAuliffe, who
is already one of the president's closest friends and supporters, a
significant role in Clintons' financial life after he leaves
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has a reputation Washington as a singularly effective
fund-raiser, and he is largely credited with the fund-raising
successes of both Clinton and the Democratic Party during Clinton's
years in office. The fact that the president and Mrs. Clinton
turned to him now is hardly a surprise: McAuliffe is already
serving as the key fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's presumed Senate
race, the president's legal defense fund, and a $10 million
millennium celebration the Clintons are planning for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has amassed a personal fortune through his investments
in a home-building firm, a title insurance firm and a mortgage
servicing firm. Thursday night, he was at the Clintons' side again
as they raised money in Syracuse, where, as it turns out, McAuliffe
grew up. He told reporters there that he had ``no closer friends
than the president and the first lady.'' The secured-mortgage
arrangement was described by other real estate brokers last night
as slightly unusual, but not unheard of. Most of all, it seemed a
reflection of the Clintons' financial bind: Notwithstanding the
obvious earning potential of an ex-president, White House aides
said the family had assets of just over $1 million and legal debts
of about $5.2 million. As a result, one of the president's
associates said, banks were a little bit wary about providing such
a large a mortgage without some extra security.
</P>
<P>
   This loan is a five-year balloon mortgage, which means that the
Clintons will have to refinance (or pay back the entire amount) in
five years. It is an adjustable rate that can change every six
months, and will equal one point above the London Interbank Offered
Rate, which is the rate that the most credit-worthy international
banks charge each other for large loans.
</P>
<P>
   The current rate is 5.52 percent. Based on this, the Clintons
would pay an interest rate of 6.52 percent. That would mean a
monthly mortgage payment of either $7,335 or $8,550, depending on
whether the Clintons have an interest-only balloon mortgage or one
that includes principal payments as well. In addition, the
estimated property taxes are $25,922 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the White House counsel's office had ruled
that McAuliffe's guarantee did not fall under the provisions of
federal gift reporting laws and thus did not have to be listed on
the Clintons' annual disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,
said he could not comment on whether that would change if the
Clintons defaulted on the loan, and McAuliffe lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothetical question, and I don't have an answer to
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Clinton home is 5,232 square feet on 1.1 acres at the
end of a cul-de-sac at 15 Old House Lane. Built in 1899, it has
five bedrooms, four bathrooms and a pool. There is also a barn
perched on the back lawn, which is likely to be taken over by a
Secret Service detail. .
</P>
<P>
   Chappaqua is a wealthy hamlet in the town of New Castle, known
for its public school system, which is regarded by many as the best
in Westchester. Right in the center of Westchester, Chappaqua is
where the county begins to feel more semi-rural than suburban, with
densely wooded lanes, the occasional meadow and larger properties
than are found in southern Westchester. But it is still within a
reasonable commuting distance of midtown Manhattan, 38 miles south.
</P>
<P>
   Chappaqua has gone from being largely Republican to
predominantly Democratic. As of 1998, there were 4,630 registered
Democrats, 3,343 registered Republicans and 2,881 registered
independents.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Chappaqua got a taste of how life might change
in the quiet village almost as soon as the White House made the
announcement: television satellite trucks pulled up outside the
house, as reporters began asking people their thoughts on their new
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's cool,'' said JoAnn Gorman, as she sat down to a
pizza dinner near the train station with her husband, Marty. ``I
voted for him twice. I just get a kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorman, a lawyer with Kraft foods, was not so sure. ``I
wonder if it's going to cost the town in terms of police and if
there will be a lot of curiosity seekers,'' he said. ``But he's
entitled to live wherever he wants.''

L.B. STATE FORTUNATE TO HAVE GIMMILLARO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a late Wednesday afternoon on the first day of September,
1,642 spectators showed up at the Pyramid to watch Brian
Gimmillaro's defending national champion Long Beach State women's
volleyball team open its season against Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice turnout for a 4 o'clock match,'' said the Prez,
Dr. Robert (Fightin' Bob) Maxson, an interested courtside
spectator.
</P>
<P>
   All the school's high-profile personages were present for the
long-awaited debut of Misty May's successor, Brittany Hochevar,
including the lovable AD, Bill Shumard, the two head basketball
coaches, Wayne Morgan and Dallas Boychuk-Bolla, Maxson's top
lieutenant, Armando Contreras, Shumard's alter ego, Don (Mr. Long
Beach State) Dyer and Morgan's dashing new assistant, Brian (Baby
Face) Yankelevitz.
</P>
<P>
   But what only a select few in attendance knew was that the 49ers
were fortunate to still have Gimmillaro prowling their sidelines
instead of, say, prowling the sidelines for USC today in its noon
opener against North Carolina at the Pyramid in the Long Beach
Volleyball Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   You see, USC attempted to hire Gimmillaro last spring, offering
him $150,000 $50,000 more than he earns at Long Beach to coach its
women's volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``An associate athletic director, Daryl Gross, was the person
who made contact with me,'' confirmed Gimmillaro. ``I turned it
down right away. As I've said so often in the past, I love Long
Beach and the great community feeling you get here. Sure, the money
was good, but I feel comfortable what we have going here. And so
does my family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew ... was I relieved that Brian stayed with us,'' gasped
Bob Maxson. ``What he's built here would be hard to duplicate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's become a hallowed annual ritual for big-name universities
to pursue Gimmillaro in the off-season and for Gimmillaro to turn
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are perks Brian Gimmillaro enjoys in Long Beach
that might not be available to him in other venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into Legend's the other day, and open up the menu to find
a `Gimmillaro Vegie Burger' in it,'' laughs Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   No way USC could match that particular perk, especially since
Julie's is now closed. ...
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' new setter, Brittany Hochevar, is an impressive
athletic specimen whose jump serve already is as wicked as Misty
May's.
</P>
<P>
   She still has a way to go to match May's ball-handling skills,
but she made enough extraordinary plays to give an alluring hint of
her vast potential. ...
</P>
<P>
   An intrigued viewer at the Long Beach-Kansas State match, Misty
May reports her new beach volleyball partner is the veteran Holly
McPeak, the former UCLA star.
</P>
<P>
   May watched her successor, Brittany Hochevar, with a discerning
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt she's going to be a good one, but right now she's got
to start talking a little more out there on the court,'' said May.
</P>
<P>
   May recently quit the national team that's preparing for the
2000 Olympics, but that decision doesn't necessarily mean she won't
be in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a chance I can make the Olympics in beach
volleyball,'' May said. ...
</P>
<P>
   If you're a women's volleyball devotee, you'll have the rare
opportunity at the Pyramid today and Saturday to watch eightup to
nine
</P>
<P>
   matches featuring such schools as Long Beach, USC, North
Carolina, Illinois, Santa Barbara and the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The featured attraction of this annual event is Saturday
evening's showdown between Long Beach and USC. ...
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, I'm finding it terribly difficult to endure the riveting
suspense surrounding the football openers this weekend of the
area's two major college teams, USC and UCLA. Why, the Trojans are
mere 29 point favorites against Hawaii and the Bruins are a
threadbare 27 point pick against Boise State. ...
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green? You've gotta be kidding me. What are the Lakers
going to do next, activate Kurt Rambis? Why not disinter Happy
Hairston? ...
</P>
<P>
   I get tired of hearing Kevin Malone say how he's trying to
rebuild the shattered Dodgers organization. What selective amnesia!
The Dodgers happened to be one of the first-class organizations in
baseball until Fox and Malone came along to tear it hopelessly
apart. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is recurring speculation that Disney still might detach
Terry Collins even though it recently gave him a contract
extension. I doubt if Disney will do that, but if I were Terry
Collins I'd voluntarily depart the Angels. I don't know how Collins
can stand being around such a hapless bunch of losers. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've watched all the great Las Vegas comedians across the
decades Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Joan Rivers, Don Rickles, Red
Buttons, Sheckie Green, Rodney Dangerfield, etc. but has elicited
more laughter from me than Don King. He might not be funny to the
feds, or to those with whom he does business, but the guy always
leaves me in stitches at his press conferences. ...
</P>
<P>
   While sampling the delights at the Cowboy Bar in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., recently, I ran into two Long Beach Ski Club members, Jan
Patten and John Byrd, who were pals of the late, great
Press-Telegram reporter, Allen Wolfe. ``I can't express in words
how much we all liked Allen and how much we now all miss him,''
said Patten, a Cerritos resident. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to know what goes through the not so fertile mind of
Bob (Don't Call Me Rocky) Graziano each time Mike Piazza dispenses
heroics for the New York Mets. ...
</P>
<P>
   I get a kick out of the predictable journalistic violin playing
for the plight of those 22 umpires who lost their jobs. Sorry,
fellows, but no one stuck heaters against your empty noggins
forcing you to resign. All you had to do is stand up to your bozo
of a leader, Richie Phillips, instead of acting like meek sheep.
You got precisely what you deserved. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Richie Phillips had the same undying devotion of his fallen
union members, he'd chuck his job, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've been privileged to visit some beautiful areas in my
lifetime, but I'm not sure any was more breathtakingly picturesque
than Lake Louise in Banff up in Alberta, Canada. ...
</P>
<P>
   Oh, please, Mark Ridley-Thomas, spare us all any further prattle
on behalf of the Coliseum. I'm tired of it, and so is the NFL,
which doesn't want the Coliseum and probably will opt for Houston
because of such a feeling. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's rare any team has three talented bonus babies, but our Toy
Department does in Joe Stevens, Louis Johnson and Kerry Murray.
</P>
<P>
   I'm enjoying Sammy Sosa vs. Mark McGwire II almost as much as
their celebrated home run duel last summer. I'm rooting for Sosa, a
delightful fellow who doesn't brush off reporters, to hit 71. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Jim Brown made terrorist threats against his
wife, but I do know Brown has a ignoble history of roughing up
women and I do wonder why anyone would dare marry such a person.
...
</P>
<P>
   Almost every fistic person I talk to is picking Felix Trinidad
to beat Oscar De La Hoya, which inspires me to lean toward De La
Hoya at this still early juncture. ...
</P>
<P>
   High tea at the Empress Hotel in Victoria, B.C., might not be
the equal of cold beer at Joe Jost's, but it does give one the
momentary illusion of being titled.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU chancellor Michael Ferrari resigned as
chairman of the Western Athletic Conference council of presidents
yesterday, but denied his decision signals the beginning of the end
of TCU's stay in the beleaguered conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't signal anything other than good judgment,'' Ferrari
said. ``I sent a note to the commissioner and the presidents of the
other institutions in the WAC simply indicating that now that we
have begun conversations with the commissioner of Conference USA
and as other things develop, I thought it was appropriate for me to
step down.''
</P>
<P>
   C-USA presidents voted Tuesday to authorize commissioner Mike
Slive to explore expansion possibilities and report back to them in
two weeks. A source said yesterday that C-USA officials initiated
talks with TCU and SMU last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari confirmed yesterday that TCU has had ``preliminary''
talks with Slive, and a source said C-USA officials hope to have a
preliminary proposal to TCU by Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two weeks, I think there will be a conclusion to
discussions,'' Horned Frogs athletic director Eric Hyman said.
``But we have not received an invitation nor have we applied. We
have had preliminary, exploratory discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue being discussed is when TCU and SMU would join C-USA
if they left the WAC. TCU and SMU might have to play an independent
schedule next season. While TCU and SMU's original agreement with
the WAC ends with the 2001 season, WAC commissioner Karl Benson
said the best interests of the conference might precipitate an
earlier split.
</P>
<P>
   ``League bylaws call for any institution that notified me
between now and August 30th of 2000 to be a WAC member for the
2000-2001 academic year,'' Benson said. ``Unless, of course, there
can be a mutually agreed upon separation agreement. We'd want that
so we don't have to go through two years of lame-duck membership
... If this is the end, or they leave, there are plenty of schools
that fit the WAC.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said if TCU and SMU didn't participate in the WAC next
season, they would forfeit any league revenue generated this
season. The WAC presidents, with Ferrari as chairman, instituted
that policy in June in response to what happened when half of the
WAC's 16 members left to form the Mountain West Conference this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari said the talks weren't at a point where issues like when
or how were being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just all very premature,'' he said. ``I don't think
we've progressed to that point. At this particular time, we have no
commitment beyond what we're doing right now. ... This is not a
done deal.''

AMERICANS DIE IN PLANE CRASH IN AFRICA

<P>
   A New Jersey couple who had spent a year planning a trip to the
Serengeti national park and a Connecticut financial consultant, his
brother and their mother were among those killed Wednesday in the
crash of a small plane near Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.S. State Department identified the New Jersey
couple as Jeffrey and Christine Bowersock, both 33, of Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Bowersock's father, Wallace, said, ``They had just been married
almost two years and they were taking advantage of the fact that
they had the means to do this sort of thing and now had the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bowersock, a native of Waukesha, Wis., was a lawyer
who worked for Centre Re, a reinsurance company that is a division
of Zurich Insurance Group. He had worked for three years in what
his father called ``creative financing,'' which kept him ``very,
very busy'' traveling the world from Australia to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Bowersock, a native of Green Bay, Wis., was a
free-lance interior decorator and designer who worked from home.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that the other victim from the New
York region was Cameron Ennis, 37, of Stamford, Conn., a money
manager and owner of a consulting firm he founded 15 years ago,
Prime Capital Services. With him on the plane were his brother
Robert and his mother, Betsy Hoffman, both of Florida, family
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Ennis was taking his first vacation in nearly a decade,
Patty Barrington, a co-worker, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time he felt confident enough about leaving
his clients to go on a trip,'' she said. ``He was just starting to
enjoy his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ennis family and the Bowersocks were part of a group of 10
tourists, a pilot and a guide aboard a twin-engine Cessna 404 when
it crashed into the southern slope of Mount Meru while flying from
the Serengeti to an airport in Arusha, Tanzania, near Mount
Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of a larger group of 18 people in the Livingstone
Safari, a 15-day tour of the East African region that has been
conducted by the Abercrombie and Kent tour company for 37 years,
said Christa Branch, a spokeswoman for the Oak Brook, Ill.,
company. The tour is named for the 19th-century Scottish medical
missionary and explorer Dr. David Livingstone, who was the object
of the celebrated search by the newspaperman Henry Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The group was to fly north from the Arusha area to its next stop
on the tour, the Masai Mara Game Preserve in Kenya. The eight other
members of the tour traveled safely to Arusha on another plane.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said early reports indicated that the
crash had been caused by bad weather in the area, which is in the
midst of its rainy season, when mountain peaks are regularly
swathed in fog.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which had been piloted by Chris Pereira, whom Ms.
Branch described as a veteran bush pilot with 20 years of
experience, was found ``twisted and mangled,'' according to a
dispatch by Reuters that quoted Julian Boullin, a doctor with a
research foundation based in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the remote location of the site and the continuing
bad weather, a State Department official said, search parties were
delaying the recovery of the bodies until Friday.

   FORD SALES INCREASED 8.1 PERCENT IN INDUSTRY'S BEST AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor said that its sales in August rose 8.1 percent, even
higher than expected, making last month the best August ever for
auto sales and the best month in the 1990s after adjusting for
seasonal variations in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives attribute the brisk sales to rising household
incomes, soaring stock and real estate prices, low unemployment,
extremely strong consumer confidence, fairly flat prices for new
automobiles and the introduction of innovative vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   FRAUD SUSPECT SEEN IN WIDER SCHEME
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Pace, a former brokerage firm executive who prosecutors
say was the mastermind behind a big securities fraud earlier in the
1990s, was charged with directing a wider conspiracy that involved
three brokerage firms, the manipulation of 11 companies' stocks and
$200 million in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLIC NEW YORK DEAL DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   HSBC Holdings said that its pending $10.3 billion acquisition of
Republic New York would be delayed because of an investigation of
Republic's securities unit. In a statement, Republic said that it
was cooperating with investigators and that it had suspended the
chief executive of the unit, James Edward Sweeney. Republic also
said that it had replaced the manager of the futures department.
Shares of Republic fell $7.185, to $62.1875.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS FALL AHEAD OF JOBS REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices resumed their late-summer swoon as traders braced
for the government's report Friday on the August job market. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 94.67 points, to 10,843.21. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 11.96 points, to
1,319.11. The Nasdaq composite index slumped 16.56 points, to
2,734.24.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell sharply on continuing worries that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates again. The yield on the benchmark
30-year issue rose to 6.13 percent, from 6.08 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ANHEUSER-BUSCH RECALL IN EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch said that it was recalling 5.7 million bottles of
its Budweiser and Bud brands from 12 European nations after
consumers complained that glass slivers had broken off of some
bottles when the twist-off caps were removed.
</P>
<P>
   UNION AT BOEING ACCEPTS CONTRACT
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's largest union voted overwhelmingly to accept a
three-year contract, averting a strike that would have dealt a blow
to Boeing's efforts to recover from a financial downturn. Both the
union and the company hailed the results, which headed off what
would have been the third walkout by the machinists in the last 10
years. Some analysts and investors think that Philip M. Condit,
Boeing's chairman, felt he had little choice but to give the
machinists what they wanted because a strike would have disrupted
the company's financial recovery.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA ELECTRIC TO SPIN OFF ASSETS

   The state-owned Korea Electric Power said it would spin off six
independent companies in November and then offer to sell them to

<P>
   REPORTS SIGNAL A STRONG ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Orders for factory-made goods rose by 2.1 percent in July, the

stayed below the key 300,000 level for the sixth consecutive week,

JEANNE MILES, ABSTRACT ARTIST INSPIRED BY ASIAN ART AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric
abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She
was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George
Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and,
determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a
year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel
Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere. She left France after the start
of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in
Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons
Gallery in New York during the gallery's heyday, from 1943 to 1959,
and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley
Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows
in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita
Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based
on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green
interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they
suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work
reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and
thought and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western
modernist art. ``The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in
our psyche,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miles' paintings were included in many group shows from the
1930s on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other
institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the
Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell
Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and
Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She
taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a
grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.

ROBERTS SEES REVELATIONS AS `SAD CHAPTER' IN FBI'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sen. Pat Roberts of
Kansas said Thursday that revelations about the FBI's role at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, represent a ``sad
chapter'' that undermines the credibility of law enforcement
agencies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We don't need this,'' the Republican Roberts said at a
Downtown Rotary Club meeting in Kansas City. ``We don't need this
kind of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he had no inside information, but doubted that the
flammable military tear gas canisters the FBI fired into the
compound in 1993 ignited the fatal fire. At the end of the siege,
about 80 persons were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI admitted only recently that flammable canisters were
shot into the compound early on the last day of the siege. The U.S.
Marshals Service seized a videotape Wednesday from the FBI that
reportedly documents the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roberts said FBI officials were guilty of past lies about
their use of the flammable gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't do that,'' Roberts told the Rotarians. ``I think
the American people quite frankly are...tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged Attorney General Janet Reno to move quickly on
initiating an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says `I take full responsibility,' '' Roberts said of
Reno. ``But in the end of it all, it just seems to fall between the
slats.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the facts are known, ``Heads ought to roll,'' he said. ``I
know we'll get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Roberts reported that he was pleased with
progress that countries in the former Soviet Union have made in
dismantling nuclear warheads. The senator returned last month from
a brief visit to Russia in which he received an update.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back feeling much more positive,'' said Roberts, a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``This is a real
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was convinced that U.S. money being used to finance
the dismantling program was not being siphoned off by
organized-crime syndicates operating in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Armed Services Committee, more than 4,800 of
13,300 known nuclear warheads have been de-activated in recent
years in Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine. The last three
countries are free of nuclear weapons.

COWBOYS ESCAPE SEVERAL INJURY SCARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If anyone needed one more reason why playing
five preseason games is a ludicrous amount, the Dallas Cowboys
provided at least five good ones. That was the number of Cowboys
players forced out of their final preseason game, against
Jacksonville Thursday night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the injuries weren't serious, although it was hard
to tell at first.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the game, starting left tackle Flozell
Adams went down and limped off with a sprained left knee. Adams did
not return, but Cowboys officials said he could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, our goal was to get in and out of here with a
minimal amount of guys getting banged up,'' quarterback Troy Aikman
said. ``It looks like Flozell is going to be OK, and I'm hopeful
some of the other guys who got hurt will be all right.'' FOUR-WIDE
SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first team employed the four-wide offense twice
Thursday night. With Troy Aikman in the shotgun, Chris Warren in
the backfield, and receivers Jeff Ogden, Raghib Ismail, Ernie Mills
and Michael Irvin split wide, Aikman hit Ismail for a 25-yard gain
and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   The second attempt never materialized, thanks to an illegal
formation penalty on Tony Hutson, who had replaced the injured left
tackle Flozell Adams moments earlier. DENVIS MANNS DOWNER
</P>
<P>
   Denvis Manns didn't help his cause by making poor decisions on
special teams, and fumbling after making a reception at the
Jaguars' 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Manns, a four-time 1,000-yard rusher at New Mexico State,
botched two of three kickoff returns. Although Manns is not
considered a front-runner to return kickoffs, his play is critical
in his battle with Beau Morgan, who did not play until the second
half, as the third-string running back.
</P>
<P>
   Manns elected to return two kickoffs from 5 yards deep in the
end zone. He fumbled at the 20 on one, but was saved by Tony Hutson
falling on the loose ball. The next time, he was drilled and
dropped at the 14. He somewhat made up for those mistakes, however,
with a 45-yard kickoff return in third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to redeem himself on offense, he was gang-tackled
at the Jaguars' 4-yard line, then fumbled to stall the Cowboys'
best opportunity to score in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Manns gained only nine yards on six carries. JACKSONVILLE PUNT
RETURN
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars took a 7-0 lead without running a play when Reggie
Barlow split the defense and returned a Toby Gowin punt 88 yards
with only 3:51 elapsed in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gowin hasn't had a regular-season punt returned for a touchdown
in his two seasons with the Cowboys. In fact, the last punt he had
returned for a touchdown came on Nov. 4, 1990, by the New York
Jets' Terance Mathis. TUCKER MAKES A MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Former Horned Frogs wide receiver Jason Tucker made a strong
impression with a productive third quarter on the second-team
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker caught three passes for 35 yards through three quarters,
with a long of 13. His competition, MarTay Jenkins, had two catches
for 29 yards with a long of 21. MORGAN MAKES A RUN
</P>
<P>
   Beau Morgan, straddled with a toe injury for most of the
preseason, broke loose for a 24-yard run in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the former Air Force wishbone quarterback who spent his
third training camp with the Cowboys, carried eight times for 36
yards of the team's total 67 rushing yards. Final cuts will be
announced on Sunday.

HENRY SINGLETON, 82, ENGINEER WHO CO-FOUNDED TELEDYNE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Pa., Mass., N.M.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dr. Henry E. Singleton, a brilliant engineer who
co-founded and built Teledyne Inc. into one of the nation's largest
and most enduring conglomerates, died Aug. 31 at his home in Los
Angeles. The cause was brain cancer, his family said. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton made an early mark with technological developments,
including designing an inertial guidance system now used in
military and commercial aircraft. But he became known more for his
financial wizardry, as he built up his company through more than
100 acquisitions and later made Teledyne a major investor in other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood how to move between real assets and financial
assets in a way you don't see today,'' said Leon Cooperman,
chairman of Omega Advisors, a Wall Street investment firm. ``He was
the most brilliant industrialist that I've ever met, and I've met
many.''
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Teledyne had revenue of nearly $5 billion, with a
diverse mix of businesses including specialty metals, unmanned
aircraft, insurance, swimming pool heaters and Water Pik shower
heads and tooth cleaners. Teledyne merged with Allegheny Ludlum
Corp. in 1996, and the company is known today as Allegheny
Teledyne, based in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton headed Teledyne from its founding in 1960 until 1986
and remained its chairman until 1991. He retired as a director in
1997, but still owned 7.2 percent of the stock. Forbes magazine
estimated his wealth at $750 million, making him one of the
nation's 400 richest people.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton was described by those who knew him as extremely
brainy. He could recite lengthy passages from Shakespeare and other
poets and also liked to play chess without looking at the board,
keeping the positions of the pieces in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his business strategies like low spending on research
and development were criticized, but Singleton paid little heed to
critics. He kept to himself, rarely giving interviews or
communicating much with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't care what other people thought,'' said Arthur
Rock, a pioneering venture capitalist who provided the initial
financing for Teledyne and served on its board for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style was to really stay in his office and to think things
up and to get other people to carry them out,'' Rock said. He added
that by his calculations, Teledyne's stock rose an average of 25
percent a year in the 25 years that Singleton was the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview with Business Week magazine in 1982,
Singleton disclaimed having a long-term plan for Teledyne, saying,
``I like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into
the future.'' In 1978, he told Forbes that Teledyne was ``like a
living plant with our companies the different branches and each
putting out new branches and growing, so no one is too
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton was born in 1916 in Haslet, Texas, on a ranch where
his father raised cotton and cattle. He attended the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md., but transferred to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he earned bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He interrupted his studies during World War II to serve in the
Office of Strategic Services in Europe. He also developed a system
for removing the magnetic field from ships so they could not be
detected by enemy submarines, according to Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton worked at Hughes Aircraft, North American Aviation and
then Litton Industries, where he ran the electronics equipment
business until 1960. But he left that year, apparently because of a
dispute with one of his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   With George Kozmetsky, a colleague from Litton, he started
Teledyne by buying a military contractor that had practically
collapsed because it lost its main contract, according to Rock.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Teledyne used its high-priced stock to buy 125 or
so companies. Most were left to be run by their own managers and
Singleton did not interfere, as long as they generated cash for the
parent company in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Teledyne stopped acquiring companies because its
stock price dropped and because antitrust regulators were beginning
to scrutinize conglomerates. Singleton then had Teledyne buy back
much of its own stock from shareholders. It is a technique commonly
used today by companies to raise their share prices, but at that
time it was highly unusual and attracted criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Teledyne also began investing in other companies, taking big
stakes in Curtiss-Wright and Litton, Singleton's former employer,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, with Singleton winding
down his involvement in the company and conglomerates out of favor,
Teledyne began divesting itself of various operations. Also, the
company became embroiled in military procurement scandals, and it
paid more than $100 million in fines to settle charges that it had
inflated bills to the Pentagon, falsified tests of components and
exported material for Iraqi bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Singleton went back to his roots in cattle
raising, amassing ranches in New Mexico and California that made
him one of the nation's largest individual landowners, according to
his family. He was a student of Western folklore and of the Pueblo
Indian culture of New Mexico, a wine collector and a voracious
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton is survived by his wife of 57 years, Caroline, and by
five children and four grandchildren.

SELF-MADE MULTIMILLIONAIRE MARY HUDSON DIES AT AGE 86 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan. _ Mary Hudson, a
self-made multimillionaire who succeeded in a man's world of oil,
land and cattle, died Thursday of cancer at her Prairie Village
home. She was 86.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her daughter, Joyce Driver Sharp of Prairie Village, said her
mother became ill in July, but was diagnosed with cancer only two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   During six decades of work, Hudson's career soared, plummeted,
then rebounded at the end.
</P>
<P>
   She built an empire that included more than 300 gas stations and
convenience stores and landed her on the Forbes 400 list of richest
Americans. But her business fell apart in the 1980s, partly because
of multimillion-dollar court judgments entered against her company
for overcharging customers at the pumps and for underpaying some
employees.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit felony theft in
connection with the overcharges and was ordered to perform 200
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   She clawed back in the final years of her career, however, to
oversee a smaller, rejuvenated operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a goer,'' said Dean Walthers of Cuba, Kan., a
petroleum distributor and station owner who knew her in business.
``She was loud. She could cuss like a trooper. She got her point
across. She got the job done. She was a money-making
businesswoman.''
</P>
<P>
   Her rise to the top started in 1933 after her husband, Wayne
Driver, was killed in a truck accident. At 21 and caring for a
6-month-old daughter, Hudson borrowed $200 from her father to open
her first Hudson Oil Co. station in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, she built a chain of stations
with a reputation for low prices and no-frills service. The
stations were among the first in the country to feature
self-service.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, her private-brand refining and retail
marketing companies operated more than 300 stations and convenience
stores in 35 states.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Oil also ran an oil refinery in Cushing, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, she married Frank B. Vandegrift. Vandegrift, who worked
in his wife's business, died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Her business turned sour in the early 1980s, when the U.S.
petroleum industry crashed. At a time when the industry was sitting
on huge reserves of oil selling for $43 a barrel, Middle East
producers began flooding the market, and prices plunged to $10 a
barrel. Hudson closed its Cushing refinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were losing $500,000 a month,'' Hudson recalled in a 1993
interview. ``We had no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounting losses from station operations, the costs of
maintaining the closed refinery and poor accounting controls all
bore in on the business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the company defaulted on a $20 million line of credit
at United Missouri Bank and banks in Chicago and Oklahoma City.
Hudson Oil and eight affiliated companies filed for reorganization
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Kansas City, Kan. At the time, it was
the largest bankruptcy case ever filed in Kansas. It turned out to
be one of the longest, too, with some issues still not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson experienced other setbacks in the 1980s:
</P>
<P>
   - The U.S. Department of Energy won a $30 million court judgment
against her company for setting pumps so customers received less
gasoline than they paid for. The department later settled for $6.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   - A federal judge concluded that the company had wrongly
exempted managers from overtime, had illegally docked workers for
cash shortages and had failed to pay employees for time they worked
before and after their regular shifts. The judge entered a $12.9
million judgment against Hudson Oil. Most of that was never
collected from the bankruptcy, and none of the former employees has
received any money yet.
</P>
<P>
   - The Environmental Protection Agency accused the company of
polluting the ground, soil and air around its Oklahoma refinery.
The company agreed to pay $1 million to help clean up the problem.
</P>
<P>
   - Hudson pleaded no contest to a state charge of conspiracy to
commit felony theft because her company had been setting pumps to
deliver less gasoline than they showed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the corporate reorganization dragged on for six years
as, piece by piece, the company's properties were sold off to pay
creditors. Mary Hudson lost control. As decades of work crumbled
around her, however, Mary Hudson was unbowed. She looked forward,
not back.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, at age 80, she oversaw an operation that included
cattle ranches, farms, several Handy Stop convenience stores and a
petroleum consulting firm in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, her attorney, R. Pete Smith, said in an interview:
``Mary is young in mind and young in heart and a very shrewd
businesswoman. She has not waited for the world to serve her off a
silver tray.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she had been selling off those properties, while
continuing to operate farms in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Notified of her death Thursday, Smith said, ``She was a very
smart, hard-working, tough businesswoman, and I enjoyed working
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Janice Karlin, who handled some of the
government's litigation, observed, ``She was a woman ahead of her
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, The New York Times Magazine said: ``Of the 1,019 people
who have ever appeared in the Forbes 400 list...(only) three were
women, Oprah Winfrey, Estee Lauder and Mary Hudson, a
gasoline-station mogul.'' Hudson said that when Forbes listed her,
in the mid-1970s, she was worth about $325 million.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly proud of her membership in the Twenty-Five
Year Club, an organization of top oil company executives. She was
the only woman member.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me just as nice as if I was one of them _ I am one
of them _ and if you checked it out, I'm probably worth more than a
lot of them,'' she said of her fellow club members in a 1995
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was a snappy dresser and traveled extensively, having
visited more than 75 countries. At the same time, she considered
herself down to earth, and she did not flaunt her wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always lived just a regular life,'' she said in the 1995
interview. ``When I made all this wealth, I didn't want to be any
different from anyone else. I never even bought a plane. People
would say, `Why don't you buy a plane?' And I'd say, `Why should
I?' I don't need to buy a plane when I can rent one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Marketplace musings for a long holiday
weekend:
</P>
<P>
   - When Kansas City's riverboat casinos break a monthly revenue
record, it's as significant a sign of local economic health as a
record low area jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
   - You can bet that the biggest supporters of another
minimum-wage increase are people who don't have to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   - E-mail as a marketing tool seems preferred mostly by those
pitching get-rich-quick schemes and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   - A word such as ``multitasking'' has no legitimate place in the
English language.
</P>
<P>
   - Does anybody else think a 22-letter name such as
PricewaterhouseCoopers is too unwieldy to be effective as a
business handle?
</P>
<P>
   - You're getting old if you can remember when religious families
routinely reserved the right on Sundays to deny children permission
to pursue entertainment activities such as going to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   - Chances of horse racing having another Triple Crown winner are
about as good as someone breaking baseball immortal Joe DiMaggio's
56-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   - Professional golfdom acted against its best marketing
interests by sticking with a rule that denied Tom Watson the chance
to make a birthday weekend debut as a geezer golfer in his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   - If Russia could afford to send troops to Kosovo, why can't it
afford to pay some of its debts?
</P>
<P>
   - Do all sport-utility vehicles come with a cell phone as part
of the power-look package?
</P>
<P>
   - Whatever happened to Nolan Bushnell?
</P>
<P>
   - If steaks and burgers really cause impotence, as some animal
rights fanatics claim, the human species wouldn't have proliferated
to the extent it has.
</P>
<P>
   - Why are so many Americans hyper about MSG in their food?
</P>
<P>
   - Quick, when was the last time economist Lester Thurow wrote
something worth reading?
</P>
<P>
   - Baseball's Hall of Fame will be unworthy of its name as long
as Pete Rose is denied entry.
</P>
<P>
   - Is anyone surprised at the explosion of fen-phen lawsuits here
and elsewhere after a Texas woman recently hit a $23 million
litigation jackpot involving the diet regimen?
</P>
<P>
   - You don't have to be particularly religious to believe that
doing less retail commerce on Sundays in America is an idea worth
serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   - Losing the traditional Campbell Soup can design from
supermarket shelves is like losing an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   - Is it my imagination, or do more people get ``tennis elbow''
working in their gardens than they do from playing tennis?
</P>
<P>
   - Somebody tell Clint Eastwood that ``True Crime'' should be the
last film in which he attempts the sexy-hunk bit.
</P>
<P>
   - What's it going to take for the NFL to learn that instant
replay's disruption factor isn't compatible with the game rhythms
that are key to making television sports entertaining?
</P>
<P>
   - The International Monetary Fund has outlived whatever
usefulness it may have had earlier in the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   - If today's young workers think they have it bad, as a recent
poll indicated, they ought to sit down with their grandfathers for
a heart-to-heart chat about the bad ol' days.
</P>
<P>
   - Wake me when Chiefs honcho Carl Peterson and first-round
draftee John Tait's agent get their contract differences ironed
out.

 MISSOURI REGULATORS APPROVE KCP&AMP;L-wESTERN MERGER, BUT QUESTIONS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri regulators Thursday approved the
merger of Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. and Western Resources Inc.,
but questions continue to simmer about the deal's future.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Public Service Commission unanimously gave its OK.
Sheila Lumpe, the commission's chairwoman, said the merger, as
approved, would not be detrimental to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators endorsed a July agreement between the two
utilities and the commission's staff and the Missouri Office of
Public Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specified that consumers not pay any of the
merger's acquisition premium. In addition, ratepayers will get $5
million in credits and a three-year rate freeze. Also, a study will
be conducted to determine whether the merged company would wield
too much market power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission was very pleased with the agreement,'' Lumpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's approval is the first of the merger's major
regulatory hurdles officially to be completed. The merger, still
scheduled to be completed by year-end, would create Westar Energy,
which is to absorb KCP&AMP;L and Western's KPL and KGE electric
utilities. Westar would have 1 million electric customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased with the action of the Missouri
commission moving the merger forward with terms that benefit
everyone involved and allow our utility operations to grow,'' said
David Wittig, Western's chief executive officer, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also has progressed at the federal level with a
recent agreement with the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, which must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Corporation Commission tentatively has approved the
merger, with a final order expected in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas regulators have said they will not accept an
agreement between their staff and the two utilities that called for
$300 million of the merger's acquisition premium to be put into the
rate base to be paid by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Western said previously that it needed the $300 million to help
pay for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig said Thursday that he continued to hope for a decision
from Kansas regulators that would allow the merger to move forward
without creating financial harm to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Michel' Philipp, a Western spokeswoman, said Thursday that there
would be no further comment until Kansas regulators release their
final order on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Western's stock closed Thursday at $23.50 per share, down 31
cents and well below the $29.78 per share that gives either utility
the option to not complete the merger. That option could be
exercised shortly before the merger's completion.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L shareholders would receive less if Western's stock was
below the $29.78 share price for Western's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Tilden, a KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman, said Thursday that the
utility had no comment about the share price and any option later
to end the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday that it was placing
Western's short-term debt ratings on review for possible downgrade
and that its review of the company's long-term debt was now
``uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's said it took the action in its belief that the merger
may not occur, and concerns over a possible loan default by
Protection One, which is 85 percent owned by Western.
</P>
<P>
   Protection One, which provides monitored security services, is
being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over
how it accounts for the acquisition of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Protection One's stock is down sharply, and the company may be
out of compliance with provisions of a $500 million line of credit.
A default could affect the marketability of Western's credit, too,
according to Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   Philipp, the Western spokeswoman, said that while no assurances
could be given, Western thought a default by Protection One could
be avoided.

CASINO GROUP CONSIDERS BUYERS OTHER THAN TRUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Trumpster, it seems, is about to get
trumped.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place Entertainment Inc., the company handling the sale of
the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City, said Thursday that it
was considering new bids for the pink gambling emporium, which
Donald Trump had earlier agreed to buy for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement reached in January, Trump's company or
Hilton was allowed to walk away from the deal if it didn't close by
midnight Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Trump's licensing approval stalled at the Missouri
Gaming Commission, Park Place is entertaining new suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've advised the Trump organization and the Missouri Gaming
Commission that the deadline has passed,'' said Geoff Davis, a
spokesman for Park Place. ``We're considering competing bids and
will make an announcement shortly on what we will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to specify how many bids Park Place had received,
from whom or for how much. Nor would he provide any timetable for
when the company expected to make its announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts offices in Atlantic City,
N.J., were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming unraveling of the Hilton-Trump deal comes as little
surprise to local observers given the length of time it has been
under review by the Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At $15 million, Trump originally got a deal on a casino that
cost $100 million to build. Hilton wanted to sell the boat cheaply
and quickly to sidestep a criminal trial on charges that it bribed
then Port Authority Chairman Elbert Anderson in exchange for his
support to build the boat on city-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton agreed to surrender its gambling license in Missouri when
the riverboat was sold and Trump was approved for a license. Hilton
also spun off its other gambling properties into a separate,
publicly held company, Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   The Trump organization, however, has since run into its own
problems with the commission, which is reportedly concerned with
the company's high debt levels and previous bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Wednesday that its licensing investigation
was ongoing and that it was still not prepared to offer Trump
approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the commission's executive director, Mel Fisher,
said: ``We've been advised that there are other people seeking to
buy the casino. They don't have to have our approval to sell it. We
just have to approve the buyer. We're waiting for the dust to
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo's revenue has been stuck in last place among local
casinos. But it may still be an attractive property to other buyers
at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true, observers say, considering the recent
growth in local gambling revenues, which reached a monthly record
of $44.7 million in July and should get another boost from the
introduction of open boarding in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a relatively short list'' of companies that might be
interested in buying the Flamingo, said Joe Coccimiglio, a gambling
industry analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   A likely bidder, he said, is California-based Hollywood Park
Inc., one of the former owners of The Woodlands racetrack in Kansas
City, Kan. Hollywood has been an active casino buyer in other
markets and may be interested in re-entering the Kansas City
market, which it is already familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include companies such as Isle of Capri and
Lady Luck Gaming, or existing local players such as Harrah's and
Station Casino, which would be looking to defend their positions in
the Kansas City market and might find the licensing process easier
to negotiate than Trump.

CREATIONISM BECOMES CAMPAIGN ISSUE FOR GOP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ On the second day, the media created a new campaign
issue _ evolution vs. creationism.
</P>
<P>
   And the presidential candidates said, ``This is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the Iowa Straw Poll last month, the Kansas
Board of Education's contentious decision was front and center on
the campaign trail, much to the consternation of GOP contenders
Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and columnist George Will sparred over the issue on ABC's
``This Week,'' with Will finally concluding that Forbes wasn't
answering his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire your footwork,'' Will told Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, meantime, appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program the
same day. She never responded to a question on whether it would
bother her if evolution was not taught in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to leave that to the states,'' Dole said, but then
she hinted, ``But as I say, I'm a person of strong faith...''
</P>
<P>
   The book of Genesis and the 19th century theories of Charles
Darwin appear to be a new staple on the campaign trail, as
reporters began stirring the primordial soup.
</P>
<P>
   Voters and reporters have begun asking about it, and the Gallup
Organization asked a series of questions on the subject in June
when the Kansas Board of Education debated the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the silliness of our campaign process today,''
said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
``Issues that have absolutely nothing substantial to do with
governing end up becoming headline items.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the issue was more elevated than the ``have-you-used
drugs'' inquiries that have dominated the news lately, Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the evolution issue is stirring curiosity among the
masses, it's apparently causing anxiety among the candidates,
particularly when their own views are solicited. Forbes and Dole
aren't the only ones avoiding the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP contender, Gary Bauer, the former head of the Family
Research Council whose base includes many social conservatives,
won't say how he believes the world was created, according to a
report in the New York Daily News. A spokeswoman for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush never replied to a similar request.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the campaigns of Pat Buchanan and John McCain. Only
long-shot candidates were more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world was formed as Genesis described it,'' said former
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a religious conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I believe in the creation enumerated in the
Bible,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah on CNN, who quickly added
that he also recognizes science.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how public schools should deal with the dueling
notions of how the world was created. One viewpoint is that the
world was put together in six days as the Bible suggests in
Genesis. Another is that the Earth is billions of years old and
life forms upon it evolved from earlier versions to what they are
today.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential contenders want to appeal to social
conservatives, a group that tends to turn out on Election Day. But
they don't want to alienate middle-of-the-road voters, who often
decide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many centrist voters may be put off by candidates who believe in
a ``creationist'' view of the Earth's development that seems to
ignore decades of scientific discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist,
observed that it is difficult to know how strong religious beliefs
outside the mainstream will play in today's politics.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he recalled how Kansas Republican Jim Ryun's
strict views became campaign fodder but did not stop his successful
run for Congress in 1996. He sensed, however, that at the
presidential level, espousing some faiths or evangelical beliefs
still could be a political hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come around full circle that a divorced Catholic wouldn't
have any trouble right now, but a married Protestant who fervently
espouses creationism might,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll conducted in late June revealed national
ambivalence on the issue that may be one reason for the candidates'
unwillingness to take a strong stand. The poll showed that
Americans favor teaching creationism in public schools, along with
evolution, by 69 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, by 55 percent to 40 percent, they would oppose
replacing evolution with creationism.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing candidates want to do is engage in a controversy
that splits Republicans, Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only serves the interests of the other party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue leaped onto the national stage Aug. 11 when the Kansas
Board of Education, on a 6-4 vote, adopted new testing standards
that play down the scientific importance of evolution. The vote was
considered a major victory for conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the board's action, the question of teaching evolution
will be left to the state's 304 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP presidential candidates say, as Dole did, that local
school districts should decide how the theories are taught. The
federal government, the candidates say, has no business meddling,
even though the issue has come before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court has forbidden states to require the teaching of
creationism because of the religious foundation of that idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates, more liberal, are not as divided.
Both Vice President Al Gore and his only rival, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, say public schools should teach evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I respect local school board control, I also believe
that every American child needs a foundation of solid scientific
education, and evolution clearly falls into that category,''
Bradley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't say how creationism should be handled. Gore, who
hails from Tennessee, the site of the famous Scopes monkey trial in
1925, suggests that creationism could be included as part of a
religion course.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is clearly up to local districts to decide,'' a Gore
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, Loomis said, ``are happy to have Republicans mucking
around in a 19th century debate as we head toward the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I bet they all wish it would go away.''

CANDIDATE BUSH LAYS SCHOOL-POLICY PLANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
has unveiled his education platform in Los Angeles, saying federal
funds should be taken from the worst schools and given to parents
for private education, tutoring or ``whatever works.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first major speech on education as a presidential
candidate, the Texas governor decried the nation's public school
system as a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we are divided into two nations, separate and
unequal. One that reads and one that can't. One that dreams and one
that doesn't,'' Bush told about 3,000 Latino business leaders
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we spend federal money, we want results,'' Bush said.
``In my administration, federal money will not follow failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan could cost the Los Angeles Unified School District
$167 million in Title I funds that this year are distributed to 472
schools with enrollment of 475,000 students in kindergarten through
12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush avoided using the word ``voucher,'' the plan he
described is strikingly similar to the voucher system in Florida,
where his brother Jeb is governor. Florida adopted the first
statewide voucher system in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has repeatedly surfaced in California, where voters
rejected a school-vouchers initiative, Proposition 174, in 1993.
That campaign was viewed as pitting voters in suburban school
districts, where many are satisfied with local schools, against
those in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal here is to strengthen public schools by expecting
performance, to increase the number of schools where children are
likely to learn,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would require poorly performing schools to improve
test scores within three years if they receive Title I funds under
a federal program that funnels about $7.7 billion yearly into the
education of the children of poor parents.
</P>
<P>
   States would set their own standards for determining when a
school is failing, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said warnings would be issued for two years to schools that
failed to show improvement and rewards to those that did. During
the third year, parents could take the school's share of Title I
funds, about $1,500 a student, to spend in other ways for their
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money can be used by students for tutoring, for a charter
school, for a working public school in a different district, for a
private school -- for whatever parents choose,'' Bush said. ``For
whatever works.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was billed as the first of three education-policy
addresses Bush will make as he seeks to counter national criticism
that his campaign has not provided enough specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his Title I plan, Bush said he would seek to transfer the
Head Start program to the Department of Education to stress the
original goal of educating preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit to Los Angeles to speak to the Latin Business
Association was purely by design: to counter criticism that he has
failed to appear at earlier Latino events in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used Spanish phrases throughout his remarks, and some local
officials said he is one of the few GOP candidates who stands a
chance of breaking through Latino animosity toward Republicans that
developed during former California Gov. Pete Wilson's time in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush understands our community,'' said Hector Barreto,
chairman of the Latin Business Association. ``If anyone is going to
overcome what we have had in the past, it is George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delma Avalos, a school board member in Texas, questioned
Bush's success in education there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some slight improvements, but it's too early
to say if they are effective,'' Avalos said. ``He should wait to
see if they work in Texas before trying them out nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his GOP presidential opponents, Ken Blackwell, national
chairman of Steve Forbes' campaign, said Bush didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his program is a bit weak in one particular area: He
tells parents to wait three years for real school reform,'' said
Blackwell, secretary of state in Ohio, which is experimenting with
vouchers. ``I don't believe and neither does Steve Forbes that we
can wait three years for real school reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, claimed Bush's speech
``was more notable for what was not in it than for what was in
it.'' He cited discipline as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Dole favors school vouchers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, campaigning in
Ohio, said vouchers are not the answer to the problems of public
education. ``I think that there are problems -- not the least of
which are issues of church and state -- and ultimately they will
have to be resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Los Angeles teachers union said Bush's ideas
would punish the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't that we're over-investing in poor kids,''
said Day Higuchi of United Teachers Los Angeles. ``Title I has a
history of improving the disadvantaged at twice the rate they would
otherwise do, even though it hasn't brought them up to standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi also questioned whether there would be enough private
schools to handle voucher students and whether private schools
would raise their tuition to keep disadvantaged children out.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a fraud: a bait and switch,'' Higuchi said.
``It also lets them say we've got vouchers and don't need to do any
more. It's wiping their hands of the problems of poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A national union leader claimed Bush lacks commitment to public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``His risky voucher scheme would drain scarce resources from
public schools and would not build on the gains that are being made
thanks to high standards, smaller class size and better
discipline,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.

ALEX HAYNES, 89, AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY PIONEER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mich.)  (rk) 
 By   RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Haynes, a Ford Motor Co. engineer who pioneered safety
devices for American cars in the 1950s, died Monday in a nursing
home in Stuart, Fla. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   When Haynes oversaw Ford's development of the auto industry's
first comprehensive package of safety equipment, his crash tests
sometimes bordered on the macabre. A nationally telecast promotion
of seat belts _ showing that the belts could support a Lincoln _
went awry, and Ford's safety campaign did not translate into sales
at first. However, the life-saving devices that Haynes advocated
eventually became standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As executive engineer for product study at Ford, Haynes helped
create 1956 models with collapsible steering wheels, safety locks
to keep doors from flying open on impact, shatter-resistant
rear-view mirrors, and, as options, seat belts, padded sun visors
and padded dashboards.
</P>
<P>
   Several small American automobile companies had provided seat
belts earlier in the 1950s, but Ford made ``a breakthrough'' as the
first company with an array of safety products, according to
professor David Lewis, an auto industry historian at the University
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people weren't buying safety,'' Lewis recalled on
Wednesday. ``After three months of trying to market cars on the
basis of safety, Ford reverted to the kind of advertising other
auto makers were using: style and horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, who was born in Poland, came to the United States with
his family as a youngster and received engineering degrees from
Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   After working on aircraft design for Curtiss-Wright and General
Motors during World War II, he was hired in 1945 by Ford. During
the early 1950's, he undertook safety research at the behest of
Henry Ford 2nd, the company president, who had become aware of
accident studies by Cornell University Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to look into them and see what we could use,''
Haynes recalled in a 1986 interview with The Miami Herald. ``That
was the start of the drive to make cars safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford researchers crashed cars together to see how various types
of door locks would hold. But because crash dummies were not
available then, they had to improvise to study the impact of
crashes. Haynes remembered that his engineers joined with Wayne
State University Medical School in Detroit, which was using human
skulls to study head injuries, in dropping skulls down a five-floor
elevator shaft onto objects of varying shapes and materials ``to
see what would happen when heads hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting its safety features on the 1956 models, Ford staged
a demonstration televised on Dave Garroway's ``Today'' show on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to lift a gold Lincoln 10 feet in the air using
Ford's new seat belts and buckles to show how strong they were. But
to capture the best camera angles, technicians hauled the car up in
jerks of 10 feet until it was about 60 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the buckle collapsed, and the car fell on national
television,'' Haynes recalled. ``The fall broke its frame. I called
my wife and told her to pack _ that I was out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes later calculated that the buckle, designed to support
4,000 pounds of pressure, had withstood more than five times that
before collapsing, and when he told Ford officials, he was hailed
for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes retired from Ford in 1970 and moved to the Stuart area.
During the late 1970s, he traveled to South Korea to help Hyundai
start an automobile division.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Eve, of Stuart; three daughters,
Stephanie Patton, of Maryland; Laura Roscoe, of Nova Scotia, and
Elizabeth Richardson of Ann Arbor, Mich.; two brothers, William, of
Stuart, and Berle, of Pittsburgh; a sister, Ann Zabet, of
Washington, and two grandsons. &QL;

MILTON JACK MIRMAN, 84, AN AUTHORITY ON STAMPS; MARK ZEBROWSKI,
ISLAMIC ART HISTORIAN, 54 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., England) (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milton Jack Mirman, an authority on U.S. stamps who was once a
major dealer, died last Friday at a hospital in Drexel Hill, Pa. He
was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Mirman, a longtime resident of Baldwin, N.Y., had moved to an
elder-care community in Media, Pa., last year.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Mirman started attending auctions as an
amateur stamp dealer when he was 14. He graduated from New York
University and, in 1935, from its law school, and practiced law for
about 10 years before going into business in the garment district
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he decided to turn his hobby into an occupation with
his own dealership. Within a year he had bought Stanley Gibbons
Inc., an American offshoot of Stanley Gibbons Ltd. of London.
</P>
<P>
   The New York company was one of the leading traders for serious
collectors in the United States, with a catalog that served as a
pricing guide for American stamps. Mirman headed the company until
he sold it to the Intergovernmental Philatelic Corp. in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He managed the business into the 1980s, when the British company
bought it and integrated it into the London original. Mirman
remained with Intergovernmental as an appraiser and manager of its
American operations until his retirement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Sally Roth Mirman; a
son, Steven J., of Philadelphia; a daughter, Marilyn Marte Mirman
of Baltimore, and two sisters, Lucille Schulman of Cranbury, N.J.,
and Ruth Pomeranz of Boynton Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zebrowski, Islamic Art Historian, 54
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zebrowski, a historian of Islamic art who specialized in
Mogul culture of southern India, died on Aug. 22 in London. He was
54.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Peace Corps in India in 1967, Zebrowski became
interested in Deccani metalwork and manuscript painting, which had
received little scholarly attention.
</P>
<P>
   On his return to the United States, he entered the doctoral
program in art history at Harvard University. In the 1970s he
settled in London, dealing in and collecting art. In 1983 he
published ``Deccani Painting,'' based on his dissertation; it
remains the standard work on the subject. In 1997 his ``Silver,
Gold and Bronze From Mughal India'' appeared. His last book,
``Architecture and Art of the Deccan Sultanates,'' written with
George Michell, was published earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zebrowski is survived by his companion, Robert Alderman.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There he was, dressed in his favorite striped T-shirt,
his little cargo shorts, his backpack slung over one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' my husband said as he took the steps down the front
porch. ``I'm going to school now.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned around once, looked back toward home, looked back at
me standing in the doorway, waving goodbye. He was off for his
first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye,'' he said again, still looking back.
</P>
<P>
   It was killing me. Ripping my black little stone heart right in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. Honestly, I couldn't wait for him to get out
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   You see, ever since my husband changed his schedule at work to
accommodate his classes at ASU, he's been home during the day.
Every day. That's the same ``every day'' when I'm trying to work
and get stuff done.
</P>
<P>
   So, all summer long, I waited impatiently for the first day of
school to hurry up and get here, and it had finally arrived. As a
wife, I saw it as my duty to make sure it was a flawless experience
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I was preparing him was because I didn't want him
coming back. I don't mean ``ever,'' I just mean in the ``when it's
light outside'' sense. Having both of us home when I was supposed
to be at my most productive wasn't exactly working out.
</P>
<P>
   Being that he had signed up for Spanish this semester, he
decided that a great way to get a healthy head start would be to
watch Spanish soap operas in the morning to get a firm ``grasp'' of
the language.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be in my office, typing away, when I'd hear him make a deep
sigh and slap his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Miguel thinking?'' I'd hear him say to himself. ``He
has a perfectly good family, a nice home, kids, and he's throwing
it all away for that promiscuo An-hell! What an idioto! Can't you
see, Miguel? She's bad! She's a bad, bad senorita!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthill and Miguel can't hear you,'' I yelled back. ``But I
can. And I'm WORKING.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's An-hell, honey,'' he tried to explain. ``An-hell, or, I
guess to a gringa like you, it's just plain Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd be rapidly approaching a deadline when he'd poke his head
around the corner, rub his stomach and say, ``I'm hungry. Want to
get something to eat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Macaroni and cheese in the cupboard,'' I'd respond without
looking up. ``But if I catch you taking stuff from the Year 2000
stockpile again, I'm going to stop WORKING and kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only one Cup of Noodles!'' he'd argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remind you of that on January 11th, when you're cold,
hungry and bored because you can't watch Spanish TV since the world
has come to a grinding halt,'' I replied. ``And we've just eaten
the last jar of the Vienna sausages and canned creamed corn.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd be in the bathroom when he'd knock on the door and
sorrowfully ask, ``Can I come in? I'm lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm WORKING!'' I'd yell.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be trying to figure out a punch line when he'd come into the
office, stand behind me, dishevel my hair and cry playfully,
``Honey! I have a great idea! Let's go to the movies!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I finally said one day. ``I would love to go to
the movies. I really would. But I can't go to the movies, and I
can't because I'm WORKING. How would you like it if I came to your
work and asked you to go to the movies? That would be torture,
wouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   He hung his head and nodded as he shuffled out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   As the first day of school came closer, I decided to prep my
husband for any emergencies that might pop up and cause him to come
running home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your classes are in the Social Sciences building,'' I said,
pointing it out on a map. ``Helpful hint here: On the second floor,
there's a clean, little-known bathroom that hardly anyone uses. You
know. In case Number 2 stages a surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' I cautioned, ``If you get lost, don't panic. Ask an
adult to point you to a big map. They're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   He just stared at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have anyone to eat lunch with?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If your shoes become untied, don't get excited. Just ask your
teacher for help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what? They have a McDonald's there! You like that!''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a friend, maybe we can have a campout in the
backyard this weekend!''
</P>
<P>
   I covered as much terrain as I could, taught him everything I
knew about ASU. As I watched him walk down the front steps of our
porch, I knew the rest was up to him.
</P>
<P>
   After I waved goodbye, I went back inside, shuffled into my
office and sat in front of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Yep.
</P>
<P>
   Just the way I like it.
</P>
<P>
   I went to work and started typing.
</P>
<P>
   It was really quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a luxury,'' I thought to myself. ``Now this is quiet!''
</P>
<P>
   I liked the quiet, I really did, but I turned on Spanish TV,
just for some background noise. Alma, Miguel's wife, had caught him
with Anthill and was trying to get both of them to eat some poison
taffy she had just made.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to work, but something felt wrong. It felt
different.
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't feel right.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I realized what it was. I was lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, I was in the car, driving at furious speeds,
switching from one lane to the next like a Road Rager.
</P>
<P>
   I was there in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I ran up the steps, taking two at a time, and scurried down the
long, sterile hall.
</P>
<P>
   I found the right door and held up my note against its large
glass window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great idea!'' the note said. ``Want to go to the movies,
honey?'' &QL;

JERRY BROWN, SOLERI DISCUSS URBAN DREAM FOR OAKLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moonbeams and wind bells: Could they show us the way out of
urban sprawl and decay?
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown and Valley artist-architect Paolo
Soleri are trying to find out.
</P>
<P>
   They are spending this week amid the concrete arches, foundries
and kilns of Soleri's futuristic Arcosanti village near Cordes
Junction, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bronze and ceramic bells sold to 50,000 tourists
annually, the mayor once known as California's ``Gov. Moonbeam'' is
shopping for pieces of philosophy to furnish his urban dream of
``elegant density.''
</P>
<P>
   In plain English, Oakland is drained by suburban development,
divided by freeways and generally depressed at being a stepsister
to San Francisco. But Brown is not waiting for a prince to appear
with a glass slipper.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to turn downtown Oakland into a viable village of
10,000 people. It will take livable housing, environmentally clean
jobs, decent schools and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give vibrancy to the city,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as blues musicians prepare to wail at a music
festival and gays get set to celebrate their heritage with a
necklace of lights around Oakland's Lake Merritt, Brown is rapping
in Arizona's high desert with Soleri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to talk and get some desert air,'' Brown joked. ``I
live next to a train station, a bus stop and a produce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Soleri said, ``We'll talk about whatever he wants to talk about.
He said he wants to get down to the nitty-gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that lies somewhere in Soleri's cosmic view of
cities. Essentially, he said, they are growing in the wrong
direction. Ever since the Big Bang, everything has been getting
back together, except the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of urban villages, we have urban hermitages,'' the
80-year-old philosopher said. ``The sprawl, the encroachment on the
land, the cost in resources, is immense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities need to grow up, not out, Soleri said, because the Earth
can't handle the sprawl and air pollution. People need to park
their cars and use solar energy as Arcosanti does, because the
planet will run out of fossil fuels for commuting and mowing lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ex-urban condition is killing us,'' Soleri said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though density can bring problems of stress and violence,
he added, ``We need to stay with it. Develop it. Make it better.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: LIVING AN AMERICAN LIFE _ IN YIDDISH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week in the Berkshire hills, 191 people gathered to play
baseball, do yoga and tai chi, sing campfire songs, dance, listen
to lectures and watch movies. It would have been an unremarkable
summer retreat, except that every word spoken was in a language
many people imagine to be if not vanished, then just ahead of the
California condor on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish-vokh, or Yiddish week, is an annual retreat organized by
Yugntruf (yugntruf(AT)yugntruf.org), a group dedicated to
preserving the language. Although many of the campers were over 60,
there were also three dozen children and teen-agers, virtually all
raised in Yiddish-speaking households. About a dozen of the campers
were not Jewish, and the vast majority of Jews were not religious.
People traveled from Uruguay, Denmark and England _ and Japan,
which has in recent years sent a large contingent. Interest in
Yiddish there is mainly due to the country's World War II history.
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish is the language of Eastern and Central European Jews. It
is written with Hebrew letters but is mainly Germanic, with some
words from Hebrew and Slavic languages. Before World War II, of
course, Yiddish was the daily language of millions. But then came
the Holocaust, and the abandonment of Yiddish by Jews who
immigrated to America, Canada, Argentina or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Yiddish is not at risk of extinction. It is used
daily by about 700,000 people worldwide _ in large part
ultra-Orthodox Hasidim, who tend to have very large families.
According to Joshua Fishman, a sociolinguist retired from the
graduate school of Yeshiva University in New York, in about 25
years their birth rate will cause daily Yiddish usage in America to
grow in absolute terms, even as elderly Jewish immigrants die out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hasidim will not maintain the language's literary
treasures. A small group of secular Jews, who feel little kinship
with the insular Hasidic communities, is trying to preserve Yiddish
in the nonreligious world. Yiddish-vokh is one result. It began in
1976 with six students and one teacher, Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter, a
prominent Yiddish linguist who is now a senior lecturer emeritus in
Yiddish studies at Columbia University. Six years ago there were 60
campers, and this year triple that. Those who are interested in
Yiddish but do not speak it can go to Mame-loshn (Mother Tongue), a
three-day weekend convention devoted to Yiddish language and
culture held annually in the New York area, with events in Yiddish
and English. About 450 people attended last year. There is also a
smaller Mame-loshn in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are incomplete, but there is some evidence that more
students are studying Yiddish in American universities. The fall of
Communism has also produced a wave of new Yiddish students _ Jews
and especially non-Jews _ in Poland, Germany and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Fishman believes that the rise of secular interest in Yiddish in
part reflects new attention to all ``heritage'' languages. But the
circumstances of Yiddish are unique. ``It might be the famous
longing for roots,'' says Schaechter. ``But for a number of people
it's that a generation is dying.'' Their children are now searching
for connections with their parents' world. Often, music provides
that emotional link, and Schaechter believes that the new
popularity of klezmer music has also provoked an interest in
Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   Schaechter and his family seem to be trying to keep Yiddish
breathing by themselves. He and his wife, Charne, raised their four
children in Yiddish. All now use it with their own families. One
daughter, Gitl Schaechter-Viswanath, met her husband at
Yiddish-vokh. She speaks to their three children in Yiddish, he in
his mame-loshn, Tamil. Schaechter's son, Binyumen, a composer who
also organizes Yiddish-vokh, met his wife, Carol, at a picnic of
Yugntruf, which has brought together at least a dozen other couples
in Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish is still a language in which boy and girl step out,
strikes and balls are called and Pokemon cards are disputed. But
these are no longer naturally occurring events. When Schaechter and
two others founded Yugntruf, which means ``Call to Youth,'' 35
years ago, it was for people in their teens and 20s. Today some of
its most ardent members are in their 50s, young only by the
standards of a language kept alive in the modern world by force of
love alone.

EDITORIAL: NEW DEMANDS ON THE FAA  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the airport this summer often seemed like a roll of
the dice. You never knew what would happen when you got there. For
many travelers, the last three months have been one long nightmare
of traffic delays, missed connections and canceled flights. In a
new report, the Federal Aviation Administration confirms that
things were just about as bad as everyone thought they were. The
FAA also assumes much of the blame. That shows commendable candor,
but the important thing now is for the agency and the airlines to
move quickly to unblock a clogged system.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for the first eight months of the year show that
delays over all ran nearly 20 percent ahead of the same period last
year, and that things really began to fall apart in late spring.
May showed a 30 percent increase in delays over last year, July an
astounding 75 percent increase _ from 25,672 delays in 1998 to
44,661 this year. A delayed flight is technically one that is more
than 15 minutes late. This year's delays, however, have averaged
about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA identified three main reasons for the increase. First,
an unexpected jump in demand persuaded the carriers to add about
600 flights per day in the summer months, which in turn jammed up
runways and air space, especially in what the FAA calls ``the
golden triangle'' bounded by Chicago, Boston and Washington. The
second reason was an unusual run of bad weather, which accounted
for about three-fourths of all delays. The third was the
introduction of new work stations for controllers in 21 ``en-route
centers'' that handle high-altitude traffic between major airports.
</P>
<P>
   This last factor is interesting because it shows that
state-of-the-art equipment can sometimes have perverse
consequences. In this case, many air traffic controllers were
uncomfortable with the new work stations, and while they were
learning to use them, they decided to slow down traffic by
increasing the space between aircraft from the legal minimum of 5
miles to as many as 90 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes a menu of remedial actions, and the agency
says it has already embarked on three of the most important. It has
begun to reduce spacing between planes in the air, consistent with
safety requirements, and is trying to work out a new system to
minimize delays on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the agency is giving its Air Traffic
Control System Command Center, in Herndon, Va., broader authority
over regional and local air traffic centers _ including final say
over spacing and ground delays. The reasoning here is that the
command center has a much better picture of weather conditions
around the country, overall traffic patterns and the congestion
problems at individual airports.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, of course, can do only so much. More people are flying,
and the airlines are putting more planes in the air. But only the
agency is in a position to ration air space in a timely, safe and
efficient manner.

IMPORTING POVERTY: ARIZONA TOPS U.S. IN POOR IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan couple had been discussing the matter for about
10 minutes. What to do, buy a $5 or $10 long-distance calling card?
</P>
<P>
   Marta Jordan, co-owner of Tienda Centroamericana, smiled as she
waited at the cash register. Like so many of her customers in the
2400 block of East McDowell Road, the immigrants' hopes are held
down by a menial paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   So Jordan was anything but surprised by a think tank's study
that gave Phoenix and the state a dubious national distinction: No.
1 for percentage of immigrant families living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report released Thursday by the non-profit Center
for Immigrant Studies in Washington, D.C., about 37 percent of
immigrants in Phoenix and 36 percent statewide fall below the
poverty level. That's about 10 percentage points higher than the
closest city, Houston, and closest state, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which doesn't track with what state officials say
they're seeing, used the federal poverty line: a family of four
that has an annual income of less than $16,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona stands out as a huge problem area,'' said Steven
Camarota, author of the report, ``Importing Poverty.'' ``It really
jumped off the page during our research. The immigrant poverty is
just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Camarota said the number of people in poverty living in
immigrant households in Arizona has nearly tripled to 330,000 from
113,000 during the 1990s. During that same time, immigrant
households rose to 41 percent from 20 percent of the total of
poverty-level households.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of native-born households in poverty
throughout Arizona declined, Camarota said. The gap between
earnings in immigrant homes and native-born homes in Arizona, he
said, is more than twice as large as in any other state in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics come as a shock to Vince Wood, assistant
director of the state Department of Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cash-assistance welfare roles are becoming more Native
American and less Hispanic,'' Wood said. ``Also, some states with
large immigration numbers have put in state-funded food-stamp
programs for the immigrant population. There's been no discussion
of that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican consulate officials stationed in Phoenix have estimated
that 300,000 Mexicans live in the Valley, about three times as many
as 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Sonchik, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that migration from Mexico is about 90
percent of the Valley's total.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Isidro, Mexico's deputy consul general in Phoenix,
refused to comment on the poverty report.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Camarota said, the poverty rate of immigrant
households grew to 22 percent from 15 percent of the national total
from 1979 through 1997, while the gap in the number of immigrant
households and native-born households in poverty tripled during
that time.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of immigrant poverty in the United State has been
the fodder of much academic research in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Heaven's Door: Immigration Policy and the
American Economy,'' George Borjas, who left Princeton University
recently for the University of California-Santa Barbara, wrote that
a surge of immigration to this country is allowing a huge transfer
of wealth from the poorest in the land to the richest. Borjas also
wrote that immigrant children today are far more likely to remain
in poor, segregated communities.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute, a
pro-immigrant think tank in Washington, D.C., said such theories
and the immigrant-poverty report are very misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely misses the big picture,'' Moore said. ``We've
had 20 million immigrants come to this country during the past 20
years, and we've had the greatest economic expansion in the history
of the world. And a lot of that is because of immigration, not
despite it. For native-born Americans, immigration has been an
economic blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore also said that his research indicates that earnings of
immigrant households rapidly narrow the gap with native-born
households after immigrant families are in this nation for more
than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studies indicate that within 15 years of coming to this
country, immigrants on the average make as much as the native-born
population,'' Moore said. ``If you look at those who are in the
country for 15-20 years, their poverty rate is less than people
born in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the store owner from El Salvador, hopes some of that
wealth starts finding its way to her soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said she and her husband, Orlando, and two small
children, only wish that they could earn $16,400 a year with their
store, which they opened this year. They're in the process of
getting a bank loan to buy the building, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   She surveyed the shelves, full of such items as pumpkin seeds
from Guatemala, bottled figs and papaya from Colombia and fava
beans from Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would surprise me if we ever had a family who makes more
than $20,000 a year come in here,'' Jordan said. &QL;

PATRIOTS GET KICK IN THE TEETH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ You have to cut through the very thick maze of
excitement _ field goals of 58 yards (by Adam Vinatieri) with three
seconds and the winner of 61 (by John Kasay) with one second left
to get a feel for the Patriots' 23-20 loss to the Carolina Panthers
that left New England with a 1-3 exhibition record.
</P>
<P>
   The kicks are probably the longest back-to-back field goals in
the history of the NFL, but they came in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is precisely what Pete Carroll said it was at
the end of this heart-thumper: ``Our best football is definitely
ahead of us.'' It had better be. For when the bell rings Sept. 12
and Bill Parcells is staring out at his old players with that
hypnotizing look, the Patriots' first offense has to do better than
make one first down in five series in the first half, they must
convert more short-yardage situations, and they must do better than
go 5 for 14 on third-down conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do better on both sides on third down,'' said
Carroll, who watched Carolina convert 8 of 15 such opportunities.
``We're not getting what we need to get and that had better change
in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe (3 for 8, 16 yards, one sack) took the blame for
the first offense not being able to score in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoulder the blame for that,'' said Bledsoe, who was
fighting the flu. ``I had Terry (Glenn) wide open on one and I
didn't get him the ball. I was disappointed that we weren't able to
be more efficient our last time out before the season starts. But
we have to do it when we go out there against the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tied the score, 20-20, with three seconds remaining
on a 58-yard field goal by Vinatieri, who had hit a 28-yarder in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised those balls could carry like that,'' said
Vinatieri, ``but it was a great night to kick. I thought time had
run out after the kickoff, but they said there was time left and
wouldn't you know it, John makes one from that far. He's a great
kicker so it doesn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' kickoff was not an ``onside'' kick as originally
thought, according to Carroll. The coach said Vinatieri
``chili-dipped it'' meaning Vinatieri was supposed to hit it on the
ground up the middle, but miskicked and it had the appearance and
went the distance of an onside kick. Panthers linebacker Spencer
Reid recovered at the Patriots' 44-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots argued that the clock should have run out, but the
officials seemed to give the hometown team one more shot, and Kasay
hit a long, low line drive that made it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the balls are juiced,'' quipped Carolina coach George
Seifert. ``John has the strongest leg I've ever been involved
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this would have been close if it wasn't for
Bishop. He performed a Flutie-like miracle, connecting with former
Brown receiver Sean Morey on a 47-yard bomb after avoiding head-on
traffic as if he were driving on the Southeast Expressway. That put
the ball at the 15. Just two plays later, Bishop landed a touchdown
pass to third-string tight end Henry Lusk in the back of the end
zone with 3:53 left, giving the Patriots a 17-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Panthers had their own bag of tricks as young Dameyune
Craig led the Panthers right back down field, ending a 64-yard
drive with a 1-yard quarterback sneak with 1:32 left that gave the
Panthers a 20-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bishop got the Patriots close enough again for Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, there were positives: a strong pass rush from
Willie McGinest and Greg Spires, a nice job at the middle
linebacker spot by Marty Moore, and a 32-yard interception return
by safety Kadar Hamilton (son of Patriots defensive line coach
Ray), who spelled the injured Tony George (left knee) on the second
defensive unit. Moore, who finished with five tackles, had to fill
in for Andy Katzenmoyer, who sprained his right ankle in the first
quarter, but the Patriots say he will make it back for the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense had its finest moment in the first quarter
when McGinest and Katzenmoyer stuffed William Floyd's attempt from
the 1, and then on fourth down McGinest blew past Floyd for his
third sack of the exhibition season, a 5-yard loss of Steve
Beuerlein.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots experimented with Terry Allen early in the second
quarter. The veteran broke open a 9-yard run, but on third and 1,
precisely Allen's moment in the game, he was stuffed by linebacker
Mike Barrow, who got through the line on Bruce Armstrong's side to
stop Allen for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, using their third quarterback, veteran Steve Bono,
broke the deadlock with a 40-yard drive that culminated with a
9-yard pass from Bono to Iheanyi Uwaezuoke over the middle that
beat Kato Serwanga, playing the left corner on the Patriots' second
defense. Kasay added the extra point to give the Panthers a 10-3
lead with 10:08 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Right after that, Kevin Faulk debuted as a kick returner and
took his first chance 45 yards before he ran out of room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to use Kevin on kickoffs,'' said Carroll. ``You
can see the new dimension he adds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers added to the lead with a 30-yard field goal by
Kasay with 1:58 remaining. Patriots defensive end Willie Cohens
saved further damage by sacking Bono for a 6-yard loss on third and
goal from the 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' second offense put up the taem's first touchdown
with 10:20 remaining when John Friesz directed a 12-play, 70-yard
drive, utilizing Tony Simmons's receiving and Lamont Warren's
running. Warren made a key third and 1 from the Carolina 3 with a
2-yard run then took it in for the final yard, making it 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for the Patriots, all the good things happened
on offense when the players who don't play much (save for
Vinatieri) were in the game. The Jets scouted the game
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, and don't think they didn't notice.

IT'S NOT A LOST CAUSE FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Sometime Friday, Pete Carroll and his
assistant coaches will huddle in Foxborough and discuss Patriots
issues. You are not invited to their exclusive football party, but
it doesn't matter, because you should know what they have to say.
They will use a lot of football terminology which, when stripped to
its core, translates to this: The Patriots have got problems.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean New England should prepare itself for a
5-11 season. Fortunately for the Patriots, some of their exhibition
season issues can be dealt with easily. They need a kickoff
returner and Kevin Faulk is the best man for the job. They should
give it to him. They have a veteran backup quarterback, which is
the solid thing to do in the NFL. But I think it's obvious that the
backup job should go to rookie Michael Bishop rather than 10-year
veteran John Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of replacing safety Willie Clay? No problem. The
only Willie who had a worse 1998 than Clay was Willie Jefferson
Clinton. I still don't understand why Clay is described as if he
were a young Ronnie Lott when, as one team official said, ``He was
a good gamesman, but this stuff about him calling all the defensive
signals is (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   So all of the above issues can be put in a neat laundry pile and
easily washed away. But are the Pats ready to play the Jets in nine
days? Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at Ericsson Stadium, they ended their
exhibition season with a 23-20 loss to the Panthers, a team that
will most likely finish 5-11 in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The game was lost with one second remaining. Kicker Adam
Vinatieri tried to pull off a squib kick, but it fell about 15
yards short of where he wanted it to go. He had just finished
making an improbable 58-yarder to tie the game at 20 with three
seconds left. After the too-short kick, Panthers kicker John Kasay
lined up for a 61-yard field goal. Considering that the league's
new footballs are supposed to take 5 yards off most kicks, the
attempt seemed ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Kasay made it. Now football and baseball have something in
common: People will accuse both sports of having juiced balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Pats now have a 1-3 record to show for their exhibition
season. They have a rookie center and a further depleted group of
linebackers (Andy Katzenmoyer hurt an ankle Thursday &UR;  &LR; night). Is it
time to worry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people who are more worried than I am,''
cornerback Ty Law said. ``But I'm not, because I realize a few
things. First of all, we're all going to be out there for 60
minutes when the season starts. In the preseason, a lot of us are
wearing hats and eating sunflower seeds in the third quarter. It's
not going to be like that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know what kind of talent we have on this team. You look
at the teams in the AFC who are supposed to be the best and we
match up with all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is right. The Broncos have a great offensive line and the
best running back in the game, but they also have a rookie
quarterback in Brian Griese and a sulking Bubby Brister backing him
up. If the Jaguars remain healthy, I cannot see how anyone will be
able to stop their offense. When you're building an offense you
want a great left tackle, good running back, and above-average
quarterback. They have all three. Their weakness is defense. And
then there are the Jets. Not only are they good, but the Pats have
an almost insane desire to beat them on Sept. 12. They may say on
the record that this is just another game, but it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   There are still coaching/management struggles going on between
these teams. There is speculation among some in the organization
that Jet coaches still contact certain defensive players and
critique them on their technique. The inference is twofold: that
the Jets are tampering and trying to undermine the power of
Carroll's staff.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, though, the issues don't have such a
conspiratorial sound. It appears to be obvious that the Patriots
starters won't have a problem defending the pass with Steve Israel
now opposite Law. But the key defensive players are Henry Thomas
and Chad Eaton. Thomas did not play the entire exhibition season.
If you are an optimist, you have to hope that is the reason teams
sliced through the middle of New England's defense with ease. Going
along with that optimistic line of thought, you have to hope that
Eaton did not play as well in the four fake games because he did
not have Thomas alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   No one should worry about this team's offense. Before
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 16-yard meltdown, Drew Bledsoe had completed 70
percent of his passes. More important, defenses are going to have
to consider gearing most of their focus toward stopping Terry
Glenn. The offense alone makes the Pats an 8-8 team.
</P>
<P>
   But one-dimensional, 8-8 teams usually don't make the playoffs.
The difference between them and 10-6 postseason participants is
balance. The Pats will be a 10-win team if Thomas and Eaton stay on
the field. It's as simple as that. For now, they get the benefit of
saying that their previous four games didn't matter. They didn't
count. The counting starts in nine days.

RUNAWAY FILMING ISSUE FESTERS AS TAX-CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Legislation aimed at using tax breaks to slow
runaway entertainment production has suffered a setback in
Sacramento but a key assemblyman insisted Thursday that the measure
remains alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until the fat lady sings on Sept. 9,'' said
Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, referring to the end of this
year's legislative session. ``I'm going to fight like hell until
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman's bill, AB 358, hit a major snag this week when the
Senate Appropriations Committee put off considering the measure,
which has been approved by the Assembly. Hollywood's below-the-line
work force has lobbied forcefully for the legislation, contending
that lucrative Canadian incentives have lured thousands of jobs out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also failed to consider a similar bill, AB 484,
authored by Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino, due to strong
indications from Gov. Gray Davis that he will not sign into law any
tax-credit legislation this year. Kuehl aide Jennifer Richard said
Davis has said he won't set aside money to pay for the tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance these bills will pass,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Thursday, ``The
governor has not taken a formal position on these bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman said he plans to present evidence to Davis that Canada's
incentives are eroding Hollywood's economic base to a greater
extent than was described in a recent Monitor Co. report, which
showed 23,500 full-time jobs were lost last year to runaway
production at a cost of $10.3 billion. That study also found 81
percent of runaways had gone to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to stress the critical nature of the crisis,
because we are seeing a dramatic increase in job loss based on
evidence I've seen in my district,'' Wildman said. ``We're seeing
it in decreased patronage of restaurants and stores. Every day we
delay, it's another day for Canada to take away jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildman's bill would give producers a 10 percent tax refund on
labor costs for films and TV shows that either incur at least 75
percent of labor costs in California or perform 75 percent of their
principal photography in the state. The state Department of Finance
has calculated the bill would lower state revenues by $90 million
annually but Wildman disputes that figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument is that the tax credit will generate more revenue
than we lose in taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To cut the cost to the state, Kuehl's bill has been amended to
exempt TV commercials from the tax breaks, along with making only
the first year of a TV series and the first three weeks of a
mini-series eligible for tax breaks.

HOLLYWOOD TIGHTENS BELT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's entertainment production activity
outside studio lots has continued to trail last year's figures, as
movie producers keep an increasingly closer eye on the bottom line,
statistics released Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall for-profit production fell 2.5 percent in August to
2,836 days, dragged down by a 14.8 percent slide in feature-film
production, according to the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feature-film location shooting is continuing to lag as studios
commit to fewer films and smaller budgets,'' said EIDC chief Cody
Cluff. ``We are also seeing many projects get green-lighted and
then postponed, because it appears studios are making certain the
scripts are completely in order before starting into production.
That was not necessarily true in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff also said runaway production to lower-cost locales such as
Canada has held down movie production, mostly among independent
producers and studios, but noted the region still draws the lion's
share of most major productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting some good commitments such as `Mission:
Impossible 2,' which has been shot mostly in Australia, and `13
Days,' '' said Cluff, who has been forecasting for many months that
bottom-line pressures will keep 1999's movie production flat or
slightly below the 1998 level. ``We can't get absolutely
everything, and what we're typically losing is lower-budget TV and
independent features.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which handles about 80 percent of the county's
off-lot permitting, also reported that August production of
commercials jumped 20.4 percent while TV shoots edged up 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff predicted TV production, down 8.7 percent for the year,
will surge in the coming months to equal last year's level, while
commercials will continue to grow in strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started to see TV come off its hiatus, and we expect it
to be a very solid year, although our figures don't reflect the
episodic shows on soundstages,'' he said. ``And commercial
production is just screaming right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Production activity in Los Angeles County soared between 1994
and 1997 due to the improved economy, global demand for American
entertainment and a streamlined permitting process. Production then
dipped last year as out-of-areas with lower fees attracted runaway
projects.

<P>
   When that Grand Old Man of Victorian England, William Ewart
Gladstone, was in his 85th year, he was steering the second
home-rule bill for Ireland through a recalcitrant parliament and
going home to translate the odes of Horace at night.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan reached the tender age of 73, he was fighting
his second presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the world's most successful central banker, is
also 73.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and economics are plainly jobs that the old can do
well. They are not alone. The boardrooms of the world's big
companies are full of non-executive sages, telling whippersnapper
40-somethings how to run their firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are so few of the rich world's older folk in
employment? They live longer and enjoy better health than their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs have become less physically demanding; most people in
late middle age are well educated; most evidence suggests that
training older workers, if done sensibly, is no harder than
training the young. But the figures show an astonishing and
long-drawn-out retreat from the job market.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, men could expect to spend 50 of their 68
years of life in paid work. Today, they are likely to work for only
38 of their 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of men in their late 50s and early 60s are
in the rich world's labor force. Indeed, by the time they celebrate
their 55th birthday, more than half of Europe's men have gone home
to translate Horace.
</P>
<P>
   For most, that is something to celebrate. Never before have so
many people been able to look forward to so many years of healthy
leisure. Two-thirds of people say that they like being retired and
have no desire to go back to work. There are grandchildren to
enjoy, foreign countries to visit, books to read and golf games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures of old age are less expensive, and more widely
available, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether all of this retirement is voluntary.
It is worth asking for its own sake; in a liberal society, the old,
too, should be free to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition, the stampede to retire has consequences not
merely for the old themselves. And it is often being encouraged by
perverse public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread and early retirement will increasingly affect the
lives of everyone else, for two reasons. The first is a familiar
one: as the share of old folk in the population rises, so will the
burden on the young of paying for their pensions and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The second is less discussed: the rise of the grey-headed
leisured class has consequences for economic growth, because of its
impact on the supply of labor and of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments, their eyes focused on the impact that future
pensions claims will have on public finances, have embarked on
reforms _ but not always reforms that give pensioners a freer
choice. For their eyes are also trained, in the shorter term, on
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in Western Europe, are pressing more
people to retire early, on the mistaken view that this will provide
jobs for the young, even as they try to trim pensioners'
entitlements in order to reduce the burden on public finances.
</P>
<P>
   This is unforgivable from a liberal point of view. It is also
foolish from the perspective of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the baby-boom generation that starts to reach
retirement age over the coming decade means that there will be a
simple, but huge imbalance: too few people in work, paying taxes
and pension contributions; too many in retirement, drawing on
pensions and running up health costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the main alternatives will be to renege on the
pensions that workers thought they had been promised, or to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be far better for the health of economies if more older
people went on working instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quite small rises in the ages at which people retire have large
effects: as long as older folk stay in the job market, they pay
taxes (helping one side of the fiscal balance) and draw either no
pension, or a smaller one (helping the other).
</P>
<P>
   Governments should recognize that people (like politicians)
would prefer to decide for themselves when to retire. At present,
the choice is, perversely, biased in favor of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in many countries, the opportunity cost of working
beyond the minimum retirement age is high: workers must often leave
the job market in order to receive a state pension, and even where
this is not the case, they rarely earn any extra pension for their
additional taxes and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If they claim disability benefit, as many in their late 50s and
early 60s do, their pension rights are rarely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Such perverse incentives should be replaced with neutrality.
Employers, often urged on by trade unions, also put obstacles of
their own in the way of older workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pension schemes based on defined benefits make it
disproportionately expensive to offer jobs to older people. Pay
schemes that reward long service more than merit and productivity
make it disproportionately costly to keep older workers on the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And sheer discrimination, formally banned in the United States
but flourishing in most countries, persuades many older folk to go
home rather than risk probable rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   Would such changes coax 60-year-olds off the golf course? In
America, where jobs for older workers are plentiful and the
government is scrapping the tax disincentives for older folk to
work, early retirement has begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Give people a choice, and they might surprise you. &QL;

companies are full of non-executive sages, telling whippersnapper
40-somethings how to run their firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are so few of the rich world's older folk in
employment? They live longer and enjoy better health than their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs have become less physically demanding; most people in
late middle age are well educated; most evidence suggests that
training older workers, if done sensibly, is no harder than
training the young. But the figures show an astonishing and
long-drawn-out retreat from the job market.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, men could expect to spend 50 of their 68
years of life in paid work. Today, they are likely to work for only
38 of their 76 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of men in their late 50s and early 60s are
in the rich world's labor force. Indeed, by the time they celebrate
their 55th birthday, more than half of Europe's men have gone home
to translate Horace.
</P>
<P>
   For most, that is something to celebrate. Never before have so
many people been able to look forward to so many years of healthy
leisure. Two-thirds of people say that they like being retired and
have no desire to go back to work. There are grandchildren to
enjoy, foreign countries to visit, books to read and golf games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures of old age are less expensive, and more widely
available, than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether all of this retirement is voluntary.
It is worth asking for its own sake; in a liberal society, the old,
too, should be free to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition, the stampede to retire has consequences not
merely for the old themselves. And it is often being encouraged by
perverse public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread and early retirement will increasingly affect the
lives of everyone else, for two reasons. The first is a familiar
one: as the share of old folk in the population rises, so will the
burden on the young of paying for their pensions and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The second is less discussed: the rise of the grey-headed
leisured class has consequences for economic growth, because of its
impact on the supply of labor and of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments, their eyes focused on the impact that future
pensions claims will have on public finances, have embarked on
reforms _ but not always reforms that give pensioners a freer
choice. For their eyes are also trained, in the shorter term, on
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in Western Europe, are pressing more
people to retire early, on the mistaken view that this will provide
jobs for the young, even as they try to trim pensioners'
entitlements in order to reduce the burden on public finances.
</P>
<P>
   This is unforgivable from a liberal point of view. It is also
foolish from the perspective of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the baby-boom generation that starts to reach
retirement age over the coming decade means that there will be a
simple, but huge imbalance: too few people in work, paying taxes
and pension contributions; too many in retirement, drawing on
pensions and running up health costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the main alternatives will be to renege on the
pensions that workers thought they had been promised, or to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be far better for the health of economies if more older
people went on working instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quite small rises in the ages at which people retire have large
effects: as long as older folk stay in the job market, they pay
taxes (helping one side of the fiscal balance) and draw either no
pension, or a smaller one (helping the other).
</P>
<P>
   Governments should recognize that people (like politicians)
would prefer to decide for themselves when to retire. At present,
the choice is, perversely, biased in favor of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in many countries, the opportunity cost of working
beyond the minimum retirement age is high: workers must often leave
the job market in order to receive a state pension, and even where
this is not the case, they rarely earn any extra pension for their
additional taxes and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If they claim disability benefit, as many in their late 50s and
early 60s do, their pension rights are rarely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Such perverse incentives should be replaced with neutrality.
Employers, often urged on by trade unions, also put obstacles of
their own in the way of older workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pension schemes based on defined benefits make it
disproportionately expensive to offer jobs to older people. Pay
schemes that reward long service more than merit and productivity
make it disproportionately costly to keep older workers on the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And sheer discrimination, formally banned in the United States
but flourishing in most countries, persuades many older folk to go
home rather than risk probable rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   Would such changes coax 60-year-olds off the golf course? In
America, where jobs for older workers are plentiful and the
government is scrapping the tax disincentives for older folk to
work, early retirement has begun to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Give people a choice, and they might surprise you. &QL;

<P>
   These are bleak times for South Americans. Brazil is recovering
from its chaotic January devaluation, but living standards have
fallen. Most of Spanish-speaking South America is in deep
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has announced the first-ever default on Brady bonds, the
instrument created to forgive (mainly) Latin American countries
some of their debts to commercial banks from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Markets have become increasingly nervous about Argentina's
ability to maintain the fixed exchange rate that has underpinned a
decade of growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries about political stability too. In Colombia,
peace talks with the largest guerrilla group seem to have foundered
before they have properly started.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is acting like an elected
dictator: in August a constituent assembly dominated by his people
dissolved Congress and intervened in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere, governments are deeply unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is now more than a decade since much of Latin America
embraced democracy and liberal economic reform, such a panorama is
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some Latin American politicians _ such as Chavez,
Roberto Madrazo, a populist challenger for the presidential
candidacy of Mexico's ruling party, and the leaders of Brazil's
Workers Party _ go on to claim that what they call ``savage
neo-liberalism'' has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets, too, have been severe. For example, Brazil's
sovereign bonds are trading at a punishing 11 percentage points
over those of the United States Treasury, while a rally earlier
this year in the region's stock markets petered out when the United
States raised its interest rates in May.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is far more nuanced. Note first the strength of
Mexico's economy: thanks to NAFTA, it now follows that of the
United States, rather than those to the south, as investors have
started to recognize. The same goes, to a lesser extent, for
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the severity and length of South America's recession
owes much to external shocks and cyclical factors. These include
investors' 1997-98 flight from all emerging markets, low prices for
commodities, and last year's devastating El Nino weather.
</P>
<P>
   As such factors recede, growth will resume. And a return to
authoritarian rule is unthinkable in much of southern South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither can the current setbacks be quite so easily
dismissed. Even in the better-placed countries, economic recovery
may not be swift.
</P>
<P>
   South America remains uncomfortably dependent on commodity
exports and on foreign capital. It needs further reform, especially
of financial systems (to reduce the cost of credit), and to foster
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   A particular question mark hangs over Argentina. Advisers to
Fernando de la Rua, the front-runner for next month's presidential
election, say their man would quickly push through radical fiscal
and other reforms, to boost competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But they must act quickly, if Argentina is to grow again _ the
main test for its exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Andes, the worries go even deeper. Colombia's
normally robust economy is in its worst recession since the 1930s,
brought low by fiscal and banking problems but also by worsening
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' increased strength (which owes more to drug
money than political support) has undermined confidence. This week,
a general strike added to the government's problems. Colombia's
best hope is to try to contain the guerrillas militarily, and to
try again to coax them into talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador is a mess: banks have collapsed, GDP may shrink by
perhaps 7 percent, and Jamil Mahuad, the fourth president in as
many years, will struggle to get congressional approval for the
fiscal and banking measures needed to secure IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Chavez has swept away a corrupt and self-serving
political elite, but risks making matters worse. He shows few signs
of fostering independent democratic institutions, or of addressing
Venezuela's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a doubling of the oil price, the economy may contract by
6 percent this year, largely because of business mistrust of his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ecuador and Venezuela, both accustomed to the easy money of
oil, have been notoriously resistant to free markets and fiscal
discipline. And until Chavez has more economic success, he is
hardly likely to inspire imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are testament to lack of reform, rather than to
its failure. But they are also reminders of just how hard a task
would-be reformers can face ) _ and of how far much of the rest of
South America has come, despite its current ills. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In education, only one thing counts: the chance of a good school
for every child. This is the thinking behind America's voucher
schemes, which use public money, voted by state legislatures, to
provide education credits for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these, parents can send their children to whatever
schools they choose, public or private.
</P>
<P>
   More power to them, you might think. But vouchers are so
controversial that their spread around the country has been
glacial.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, vouchers simply allow parental choice to operate,
forcing the worst public schools to improve themselves if they want
to keep pupils (and the education money that follows them).
</P>
<P>
   But some inevitably sink; and this has created opposition to
vouchers not only among teachers' unions, but the public at large.
Polls show Americans equally divided for and against them and, as a
result, every scheme ends up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest decision, on Aug. 24, a federal judge in Ohio
struck down the voucher scheme in Cleveland, giving parents one
term's grace before suspending it. The judge did not argue that the
scheme had hurt the public schools, but that it constituted an
``advancement of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland the vast majority of the 4,000 children in the
voucher plan have left public schools for Catholic ones. This means
that taxpayers' money, previously allocated to the public schools,
has been transferred to parochial ones, often run by nuns and with
crucifixes prominent in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transfer appears to contradict the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which requires that the government stay neutral and
distant from all religious matters.
</P>
<P>
   It means that state money, hedged about with state conditions,
ends up in schools whose first purpose is to teach the tenets of a
particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   Why this has happened is no mystery. Parochial schools, although
often in the distressed centers of cities, have better discipline
and get better results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in a long line of cases the Supreme Court has
insisted not only that government should not help in advancing
religion, but that it should avoid ``excessive entanglement'' in
it. This has been applied even in the most minor cases, such as
lending secular textbooks or reimbursement for state tests.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever state money comes close to religious schools,
government regulation is called in to check that religion is not
thereby promoted. Hence ``entanglement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet America's government is hardly consistent in its behavior.
Even while excluding most support for religious schools, the Court
has raised no objections to individuals getting tax breaks for
donating money to their churches or synagogues (which in turn
support schools).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Court has extended tax exemptions to churches as
charities, and decided that it must not discriminate between
religious charities and the rest; but the effect is the same, that
state money is funnelled towards religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Should not the Court, by the same token, rule swiftly in favor
of voucher schemes like Cleveland's? So far it has been silent,
which is increasingly unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Court should either ban both religious tax breaks
and the use of vouchers for religious schools, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to be truly zealous about separating church and state
in its traditional sense of outlawing the indirect flow of public
money to sectarian schools (as opposed, say, to preventing the
establishment of a state religion) then the logic of its position
is that it should also outlaw tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is unlikely in the near term. So advocates of vouchers
_ which include this newspaper _ had better settle for second best:
a swift ruling, in line with its previous position, that vouchers
cannot be used in religious schools. And then vouchers will be free
to help improve the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is worse: that, embroiled in religious
controversy, voucher schemes could become so contentious that they
might disappear.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a great pity, since vouchers provide many of the
poorest children with their only means of escape from awful
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And by restricting vouchers to secular schools, the Court would
at least encourage the creation of a thriving market in secular
education, public and private, which could attract more of the
corporations and philanthropists who are already interested in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Every American _ in time _ would then acquire the opportunity to
choose good secular schools over bad. Religious schools would feel
the pressure of more competition. But that might just make them try
even harder. &QL;

<P>
   In education, only one thing counts: the chance of a good school
for every child. This is the thinking behind America's voucher
schemes, which use public money, voted by state legislatures, to
provide education credits for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these, parents can send their children to whatever
schools they choose, public or private.
</P>
<P>
   More power to them, you might think. But vouchers are so
controversial that their spread around the country has been
glacial.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, vouchers simply allow parental choice to operate,
forcing the worst public schools to improve themselves if they want
to keep pupils (and the education money that follows them).
</P>
<P>
   But some inevitably sink; and this has created opposition to
vouchers not only among teachers' unions, but the public at large.
Polls show Americans equally divided for and against them and, as a
result, every scheme ends up in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest decision, on Aug. 24, a federal judge in Ohio
struck down the voucher scheme in Cleveland, giving parents one
term's grace before suspending it. The judge did not argue that the
scheme had hurt the public schools, but that it constituted an
``advancement of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland the vast majority of the 4,000 children in the
voucher plan have left public schools for Catholic ones. This means
that taxpayers' money, previously allocated to the public schools,
has been transferred to parochial ones, often run by nuns and with
crucifixes prominent in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transfer appears to contradict the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which requires that the government stay neutral and
distant from all religious matters.
</P>
<P>
   It means that state money, hedged about with state conditions,
ends up in schools whose first purpose is to teach the tenets of a
particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   Why this has happened is no mystery. Parochial schools, although
often in the distressed centers of cities, have better discipline
and get better results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in a long line of cases the Supreme Court has
insisted not only that government should not help in advancing
religion, but that it should avoid ``excessive entanglement'' in
it. This has been applied even in the most minor cases, such as
lending secular textbooks or reimbursement for state tests.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever state money comes close to religious schools,
government regulation is called in to check that religion is not
thereby promoted. Hence ``entanglement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet America's government is hardly consistent in its behavior.
Even while excluding most support for religious schools, the Court
has raised no objections to individuals getting tax breaks for
donating money to their churches or synagogues (which in turn
support schools).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Court has extended tax exemptions to churches as
charities, and decided that it must not discriminate between
religious charities and the rest; but the effect is the same, that
state money is funnelled towards religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Should not the Court, by the same token, rule swiftly in favor
of voucher schemes like Cleveland's? So far it has been silent,
which is increasingly unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Court should either ban both religious tax breaks
and the use of vouchers for religious schools, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to be truly zealous about separating church and state
in its traditional sense of outlawing the indirect flow of public
money to sectarian schools (as opposed, say, to preventing the
establishment of a state religion) then the logic of its position
is that it should also outlaw tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is unlikely in the near term. So advocates of vouchers
_ which include this newspaper _ had better settle for second best:
a swift ruling, in line with its previous position, that vouchers
cannot be used in religious schools. And then vouchers will be free
to help improve the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is worse: that, embroiled in religious
controversy, voucher schemes could become so contentious that they
might disappear.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a great pity, since vouchers provide many of the
poorest children with their only means of escape from awful
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And by restricting vouchers to secular schools, the Court would
at least encourage the creation of a thriving market in secular
education, public and private, which could attract more of the
corporations and philanthropists who are already interested in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Every American _ in time _ would then acquire the opportunity to
choose good secular schools over bad. Religious schools would feel
the pressure of more competition. But that might just make them try
even harder. &QL;

<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM _ On the roads of North Carolina it is not unusual
to see cars sporting bumper stickers that pointedly proclaim
``Tobacco pays my bills'' or ``I smoke and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This state leads the nation in tobacco production, and three of
the country's five biggest cigarette manufacturers are based here.
The state's leaders have never shown much enthusiasm for the
campaign against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina did sign on to last year's $360 billion
settlement of lawsuits against cigarette makers, but according to
the attorney-general's office it did so primarily ``to bring
much-needed stability to the tobacco industry and the tobacco
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As one state legislator put it, ``In North Carolina, tobacco is
as sacred as a cow in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Carolinians think of the cigarette companies as good
corporate citizens. The tobacco industry is still widely seen as a
positive force in places like Winston-Salem, which has lent its
name to two leading cigarette brands.
</P>
<P>
   The state's fourth-largest city owes its place as a commercial
and industrial center to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which
was established there in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the impact of the tobacco industry on
Winston-Salem has been huge would be an understatement,'' says a
former mayor, Martha Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the tobacco industry's influence on Winston-Salem's
development is easy to find. Tobacco leaves feature in the city's
seal, and a statue of the young R.J. Reynolds riding into town on
horseback stands outside the city hall.
</P>
<P>
   A high school, an auditorium, a park and the airport are named
after members of the Reynolds family, and R.J. Reynolds's summer
home is now an art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from cigarette sales helped to establish three
charitable foundations, and tobacco money went into bringing Wake
Forest University to the city in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette company continues to have a major impact on
Winston-Salem's civic life. RJR provides high-paying jobs to more
than 7,000 people in the area, and the company has given $16.9
million to community groups over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   As a grateful executive at a Winston-Salem charity told a local
newspaper, ``We would not enjoy the fine quality of life that we do
without the presence of RJR.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in cities that owe their existence to the tobacco industry,
however, times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic cigarette consumption down by about a third since
1970, and a series of lawsuits aimed at cigarette makers,
communities that have long relied on tobacco now want to diversify
their economies.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, cigarette manufacturing is no longer the
primary engine of growth. RJR has lost much of its market share
since the early 1980s, and it closed its downtown factories more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of the city's tax levy dropped from 18
percent in 1988 to 6 percent in 1998, and the size of its local
work force has fallen by half.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco has slipped, medicine and banking have grown in
importance. The university-affiliated hospital has surpassed RJR as
the largest employer in the county.
</P>
<P>
   As the home of two large regional banks, this city of 171,000
people is the 11th-biggest banking center in the country, just
behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are changing, too. In a move that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago, the city's largest shopping mall
banned smoking earlier this year. City leaders who were once
content to depend upon the tobacco industry to provide jobs are now
seeking to attract new businesses to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a real wake-up call'' when RJR began to scale down its
operations in the late 1980s, says Allen Joines, the official
responsible for economic development: ``We have become much more
aggressive since then.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the tobacco era is coming to an end.
At the beginning of last year, RJR stopped offering free public
tours of its Whitaker Park cigarette plant: the number of visitors
had fallen by two-thirds over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are looking for symbols, the fire that ripped
through a downtown block of disused RJR factories last August
destroyed Factory Number 256, which stood on the site of the
``little red factory'' in which R.J. Reynolds launched his business
more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more than an hour down the road from Winston-Salem,
Durham has moved even further away from its roots as a tobacco
town.
</P>
<P>
   The city was once the home of James B. Duke's American Tobacco
Company, which controlled more than 90 percent of the world tobacco
market until regulators broke it up in 1911. Tobacco money financed
the development of a small Methodist college, subsequently renamed
Duke University in honor of its patron.
</P>
<P>
   Durham is still the headquarters of the Liggett Group, the
fifth-largest cigarette maker in the country, but the tobacco
industry now employs less than 1 percent of the city's workers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms based in the nearby Research Triangle Park
account for 42,000 jobs in the Durham area, and Duke University
Medical Center is the county's biggest employer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In rural areas, too, the economic landscape is changing. Tobacco
growers are looking for ways to diversify their operations as the
federal government scales back its tobacco price-support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the chagrin of those of their neighbors who object to
strong odors, farmers in the state now make more money from poultry
and pig farming than they do from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many tobacco growers, deep in debt, have failed to find new
sources of income. The challenge of diversification is particularly
acute in the hilly Piedmont region, where farms are smaller than in
the flat eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians hope to ease the fears of nervous farmers by
directing much of the $4.6 billion that North Carolina is due to
receive from the tobacco settlement to communities that depend on
tobacco. Everybody hopes the tobacco companies survive long enough
to make all the payments. &QL;

to see cars sporting bumper stickers that pointedly proclaim
``Tobacco pays my bills'' or ``I smoke and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This state leads the nation in tobacco production, and three of
the country's five biggest cigarette manufacturers are based here.
The state's leaders have never shown much enthusiasm for the
campaign against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina did sign on to last year's $360 billion
settlement of lawsuits against cigarette makers, but according to
the attorney-general's office it did so primarily ``to bring
much-needed stability to the tobacco industry and the tobacco
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   As one state legislator put it, ``In North Carolina, tobacco is
as sacred as a cow in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Many North Carolinians think of the cigarette companies as good
corporate citizens. The tobacco industry is still widely seen as a
positive force in places like Winston-Salem, which has lent its
name to two leading cigarette brands.
</P>
<P>
   The state's fourth-largest city owes its place as a commercial
and industrial center to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which
was established there in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the impact of the tobacco industry on
Winston-Salem has been huge would be an understatement,'' says a
former mayor, Martha Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the tobacco industry's influence on Winston-Salem's
development is easy to find. Tobacco leaves feature in the city's
seal, and a statue of the young R.J. Reynolds riding into town on
horseback stands outside the city hall.
</P>
<P>
   A high school, an auditorium, a park and the airport are named
after members of the Reynolds family, and R.J. Reynolds's summer
home is now an art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from cigarette sales helped to establish three
charitable foundations, and tobacco money went into bringing Wake
Forest University to the city in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette company continues to have a major impact on
Winston-Salem's civic life. RJR provides high-paying jobs to more
than 7,000 people in the area, and the company has given $16.9
million to community groups over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   As a grateful executive at a Winston-Salem charity told a local
newspaper, ``We would not enjoy the fine quality of life that we do
without the presence of RJR.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in cities that owe their existence to the tobacco industry,
however, times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic cigarette consumption down by about a third since
1970, and a series of lawsuits aimed at cigarette makers,
communities that have long relied on tobacco now want to diversify
their economies.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem, cigarette manufacturing is no longer the
primary engine of growth. RJR has lost much of its market share
since the early 1980s, and it closed its downtown factories more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share of the city's tax levy dropped from 18
percent in 1988 to 6 percent in 1998, and the size of its local
work force has fallen by half.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco has slipped, medicine and banking have grown in
importance. The university-affiliated hospital has surpassed RJR as
the largest employer in the county.
</P>
<P>
   As the home of two large regional banks, this city of 171,000
people is the 11th-biggest banking center in the country, just
behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are changing, too. In a move that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago, the city's largest shopping mall
banned smoking earlier this year. City leaders who were once
content to depend upon the tobacco industry to provide jobs are now
seeking to attract new businesses to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a real wake-up call'' when RJR began to scale down its
operations in the late 1980s, says Allen Joines, the official
responsible for economic development: ``We have become much more
aggressive since then.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the tobacco era is coming to an end.
At the beginning of last year, RJR stopped offering free public
tours of its Whitaker Park cigarette plant: the number of visitors
had fallen by two-thirds over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are looking for symbols, the fire that ripped
through a downtown block of disused RJR factories last August
destroyed Factory Number 256, which stood on the site of the
``little red factory'' in which R.J. Reynolds launched his business
more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more than an hour down the road from Winston-Salem,
Durham has moved even further away from its roots as a tobacco
town.
</P>
<P>
   The city was once the home of James B. Duke's American Tobacco
Company, which controlled more than 90 percent of the world tobacco
market until regulators broke it up in 1911. Tobacco money financed
the development of a small Methodist college, subsequently renamed
Duke University in honor of its patron.
</P>
<P>
   Durham is still the headquarters of the Liggett Group, the
fifth-largest cigarette maker in the country, but the tobacco
industry now employs less than 1 percent of the city's workers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms based in the nearby Research Triangle Park
account for 42,000 jobs in the Durham area, and Duke University
Medical Center is the county's biggest employer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In rural areas, too, the economic landscape is changing. Tobacco
growers are looking for ways to diversify their operations as the
federal government scales back its tobacco price-support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the chagrin of those of their neighbors who object to
strong odors, farmers in the state now make more money from poultry
and pig farming than they do from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many tobacco growers, deep in debt, have failed to find new
sources of income. The challenge of diversification is particularly
acute in the hilly Piedmont region, where farms are smaller than in
the flat eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians hope to ease the fears of nervous farmers by
directing much of the $4.6 billion that North Carolina is due to
receive from the tobacco settlement to communities that depend on
tobacco. Everybody hopes the tobacco companies survive long enough
to make all the payments. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most aspiring politicians test the ground by releasing position
papers. Warren Beatty released a film featuring a man in a woolly
hat and baggy trousers instead.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Beatty played a Democratic senator who is
finally driven mad by Washington's evil ways.
</P>
<P>
   He swaps his suits for ghetto gear, tears up his speech about
``standing at the dawn of a new millennium,'' and starts rapping
about the ``real issues'' instead: the hold of big money on
politics, the lack of universal health care, the export of jobs to
the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   This exercise in truth-telling naturally goes down famously with
the voters, and Senator Jay Billington Bulworth prepares to return
to Washington to clean house. The fictional Bulworth is inevitably
assassinated by big money before he can fulfill the people's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are growing signs that the real Beatty is preparing to
go to Washington in his place _ and go, moreover, as president
rather than a mere senator.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has not yet announced his candidacy _ indeed, he has not
yet decided whether to run as a Democrat or a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He is also being advised not to run by influential Democrats
(who think that he will split the left of the party) and by some
close friends (who warn the self-confessed perfectionist that you
cannot control a campaign as you can a film).
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has been arguing for years that American liberalism
has been destroyed by the influence of money on politics, and he
thinks that the groundswell of support for campaign-finance reform
provides a chance of changing that.
</P>
<P>
   He is vigorously consulting activists in both the Democratic
Party and the Reform Party, and has sought advice from Pat Caddell,
the pollster who helped to bring New Coke into the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has written a somewhat elliptical piece for the New York
Times condemning the grip of big money on American politics, and
has another piece coming out in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, the governor of Minnesota, is apparently courting
him as the Reform Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Arianna Huffington first floated the idea of a Beatty
candidacy, it has been the cause of mirth. How can a man who lives
in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills take himself seriously as a
champion of the poor?
</P>
<P>
   And how can a man who is admired more for his womanizing than
his contribution to public life hope to fill the shoes of such
paragons as William Jefferson Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   One joke making the rounds is that Beatty will be able to win
the California primary even if the only people who vote for him are
women who have slept with him. (His paramours range from Madonna to
Diane Keaton.)
</P>
<P>
   The mirth is the result of more than just Beatty's record as an
inveterate liberal and retired roue. (He has now settled down with
Annette Bening, an actress.) It is the result of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan never lived down the fact that he starred in
``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' despite changing America more radically than
any president since Franklin Roosevelt, and today's Hollywood crowd
is regarded as much more of a joke than Reagan's ever was.
</P>
<P>
   There is no permutation of political correctness that does not
have some celebrity's name attached to it. Yet Hollywood is one of
the most ruthless industries in the world: a place where giant
multinationals package pap for the masses, slippery agents carry
the art of the double cross to levels undreamed of by Talleyrand,
and nobody bats an eyelid when the stars make millions and the rest
of the crew is thrown on the dole at the end of a production.
</P>
<P>
   Rich liberals always have a hard time dealing with the hypocrisy
charge. But Beatty is very far from being an airhead. Politics is
the other of his two great interests in life.
</P>
<P>
   He stumped for Robert Kennedy in 1968, strategized for George
McGovern in 1972, and worked as a key adviser for Gary Hart in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   His dinner conversation is more Washington than Hollywood,
focused on the hot topic of the day with occasional excursions into
political lore. (He tells a nice story about a friend bumping into
Richard Nixon on a beach at the height of the Watergate crisis. He
asked the embattled president whether he was ever tempted to press
the button. Nixon went silent for a while and then replied, slowly
and deliberately, ``No, that would be wrong.'')
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has the political skills it takes to rise to the top of a
brutal industry. He made a fortune out of ``Bonnie and Clyde''
(1967) by negotiating a contract that gave him 40 percent of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, with the Cold War still raging, he persuaded Gulf +
Western to produce $25 million for ``Reds,'' a film that came close
to endorsing the philosophy of the other side; and the man who
financed Bulworth's anti-capitalist rants was none other than the
arch-capitalist himself, Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   If Beatty's involvement in politics is not quite as silly as it
sounds, neither is Hollywood's. Hollywood is one of America's most
successful industries, accounting for three-quarters of the films
shown in Europe and more than half of those in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the country's most controversial industries, too,
provoking fury in everybody from middle-of-the-road Americans, who
blame it for encouraging violence, to French bureaucrats, who
accuse it of destroying their film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has no choice but to woo Washington, and to keep the
fires of both political parties stoked with heaps of money. The
resulting nexus between Hollywood and Washington is inevitably
blamed for trivializing politics. But it is not entirely clear who
is doing the trivializing.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians usually become infatuated with Hollywood only when
they have to disguise failed policies with star power: the decline
of the Clinton presidency can be dated from the time when the
celebrities started outnumbering the Ivy League professors at White
House dinners.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood figures often become preoccupied by Washington
because they want to prove that they are serious: Reagan was
attracted to politics by the idea of ``getting government off
people's backs,'' just as Beatty is by the idea of reforming
America's money politics.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons to oppose a Beatty candidacy, not
least that he is going to do more harm than good to his own cause
by taking votes from Bill Bradley; but the fact that he lives in
the Hollywood Hills is not one of them. &QL;

 GENETIC TESTS ON GRAPES SHOW FINE WINES MAY DESCEND FROM DREGS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine sophisticates got some shocking news to swallow Thursday
when genetic experts revealed the true origins of some of the
world's finest grape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that nearly all those fabulous wine grapes of
northeastern France, and their genetically identical California
cousins, resulted from a single odd coupling between a Pinot and
the now-obscure Gouais blanc, a vine so common that the French
tried to ban its cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   Its very name derives from an old French term of derision,
``gou.'' Disowned by the aristocrats of enology, Gouais may have
been a gift of the Roman Emperor Probus to the Gauls during the
first century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   While its origins remain obscure, there is ample historical
evidence that Gouais became the most widely planted variety in
northeastern France during the Middle Ages, although usually on the
flatter sites considered mediocre for wine cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a high-yielding, hearty variety _ the kind of
wine grape perfectly suited for making lots of ``innocuous plonk''
for the table, said Jim Lapsley, a wine historian and winemaker at
Orleans Hill Viticultural Corp. in Woodland.
</P>
<P>
   But as the French trade in fine wines matured, authorities
repeatedly tried to ban Gouais in at least two regions to make room
for more worthy cultivars. It is no longer grown commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Now, DNA fingerprinting and years of detective work by
scientists at the University of California at Davis elevate the
lowly Gouais to the very top of the French wine-grape family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay, Gamay noir, Aligote _ 16 classic French varietals in
all _ turn out to be direct offspring of a single Pinot-Gouais
pairing, according to the most careful analysis ever done of
identifying patterns found in the plant genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came as a complete surprise,'' said plant geneticist Carole
Meredith, who lead  &LR; led the research effort. ``When we told our
French collaborators, they had a hard time believing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith was on a team of researchers that pinpointed the
origins of Cabernet Sauvignon two years ago, proving through DNA
analysis that it was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon
blanc. Some of the same researchers are now hunting for the origins
of Zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, published Thursday in the journal Science,
came from a collaboration between UC Davis and French researchers
who examined historical literature on wine grapes, which led to
close examination of leaf samples from some 300 varieties
maintained at a French research institute near Montpelier.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic analysis is a far more reliable way to track family
relations than relying on physical traits of different wine-grape
crops, because those traits can vary widely on account of soil or
climate.
</P>
<P>
   The same variety, depending on mutations, can produce plants
that bear light or dark berries. Pinot noir, Pinot blanc and Pinot
gris, for example, are all the same cultivar.
</P>
<P>
   The new research solves one of the big mysteries of the wine
trade and underscores some basic facts of life: Children often
differ from their parents, and parents need not be ``special'' at
all to give rise to ``special'' offspring, just so long as the
parents contribute a robust mix of genetic material from which
nature can select.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the mysteries of wine-grape parentage also has some
practical value, providing some important clues for modern plant
breeders trying to create the perfect wine grape.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental crossing of a Pinot noir and a Chardonnay, for
example, would not seem likely to produce good results because of
how closely the two varieties are related.
</P>
<P>
   And in order to conserve the entire gene pool of the varieties
Meredith and her colleagues examined, all that's really needed is
to preserve the two parent varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting to figure out how things relate,''
Lapsley said. ``The next question is how can we use this
information to improve grape breeding?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG, NEW YORK AND PARIS _ Simon Noble, a young-looking
28-year-old, is nobody's idea of a latter-day Bugsy Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago he had been due to study banking and international
finance at Manchester University, when he took a part-time job at
the London office of Intertops, an Austrian bookmaker offering bets
on Germany's Bundesliga (soccer betting inside the country was a
government monopoly).
</P>
<P>
   Noble, who has a good head for numbers, kept delaying his
degree. Now he runs Intertops.com, an Internet spin-off in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bugsy's Flamingo Hotel, which gave birth to Las Vegas,
had its admirers, so some see Intertops.com as a pioneer in a
thriving young industry serving some 20 million gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Sinclair, of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New
York-based management consultancy, reckons that the revenues of the
400 or so online gambling sites (i.e.: the money that the gaming
companies keep) will surpass $1 billion this year, compared with
$300 million in 1997. Others give even higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugsy also had his detractors, and some critics compare
Internet gambling to crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Around half the bets in the Caribbean are made by American
punters. Politicians argue that the Internet is enticing minors and
college students into gambling, and providing an even quicker way
for addicts of all ages to fritter away their money.
</P>
<P>
   They also whisper _ with no hard evidence _ that some virtual
casinos are a haven for money laundering (just as the Flamingo and
other joints once were).
</P>
<P>
   Several states have tried to outlaw wire-transfers to Caribbean
gambling sites. In 1998 the Department of Justice brought charges
under the Wire Act against 22 American citizens involved in
managing foreign-based sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hide online,'' Janet Reno, the attorney-general,
warned Internet betting operators, ``and you can't hide offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent huge National Gambling Impact Study Commission
(NGISC) report recommended banning Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   What is afoot? The answer depends on your attitude to gambling.
Yet from a strictly commercial viewpoint, the lesson is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling may still be small (the revenues of American
casinos alone are 50 times bigger). But technology is gradually
helping to globalize one of the world's most idiosyncratic and
local industries.
</P>
<P>
   Property vendors like to say that only three things matter:
location, location and location. In gambling, the equivalent has
always been regulation, regulation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Countries tend to grant only limited exceptions to a general
ban. Even in a free-trade area such as the European Union, gambling
is usually an exception to the rule that firms can ply their trade
freely across borders. The result is one of the most peculiar and
cronyish industries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In America it is virtually impossible to bet (legally) on a
football game, unless you happen to be in Las Vegas or on an Indian
reservation; betting on horse racing is also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Yet states earn around $40 billion a year from heavily promoted
lotteries _ gambling that one member of the NGISC describes as ``a
massive bait-and-switch consumer fraud.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (825-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are a rum lot, stretching from the Hong Kong
Jockey Club (which has financed most of the territory's social
services) to the (once-notorious) Las Vegas Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's ``spread-betting'' firms, which offer bets on
everything from Test matches to the performance of individual
shares, are regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Heavy
taxation is usually the price for being allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, the national lottery pays back 50
percent of customers' stakes as prizes, but then gives 80 percent
of what is left to the government through tax and its contribution
to ``good causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers, who pay out as winnings 75 percent of betting
proceeds, hand over only 37 percent of their take to the
government. Casinos surrender at least 95 percent of what is spent,
but their tax rate is only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology allows gambling to jump out of such boxes. Off-track
horse betting jumped in popularity once the shops started providing
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, thousands of one-armed bandits have been linked to
create a game with odds and potential prizes comparable to a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, bingo halls have fought back against the national
lottery by forming a national network with a super-jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are forever reproving those that overstep the mark.
Bookmakers in Britain who offered a game based on the results of
the Irish national lottery were forced to adapt its prize structure
into something less appealing so as not to siphon money out of the
British one.
</P>
<P>
   There have been endless rows in America about what games tribal
authorities can offer, and how far offshore floating casinos must
be (the distance seems to have fallen from miles to a few inches).
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border gambling is a particular threat. In 1994 the
British government won the ``Schindler'' case to stop a group from
selling German lottery tickets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In America, lotteries also have to stay in their states: hence
the traffic streaming across the border from New York state to
Connecticut to play ``Powerball,'' a ludicrous multi-state lottery
that gives its sad devotees (including your correspondent) a
pathetically small chance of winning an outrageously large sum of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ``foreign competition,'' Victor Chandler, a British
telephone bookmaker, recently moved to Gibraltar. The firm thus
avoids the 9 percent tax levied on off-track betting in Britain,
although it voluntarily pays 1.5 percent of its takings to
Britain's horse-racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler will start taking bets over the Internet at the end of
the year, but it already reports that more inquiries from new
customers are coming via the web; one in four American punters
makes contact this way.
</P>
<P>
   It costs less than $500,000 to set up an Internet site, which
even a mildly efficient operator should be able to win back within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, points
out that more than 40 places, including most tax havens, now allow
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest country to become a haven for Internet gambling is
Australia. Most of the big casinos are involved. The leading sports
bookie, Centrebet (which also claims to be among the top five
worldwide) is pushing into Scandinavia, accepting bets on Finnish
baseball and Danish ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was taken over by Jupiters, which is part-owned by
America's Hilton Hotels, Centrebet has turned away American-based
punters; despite that handicap, its Internet business, which now
generates A$50 million ($32 million) a year, doubles every year.
</P>
<P>
   For punters, Internet gambling is riskier than the regulated
thing. Betting on sports online, where everybody knows the result,
is safer than online casino games, where it is practically
impossible to know the odds _ though some websites at least monitor
the payouts.
</P>
<P>
   There is the risk that a site will close before you collect your
winnings (one punter cited by the NGISC lost $7,000 that way).
Hence most bigger firms want to establish brands.
</P>
<P>
   Noble says his books are audited by KPMG, and that Intertops.com
has paid out $200 million since it began _ the largest successful
bet was for SFr350,000 ($230,000) on Romania reaching the second
stage of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bookmakers, he has to cope with syndicates such as
the Kosher Kids and the Chinamen (``You take the first bet, and
politely refuse the rest''). The global spread of punters helps in
his two main sports, American football and English soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Local gamblers, who follow form, can make a killing betting
against better-known clubs; but this is usually offset by Asian
gamblers who tend to bet on famous names such as Manchester United
and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, the odds are that much sports betting will have
moved to the web. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, both William Hill, a high-street bookmaker, and IG
Index, a spread-betting firm, report big increases in Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a fair chunk of the ``street'' (i.e.: mob) betting
will also move. Yet the Internet is also tempting students who
would not dream of taking odds from Two Fingers Rossi on a street
corner in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Europe will enforce some tacit regulation of
Internet gambling. But the land of the day trader and Powerball
looks likely to pass an Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,
sponsored by John Kyl, a Republican senator, and supported by,
among others, the state attorneys-general, most American sporting
leagues and various casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, however, the Justice Department has opposed the idea
of demonizing a medium rather than a crime. And, as everybody
admits, it is impossible to stop people gambling on the Internet;
all you can do is make it harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prohibition'' will probably last only as long as America's
wealthy (but regulated) gambling industry wants it to.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine big multinational groups surrendering real
gaming to people like Noble. Already various Indian tribal
governments are trying to set up virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyl bill would mean that non-American operators might be
arrested on American soil, so Noble's most recent trip to New York
(to meet his lawyers) might have to be his last.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even if Reno succeeds in driving
Intertops.com out of Antigua, the firm could simply move to
Australia, where it is likely to list its shares soon. Bugsy did
not have that escape route. &QL;

BUSH PROPOSES VOUCHER- 
 STYLE SCHOOL PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in California to
deliver his first major educational policy address Thursday,
unveiled a limited proposal for school vouchers as part of an
effort to make education a cornerstone of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican nomination did not use the
hot-button word ``voucher,'' but he said his administration would
strip federal funding from failing public schools ``that cheat poor
children'' and give the money to parents to pay for tutors or
private schools or ``whatever offers hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a wide-ranging interview with The Chronicle, Bush said
he intended to deliver a personal message to Californians by
stressing the need to help disadvantaged children in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better make sure that kids whose voices don't really get
heard in the system get educated, Bush said. ``So long as we're
spending federal money _ $7.7 billion in entitlement programs _
there needs to be consequences if there's failure.''
</P>
<P>
   A relaxed and confident Bush said he recognizes that most
Californians don't share his views on controversial issues like
abortion and guns. But, he said, ``I'm going to tell them what I
think, and if they choose not to vote for me, that's just what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   While gun control and abortion are high on the list of issues
important to California voters, education emerged as the top
concern in last year's governor's race, won in a landslide by
Democrat Gray Davis. Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination, devoted his first major policy
speech last spring to his plans for how the federal government
could bring about what he called ``revolutionary change'' in
education.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, backed by many conservatives and strongly opposed by
many liberals, involve giving credits to parents that could be used
to remove children from public schools and place them in private
schools partly or wholly at government expense. While Bush has been
open to them in the past, Gore believes they would siphon away
needed government funding from public education.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with campaign cash and enjoying his front-runner status,
Bush is running neck and neck with Gore in California, even though
polls also show that many voters here profoundly disagree with him
and the GOP on major issues like taxes, guns and abortion. But in
his interview Thursday, Bush said that neither polls nor critics
would budge him from his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people realize I've got a philosophy about life that's
hopeful and optimistic. ... I believe a conservative philosophy can
lead to compassionate results,'' said Bush. ``I'm going to wage a
positive campaign. I hope it has a little different look to it, by
not tearing other people down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose an appearance before 2,500 entrepreneurs of the
influential Latino Business Association to deliver what was billed
as his first major educational policy address.
</P>
<P>
   Moving easily between English and Spanish, he called for more
local control and accountability to serve the nation's poorest
children, saying, ``Pigment and poverty need not determine
performance. That myth is disproved by good schools every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed reforms for the $4.4 billion Head Start
program for disadvantaged youth, saying he would shift the emphasis
from day care to reading readiness.
</P>
<P>
   And he called for greater accountability for the federal
government's $7.7 billion Title I program, by requiring that
schools receiving money test their students in academic basics each
year. He said he would give poor parents up to $1,500 per child to
spend on education as they choose if their own schools are
consistently not meeting standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, the federal government has tried to close the
gap of hope _ armed with good intentions and billions of dollars,''
Bush said. ``But sacks of money and the best of motives have made
little difference in the performance of disadvantaged children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also tried aggressively to put to rest the common political
belief that the GOP cannot win the Latino vote in California
because of its past support for Proposition 187, the bitterly
contested measure to combat illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of any background should not be used as pawns in
bitter debates on education and immigration, or punished to make a
broader political point,'' he said to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush told The Chronicle that his outreach to Latinos
would remain a key to his campaign. ``I'm actually talking to
America, in a Latino audience,'' said Bush. ``It is important for
the Republican party, and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   While he disagrees with the ``spirit'' of 187 and strongly
believes that children should not be removed from schools because
of their parents' immigration status, he also said illegal
immigrants should not receive federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, except for emergency conditions, obviously,'' said Bush.
``I mean, if an illegal immigrant shows up with a pregnancy, of
course. Or with a severe wound, of course, we would provide help. I
do think we should revisit the temporary workers programs.''
</P>
<P>
   And while former GOP Governor Pete Wilson argued in court that
the Clinton administration owed California $3 billion annually to
pay for the costs of incarcerating, educating and providing health
care for illegal immigrants, Bush said definitively that as
president, he would not reimburse California for the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... because that's not a federal role, in my judgment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also addressed two sensitive issues, guns and abortion,
acknowledging that many Californians appear to disagree with his
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people in California realize I'm a reasonable person
when it comes to who and who should not have guns,'' said Bush, who
has taken sharp criticism in recent months for signing a Texas
concealed-weapons law and another which prohibits suits against gun
manufacturers. ``I think people are going to find George W.'s a
fairly reasonable-sounding person, who is tough enough and resolute
enough to make sure the federal prosecutors, under his watch, will
arrest people'' if they violate gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, he said, ``I understand the contentious nature of
the abortion issue. I believe in life. I believe in the value of
life. ... And I understand people have got different views on this
subject. ... I will say in California, good people can disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also directly addressed the criticism of some political
insiders that his campaign has lacked substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of a game that people throw at me: He doesn't
say anything, he doesn't believe anything, he doesn't take
positions, he won't debate,'' said Bush. ``They forget ... that
people are turning out in droves in New Hampshire and Iowa, because
they know I've got a strong agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began the day hammering the themes of education before a
receptive crowd at Bennett-Kew Elementary School in Inglewood,
which has been repeatedly cited as a model school with an almost
entirely minority student population. The governor addressed
students, and then visited classrooms, at one point, delivering a
rousing reading of ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to
kindergartners as part of an effort to stress literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, the Texas governor
called for schools to focus on ``basic skills and essential
knowledge'' with ``excellence in four goals: reading, math, science
and social studies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would demand tough accountability, arguing, ``It is
essential to align responsibility and accountability at the local
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush vowed his administration will ``require every federal
program, in teacher training, curriculum research, and school
safety, to prove results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's most potentially controversial proposal was his call for
ending federal funding to schools with disadvantaged children. If
the schools don't improve over three years, he proposed
transferring those funds to parents in the form of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the Head Start program, in a Bush administration,
would be given a strong educational emphasis, and moved from the
Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's outreach to Latinos, while warmly received, was also
met with some skepticism from the very audience he was wooing.
</P>
<P>
   At Bennett-Kew Elementary, Latino parents lined the fences an
hour in advance to get a place for his speech. But many of them,
recent immigrants and Spanish speakers, said they could not forget
the ugly issue of Proposition 187 _ or the Republican Party's role
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Wilson wasn't good for Latinos,'' said Angelica
Hernandez, a parent with kids in first and fifth grades. ``We're
worried that if we vote for (Bush), it will be the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is the most important thing, and I'm glad he's
talking about it,'' agreed Lupe Gomez of Inglewood, in Spanish.
``But 187 was definitely an issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Perez, a public relations executive and an officer
in the Latin Business Association who heard the Texas governor's
address, said her organization was profoundly ``flattered'' that
the GOP front-runner chose their audience to unveil a major
proposal on schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the importance of the Latino vote in the next
presidential election,'' she said.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG, NEW YORK AND PARIS _ Simon Noble, a young-looking
28-year-old, is nobody's idea of a latter-day Bugsy Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago he had been due to study banking and international
finance at Manchester University, when he took a part-time job at
the London office of Intertops, an Austrian bookmaker offering bets
on Germany's Bundesliga (soccer betting inside the country was a
government monopoly).
</P>
<P>
   Noble, who has a good head for numbers, kept delaying his
degree. Now he runs Intertops.com, an Internet spin-off in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bugsy's Flamingo Hotel, which gave birth to Las Vegas,
had its admirers, so some see Intertops.com as a pioneer in a
thriving young industry serving some 20 million gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Sinclair, of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New
York-based management consultancy, reckons that the revenues of the
400 or so online gambling sites (i.e.: the money that the gaming
companies keep) will surpass $1 billion this year, compared with
$300 million in 1997. Others give even higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugsy also had his detractors, and some critics compare
Internet gambling to crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Around half the bets in the Caribbean are made by American
punters. Politicians argue that the Internet is enticing minors and
college students into gambling, and providing an even quicker way
for addicts of all ages to fritter away their money.
</P>
<P>
   They also whisper _ with no hard evidence _ that some virtual
casinos are a haven for money laundering (just as the Flamingo and
other joints once were).
</P>
<P>
   Several states have tried to outlaw wire-transfers to Caribbean
gambling sites. In 1998 the Department of Justice brought charges
under the Wire Act against 22 American citizens involved in
managing foreign-based sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hide online,'' Janet Reno, the attorney-general,
warned Internet betting operators, ``and you can't hide offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent huge National Gambling Impact Study Commission
(NGISC) report recommended banning Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   What is afoot? The answer depends on your attitude to gambling.
Yet from a strictly commercial viewpoint, the lesson is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling may still be small (the revenues of American
casinos alone are 50 times bigger). But technology is gradually
helping to globalize one of the world's most idiosyncratic and
local industries.
</P>
<P>
   Property vendors like to say that only three things matter:
location, location and location. In gambling, the equivalent has
always been regulation, regulation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Countries tend to grant only limited exceptions to a general
ban. Even in a free-trade area such as the European Union, gambling
is usually an exception to the rule that firms can ply their trade
freely across borders. The result is one of the most peculiar and
cronyish industries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In America it is virtually impossible to bet (legally) on a
football game, unless you happen to be in Las Vegas or on an Indian
reservation; betting on horse racing is also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Yet states earn around $40 billion a year from heavily promoted
lotteries _ gambling that one member of the NGISC describes as ``a
massive bait-and-switch consumer fraud.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (825-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are a rum lot, stretching from the Hong Kong
Jockey Club (which has financed most of the territory's social
services) to the (once-notorious) Las Vegas Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's ``spread-betting'' firms, which offer bets on
everything from Test matches to the performance of individual
shares, are regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Heavy
taxation is usually the price for being allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, the national lottery pays back 50
percent of customers' stakes as prizes, but then gives 80 percent
of what is left to the government through tax and its contribution
to ``good causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers, who pay out as winnings 75 percent of betting
proceeds, hand over only 37 percent of their take to the
government. Casinos surrender at least 95 percent of what is spent,
but their tax rate is only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology allows gambling to jump out of such boxes. Off-track
horse betting jumped in popularity once the shops started providing
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, thousands of one-armed bandits have been linked to
create a game with odds and potential prizes comparable to a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, bingo halls have fought back against the national
lottery by forming a national network with a super-jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are forever reproving those that overstep the mark.
Bookmakers in Britain who offered a game based on the results of
the Irish national lottery were forced to adapt its prize structure
into something less appealing so as not to siphon money out of the
British one.
</P>
<P>
   There have been endless rows in America about what games tribal
authorities can offer, and how far offshore floating casinos must
be (the distance seems to have fallen from miles to a few inches).
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border gambling is a particular threat. In 1994 the
British government won the ``Schindler'' case to stop a group from
selling German lottery tickets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In America, lotteries also have to stay in their states: hence
the traffic streaming across the border from New York state to
Connecticut to play ``Powerball,'' a ludicrous multi-state lottery
that gives its sad devotees (including your correspondent) a
pathetically small chance of winning an outrageously large sum of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ``foreign competition,'' Victor Chandler, a British
telephone bookmaker, recently moved to Gibraltar. The firm thus
avoids the 9 percent tax levied on off-track betting in Britain,
although it voluntarily pays 1.5 percent of its takings to
Britain's horse-racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler will start taking bets over the Internet at the end of
the year, but it already reports that more inquiries from new
customers are coming via the web; one in four American punters
makes contact this way.
</P>
<P>
   It costs less than $500,000 to set up an Internet site, which
even a mildly efficient operator should be able to win back within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, points
out that more than 40 places, including most tax havens, now allow
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest country to become a haven for Internet gambling is
Australia. Most of the big casinos are involved. The leading sports
bookie, Centrebet (which also claims to be among the top five
worldwide) is pushing into Scandinavia, accepting bets on Finnish
baseball and Danish ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was taken over by Jupiters, which is part-owned by
America's Hilton Hotels, Centrebet has turned away American-based
punters; despite that handicap, its Internet business, which now
generates A$50 million ($32 million) a year, doubles every year.
</P>
<P>
   For punters, Internet gambling is riskier than the regulated
thing. Betting on sports online, where everybody knows the result,
is safer than online casino games, where it is practically
impossible to know the odds _ though some websites at least monitor
the payouts.
</P>
<P>
   There is the risk that a site will close before you collect your
winnings (one punter cited by the NGISC lost $7,000 that way).
Hence most bigger firms want to establish brands.
</P>
<P>
   Noble says his books are audited by KPMG, and that Intertops.com
has paid out $200 million since it began _ the largest successful
bet was for SFr350,000 ($230,000) on Romania reaching the second
stage of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bookmakers, he has to cope with syndicates such as
the Kosher Kids and the Chinamen (``You take the first bet, and
politely refuse the rest''). The global spread of punters helps in
his two main sports, American football and English soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Local gamblers, who follow form, can make a killing betting
against better-known clubs; but this is usually offset by Asian
gamblers who tend to bet on famous names such as Manchester United
and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, the odds are that much sports betting will have
moved to the web. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, both William Hill, a high-street bookmaker, and IG
Index, a spread-betting firm, report big increases in Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In America, a fair chunk of the ``street'' (i.e.: mob) betting
will also move. Yet the Internet is also tempting students who
would not dream of taking odds from Two Fingers Rossi on a street
corner in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most places in Europe will enforce some tacit regulation of
Internet gambling. But the land of the day trader and Powerball
looks likely to pass an Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,
sponsored by John Kyl, a Republican senator, and supported by,
among others, the state attorneys-general, most American sporting
leagues and various casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, however, the Justice Department has opposed the idea
of demonizing a medium rather than a crime. And, as everybody
admits, it is impossible to stop people gambling on the Internet;
all you can do is make it harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prohibition'' will probably last only as long as America's
wealthy (but regulated) gambling industry wants it to.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine big multinational groups surrendering real
gaming to people like Noble. Already various Indian tribal
governments are trying to set up virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyl bill would mean that non-American operators might be
arrested on American soil, so Noble's most recent trip to New York
(to meet his lawyers) might have to be his last.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even if Reno succeeds in driving
Intertops.com out of Antigua, the firm could simply move to
Australia, where it is likely to list its shares soon. Bugsy did
not have that escape route. &QL;

IT'S HOT ENOUGH TO FRY WILLIE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe it's the heat. The pounding, searing San
Francisco summer sizzle, with the mercury rising, banging on 70's
door.
</P>
<P>
   Hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, if you also have a
blowtorch. But don't try it. There's already enough stuff on the
sidewalks without having to worry about where you step. And who
wants to eat an omelet stamped Florsheim or Nike?
</P>
<P>
   The crazy heat does crazy things to a man's mind. Maybe several
men's minds.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's on edge. At Tuesday's debate, some Clint Reilly
supporters were under kibitz attack by a guy with long hair and a
beard. He asked 'em how much they were being paid to carry the
Reilly signs, and a lively conversation ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing the guy knew, he was being detained and patted down
by the SFPD, who told the guy that the Reilly crowd said he had
threatened them with a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   See how much fun this race is going to be?
</P>
<P>
   Each of the candidates declared a clear-cut debate victory, of
course, and may the least self-delusional man win.
</P>
<P>
   One Willie supporter, Rebecca Silverberg, was quoted saying,
``(Brown's) the one who can deliver the bacon for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Tina Hirt asks: ``Hebrew Academy ... Raoul Wallenberg
Jewish Democratic Club ... How'd the bacon get in there?''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Mayor Brown was shocked _ shocked _ by the
vicious attacks on him by his two opponents and has reluctantly
decided to dump the gentlemanly approach. That's right _ no more
Mr. Nice Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Darn, Willie had planned to devote his allotted time at the next
debate to complimenting Reilly and Frank Jordan on their wardrobes,
but hey, if they want to play dirty, what can he do?
</P>
<P>
   IT CAME as a shock to me to learn Thursday that San Francisco
District Attorney Terence Hallinan has the state's worst record in
cracking down on violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   This is Kayo Hallinan who once trash-talked the thugs: ``Don't
expect any sympathy from Terence Hallinan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers show that Kayo has been softer than Mr. Whipple.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco: Use a gun, plea-bargain it down to disturbing the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Hallinan and supporters accused
The Chronicle of cheap-shot vendetta journalism and unfair
number-crunching. But what are the odds he can make those charges
stick?
</P>
<P>
   GUY IN Fort Bragg renewed his driver's license by mail, and one
form asked, basically, if he'd suffered blackout spells or
deterioration of vision since his last renewal.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the form, in a box, in large letters: ``UPON
REQUEST, THIS DOCUMENT CAN BE PRODUCED IN BRAILLE OR LARGE PRINT.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ty's probably laughing his head off,'' whined one
distraught collector. ``I just can't imagine being without them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the news on Aug. 31 that Ty Warner, the
founder of Ty Inc., is retiring all of his toy company's Beanie
Babies by the end of the year looks like inspired marketing _ and
great news for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is going to make these hugely popular and scarce
little bean-bag animals, with names like ``Honks'' the goose and
``Slowpoke'' the sloth, even scarcer.
</P>
<P>
   Since he introduced Beanie Babies in 1993, Warner has proved a
superlative marketer, manipulating demand by supplying restricted
quantities of Beanies to small, specialist toy shops, bypassing big
toy chains and periodically ``retiring'' animals to boost their
value.
</P>
<P>
   He has added a touch of exclusivity too, by never advertising,
relying on word of mouth, and building a mystique about himself and
his private firm, based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been startling. Although Beanies were
originally a children's toy, 70 percent of collectors are adults.
Many have sunk large sums, trading the 212-strong range of animals
on the secondary market, taking out insurance policies in case
their Beanies are stolen, and writing in for legal advice about how
to divide their collections when they get divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Beanies that sell new for $4-5 can trade for thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Beaniex.com, an auction website for Beanies
(http://www.beaniex.com), features ``Peanut,'' a Royal Blue
Elephant, for $5,200, and ``Brownie Brown Bear'' for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The craze has generated a whole spin-off industry from sellers
on the street to people such as Mary Beth Sobolewski, who left a
job at IBM to start ``Bean Bag World Monthly,'' a magazine with a
circulation of more than a million and the biggest of several
Beanie publications.
</P>
<P>
   This latest, carefully crafted announcement made on Ty's website
(http://www.ty.com) is guaranteed to send the price of Beanies
rocketing.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the statement is a huge teaser. The company refused
to clarify whether ``retirement'' meant the end of Beanie Babies
for good or merely a clearing of the shelves for a new collection.
A new black bear called ``The End'' coinciding with its statement
merely added to the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ty then blacked out its site for more than 12 hours before
reposting the news. Children and collectors sat up all night in
case the news was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Creating panic buying is astute at a time when the Beanie Babies
craze has started to wane and competition for new collectible toys
such as the Pokemon characters has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   A renewed buying frenzy could, however, turn out to be nothing
more than a short-term bounce. Perhaps these little bean bags
really are like tin soldiers, baseball cards or Picasso paintings,
which become more valuable the scarcer they get. But the suspicion
is that, by choking off the supply of Beanies, Ty is stabbing its
customers in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hype dies and collectors move on to something else,
there will be no new buyers to keep the market liquid. Prices could
plummet; and collectors who have not already sold will be left with
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens will decide if Beanie Babies were a genuine
collectible or just a well-marketed fad. &QL;

   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ This Labor Day, it's time to do a
little comparison shopping. Workers in the United States may have
it good in many ways. But other nations have it over the United
States in a big way when it comes to measuring a valuable commodity
_ vacation days. Typical workers in the United States get a measly,
paltry, minuscule 2.5 weeks of paid vacation. Workers in most of
Europe receive at least a month. By L.M. SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Houston) _ Few developments in personal
computing have been as highly anticipated as the arrival of faster
Internet access to the home. That's because no matter how zippy
your on-line connection may be, it's never zippy enough. For the
last few weeks, I've been able to experience the joy _ and
frustration _ of cable modem service at home. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``My computer is a
little old, not too bad. It doesn't have USB ports, and I want to
add them. I understand I need a newer version of Window 95 to use
USB ports, too. How would I go about doing this?'' By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   CAREERS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If you want to understand
everything that is wonderful and not-so-wonderful about labor
unions, go to a baseball game. Even if your body doesn't last the
full nine innings, your insight into labor and management will go
the whole nine yards. By DAVE MURPHY. (For release Monday, Sept.
6).

   JEWISH-LEADER (Pittsfield, Mass.) _ Bonnie Lipton, the

few who know her would agree. Lipton has seen her share of both
tragedy and triumph as she climbed to the top of the national
Jewish women's volunteer organization. By KRIS WORRELL. (For

   ZEBRA-SKINS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Real zebra skins, which were in
fashion in the the 1960s, are in vogue again. Just as cattle are
bred for beef and leather; lamb for meat; ostrich for feathers,
leather and meat; and mink for fur; zebras are ranched for their

   FILM-REVIEW-SUBMARINE (Undated) _ As tripped-out musical
fantasias go, the Beatles' animated ``Yellow Submarine'' must have
had the most profound effect on my subconscious. I had no idea how
true this was until I sat enthralled by a visually enhanced,
digitally remastered, restored print of the film a few weeks ago.
By WESLEY MORRIS.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Whose justice system is out of step?
 &HT;    (Eds: This column, which normally moves on Mondays, is moving
today because of the three-day weekend.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much justice as was possible in the circumstances has been
done in the awkward case of Samuel Sheinbein, the American teen who
fled to Israel to duck U.S. prosecution for the especially grisly
murder of an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   The case, however, has left a bitter aftertaste for many in this
country, the residue of friction between two strikingly different
criminal justice systems. It will surprise most Americans that our
system was no less out of step with international norms in this
mess than Israel's was.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein strangled, burned and dismembered his victim _ out of
pure meanness, it seems. His admission of that in an Israeli court
will bring a plea-bargained sentence of 24 years' imprisonment,
with parole possible after 16.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's refusal to extradite Sheinbein, the plea bargaining
and, by U.S. standards, the lightness of the sentence have outraged
Maryland prosecutors, several members of Congress and commentators
generally.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel did not take this case lightly. The justice ministry
argued strongly for extradition all the way to the Israeli supreme
court. Successive Israeli governments would have liked nothing
better than to have been able to ship the case offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The courts' findings that Sheinbein had a legitimate, if
extruded, claim to Israeli citizenship through his Israeli-born
father left the case to be tried in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain denied U.S. prosecutors and the victim's family
whatever satisfaction was to be had in seeing him convicted on the
evidence, but the deal's insistence on Sheinbein's confession in
open court _ rare in Israeli proceedings _ prevents any later
appeal on a claim of coercion and Sheinbein won no break on his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have convinced themselves _ and our political
candidates play to the conviction _ that we let criminals off
lightly. In fact, U.S. prison sentences are typically longer than
the sentences for the same crimes in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most nations also refuse to treat even grave crimes committed by
juveniles as if they had been committed by an adult, as Americans
increasingly do. Israel has never sentenced an under-age killer to
more than 24 years. (And parole after 16 is by no means certain in
any case and seems unlikely in one as notorious and vile as this
one.)
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, most countries, including Israel, have banned
capital punishment, and a growing number that forbid the death
penalty balk at extraditing their own nationals, or even returning
Americans, if they could face possible execution.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, embarrassed by this case, have changed their law to
distinguish between technical citizens like Sheinbein, who are now
extraditable, period, and citizen residents, who can be extradited
if the extraditing country agrees any resulting sentence will be
served in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans, for our part, are left to think about the degree
to which the unique harshness of U.S. justice is beginning to work
against our interests in an ever more tangled world.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A fair deal for fall
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Ann Eaddy
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   After a long hot summer, the coming of fall was welcome in my
hometown of Florence, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Fall brought the joys of sweater weather and high school
football on Friday nights, but it also set the stage for the county
fair.
</P>
<P>
   This annual event in the 1950s and 1960s was anticipated
throughout our agricultural region.
</P>
<P>
   Farm folks exhibited their prized livestock and produce.
Extremely large animals with distinctive aromas were popular
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill-seekers of all ages enjoyed the merry-go-round, the
Ferris wheel and, for the adventurous, the tilt-a-whirl.
</P>
<P>
   Fair-goers wanted to see the bright lights and hear the music on
the midway. Cotton candy, hot dogs and Co'-Cola were the daily
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody came to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Schools let out a little early one afternoon during Fair Week.
That was the day my father chose to take my younger sister and me
to the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Our ritual never varied.
</P>
<P>
   First we headed for the agricultural tents to see the cows and
hogs.
</P>
<P>
   From there we traveled to the flower show, looking at the
carefully styled arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   After that came the rides. Both the timid (me) and the daring
(my sister) found amusements to suit their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   There was one aspect of the fair that my father discouraged us
from viewing: the side shows.
</P>
<P>
   There were whispers among my friends of the presence of ``girlie
shows'' at the edge of the fairgrounds, but we always carefully
avoided that area.
</P>
<P>
   As we walked along the midway, the side show barkers called out,
enticing passersby with descriptions of the amazing sights to
behold if only they would venture inside the tents.
</P>
<P>
   The price of admission was 25 cents, a small sum to view the
strangest wonders known to the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   One year I asked my father why we didn't go into these shows. He
said they were never what you expected, and we would be throwing
away our money.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later I spied a show with a sign advertising
``Free Admission.''
</P>
<P>
   I begged my father to allow us to go in. I was desperate to see
a modern wonder, and the price certainly seemed right.
</P>
<P>
   My father looked at me, looked at the sign and, finally, said,
``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   I was ecstatic as we entered the tent. But there was nothing to
see as we walked along a corridor, until we reached the end of it _
where a sign said, ``Pay To Exit.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked for a means of escape, but there was none. Without a
word my father handed the cashier two quarters as the price of our
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Some lessons are good to learn early in life, and I am grateful
for a wise teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Now when fall comes, I remember the fair, cotton candy and
innocence.

JUDGE IN GAMBLING CASE TAKES ON STICKY ISSUE OF JURISDICTION

<P>
   &UR; By CARL S. KAPLAN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   A local trial judge in Manhattan made headlines recently when he
ruled in a path-breaking case that operators of an Internet
gambling casino based in Antigua violated New York State and
federal anti-gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Justice Charles Edward Ramos of New York
State Supreme Court was the first judge in the nation to hold that
an online gambling site -- no matter where its computer server may
be located -- creates a virtual casino within a local user's
computer terminal and thus runs afoul of local and national laws
that prohibit the promotion of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversial 20-page opinion in the case, People v.
World Interactive Gaming Corp., issued on July 22, addressed
another novel issue that some legal experts think could have an
equally far-reaching impact not just on Internet gambling but on
other forms of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The riddle is this: What steps must a Web site take to screen
out unauthorized users or buyers so as to escape the grasp of the
local police?
</P>
<P>
   That is ``an interesting, important and unresolved'' question in
Internet law that is representative of a second-generation of
cyberlaw cases, said Jack Goldsmith, a law professor at the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Goldsmith explained, a major issue in cyberlaw
was whether a Web site that could not control the direction of its
information flows could nevertheless be hauled into court in
particular state for violating local law. Today the answer is plain
that a state does indeed have jurisdiction when there are
significant contacts between itself and the Web site, Goldsmith
said.
</P>
<P>
   But assume, Goldsmith said, that a Web site can take certain
precautions to keep its nose out of ``unfriendly'' jurisdictions
where its content or products would be illegal. If it makes a good
faith effort to screen out unauthorized users in those places, then
the local law should not apply to its actions, the reasoning goes.
``But what kind of precautions do content providers need to take to
avoid liability and make business flourish?'' he asked. ``What is
reasonable?''
</P>
<P>
   Courts will have to decide those questions, he said. Justice
Ramos's decision was a start.
</P>
<P>
   The New York gambling case grew out of a 1998 investigation of
Suffolk County-based World Interactive Gaming Corporation (WIGC)
and its officers by New York State's attorney general, Eliot L.
Spitzer. According to the court's opinion, the company sold about
$1.8 million worth of shares in its casino gaming business to 114
investors throughout the country, in violation of state securities
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Spitzer's office furthered its investigation by
logging onto WIGC's Web site, which was operated by Golden Chips
Casino Inc., a subsidiary company based in Antigua that is licensed
by that country to operate a land-based casino. According to the
opinion, a law enforcement investigator who was physically located
in New York downloaded gambling software from the site and placed
several bets on a computer terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But according to court papers, the Web site tried to screen out
New Yorkers from virtual slots, blackjack and roulette. In opening
an account, a user was prompted by the gambling software to enter
his permanent address. A player who submitted a permanent address
in a state that permitted land-based gambling, like Nevada, was
granted permission to gamble. A user who entered a state like New
York, which does not permit land-based gambling, was blocked from
playing. According to legal papers, the investigator initially
entered ``New York'' as her residence, but then, to circumvent the
filter, she changed the entry to ``Nevada,'' and proceeded to bet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arguments raised by the defendants in the case was
that they made a good-faith effort to screen out New York gamblers,
and thus they should not be liable under New York's anti-gambling
law.
</P>
<P>
   The court brushed the argument aside, however, maintaining that
the precautions taken were insufficient. ``[This Court rejects
respondents' argument that it unknowingly accepted bets from New
York residents,'' Justice Ramos wrote. ``New York users can easily
circumvent the casino software in order to play by the simple
expedient of entering an out-of-state address.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Internet has about 500 virtual gambling casinos,
say gambling and law enforcement experts. Many of the online
casinos use no precautions to screen out certain gamblers beyond
running notices that users must be adults and authorized to gamble,
according to Sue Schneider, publisher of Interactive Gaming News
and chairwoman of the Interactive Gaming Council, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, she said, employ the address filter that WIGC used
or take stronger measures, like screening out gamblers who use ISPs
that are based in non-gambling states, or even requiring players to
fax in passports or drivers' licenses. But no current method of
screening is foolproof, she said, adding that one gambling operator
was working on technology that could verify the geographical
location of the better's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rise of Internet wagering, three states -- Nevada,
Illinois and Louisiana -- have passed laws specifically outlawing
online gambling, Schneider said. Others, like New York, Minnesota
and Wisconsin, have sought to prosecute out-of-state Internet
gambling operators. A bill that would outlaw the promotion of
online gambling in the United States is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Joel M. Schwarz, an assistant attorney general in New York who
helped prosecute the case against WIGC, said the court was correct
in rejecting the gambling operators' filtering arguments. ``The
judge said the precautions they took were not adequate. They were
perfunctory,'' he said. ``You could put whatever state you liked
into the registration page, and there was no verification.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would be an adequate New York filter, Schwarz
replied: ``I think it's difficult to screen.'' He said that one way
to do it would be to ``follow the money trail. Verify where the
money is coming from and where [the winnings are going. That would
give an indicia of reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that would be adequate under the law, but there
has to be more substantial vetting'' of a player's location that
the method provided by WIGC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz added that the gambling operators' other actions in New
York State, like soliciting money and advertising the site,
violated anti-gambling laws independent of its knowledge that some
betters were from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Colleluori, a lawyer for WIGC, said in an interview
that his client ``used the best technology we have'' to screen out
New Yorkers. ``There is no filter at this point in time that can
tell you where someone is actually sitting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a good-faith effort,'' he said. ``But it didn't matter
to the judge.'' He said that he expects to appeal the court's
decision to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Ramos did not explain what would constitute a
reasonable method of filtering illegal customers, at least one
lawyer thinks future court decisions will have to tackle the thorny
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know, under the Ramos decision, that I can't advise my
client to just ask a customer what state he's from,'' said David
Loundy, a cyberlaw expert at D'Ancona &AMP; Pflaum in Chicago. ``What
is good enough? Who knows? What I would like to see is a reasonable
technology standard recommended by the courts, something that is
available to the common person.''

 &HT;    First lesson: Teaching kids not to give up on themselves
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ School started a few weeks ago and, for most
parents, happy days are here again.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first day of school is one of those rare times of
the year, like Christmas, when almost everyone is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know, students will tell you that they aren't excited, but
don't believe it for a moment. With few exceptions, they can't wait
to get to school. This is not entirely because they are all wanting
to get to class, they also want to see their friends and get away
from their nagging parents.
</P>
<P>
   But don't underestimate the degree to which children want to
learn, either.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of school really is like the first day of the rest
of your life and that fact isn't lost on most children.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have done well in the past year, it is a chance to
move ahead even further, to see how high they can go. Those who
already have a solid grounding in school see it as a true
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have not done particularly well have another chance.
They start off with a slate that, while it may not be completely
blank, at least is has plenty of room on which to write a new
story.
</P>
<P>
   It is more difficult for these kids, to be sure, because if they
have not learned well enough in the past, it will be an uphill
battle in each succeeding year.
</P>
<P>
   But history is full of stories about people who have turned
themselves around in midstream.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I'm one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember much about the placement test we took in sixth
grade to determine what level of classes we would attend for my
first year of junior high. All I know is, when I got to class the
next year, I had been placed in remedial English, math and science.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't merely from the results of testing, mind you. I had
always been a poor student.
</P>
<P>
   You're looking at a true benefactor of the system of social
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a shock to be placed with that group everyone
considered ``the dumb kids.'' I wasn't talking about ``them'' any
more. I was talking about ``us.''
</P>
<P>
   But what burns in my memory was the day I was talking to Mr.
Nichols, my eighth grade math teacher _ once on the remedial track
it was almost impossible to escape.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking about my hope of getting out of remedial classes
so I could have the opportunity to take algebra, which I knew was
necessary to get into college.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nichols looked me straight in the eye and said: ``People in
these classes don't go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose he was mostly right _ probably most of those kids
didn't finish high school _ but to an eighth-grader it was as if
society had given up on me.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say that conversation was a pivotal moment in my
life, that from that moment on I began to do better in school and
graduated with honors from high school.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   I struggled all through high school, through no fault of
teachers, counselors or parents, just my own.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the rest of my life didn't come until I went to
college, though even my parents, convinced I would fail, tried to
talk me out of going.
</P>
<P>
   Something clicked then _ probably the prospect of returning to
work in the aluminum foundry _ and I found academic religion. I
made the dean's list almost every semester.
</P>
<P>
   I have enough faith in our public school system to believe that
our teachers won't give up on any student, but there is one further
task that might prove more difficult: That is, making sure that no
student gives up on himself.

   They are desperate women, these mothers who work from home,
striving to maintain a semblance of professionalism while caring
for young children.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time I fall into one of those
feeling-profoundly-sorry-for-myself moods, imagining that nothing
could be more difficult than juggling home and office. Nothing
jolts me back to reality quicker than a chat with a friend who
works from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been interrupted when interviewing the executive director
of a national non-profit,'' Elissa said. ``Nicholas burst into the
office, loudly panting, 'I have to go potty NOW!' Luckily, she was
a mother, and we both had a good laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is so understanding. Cindy Osborne, graphic
designer and mother of six, runs Cimarron Design out of her New
Carlisle home. She will never forget the first encounter between a
new client and daughter Abbey, then 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The client came in and just ignored her,'' Osborne recalled.
``He should have known better; you don't ignore Abbey. She went to
the toy box and got a bat and batted him right upside his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes just about came out of his head, and I'm about to
die, and he still ignored her. So she went and got a book off the
shelf and BOOM! she smashed his fingers flatter than a fritter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Osborne's first and last job with the gentleman, ``but he
didn't like my kids, so it's no great loss.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the spirit. Even ``the world's longest baby gate'' hasn't
kept Osborne's studio from looking like a romper room. And
diversionary tactics don't always work.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while conducting a phone interview, my friend Kathleen, a
freelance writer, tossed small offerings to the toddler daughter
sitting on the floor near her desk _ erasers, a highlighter pen and
pad, credit cards. The technique worked famously until the child
screamed, ``Stop throwing things at me!''
</P>
<P>
   Subterfuge is another fine art, practiced equally on kids and
clients. One friend, mother of four, can't get any peace even when
her husband is home. So she pretends to leave the house and quietly
re-enters through another door, shutting herself in the furthest
corner of the basement laundry room. ``Otherwise,'' she said
darkly, ``they'd be in the basement all over me.''
</P>
<P>
   In work-at-home lingo, Kathleen noted, ``I will call you after
my meeting'' can mean ``when I get back from an executive session
with Gymbo the clown, when I am done making cookies with my
preschooler, or when both the children are in school and the call
won't be interrupted by a screaming match over the ownership rights
to a wad of Playdough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bribery becomes a way of life for work-at-home mothers. While on
the phone, these women do whatever it takes to keep the kid quiet:
Gum, videos, computer games, play time, special treats, even toys
``if that's what it takes to buy me a few minutes of sanity,''
Elissa said.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Osborne with a followup question, she confessed
how she kept her 7-month-old quiet while we were on the phone: ``He
was, er, attached at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, desperate women always find a way.

 &HT;    After confessing, I have my eye on the White House
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ After Minnesota put a professional
wrestler in the governor's mansion and right here at home a
Superior Court judge got elected by standing on street corners and
waving at traffic, I thought I had a pretty good shot at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   I had formulated an attractive three-point platform: two guns in
every closet, watch my lips, I feel your pain. Now it appears my
presidential aspirations are down the drain because of mistakes
made in reckless youth. I experimented with rabbit tobacco,
although I didn't inhale.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of younger readers (if any) I'd better define
rabbit tobacco. It comes from a weed that grows wild. Leaves can be
stripped off and rolled into a reasonable facsimile of a cigarette,
or puffed in a homemade corncob pipe. Rabbit tobacco is smoked
behind a barn, or beside a creek, and never by adults.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could have lied my way out of rabbit tobacco
accusations if I'd been content with a few tongue-blistering puffs
instead of getting involved in a scheme I thought might upgrade my
personal supply, and perhaps bring in a few pennies from colleagues
willing to give up a Tootsie Roll for a smoother smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the back of my daddy's Prince Albert can, I was
impressed by the claim of how the contents had been flue-cured and
roasted into a ``smooth and flavorful'' product enjoyed by
roll-your-own addicts across the land.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit tobacco is anything but smooth and flavorful. Taking a
cue from the Prince Albert can, I harvested a sack of leaves and
spread them on a sheet of tin on top of the cow shed, where they
could be sun cured.
</P>
<P>
   On a morning when my mother was outside working in her flowers,
I slipped them into the kitchen to begin the roasting phase.
Arranged in her favorite biscuit pan, the stuff had been in the
oven no more than 10 minutes when the smell lured her back into the
house. The episode did not have a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   I got out of the rabbit tobacco business but word got around. I
doubt if my indiscretion could be covered up, even after all these
years. Somebody would come out from under a rock, leak to the
media, and I'd be in the pickle with George W.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm out, I've been doing some serious thinking about
which candidate to support. I've ruled out Al Gore, since I've
never known for sure if he really exists, or if he is only a
cardboard cutout the Democrats use to stand up behind Bill Clinton.
Although he was a great basketball player, Bill Bradley went to
Princeton, and that's where they hired the professor who thinks
it's OK for parents to kill their deformed children.
</P>
<P>
   I'm taking another look at Dan Quayle. It doesn't bother me that
he couldn't spell potato. Every time a report on my garden mentions
tomatoes I have to consult my computer's dictionary. I'm much more
confident writing about beans and figs. Based on journalists of my
acquaintance, media folks who made such an issue over Quayle
misspelling potato were pots calling the kettle black.
</P>
<P>
   What impresses me about Quayle this time around is his concern
about the decline of family dinners, and particularly the plan to
put microwave ovens in cars. If they're going to put anything else
in cars, they ought to be looking at bathrooms, which should easily
be possible with all the new technology. They already have
bathrooms on space vehicles not much bigger than a Crown Victoria.
Female astronauts stay in space for days without asking to stop at
a McDonald's or a BP station.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential candidate who came out for mandatory bathrooms in
cars would solve the problem of wives having to go two minutes
after passing the last rest stop on the interstate. That would
certainly lock up the married male vote. Mandatory bathrooms for
cars would swing the commuter vote and assure financial
contributions from the coffee industry. Thousands of metro Atlanta
workers, unable to endure hours on Interstate 285 without relief,
are faced with giving up their jobs or giving up coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves looking forward to absurd developments like
microwave ovens in our cars, and that means not as many dinners
together as a family,'' Quayle warns. As we all know, the family
that eats together stays together, unless they're being fed
something out of a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   As we might expect from people who eat lunch instead of dinner,
and dinner instead of supper, The New York Times says Quayle is
raising a nonissue. The Times cites a recent poll revealing that 69
percent of American families with children say they have a family
dinner five nights a week or more. That's how we are misled by
polls. A lot of those ``family dinners'' are being eaten at
McDonald's, or delivered by Domino's. A real family meal is cooked
at home, on a real stove.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at fast-food parking lots between 5 and 8 p.m. tells
any impartial observer the old-fashioned family supper is an
endangered species. Dan Quayle is justifiably concerned. And with
apologies to Furman Bisher, whatever happened to Lloyd Bentsen?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Much left unanswered
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A lot more needs to be answered than simply why it
took FBI officials and Attorney General Janet Reno six years to
report that agents fired flammable tear gas canisters during the
deadly final assault on the Branch Davidians' compound in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the only question that this new investigation attempts
to answer, the exercise will be another waste of paper and will
make Americans even more cynical about their government.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious why it took until now for Reno and FBI Director
Louis Freeh to talk about the need to investigate the firing of
incendiary military tear-gas rounds the morning that the compound
was engulfed in flames. They had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Right up until physical evidence to the contrary was dropped in
their laps, they denied for six years that FBI agents fired
pyrotechnic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the leaders of the Justice Department and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation were misled by their own people, then they
both are in charge of such slipshod operations that some of the
nation's top law enforcement officials are not above misleading
their bosses, Congress and the American people. That's the
charitable assessment.
</P>
<P>
   A recently discovered videotape shot from a surveillance
aircraft that morning contains a soundtrack that clearly contains
discussions among FBI Hostage Rescue Team members in which a team
member asks a superior for permission to fire military tear gas
cartridges that release gas by burning. An FBI superior grants
permission to fire the incendiary tear gas cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The radio traffic among assault team members was monitored in
real time throughout the FBI chain of command at the scene and by
FBI officials in Washington, D.C., either simultaneously or with a
slight time-delay, according to an FBI official.
</P>
<P>
   After it was clear that the assault and subsequent inferno
resulted in a historic tragedy, FBI officials in Waco held a press
conference to make their first unequivocal denial that FBI agents
fired incendiary or pyrotechnic devices during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston of Waco now reports that
the Justice Department has had possession of notes for years that
acknowledge the use of military gas by FBI agents that morning. The
military CS gas is delivered in an incendiary device.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's recent revelation and letter to Reno are attempts to
cover his own involvement in a government cover-up, according to a
defense attorney for one of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Now new questions are being asked if withheld evidence prevented
several Branch Davidians from receiving a fair trial in federal
court in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   An outside investigation needs to answer a lot more than why
Reno and FBI officials misled Congress and the American people
about the pyrotechnic tear gas for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of a new probe should be to ensure American citizens
that they can respect the fairness and honesty of their government.
Another piecemeal investigation can never accomplish this goal.
</P>
<P>
   A new investigation into ``what happened in Waco'' should
encompass the entire gamut of government involvement from beginning
to end.
</P>
<P>
   Was there probable cause for the search warrant, for instance?
</P>
<P>
   Was military involvement in the raid, siege and final assault
out of bounds? Were military officials misled?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the FBI refuse to cooperate with the Texas Rangers
during the siege and go out of its way to destroy crucial
crime-scene evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Why was an arson investigator hired with close ties to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms?
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the credibility of the federal government, there
should be an outside investigation of the entire Branch Davidian
debacle. Malefactors should be held accountable.

 &HT;    More shortends and cutoffs
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A writer asks: ``What is checkering?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be a lot of things, since the question comes with
no context. What springs to mind is the delicate cross-hatching
done to provide a better grip on gunstocks.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, however, that the question intended was ``What is
checking?''
</P>
<P>
   Checking refers to the inevitable cracks at the end of planks.
They're usually only an inch or two into the board, and most
hardwood dealers will deduct them from the measurement before they
price the board.
</P>
<P>
   Checking occurs because moisture escapes quicker from end grain
than from the face or sides.
</P>
<P>
   Another question: ``How do I dovetail plywood?''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, you don't dovetail plywood. Since
manufactured sheet material wood doesn't move, a joint such as this
is unnecessary and brutally difficult in this material.
</P>
<P>
   If you really feel some primordial urge to do it anyway, do it
in Baltic birch, which has a lot of plys and thus will work better
and look better. Perhaps the price of it will reduce your urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I use to finish a cutting board?''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it depends. In this case it depends on whether you
made a butcher-block board, in which the cutting surface is all end
grain, or the more common type of board in which the cutting
surface is long grain.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem in both cases, of course, is that most of our
most common finishes are not suitable for food surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Behlen makes a salad bowl oil which works nicely and won't make
you sick once it's dry. The alternative is mineral oil, which tends
not to look very good.
</P>
<P>
   If you've gone to the trouble of making a butcher-block board,
then the recommendations I've seen _ and used _ tend toward the
unusual. Get some paraffin, and carefully melt it. This is best
done, for safety's sake, in a double boiler.
</P>
<P>
   When it's melted, pour it on both sides of your butcher block,
being careful not to spill any of it on you. Hot wax is most
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Let it cool and then take your Sandvik scraper and scrape the
wax down to the bare wood. There will be enough of it left in the
end grain of your board to protect it nicely for some time.

   DADS-BATHROOM _ ATLANTA _ So, am I the only the only single
father in America who has to deal with this? I make sure my
6-year-old daughter goes before we leave the house. We arrive at
the theater, load up on popcorn, soda and little candy bears. We

``Daddy, I have to go!'' We scramble out of the dark theater and
race to the bathrooms.

   The line to use the ladies' room snakes around the corner, but

 &HT;    More shortends and cutoffs
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A writer asks: ``What is checkering?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be a lot of things, since the question comes with
no context. What springs to mind is the delicate cross-hatching
done to provide a better grip on gunstocks.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, however, that the question intended was ``What is
checking?''
</P>
<P>
   Checking refers to the inevitable cracks at the end of planks.
They're usually only an inch or two into the board, and most
hardwood dealers will deduct them from the measurement before they
price the board.
</P>
<P>
   Checking occurs because moisture escapes quicker from end grain
than from the face or sides.
</P>
<P>
   Another question: ``How do I dovetail plywood?''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, you don't dovetail plywood. Since
manufactured sheet material wood doesn't move, a joint such as this
is unnecessary and brutally difficult in this material.
</P>
<P>
   If you really feel some primordial urge to do it anyway, do it
in Baltic birch, which has a lot of plys and thus will work better
and look better. Perhaps the price of it will reduce your urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I use to finish a cutting board?''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it depends. In this case it depends on whether you
made a butcher-block board, in which the cutting surface is all end
grain, or the more common type of board in which the cutting
surface is long grain.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem in both cases, of course, is that most of our
most common finishes are not suitable for food surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Behlen makes a salad bowl oil which works nicely and won't make
you sick once it's dry. The alternative is mineral oil, which tends
not to look very good.
</P>
<P>
   If you've gone to the trouble of making a butcher-block board,
then the recommendations I've seen _ and used _ tend toward the
unusual. Get some paraffin, and carefully melt it. This is best
done, for safety's sake, in a double boiler.
</P>
<P>
   When it's melted, pour it on both sides of your butcher block,
being careful not to spill any of it on you. Hot wax is most
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Let it cool and then take your Sandvik scraper and scrape the
wax down to the bare wood. There will be enough of it left in the
end grain of your board to protect it nicely for some time.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ Dispatches from Dreamsville: After a long hot
summer, the coming of fall was welcome in my hometown of Florence,
S.C. Fall brought the joys of sweater weather and high school
football on Friday nights, but it also set the stage for the county
fair. (Eaddy, Cox News Service) MOVED FOR SATURDAY.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ A lot more needs to be answered
than simply why it took FBI officials and Attorney General Janet
Reno six years to report that agents fired flammable tear gas

compound in 1993. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco

himself. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ After Minnesota put a
professional wrestler in the governor's mansion and right here at
home a Superior Court judge got elected by standing on street
corners and waving at traffic, I thought I had a pretty good shot
at the White House. I had formulated an attractive three-point
platform: two guns in every closet, watch my lips, I feel your
pain. Now it appears my presidential aspirations are down the drain
because of mistakes made in reckless youth. I experimented with
rabbit tobacco, although I didn't inhale. (Jim Minter is a former

</P>
<P>
   DADS-BATHROOM _ ATLANTA _ So, am I the only the only single
father in America who has to deal with this? I make sure my
6-year-old daughter goes before we leave the house. We arrive at
the theater, load up on popcorn, soda and little candy bears. We
find the two best seats in the house and await the next Jim Henson
spectacular. Then, just when Miss Piggy is about to eat up a scene:
``Daddy, I have to go!'' We scramble out of the dark theater and
race to the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The line to use the ladies' room snakes around the corner, but
that's not our destination. We rush into the men's room, find a
stall and ensure cleanliness, and then I leave her alone to
complete the mission. Recently, such trips have drawn the ire and
shock of some of the men's room customers. Not the little boys,
however _ they're too busy concentrating on target management. It's
adult men who are freaking out. (Duncan, Atlanta

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Our unrivaled gap between the well-off and the
poor continues to grow, as more wealth is concentrated in fewer

there somewhere. And if there shouldn't be. (Tom Teepen is national

new rule from the U.S. Department of Energy that requires me to

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Allowing for changes in customs over
350 years, the sad fate of King Charles I of England resonates in
the forced exit of George I from the White House in 1993. The
electorate felt that President Bush had run out of gas. The analogy
to the Stuarts continues with the rise of George II, the Texas
governor who would succeed his father, as Charles II succeeded to
the throne a decade after his daddy's departure. (Andy Glass is a

<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Bonnie Lipton may be the only person who
doesn't think she's courageous.
</P>
<P>
   The newly named president of Hadassah, the national Jewish
women's volunteer organization, has seen her share of both tragedy
and triumph. Nearly two years ago, Bonnie Lipton's husband of 39
years suffered a debilitating skiing accident that left him in a
coma for 18 days, after which he emerged severely brain damaged and
unable to care for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred during Lipton's first week of radiation
treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `You're so courageous.' I don't think I'm so
courageous,'' Lipton said in a recent interview in her Pittsfield
home. ``But I do believe in the words that God spoke to Moses, and
that was to choose life. To choose life has kind of been my
mantra.''
</P>
<P>
   And the life she's chosen is to continue the work she and her
husband Alan began decades ago. Since 1972, Lipton has been devoted
to Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, a Jewish
activist group with more than 300,000 members nationwide. Last
month, she was installed as Hadassah's 22nd national president at a
ceremony attended by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie brings a tremendous knowledge of Hadassah and Israel to
the organization. She has a vision for the future,'' said Deborah
Kaplan, who was national president of Hadassah from 1991 to 1995
and now serves as coordinator of Hadassah International. ``She's a
sensitive person and a compassionate person and she has a difficult
row to hoe, personally. But I have no doubt that she'll be
successful for the organization and for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Lipton grew up in suburban Chicago. As college students
and Jewish activists at Purdue University in Indiana, both she and
her husband served as leaders of the Hillel Foundation, a Jewish
cultural organization for college campuses. Her mother-in-law gave
her a lifetime membership to Hadassah. Then, in 1971, Bonnie, Alan
and their two young daughters left Chicago and moved to Pittsfield
in western Massachusetts, where Alan began working in the family
steel fabrication business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nature of a small city and because of the
nature of this particular Pittsfield chapter, I was invited to
serve on the board before I even got here,'' she said. She didn't
take the position that first year, but by the next year she was on
the local board and on her way to a lifetime of involvement in
Hadassah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got drawn in and I never left,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband made their first trip to Israel in 1975 with
Hadassah. ``That was a turning point in my life,'' she said. ``When
I reached Jerusalem, I felt like I was coming home in a way that
I'd never felt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that she knew Hadassah would become her life's work.
``I listened to Yitzak Rabin, who was serving his first term as
prime minister. When he spoke about Hadassah as being a great
orchestra, I wanted to be a player. I didn't know I'd be the
conductor! But I wanted to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been a national vice president of Hadassah, chairwoman
of the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem, and has served
as head of a committee that built a mother and child center at
Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Ein Kerem. She has
held leadership roles in fund-raising, membership outreach and the
national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton's new role as leader of the 87-year-old organization
brings certain challenges, particularly that of attracting younger
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're faced with the same thing every nonprofit is faced
with,'' Lipton, 59, said. ``Younger women are balancing careers and
family. So we have to reach out to families _ by any definition of
family _ because there are so many different lifestyles today, and
there are so many demands on time.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits that there is a perception that Hadassah is only for
``older, married women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hadassah Medical Organization, which consists of two medical
and research hospitals in Jerusalem, is the flagship Israel project
of Hadassah. ``One of the few things I say with certainty is that
visiting Israel and particularly seeing the work of Hadassah
guarantees commitment and a way of life,'' said Lipton, who
estimates that she has now been to Israel more than 75 times.
``We're Zionists. That's who we are. We are women and we have
women's issues, and we're of America, and we are interested in
issues that affect us as Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hadassah, which is nonpartisan, registers
voters, lobbies lawmakers and provides members with information on
a variety of domestic policy issues, such as crime, health care,
separation of church and state, women's rights and more.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington recently for the national convention, Lipton
and several hundred other Hadassah volunteers spoke to members of
Congress, urging them to introduce tougher legislation to control
guns and curb hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed that we're a real force,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Lipton, a grandmother, has been commuting twice a
week between her home in Pittsfield and the Hadassah offices in New
York. Whenever they could be together, Alan accompanied her to
conventions and speaking engagements out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie and Alan have always had a very tight and supportive
partnership,'' said Rabbi David Small, who has been the Liptons'
rabbi at Congregation Knesset Israel in Pittsfield for the past
seven years. ``Alan has really been a rock of strength that has
helped Bonnie to find her own strength and to do the many things
that she's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Strength was in high demand in summer 1997 when Lipton was
diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, four months of
chemotherapy and five weeks of radiation. Friends and family
rallied. She had five different operations. Some days her family
and friends occupied the entire waiting room. Her doctors said the
cancer is in remission.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after Lipton's diagnosis, her world went dark when
Alan had his accident. Now her rock of a husband, who used to work
out at the gym at 5 a.m. every day, can walk only with a walker. He
has lost all of his short-term memory, his balance is bad, he has
no sense of space or time. He resembles a stroke victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he sees me, he knows me, and he greets me by name,''
Lipton said. ``And he'll say to someone, `This is my wife.' We just
don't know if he knows what is a wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton visits Alan in the Pittsfield nursing home several times
a week. She telephones. And she talks to him, wherever she goes.
``Things come up, and I think, what would Alan have told me?''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton confesses that her success is shadowed by her sorrow. ``I
do it with a broken heart,'' she said, struggling to keep from
crying. ``But I have something to give, and I have to keep on
giving so that what Alan and I did together isn't lost.''

 ZEBRA SKINS, RELIC OF THE '60s, BACK IN FASHION AGAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Animal print designs come and go like any other
fashion and interior design whim. But zebra skins seem to be always
in style.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from gracing great trophy rooms, they have been used as a
design accent in living rooms since the 1920s and '30s. The late
interior designer Elsie deWolf, who featured animal skins as a
dramatic touch in all her rooms, popularized the look.
</P>
<P>
   Both textiles and cowhides can be stenciled to look like a
zebra. Unlike the actual hide, zebra imprints don't feature a mane,
tail or ears.
</P>
<P>
   Real zebra skins, which were revived in the 1960s, are in vogue
again. Just as cattle are bred for beef and leather; lamb for meat;
ostrich for feathers, leather and meat; and mink for fur, zebras
are ranched for their meat and hides.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government allows only the import of the Burchell
zebra, which is ranched in South Africa, according to Rod Smith,
owner of Wildlife Etc. in Houston. Smith is licensed by the federal
government to buy, import and sell animals skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is heavily regulated on both sides of the ocean,
so that no endangered species are used for this purpose,'' he said.
The Grevy, the prettiest of all zebras, can't be imported, ``even
if you come across a skin that someone has owned for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most skins aren't totally black and white, but have a gray or
brown tint. Trophy-grade zebra skins are backed with felt or edged
with leather welting.
</P>
<P>
   Skins can be displayed on the wall, but most are placed on the
bare floor or atop another carpet. Some are stitched into
wall-to-wall carpeting, especially in a foyer or at the foot of the
main staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Zebra skins are approximately 12 feet long (including the tail)
by 6-to-8-feet wide and cost anywhere from several hundred dollars
to $3,000, depending on the market value, condition and quality of
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   With care, a zebra skin will last 10 to 20 years. Treat zebra
skins like any other tanned skin, avoiding excessive humidity (keep
it out of the bathroom), heat and direct sunlight.

   HEALTH-GOWN-KANSAS (undated) _ Beckie Allwood was happy to be up
and walking a few days after her quintuple-bypass heart surgery.
Down the hallway she went with help from her 24-year-old son, Bret.
</P>
<P>
   Bret's first concern was his mother's strength. His second
concern arose quickly along the way: how to keep her behind covered
up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was that familiar problem with hospital gowns, loose and
airy, less than discreet and the butt of endless jokes. The
indignity did not amuse Allwood.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, Allwood and her mother, Gertie Calvert, spread out
newspapers on the living room floor and started cutting patterns.
There had to be a way to design a gown that met the needs of the
hospital staff while avoiding the certain embarrassment of a short
walk. By EDWARD M. EVELD. 666 words. Story will move in the ``l''
category.

<P>
   TRAVEL-OLYMPIC-KANSAS (CAPE FLATTERY, Wash.) _ Just across the
water ahead of me Tatoosh Island was only a shadow behind the fog
that covered the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the island's lighthouse, I settled for the tufted
puffin bobbing in the Pacific Ocean below to symbolize my arrival
at the far edge of the lower 48. This point, on a wooden
observation deck at the end of a pleasant woodsy trail on the Makah
Indian Reservation, is the northwesternmost piece of land in the

DIGNITY COMES TO THE HOSPITAL GOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Beckie Allwood was happy to be up
and walking a few days after her quintuple-bypass heart surgery.
Down the hallway she went with help from her 24-year-old son, Bret.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bret's first concern was his mother's strength. His second
concern arose quickly along the way: how to keep her behind covered
up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was that familiar problem with hospital gowns, loose and
airy, less than discreet and the butt of endless jokes. The
indignity did not amuse Allwood.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, Allwood and her mother, Gertie Calvert, spread out
newspapers on the living room floor and started cutting patterns.
There had to be a way to design a gown that met the needs of the
hospital staff while avoiding the certain embarrassment of a short
walk.
</P>
<P>
   They went through several Sundays' worth of newspaper and plenty
of fabric. They designed and redesigned. The result was a hospital
gown with a patent and a trademark: the Dignity Gown. A year ago
two manufacturers began producing the gown and Allwood's company,
Medical Fashions Inc., has now shipped to 45 states and six
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a mom of three and a grandma of six,'' Allwood said. ``I
don't want my family members or friends or anyone else to have to
be abused in this manner. No one has to be subjected to having
their back end shine.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say Allwood feels strongly about this universal
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Allwood, who lives in Maysville, Mo., about 60 miles north of
Kansas City, owned a hotel cleaning service in 1996 when she had
her heart attack. Driving to a business appointment, she felt a
sudden and severe ache across her shoulders. She drove herself home
and her husband took her to the emergency room. It was after her
surgery and hospital stay, on the way home, in fact, that she
decided what her new venture would be.
</P>
<P>
   So what's so great about the gown? Perhaps its chief attribute
is that it doesn't open down the back. Instead, the gown can be
opened along the shoulders and down one side. That allows for parts
of the gown to be opened while others remain closed.
</P>
<P>
   Allwood had the idea to use fabric fasteners but switched to
snaps; laundry companies don't like the fabric fasteners. The
``dignity deluxe'' gown is a seersucker of blue, salmon, green and
yellow stripes. Another design is done in maroon, gray and white.
Allwood prefers the more colorful gown on the theory that brighter
colors can make patients feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors are working on contracts with hospitals and medical
offices all over the country _ and the world, she said. Patients
wear them at San Francisco General Hospital and at Baylor
University Medical Center in Texas, she said. Locally Excelsior
Springs (Kan.) Medical Center and several doctor's offices use the
gowns. North Kansas City Hospital is scheduled to offer the gowns
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Houck, patient care coordinator at Excelsior Springs
Medical Center, said patients long have complained about the
open-backed gowns, designed originally to make it easy for nurses
and others to care for patients. Patients like the privacy of the
new gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For patients who are ambulatory, they love it,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Having more than one design also helps. Some patients don't like
the feel of the seersucker material, and men, who aren't thrilled
about wearing a gown anyway, don't like the pastel colors.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays people who come to the hospital expect options, and
they've been taught to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have educated patients well,'' Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   There is competition. A recent news story from Hackensack
University Medical Center in New Jersey featured a new gown,
referred to by reporters as a ``dignity'' gown. Allwood was quick
to call the university to make sure it knew the term was hers.
</P>
<P>
   Allwood says her gowns are better-designed, of course, and she's
proud they are made in the United States. She's on the road several
times a week promoting the product, pitching it as a better
alternative than those often offered at hospitals, such as wearing
two gowns, one on backward, or a robe, which can be cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital-gown problem caught the attention of Missouri state
Rep. Sam Gaskill, who suffered his own indignity during a hospital
stay. He filed a bill to require hospitals to provide gowns that
cover patients from their shoulders to their knees, exposing only
their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hind end is always flapping in the breeze,'' Gaskill
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill didn't make it out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Allwood continues to be amazed at the response to her gown. The
phone rang about 10 one evening, with a caller from Frankfurt,
Germany, who wanted to hear about the gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal problem,'' the caller said in broken English.
``Everybody butt show.''

RUMBLE OF ENGINES RECALLS ERA OF MUSCLE CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 5)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN HOWLEY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ It was a guttural, raspy sound. A rhythmic
rumbling from some hot place way down deep. It was a sound that
betrayed its awesome power. It was a sound that shook and
threatened to erupt. There was something hypnotic about it. It made
you want to lean in for a closer listen.
</P>
<P>
   Joe James had turned the ignition and started his 1969 GTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pontiac was the only GM division that really worked hard on
that sound,'' said James, who talked about echo chambers being
built into the exhaust pipes. ``That's what gave it that throaty
sound. The muscle sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Quivering slightly from the throb of its 400-cubic-inch engine
and 350 horsepower, James' GTO has been impeccably restored to the
way it looked when James bought it new 30 years ago for $3,750.
Like a cat's eye, it glints in its original antique gold color. The
hood scoops, like flared nostrils, look menacing.
</P>
<P>
   There on the driveway of James' Broad Street home in Schenectady
sat an automotive bully from the 1960s, one of a gang of street
thugs known as muscle cars.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Honda Civics in this crowd. Simply put, muscle
cars were small- to medium-size vehicles with engines that produced
more horsepower than a day at the Saratoga race course.
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of these magnificent machines began about the time
the country fell in love with the Ford Mustang, introduced April
17, 1964, at the New York World's Fair. With its sleek, long hood
and squat 4-seater deck, the die had been cast for a theme that
would influence the most sought-after and now collectible cars of
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For those who grew up with them, the names, images and sounds of
these chariots of firepower stir a longing for another time.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the GTO in this field of gleams were cars like the
Camaro RS Z/28, Impala 409, Chevelle SS, Firebird, Nova, Corvette,
Cobra, Shelby GT, Barracuda, Dodge Charger R/T, Plymouth GTX,
Roadrunner and Oldsmobile 4-4-2.
</P>
<P>
   James bought his GTO at Knowles Pontiac in Troy. He drove it for
seven years, admitting that he once got it over 100 mph on State
Street. He reluctantly sold it but ended up buying it back 10 years
later. Since then he's spent more than $40,000 restoring it to the
eye-popping show-stopper it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the restoration complete, it was named in the Top 50
among 1,500 cars at the Adirondack Nationals at Lake George. The
next year it won first place in the same show. And last year it was
one of only two cars to score a perfect 400 points in the
prestigious Pontiac-Oakland Club International at Sturbridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cars are so sought after by collectors because the era
came and went so fast,'' said James, 55, a steamfitter and plumber
with the General Electric Co. ``It was kind of a mystic time, and
then it was over. While it was here people thought it would always
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is not surprising that the fastest cars got in the most
accidents, insurance companies based their rates on horsepower. The
early '70s also brought emission controls and catalytic converters
and a general move toward making cars both safer and more
economical. There was no place for muscle cars in a world turned
sensible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a bronze-colored Toyota Camry parked in front of Joe
James' house. That's for his sensible side. He only gets the GTO
out for shows, and he usually tows it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's hard to tell the difference between American and
foreign cars,'' said James, who helped start the Electric City GTO
Club in 1991. ``Back then you were more true to American cars. Any
regular blue-collar kid loved American muscle cars.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his car and cars like it are attention-getters wherever
they show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone appreciates seeing them,'' he said. ``Teens and young
people love 'em, and older folks remember once having their own.''
</P>
<P>
   With a hint of disdain in his voice, James described today's
American cars as tubular and not likely candidates to become
collectors' items.
</P>
<P>
   Though parked and just idling, the ferocious sound of his GTO
commanded attention. It is a sound lost on today's generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today don't have a car they can listen to,'' he said.
``They only have the stereo systems in their car to hear.''

WILD VISTAS MARK WASHINGTON'S OLYMPIC PENINSULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE FLATTERY, Wash. _ Just across the water ahead of me Tatoosh
Island was only a shadow behind the fog that covered the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the island's lighthouse, I settled for the tufted
puffin bobbing in the Pacific Ocean below to symbolize my arrival
at the far edge of the lower 48. This point, on a wooden
observation deck at the end of a pleasant woodsy trail on the Makah
Indian Reservation, is the northwesternmost piece of land in the
mainland United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cold Pacific meets some stunning cliffs here, and
historically the ocean waves have arrived with such force that they
have carved a series of caves through the rock. A sign along the
trail suggests that one should enjoy the spot now, because in a few
hundred years this piece of high ground will be undermined enough
to collapse into the sea. The surf scoters certainly were enjoying
it, flying in and out of the sea caves before settling onto the
undulating surface of the water for a spell.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the ocean just south of here that members of the Makah
tribe, with hundreds of years of cultural tradition behind them,
went on a controversial whale hunt last May _ their first since the
1920s _ enraging some hard-core environmentalists, who tried to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   But political squabbles were not on my mind as I stood here on a
windy, misty afternoon. I was looking for something much simpler: a
quiet communion with the sea.
</P>
<P>
   You can find it in abundance along the rim of the Olympic
Peninsula of Washington State. Hard-sand beaches; towering,
forested cliffs; jumbles of giant driftwood looking like so many
scattered dinosaur bones on the shore: The edges of this part of
the continent present an array of wild vistas. There are
cliche-quality sunsets and persistent fog.
</P>
<P>
   If the light and wind are just right, standing at some of these
places, at the edge of land and vast salt sea, can be a primal
experience. You can get a sense of whence we came, of human origins
in fluid and ooze. The rhythmic swell and dip of ocean water can
feel like nothing less than the breathing of the earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   My stop at Cape Flattery was well into a short tour around the
edge of the peninsula. In essence, I took the long way from the
airport into Seattle: 600 miles in 72 hours. But Seattle's
influence was all over the place: Even the sorriest-looking
roadside cafe had a window sign hawking espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Shores-Copalis Beach
</P>
<P>
   The beach at Ocean Shores is about a two-hour drive southwest of
Seattle-Tacoma Airport through only intermittently picturesque
landscapes. Ocean Shores is said to be one of the most popular
destinations in the state. On the afternoon I passed through, a
weekend convention of Harley owners was heading out. Their
departure didn't seem to leave the beach any less chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-packed sand played host to a riot of drivers,
strollers, motorbikers, horseback riders, dog walkers and rampant
kids frolicking in the breezy chill of a midsummer's afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If flying a kite or building sandcastles amid this kind of
anarchy sounds good to you, then book yourself a room at one of the
beachfront hotels.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, frankly, I couldn't wait to get out of there. And the
prospects didn't seem as if they would improve as I went up the
coast just a few miles to Copalis Beach, my destination for the
evening. The small town had the telltale jumble of kite shops, RV
parks and carved-wood purveyors. But all that fell away a couple
miles north, on winding Washington 109, when I found the Iron
Springs Resort.
</P>
<P>
   This old cluster of cabins, built on a wooded bluff overlooking
the ocean, immediately felt quieter. At least there were fewer
vehicles on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   And at first light the next day, when I went for a shoreline
walk at low tide, for much of the time all I had for company was a
flock of gulls and a black oystercatcher, he of the long, neon-red
beak.
</P>
<P>
   I got to chat briefly with Al Wooden and Jim Eberlein, Copalis
residents who had hit the beach an hour before the tide went out to
compete with the gulls for crab. Each of them had a 5-gallon bucket
full of big specimens. ``Got enough for a year,'' Eberlein said. He
and his wife can the crab meat; she eats it, he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Here as elsewhere along the peninsula shore are impressive sea
stacks _ tall, rocky outcrops where birds and seals hang out. The
coastal waters from Copalis north to Cape Flattery are designated
as Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, so the wildlife is
especially abundant, although not overly visible during my
late-July visit.
</P>
<P>
   Heading inland for part of the peninsula tour can be an
eye-opening experience, and not only because of the numerous
logging trucks that travel the two-lane roads. In between the
mountain views and the ocean waves lie millions of acres of timber
country, some of it clearcut wasteland. In the most barren patches,
the only consolations were the foxglove that dappled the stumpy
fields with color and the reminder that, oh, yes, this is where our
lovely cedar fences and backyard decks come from.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaloch
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Olympic National Park usually evokes its
unparalleled extremes: From the glacier-packed peaks of the Olympic
Range to the temperate rain forest that feeds voraciously on the
mists that roll in from the Pacific. Somewhat less known is its
narrow, 60-mile strip of ocean shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the coastal part of the national park can begin near
its southern tip at Kalaloch, an hour and a half north of Copalis
Beach. Kalaloch has a year-round lodge, camping and six public
beach areas for exploring, wildlife watching and hiking. Public
beaches in the park are also accessible from La Push, an hour up
the coast. Many of the wilderness beaches can be reached by hiking
trail only, making them a far cry from the driving lanes at Ocean
Shores.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you'll catch one of those magical sunsets,
where the liquid, boiling, orange mass of the sun is slowly
consumed by the distant gray horizon.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, I'd never stuck my finger in an anemone
before. Its tentacles will grab you _ harmlessly _ as I found out
during an early morning nature walk led by a park ranger, Tim
Burkhalter. The stroll through an intertidal zone introduced me and
a half-dozen other early risers to the limpets, starfish, anemones
and other heroic creatures whose lives revolve around adapting to
the twice-daily cycles of immersion and exposure that come with
life at the edge of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The giant green anemone can live a thousand years or more,
Burkalter said. Some seemed capable of stretching a foot long as
they worked a crab or mussel through their digestive systems.
</P>
<P>
   Neah Bay-Cape Flattery
</P>
<P>
   Any trip to Cape Flattery, which is on the Makah Indian
Reservation, must include a stop at the Makah Cultural and Research
Center, a beautifully done museum in Neah Bay. The permanent
displays include many of the 50,000-plus artifacts unearthed intact
from an ancient village believed to have been buried in a mudslide
500 years ago. The site was found in 1970 at Cape Alava to the
south, and a landmark archaeological dig managed by Washington
State University lasted for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling and sealing canoes carved from cedar logs, large halibut
hooks of bent wood, numerous household objects and a reproduction
of a cedar-plank longhouse, complete with drying salmon inside, are
among the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display while I was there was a small exhibit of some of
the fine basketry done by Makah women. They are known especially
for their tightly woven vessels, often made from cedar bark and
bear grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum reflects Makah values and meets standards of larger
museums,'' said Janine Bowechop, its young executive director. She
noted how the museum is helping to preserve the native language by
incorporating it in labeling and through its educational and
research projects.
</P>
<P>
   I was curious about wintertime in Neah Bay, and Bowechop said it
rained a lot. ``But it's mild and doesn't snow much, although there
are windstorms and the power can go out.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she much preferred the peninsula's relative
mildness to the extremes of New England, which she experienced
while earning her anthropology degree at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah tribe's return to ocean whaling after 73 years, backed
by the U.S. government and an 1855 treaty, was still much in the
air a few months later. Bowechop said she feared the controversy
had rekindled resentment off the reservation. Only recently had she
encountered the sort of discrimination or poor treatment that her
mother's generation lived with routinely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's resentment and intolerance,'' she said, ``among
ignorant people who don't know anything about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungeness Spit
</P>
<P>
   A message board suggested I could see 43 species of birds and
other fauna at Dungeness Spit. I saw three: another flock of surf
scoters bobbing on the waters near shore; many more of the
ubiquitous gulls, patrolling the ocean's edge; and a goose that I
heard calling, then quickly lost in the fog.
</P>
<P>
   There'd be no orca, no gray whales, no harbor seals or sea lions
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Dungeness Spit, a protected wildlife refuge, is a 51/2-mile
finger of sand poking into the Strait of San Juan de Fuca. At its
tip is a lighthouse, a popular destination for hikers and
picnickers. The lighthouse area had been closed recently because of
a big lightning-sparked brushfire that consumed much of the
adjacent beach vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop some early-morning hikers from heading that
way over the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Had I time that day, I might have followed them. But I pulled up
a perch on one of the huge driftwood logs that make up the spine of
the spit and watched the birds and the water lap the shore. There
was a light drizzle. The fog wouldn't lift for several more hours,
but by then my loop around the rim would be over.

<P>
   U.S. 101 loops the Olympic Peninsula, and state roads serve many
of the smaller coastal communities. The peninsula can be reached by
ferry from Seattle at various points, depending on your itinerary,
or by driving south from Seattle-Tacoma Airport on Interstate 5,
then west from Olympia. Recent airfares to Seattle _ the lowest
available coach fares _ ranged from roughly $200 to almost $500
during the summer peak.

   - Kalaloch Lodge, on U.S. 101, 70 miles north of Hoquiam and 95
miles southwest of Port Angeles. Lodge, cabins and camping are
options; during the peak summer season, room rates rival those at
big-city hotels ($73-$211 a night). Bluff-side cabins have
exquisite waterfront views (and wood-burning stoves). (360)
962-2271; www.visitkalaloch.com. The same concessionaire operates
the Lake Quinault Lodge, a luxury inland option on a quiet lake in
the woods, about 45 minutes to the southeast; (800) 562-6672.
</P>
<P>
   - Van Riper's Resort, on Front Street, off Washington 112,
Sekiu. A variety of rooms, cabins, suites, from $50 to $135, plus
RV facilities and marina. Overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca,
and convenient to Neah Bay and Ozette. Check for charter-boat
fishing seasons and other activities. (360) 963-2334.
</P>
<P>
   - Dungeness Bay Motel, 140 Marine Drive, Sequim. Handsome and
comfortable duplex cottages overlook Dungeness Bay (only five rooms
total, all with kitchenettes and all with a view). Private beach. A

<P>
   Places to eat
</P>
<P>
   - Lana's Hangar Cafe, at Bowerman Field, off Washington 109 west
of Hoquiam. Located next to a bird sanctuary and an airstrip, this
is a pleasant diner where you can even get a cappuccino with your
fried clams. (360) 533-8907.
</P>
<P>
   - Ocean Crest Resort Restaurant and Lounge, on Washington 109 at
Moclips, just north of Pacific Beach. Luxury dining at a luxury
seaside lodge. Seafood and pasta, separately and together, are
specialties; entrees can approach and exceed $20. A pretty good
wine list, favoring regional offerings. Sunset views, complete with
hummingbirds at the window-side feeder, can be superb. (360)
276-4465.
</P>
<P>
   - The Three Crabs, Three Crabs Road, Sequim. A night in the
Dungeness and Sequim area (say Skwim) means dinner at the Three
Crabs, a classic, sprawling seafood joint on the waterfront that
reminded me of New England. Being on my own, at the end of a long
day, I chose to eat in the bar. I've been served by some top-notch
bartenders in my day, but this one didn't make the list.
Nevertheless, the pot of steamed clams and the house-made slaw were
excellent. (360) 683-4264.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula coast offers fabulous opportunities to watch
birds, whales, seals and other creatures, both migrants and
year-round residents. Beachcombing and hiking through tidepools and
coastal forests _ hikers should always be alert to the tides _ are
de rigueur. Some visitors love wintertime on the coast for storm
watching.
</P>
<P>
   - Cape Alava and Lake Ozette Trails. A 21-mile drive on
Hoko-Ozette Road, off Washington 112 (between Sekiu and Neah Bay),
to Ozette Ranger Station, the northern tip of the coastal section
of Olympic National Park. Hiking trails, some of them planked, take
you to pristine beaches and Cape Alava, the site of the ancient
Makah village buried in a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   - Cape Flattery Trail, Makah Indian Reservation. The trailhead
is 7 miles or so west of the Makah Museum in Neah Bay, through town
and partly over gravel roads (it wouldn't hurt to get directions at
the museum). The hiking trail through forest is three-fourths of a
mile to the observation deck at the tip of the cape; parts of the
trail are boardwalked.
</P>
<P>
   - Damon Point State Park, a quiet respite from the nearby bustle
of Ocean Shores, at the tip of a peninsula separating the Pacific
Ocean from Gray's Harbor. For bird-watching, kite flying,
picnicking and walking the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   - Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, 3 miles north of U.S. 101
on Kitchen-Dick Road (west of Sequim). For wildlife watching,
fishing and beach hiking on what's said to be the longest natural
sand spit in the world. Boating and other activities are possible,
depending on the season. Open daily sunrise to sunset. $3 (per
family) daily entrance fee. (360) 457-8451.
</P>
<P>
   - Hoh Rain Forest, Olympic National Park. Allow a half day or so
to take this detour from your coastal journey. A scenic 20-mile
drive off U.S. 101 (between Kalaloch and Forks) will take you into
the national park and to the Hoh Visitors Center and trailheads.
Walks through the giant, moss-covered spruce and hemlock trees
range from short and easy to overnight and intensive. The Hoh
Valley gets 140 inches of rain a year, a ranger told me; rainy
Seattle gets only 34. I managed to visit during a two-day summer
drought (driest months are July and August). $10 park entrance fee
is good for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   - Makah Cultural and Research Center, on Washington 112 in Neah
Bay. Thousands of 500-year-old household objects and other tribal
artifacts, recovered in a huge archaeological excavation during the
1970s, plus whaling tools, vessels, nature exhibits and a
reproduction of a cedar-plank longhouse. Also includes a gift and
craft shop. Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily during the summer season
(Memorial Day to Sept. 15), closed Monday and Tuesday the rest of
the year; $4 admission. (360) 645-2711.

PSST, WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How can I stop my machine from asking me to log
in every time I boot the system?
</P>
<P>
   _ Tired of Typing
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TIRED: Personally, I've found that since I've stopped
turning my computer on, this problem has disappeared. Of course, my
editors seem quite upset that they now have to transcribe my
columns from soggy, wadded-up cocktail napkins.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common mistakes people make when they set up
Windows is to type a password when prompted the first time. Do
that, and you have to use that password forever, which is just
plain stupid if you're the only one who'll ever be fiddling with
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get rid of the thing. Right-click on Network Neighborhood,
then pick Properties. Click on the Configuration tab and make sure
``Windows Logon'' appears in the Primary Network Logon box. Click
OK, but don't restart your computer yet, even though Windows might
want you to. Instead, go to the Control Panel and double-click the
Passwords icon. Click the Change Passwords tab, then click the
Change Windows Password button. And this time, please don't fill in
anything for the new password.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a Network Neighborhood icon on your desktop,
use Windows Explorer to look in your Windows directory, then delete
any file with a .PWL extension. That dumps all your stored
passwords, and you can start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   And before you think I just told your kid how to hack into your
secret file of Claudia Schiffer pictures, remember that the Windows
password doesn't really protect anything but stuff like the desktop
appearance or what's in the Programs menu. Don't leave anything you
don't want anyone else to see on a Windows machine. Any kid with
half a brain can poke his way around your file system and find
whatever he wants. In fact, you'd better send all those pictures of
Claudia to me for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: While trying to resolve a hardware conflict in
Device Manager, I stupidly deleted COM2. How can I get it back?
</P>
<P>
   _ Any Port in a Storm
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PORT: What you did is no big deal if you don't have
anything hooked up to COM2 (the second serial port). In fact, if
you've used up all your system interrupts (the things that tell the
main chip something is happening with a peripheral, like data is
being received), disabling COM2 is a good way to free one. If you
really want it back, just have Windows look for it with the Add New
Hardware wizard (in the Control Panel). If Windows is having a bad
day and can't find it, you can use the same wizard to tell it
precisely what to add.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Not to nitpick, but your explanation for
finding the product ID in the Registry was unnecessarily long. It
can also be found by right-clicking on the My Computer icon and
selecting Properties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know-It-All
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KNOW: To the thousands who have written to say I'm a
dimwit, try going back and reading that column again. The reader
wanted the CD key, not the product ID, which any nimrod can find in
My Computer. The CD key is required for installation. The product
ID is what you give to a Microsoft support tech in the unlikely
event you ever get one on the phone. Honestly, you people are so
smug, it makes me angry. I'm very disappointed in you.
</P>

FANS EARN A FAILING GRADE IN BASEBALL HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The best player in major-league baseball history
wasn't even the best player on his team. So goes the collective
opinion in the Major League Baseball All-Century Team voting.
</P>
<P>
   If this is any test of what baseball fans know about the
national pastime, then America is failing miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Which might help explain the loyalty of Chicago Cubs fans.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Gehrig was a great player, the greatest of all first
basemen. He gave the greatest speech in baseball history, and he
died way too young of a horrendous disease. But for Gehrig to have
more votes than anybody who ever played makes about as much sense
as ... the people endorsing Nolan Ryan as the No. 1 pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, any ballot that doesn't have Babe Ruth's name on it
should be thrown out on the grounds of abject stupidity. Period.
Leaving the Babe off a ballot is like writing a history of
rock-and-roll and omitting the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth towered over baseball like nobody before or since. If he
had been any further ahead of his time, he'd have been swallowed up
in an X-Files vortex. Ruth transformed the home run from a novelty
to an integral part of the game. Baseball was never the same. Ruth
won 12 home-run titles, had a lifetime average of .342, led the
league in on-base percentage 10 times and had a 94-46 record as a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Ruth isn't even the leading vote-getter among
outfielders. So many injustices. So little time to do anything
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The voting ends Sept. 15 for ballots distributed at assorted
major-league outlets and Sept. 19 on the Internet
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com). Voters can select six pitchers, two
catchers, two first basemen, two second basemen, two shortstops,
two third basemen and nine outfielders. Join me in fulfilling the
civic duty to vote, or forever hold your peace:
</P>
<P>
   _ Catcher: The people's choices are Johnny Bench and Yogi Berra.
No argument there, but how can Roy Campanella be running more than
40,000 votes behind Carlton Fisk for third place? Campanella got a
late start in the majors because he was stuck in the Negro Leagues,
and he still won three Most Valuable Player awards.
</P>
<P>
   _ First base: The people's choices are Gehrig and Mark McGwire.
Only Ruth could have cast a shadow over Gehrig with the New York
Yankees. McGwire is making his case with an unprecedented four
consecutive 50-homer seasons. He has 509 homers and counting.
Still, the votes here go to Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx, who hit 534
homers while outperforming McGwire in batting average (.325 to
.265), on-base percentage (.428 to .394) and slugging (.609 to
.584).
</P>
<P>
   _ Second base: The people's choices are Jackie Robinson and
Rogers Hornsby. With all due respect to what Robinson endured to
break the color line, he put in only five seasons as a regular
second baseman. The first vote here goes to Hornsby, who had a
five-year stretch where he averaged .402, 27 homers and 120 runs
batted in. The second vote goes to Joe Morgan, the two-time MVP
sparkplug of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortstop: The people's choices are Cal Ripken Jr. and Ernie
Banks, with Ozzie Smith running a close third. The best shortstop
of all is a distant fourth. Honus Wagner was sort of an Alex
Rodriguez of his day, leading the league in batting eight times
(.327 career average), RBI five times and slugging six times while
stealing 723 bases. The votes here go to Wagner and Banks, a
two-time MVP whose slugging (512 homers) overshadowed the fact that
he won a Gold Glove at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third base: The people's choices are Mike Schmidt and Brooks
Robinson. Though Robinson is second to none as a defensive third
baseman (16 Gold Gloves), he was overrated as an offensive player
(.322 on-base percentage, .401 slugging). The first vote here goes
to Schmidt (548 homers, three MVP awards) in a landslide. Eddie
Mathews (512 homers, .376 on-base percentage, .509 slugging
average) edges George Brett (317 homers, .369 on-base percentage,
.487 slugging average) for the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outfield: The people's choices, in order, are Henry Aaron,
Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle,
Ty Cobb, Ken Griffey Jr. and Pete Rose. Great players, all of them,
but how can Stan Musial (.331 average, 3,630 hits, 475 homers) fare
no better than 11th? Frank Robinson has 16th place to show for 586
homers and 2,943 hits. Barry Bonds is only 18th, with barely half
as many votes as Black Sox outfielder Joe Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After a lot of agonizing, the votes here go to Ruth, Mays,
Williams, Aaron, Cobb, Mantle, Griffey, Bonds and Musial. Apologies
to the fans of DiMaggio, but his career numbers don't hold up to
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitchers: The people's choices, in order, are Ryan, Sandy
Koufax, Cy Young, Roger Clemens, Bob Gibson and Walter Johnson.
Ryan is a worthy strikeout king and all, but it's hard to anoint
somebody with a 324-292 record as the greatest pitcher of all time.
He led the league in ERA twice and never led in victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is the beneficiary of a reputation overblown by three
World Series appearances. He led the league in victories once, ERA
once, strikeouts once, complete games once and shutouts four times.
Koufax was brilliant (three Cy Youngs and five ERA titles). He
lasted only long enough to win 165 games. Cy Young, for his part,
collected 267 of his 511 victories last century.
</P>
<P>
   The votes here go to Johnson (417-279, six ERA titles), Lefty
Grove (300-141, nine ERA titles), Christy Mathewson (373-188, five
ERA titles), Warren Spahn (363-245, three ERA titles, eight times
leading the league in victories), Clemens (245-130, six ERA titles,
five Cy Youngs) and Greg Maddux (219-123, four ERA titles, four Cy
Youngs).
</P>
<P>
   Deep, deep apologies to Tom Seaver, Grover Cleveland Alexander,
Koufax and Steve Carlton.

FOOTBALL: A MARRIAGE MADE FOR TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 5)   (EDs: All times Eastern)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Since many people blame divorces for the fact
that football is on television, we've taken a wedding theme to
break down the professional and college seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, ESPN and Fox are still the NFL network carriers,
committing more in rights fees than Donald Trump's alimony
payments. On the college side, nearly everyone has a package of
games, from the major over-the-air networks to Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny on the NFL:
</P>
<P>
   _ Old: Former Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy, 74, has joined the
cast of the ``NFL This Morning'' pregame show on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ New: Sideline reporters have been granted expanded access,
including the ability to interview coaches _ if they're willing to
talk _ at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Borrowed: ABC will follow the norm on ``Monday Night
Football'' and use a two-man booth after dumping Dan Dierdorf off
to CBS and leaving Boomer Esiason alone with Al Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue: CBS has assigned its top announcing tandem of Greg
Gumbel and Phil Simms to games involving the blue-clad Broncos or
the Jets _ last year's AFC Championship Game participants _ the
first seven weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old: HBO's ``Inside The NFL'' returns for its 23rd season, 21
of which have had Len Dawson and Nick Buoniconti together.
</P>
<P>
   _ New: Mike Francesa's ``The NFL Now'' radio show on WFAN-AM in
Albany will be simulcast live on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Borrowed: ESPN's ``1st and 10,'' the electronically produced
yellow line indicating the first-down marker, will be used this
year on ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue: From out of the blue comes a fifth Sunday pregame shows
_ ``NFL This Morning (Fox Sports Net, 11 a.m.) _ to join ``NFL
Preview'' (CNN, 10 a.m.), ``NFL Countdown'' (ESPN, 11 a.m.), ``The
NFL Today'' (CBS, noon) and ``NFL Sunday'' (Fox, noon).
</P>
<P>
   The skinny on college football:
</P>
<P>
   _ Old: Keith Jackson, after his ballyhooed retirement last
season, is back at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   _ New: FX has dropped college football telecasts this season,
but Fox Sports Net has acquired many of those games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Borrowed: Terry Bowden, shamefully driven from the coaching
ranks at Auburn, is ABC's studio analyst.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue: Brad Nessler and Brent Musburger, both vying to replace
Jackson as ABC's blue-blazered lead voice, wound up getting
appointed co-No. 1's by the network's management.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old: Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit are back in ESPN's studio
with Chris Fowler, but the two comrades will venture out to analyze
the network's Thursday night game telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ New: A lot more Thursday, Sunday and even Monday games appear
on this year's schedule as networks try to fill voids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Borrowed: Todd Blackledge, former studio analyst at ABC, has
joined CBS, where he'll replace Terry Donahue as the network's No.
1 game analyst.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue: Prices for ESPN's ``GamePlan'' pay-per-view package of
college football games have increased by $10 for the season package
($99) and by $1 for a single day of games ($12).

NUMEROUS STANDOUTS EMERGE AS HIGH HOLY DAYS APPROACH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It may not be your father's Oldsmobile anymore, and
it's certainly not your sweet kosher wine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be, a mere mention of kosher wine conjured up an image
of thick, syrupy, cloying red wine that was more amendable to being
poured over ice cream than accompanying an entree. No longer. For
years, dry, well-made varietal kosher wines have been made in
several countries, from Israel to France to California.
</P>
<P>
   While some religions (such as Islam) ban wine and indeed all
alcoholic beverages, some others _ notably Judaism _ put religious
constraints &UR;  &LR; on wine. For a wine to be certified kosher, it must be
made under strict conditions in which only observant Jews can
handle the juice from the moment the grapes are crushed until the
wine is bottled. Indeed, although the winemaking process for kosher
wines is the same as for nonkosher wines, kosher wines are
fermented only with yeast that does not contain any animal-derived
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jewish High Holy Days approaching Sept. 10, here are a
few kosher wine labels to look for:
</P>
<P>
   _ From Israel: Yarden.
</P>
<P>
   _ From France: Laurent-Perrier Kosher Cuvee Champagne. Also from
France: Reserve St. Martin.
</P>
<P>
   _ From California: Weinstock, Gan Eden, Hagafen and Baron
Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, wine and religion have gone hand in hand for
thousands of years. After all, the fruit of the vine is mentioned
in the Bible more than ... 500 times.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a recent family outing to a rented beach house, I took along
several bottles of wines _ and something extra:  &UR; Almaden's ``Party
in a Box'' _  &LR; 2 stars &UR; _  &LR;  a 5-liter ``bag in a box'' with 2 1/2
liters each of chardonnay and white zinfandel and a ``Twist 'N
Serve'' spout. Cost: about $13.49.
</P>
<P>
   Two things bothered me about this product. One, it says ``with
natural flavor.'' My question is: natural WHAT flavor? If it's
``natural chardonnay'' or ``natural white zinfandel,'' why say it
at all? If it's a ``natural'' something-else flavor, say what it
is. Was the wine ``stretched'' with other, less respected varietals
such as chenin blanc or colombard?
</P>
<P>
   Two, the chardonnay's a loser. It manages to be both bland and
coarse at the same time. Frankly, I expected it to be pretty sweet,
but it's not. In fact, a little more residual sugar might have
helped.
</P>
<P>
   The white zinfandel, though, while ``off dry'' (read: slightly
sweet, which most white zins are), isn't bad _ as long as it's
well-chilled.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two beverages I have found to be an acquired taste are beer and
single-malt scotch from Islay, an island off the west coast of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Most scotch aficionados equate Islay scotches with a strong,
pungent, peaty, almost iodinelike flavor, although in truth some
Islays downplay that peaty character (Bunnahabhain, Bruichladdich).
</P>
<P>
   Others, of course, put the pedal to the metal when it comes to
peatiness _ Laphroaig is probably the best-known _ although
Lagavulin is no slouch. For these who do produce very peaty whisky,
it's love 'em or hate 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Now, virtually back from the dead, comes another proud Islay
name _ Ardbeg _ in a modern incarnation after years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Ardbeg is the second-oldest Islay distillery (Bowmore is the
oldest) and dates to 1798, but had basically been silent since the
early '80s. It was bought by the huge Allied Distillers in 1990,
but rescued from oblivion in February 1997 by the whisky firm of
Glenmorangie (Glen-MORE-angie), that firm's North American sales
director, Anthony Burnet, said over lunch recently at Renata's
restaurant in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ardbeg means ``small headland'' in Gaelic, Burnet said, ``which
is where we're located on Islay.'' In recent years, the only Ardbeg
whiskies available were those produced by independent bottlers such
as Cadenhead, Gordon &AMP; Macphail, and Signatory. Now, though, the
distillery has produced a 17-year-old whisky, and the  &UR; Ardbeg 17  &LR; _
4 1/2 stars _ is a beauty. It's also a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peatiness,'' Burnet said, ``is measured in phenols. Some
Islays like Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich have around 30 parts per
million, while Laphroaig and Lagavulin have around 50-55. Ardbeg is
actually the peatiest, with half again as many phenols as
Laphroaig.''
</P>
<P>
   With such an arsenal of pungency, you'd expect the Ardbeg 17 to
be coarse _ but it's just the opposite. When the whisky is
purified, that strips out a lot of the heavy, oily vapors _ ``tames
them,'' Burnet said _ and the result is a surprisingly smooth dram
with hints of licorice and raisins. The retail on the Ardbeg 17
will be around $65 per bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Burnet also was introducing a special, one-of-a-kind bottling
from Glenmorangie, the Highland distillery that makes both a 10-
and 18-year-old single malt, as well as a small amount of
vintage-dated whisky (the latest is the 1971).
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Glenmorangie made a big splash by releasing
three different 12-year-old whiskies finished off in different kind
of casks. The port, madeira and sherry wood scotches (which retail
for around $45-$50 a bottle) have been very successful for
Glenmorangie and are now an established part of the production.
</P>
<P>
   What the distillery now has is eight casks only (that's 2,500
bottles) of a whisky finished off in wood from ``a First Growth
Pauillac claret producer.'' Burnet said the winery's name was
supposed to be a secret, but word leaked out in the wine press,
anyway. I won't reveal the name, but you'd feel sheepish if you
couldn't figure it out ...
</P>
<P>
   Since there was a problem with using the winery's name, Burnet
said, there will be no more than the eight casks. Hence the high
price tag per bottle: $250 or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Glenmorangie Claret Wood  &LR; _ 4 1/2 stars _ is indeed rich
and well-balanced, although I thought the port and madeira wood
whiskies were as good or better _ especially for the relative
prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the unsung premier champagne producers is Ayala, which
makes a line of six sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   Make that seven. Ayala is now separately bottling the  &UR; Chateau
de Mareuil ``Montebello''  &LR; _ 4 stars _ a true blanc des noirs (all
pinot noir grapes) with a crisp, clean, only slightly toasty
flavor. Retail is around $35.
</P>
<P>

RATING: &QL;

 &HT;    Waco compound challenges visitors who come to see
 &HT;    (With photos.)
 &HT;    By John Reetz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With biblical intensity, swarms of yellow
grasshoppers launch from the brown brittle grass in a field off
Double EE Ranch Road. They slap off clothes, glasses and bare skin
with the persistence and frequency of fat raindrops from a summer
thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Stop in your tracks and they stop. Take a step forward and they
fly again, swarming through the grove of 80-plus head-high trees
struggling to survive in the Central Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   A little ring of loosely placed bricks circles each tree, and a
granite marker sits at the base. On each marker is a name.
</P>
<P>
   Pause by a tree in the middle of the grove, and the grasshoppers
settle back into the dry brush. Inside the brick ring that
surrounds this tree is a single, faded plastic flower, the only one
visible in this sea of brown.
</P>
<P>
   This particular marker carries the name David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Reach this spot by traveling 15 minutes east from Waco, and
through six years of TV replays and conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got some directions here,'' the hotel clerk had
said, rummaging through a folder and pulling out a map to Mount
Carmel, much the way he'd pass out directions to Baylor University
or the Texas Ranger Museum or the Dr Pepper Museum. ``People still
want to know how to get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel down peaceful-sounding Orchard Lane, take Loop 340, hit
Farm-to-Market 2491, and pass Coyote Run. Just past the ranch with
wavy metal gates, turn left onto Double EE Ranch Road and then take
a quick right into the Branch Davidian property.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-by-6-foot building sits at the property entrance, covered
with a hand-lettered history of what happened here. A white bench
sits under an old shade tree and a ``Visitors Center'' is off the
edge of a small parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Head a bit on down the drive, past a double-wide, and it starts
to look familiar. There's the erupted gas tanks and the Airstream
trailer crushed during the assault on the complex. Rusted-out buses
sit in the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Wind whips across the Texas prairie, the way it's blown almost
every day since those winds fanned the flames to a deadly intensity
on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, but not the same. The TV footage was shot from a mile
or two away. But this is up close, and very personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us get oriented,'' a visitor asks a local talking to
acquaintances gathered around his Lincoln in the tiny parking lot,
outlined by PVC pipe that serves as a curb. ``Where was the
complex?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here,'' he says, pointing to the ground, and he means
``here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right behind you,'' he points, ``is the bunker. Right over
there was the buried school bus. See these power lines? You've seen
them in the footage.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after fire swept through the complex, killing around
80 (even the number is in dispute), that TV footage is airing
again, as politicians and bureaucrats in far-away Washington try to
reconstruct what happened.
</P>
<P>
   With a new focus on Waco, this piece of ground is once again
drawing the curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we here? Because it's on the way to where we're going,
and it's something we wanted to know more about,'' said Andy, a
young Australian traveling with a friend from Massachusetts to
Arizona, then eventually to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home this was all over the news for about a week, then it
kinda disappeared,'' said Tony. ``We wanted to see it.'' They both
defer on giving last names. ``This is the kind of place where you
don't give your last name,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, 10 miles away, city officials grapple with the renewed
focus on their city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never go away,'' city official Larry Holze said. ``But
the main thing we want people to know is this could have happened
anywhere. We're a good quality community.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Holze said, the Branch Davidian tragedy hurts Waco's
image in competing for new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Seattle or wherever and I tell them I'm from Waco,
people ask me if I knew David Koresh. But the fact is the vast
majority of people from Waco have never gone out there. I'm 54
years old and have never been out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy, and continuing publicity, has brought the community
together, Holze said. ``We believe the good will eventually shine
through and heal wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Mount Carmel, the visitors come, just a few cars a day,
but from all over.
</P>
<P>
   One evening the cars are all rentals, carrying businessmen
stopping by out of curiosity, and eyeing each other cautiously. The
next day, at dusk, the Australians' car, a few Texas cars and a
sport-utility from California sit in the parking lot. This past
week, TV crews have been stopping by for a few seconds of footage.
</P>
<P>
   Small bands of people wander the prairie, peeking through the
bitterweed, walking the edges of the concrete foundations, now
flooded with stagnant, dark water.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors pause on the slab where the gym sat, reading faded
painted explanations of where the fire raged. Weathered blue
lettering talks of incendiary devices, long before any government
types admitted such devices were used.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians read the names of the dead on a stone marker
donated by a militia group from Texarkana, Texas, then wander
through the memorial grove, passing one marker that says simply,
``Little One Jones ... age 1 1/2.''
</P>
<P>
   Just across the driveway, other markers remember the victims of
the Oklahoma City bombing, and a smaller stone honors the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents killed in the shootout that
marked the start of the 51-day siege. A tiny stuffed mouse sits
atop the ATF marker.
</P>
<P>
   Still upright, one of David Koresh's motorcycles stands next to
the driveway, not far from a pile of steel rods and debris.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness comes, the few visitors leave, and the grasshoppers
and bugs flutter through the brush, bringing constant movement and
a low, steady buzz to the prairie. The night wind and the mass of
insects move the bushes as if someone is walking through them.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred yards away sits a big tent, and a dog barks at the
remaining visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Six years has brought no peace to this stretch of prairie.
``It's an eerie and unsettling place,'' says a departing visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was wrong here ... the government, the compound,
everything. And it still feels that way.''

RAIDERS TAKE BORING OUT OF INDEX INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says index investing is boring?
</P>
<P>
   A big, competing index and quantitative investment management
firm in New York showed otherwise Thursday, raiding the talent pool
at Boston-based State Street Global Advisors and hiring away eight
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Asset Management Americas was trying to recover from an
even more serious raid on its own management ranks just weeks
earlier by Merill Lynch, which is spending heavily to build an
index and quantitative investment business from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got picked off,'' said Rich Martin, head of Deutsche Asset
Management Americas. Martin said he wasn't done rebuilding an
investment and sales team, but he clearly made a splashy start.
</P>
<P>
   Leading index and quant investment shops manage hundreds of
billions of dollars, guided by sophisticated mathematic formulas
rather than old fashioned stock-picking skills.
</P>
<P>
   They are paid razor thin rates in relation to the money under
management, usually investing for big institutions and pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Global Advisors, which has $574 billion under
management and is owned by State Street Corp., is a leading figure
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It downplayed the departures, saying that all but a few
executives were relative short-timers at the company and each could
be replaced. The company made a point of saying it would not bother
to replace one manager.
</P>
<P>
   But the usually low-profile business rarely sees such
high-volume executive movement. The developments generated a buzz
of salary inflation rumors placing many deals in the seven-figures
and, in one case, unconfirmed reports of a $9 million multiyear
employment arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is that we certainly tried to make it attractive
for these people to join us,'' said Martin. ``The preemptive action
by Merrill Lynch definitely raised the stakes in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch was willing to pay up for executives because it
was trying to crack into a new business. Deutsche Asset Management
was probably prepared to spend generously because defections had
already posed a serious threat to its business.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Asset Management invests $300 billion, including about
$200 billion in index programs. Most of its index business came
from Bankers Trust of New York, which was acquired by parent
Deutsche Bank in June.
</P>
<P>
   That corporate purchase triggered provisions to cash out
previously illiquid retention compensation owed to many Bankers
Trust executives and opened the door for Merrill Lynch, which saw a
rare opportunity to build a business from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   The day after checks were cut to Bankers Trust executives,
according to Martin, five senior executives quit to establish
Merrill Lynch Quantitative Advisors. Six other employees have since
jumped ship with them.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to feel the impact of the change. New York
City, which has $50 billion invested with Deutsche Asset
Management, said it would put its arrangement up for review.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association is
reviewing its contract for the management of $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Asset Management doesn't just invest for pension funds.
It also acts as subadviser to Fidelity Investments for six mutual
funds with a combined $32.9 billion in assets. Fidelity said it was
keeping an eye on Deutche Asset Management's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin needed new managers, and he needed them fast. That led
him to a list of people at State Street Global.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the marketplace and found a lot of good people,
but none better than the ones at SSGA,'' said Martin. ``Having gone
through a significant blow ourselves, we have no desire to inflict
any damage on State Street. Fortunately for them, we think they
have a lot of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those plucked from State Street: Dean Barr, formerly chief
investment officer for global active quantitative strategies;
Richard Goldman, a corporate sales executive who will become head
of institutional sales at his new job; and emerging markets
specialist Joshua Feuerman, who will become managing director of
international quantitative strategies.
</P>
<P>
   State Street named insider Michael Schoeck to replace Feuerman.
It said Barr would not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Asset Management announced a total of 10 new hires
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The others include new international index strategies vice
president Kevin Brady, who comes from Panagora Asset Management in
Boston.

TAKE A FEW STEPS BACK, AND REFIGURE WITHDRAWALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 05, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband is 61 and I am 57. We both took early retirement
opportunities four and two years ago, respectively. We have a
combined total of $400,000 in 401(k) and rollover IRA accounts with
Fidelity, with 35 percent in an equity growth fund, 30 percent in a
growth opportunities fund, 14 percent in Fidelity Equity-Income, 10
percent in Fidelity Balanced, and 11 percent in Fidelity
High-Income. Currently, we each receive $1,000 a month from our
former employers, which will continue as long as we live. Also, we
are withdrawing earnings of $4,000 per month from the Fidelity
accounts. My husband will receive $1,000 per month from Social
Security when he turns 62 next year. We are building a $180,000
retirement home, taking a $180,000 30-year mortgage. Are our
current investments correct? When I receive an inheritance of
$100,000 to $150,000, would we be better off investing it in bond
funds or paying off a large chunk of the mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   V.G., Dripping Springs, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. The thing that bothers me most about your situation is your
statement that you are withdrawing $4,000 a month in earnings from
your various Fidelity holdings. You would have to have a portfolio
return of 12.88 percent to support withdrawals at that level
without depleting your principal. Although such returns haven't
been uncommon in the last couple of years, it's a very unrealistic
long-range expectation. If the market were to return to its
historical long-term average returns _ about 10 percent _ the
sequence of withdrawals you have established would deplete your
Fidelity accounts in about 16.6 years.
</P>
<P>
   Second, my philosophy has always been that if you are
withdrawing substantial amounts of money from a portfolio, the
portfolio should be designed with a substantial portion of the
assets in fixed-income securities, and that level should be such
that the yield closely resembles the level of withdrawals. In your
case, the only pure fixed-income holding is the High Income fund,
although Fidelity Balanced does divide its portfolio between stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that works in your favor is the prospect of your
husband's Social Security checks beginning next year, which should
enable you to reduce the levels of your withdrawals. But you would
still have to produce returns of 9.38 percent to support a $3,000
monthly withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Although I think the portfolio is too heavily tilted to the
stock side, I think the real problem is a budgeting one _ you are
simply asking the 401(k) and IRA money to provide more income than
you should be able to reasonably expect that it should. Remember,
when you retire early, that means you should leave some money
invested for growth to protect yourself from the ravages of
inflation in the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So my doubtless unpleasant suggestion is that you go back to the
beginning, calculating how much you can really afford to spend and
then redesigning the portfolio so that the fixed-income side
produces a yield that's pretty close to what you withdraw. Perhaps
the key to this is that inheritance: if a prepayment of the
mortgage would reduce the amount of your monthly expenses so that
they fell in line with the yield from your portfolio, that would
probably be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I both turn 60 this year. We expect to retire
in three to five years. We currently have $100,000 available from
the sale of stock and other sources. Where do you suggest that this
cash be put at this point? We have $175,000 in IRAs, with $60,000
of this in Nicholas, $50,000 in Templeton World, $50,000 in a money
market fund, and $15,000 in Fidelity Puritan. We also have $40,000
in individual stocks, $70,000 in money market accounts, $10,000 in
a GNMA account and $10,000 in a CD. Also, should we convert part of
the IRAs to Roth accounts? We expect to be in the same tax bracket
when we retire.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Milford, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. The question of how to invest the money begs another
question: When might you need this money, or the income stream you
might derive from it?
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that you won't need it until your
anticipated retirement in three to five years, but at that point
you will begin to rely on your retirement savings for your income.
In that case, given the relatively short period in question (and
the relatively precarious state of the stock market as well), I'd
move the funds into the kind of fixed-income holdings that you will
eventually be relying upon in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you already have enough money at the conservative end
of the fixed-income realm (the money market holdings and the CD) so
I would suggest you put all or most of it in something similar to
your current GNMA holdings, or into a Ginnie Mae fund.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of such a move would be to reduce your reliance on
the stock market from the current 52.5 percent of your invested
portfolio to 39.5 percent. That's a fairly conservative level, but
given the current market, I would be happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   But now let's suppose that you will not be relying heavily on
your retirement savings to supply an income stream in the early
years of your anticipated retirement. Perhaps you will have
sufficient pension income which will combine with Social Security
to keep you fairly comfortable, and that you view your savings
largely as funds for emergencies, extras, and as insurance against
inflation. If that is the case, I'd suggest that you take a
slightly more aggressive approach, putting the entire $100,000 in
Fidelity Puritan, which divides its portfolio between stocks and
bonds and has an excellent long-term record.
</P>
<P>
   As for your final question, I see no enormous advantage in
converting your IRA money to Roth accounts. If you're correct that
you will be in the same tax bracket as you now are when you retire,
it would ultimately make no difference in the amount of taxes you
pay.
</P>
<P>
   I frequently advise people to hold some of their money in Roth
accounts so as to give them added financial flexibility in their
retirement years, but with more than half of your savings in
taxable accounts and with a good deal of it in money market
accounts which won't generate potential capital gains tax
liabilities, this argument doesn't apply to you. So the only
remaining reason you might convert some of the IRAs to Roth
accounts is a belief that in the long run tax rates in general will
rise. You call that one.

BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS . . . OR OF CRUELTY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second year running, and over the protests of an animal
rights group, General Mills will feature a prize-winning fisherman
on its Wheaties box _ the familiar orange breakfast-table billboard
usually bearing images of sports heroes such as Tiger Woods and
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, 34-year-old David Walker from Cannon, Ky., will
appear on the Wheaties box, and People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals vows it will send letters of protest to General Mills and
to Walker, who could earn $1 1/2 million this season for catching
freshwater bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so cool,'' said Walker in a recent phone
interview. ``I'm no superhero or nothing, and I could end up back
where I started. But right now the attention is just amazing. The
phone keeps ringing. To actually make a living doing something you
love is just the greatest life of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Walker was working as a punch press
operator at the Southeast Machine and Tool Company in Cannon, a
small town in the Cumberland Gap.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years of marriage, when his divorce became
final, Walker decided to quit his job and pursue big-time
tournament fishing to see if he could earn enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, my divorce was the catalyst,'' says Walker. ``I don't
have kids, so there was just me to support, and I didn't want to
keep working at a dead-end job.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October Walker began fishing seriously, and by last spring
he found himself in contention to win the Wal-Mart FLW Tour, a
series of six bass tournaments with nearly $4 million in prize
money.
</P>
<P>
   By this spring, he found himself with enough points to contend
for the Tour lead, and he won the Forrest Wood Open in Detroit June
24th for a quarter of a million dollars and the distinction of Land
O'Lakes Angler of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In that tournament, Walker had to come from behind against
another perennial champion, Alton Jones from Texas. Jones weighed
his fish in first, and when Walker arrived at the weigh-in station,
``I saw a TV camera crew waiting for me, and I knew that was good
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, General Mills approached Walker, who still
has a shot at a $1 million winner's purse in this November's
Millennium Tour, a bass derby that will be covered live by Fox from
Cypress Gardens in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance on the Wheaties box will be the second for
tournament anglers _ the first to be showcased was Denny Brauer,
last year. But the move by General Mills to acknowledge the
enormous and growing popularity of fishing touched off protests
from PETA, which argued that the Wheaties box treatment glorified a
cruel and inhumane sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said that General Mills doesn't care about animal
suffering,'' says PETA spokesman Dawn Carr, adding that the
Minneapolis-based cereal giant did not respond to PETA's demands,
among which was a request for a dialogue on various fishing issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will write another letter this year,'' says Carr, ``and
we'll be contacting Mr. Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr says PETA's ultimate goal would be for fishermen ``to lay
down their rods and reels for good,'' but admits that goal is
unrealistic, considering the popularity of fishing. But there are a
number of lesser goals, she says, many of which overlap with the
stated interests of fishermen's groups.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues, she says, are the careless discarding of
fishing line, which often ensnares other animals and birds, the use
of barbless hooks, and the use of lures rather than bait. PETA has
a website, www.nofishing.net, which states its anti-fishing goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 55 million people who fish in this country,'' says
Brian Sayner, a spokesman for Operation Bass, one of the largest
recreational fishing groups in the United States. ``Considering the
enormous popularity of fishing, I think PETA's going to get a
chilly reception.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayner says that the projected numbers of anglers and followers
of the big pro derbies are close to NASCAR numbers and are drawing
major new sponsors such as Coca Cola, Fuji film, and Colgate
Palmolive.
</P>
<P>
   Sayner also says that Operation Bass intends to branch out into
other species, such as walleye and saltwater fishing derbies. So
confident is Fox in the interest in tournament fishing that it is
airing the Millennium Tour against NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   As for Walker, it's all a dream come true. ``It's just an
overwhelming feeling to know you can just fish and make a lot of
money doing this thing you love,'' he says. ``I see how an athlete
who just gets picked for the draft feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, Walker says, breeds confidence, the single most
important element in big purse fishing. ``You can't be
second-guessing the decisions you make,'' he says. ``You have to be
sure of your abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important attributes of a winning angler, he
says, is a ``vivid imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing is like playing football in the dark,'' he says. ``You
have to imagine what the fish are doing and what it looks like down
there. You have to have a sense for the colors and styles _ there's
a lot of art to it.''
</P>
<P>
   From a blizzard in February in North Carolina to the
90-plus-degree heat atop a Georgia lake in the summer, Walker says
anglers trying to win cash compete in all weather and conditions.
Still, says Walker, who likes his own chances to win the
million-dollar purse in November, ``It's just a great sport, the
greatest life there is.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; STOUGHTON, Mass. _ At Reebok International Ltd.'s annual
stockholder's meeting last summer, company officials braced for a
dressing down by investors frustrated with a stock price that had
declined by more than 75 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman and chief executive, cleared his
throat, took the floor, and tried to assuage at least some critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now got, in my opinion, the best product line in the
industry, and it has been heralded by most retailers as such,''
Fireman said. He asserted that Reebok's new cushioning technology,
called DMX, ``will drive our renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a salesman at his best.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Reebok is still awaiting any clear signs of
rebirth. While competitors like Nike, New Balance, and Saucony are
showing enough evidence of growth for some analysts to proclaim the
beginning of the end of hard times for manufacturers of athletic
footwear, Reebok remains listless.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the Stoughton manufacturer of shoes and apparel
has had a tough decade. Reebok's market share has declined from
about 25 percent to 10 percent in the 1990s. Nike is now edging
close to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Reebok's stock closed at 11 3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down from 51 5/8 in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and look at Reebok's position in the
marketplace you can see the history of a company that not too many
years ago had the exact same market share as Nike,'' said John J.
Shanley, an analyst for First Security Van Kasper. ``That certainly
has changed dramatically, particularly in the last three or four
years when Reebok just got overwhelmed by Nike _ a company that has
enamored themselves with all of the major retail companies and that
is just a marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   A small minority of observers, how-
</P>
<P>
   ever, express hope that Reebok could be in better shape _
perhaps sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness, I do think the symptoms at Reebok have been
aggressively overstated at times,'' said the head of a major
retailer that specializes in athletic shoes. ``The problem is that
it is an extremely difficult business to work in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Labor Day, Reebok officials confirm they will
announce layoffs, even as the company proceeds with construction of
a new $51 million headquarters in Canton. Reebok officials deny the
terminations will amount to anything like the 20 percent to 25
percent of the work force of 6,600 that some current and former
employees have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While Reebok executives will likely portray the layoffs as part
of a forward-looking reorganization aimed at making the company
leaner and meaner, some analysts say the cost-cutting is at least a
year overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Ask analysts, observers, and competitors what is wrong with
Reebok and a number of answers tumble out. Its shelf space and
presentation in retail stores is in disarray. Past problems have
led to management shakeups and turnover that hamper attempts to
sustain initiatives aimed at improving performances. Costs have
continued to grow while revenue and sales shrink.
</P>
<P>
   A good idea, like DMX, is brought to market in shoe styles that
even Reebok officials called ``ugly.'' An early dominance in the
women's fitness market was squandered entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reebok has continued to spend more than $100 million
annually on advertising with no clear impact. Analysts say Reebok
has been unable, for years, to set its products apart from other
companies in the marketplace. What is worse is that it has been a
long time since adolescent boys, who drive a major portion of the
athletic and casual footwear market, thought any of Reebok's
products were ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool factor is essential,'' said the retailing executive.
``Reebok has to find it, but that is not easily done. Obviously,
there are some challenges at Reebok, and you could argue that costs
are too high and some other fundamental elements are not sound. But
when you talk about fundamentals of business in this segment, you
can have the most sound business practices and you still don't hit
with that young consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it seems almost impossible that it has ever come
to this. There was a time, in the 1980s, when Reebok and Fireman
were the Wunderkinds of athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Reebok was a small operation with $1.5 million in
revenue. Propelled by the aerobics fitness wave, seven years later
it was a dynamo with $1.4 billion in revenue. At one point, Fireman
was earning $13.6 million per year, creating envy so intense that
some critics still stand in line for the hope of dancing on his
corporate grave.
</P>
<P>
   But when the aerobics fad declined, so did Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, Fireman was talking about plans for a broad
transformation aimed at making the women's athletic shoe company a
sector-by-sector competitor with Nike. Analysts say it was good
thinking, but the planning and execution never matched the
brightness of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok began sinking massive amounts of capital into marketing
campaigns based on the endorsements of professional athletes. The
result was that Nike had Michael Jordan and Reebok had Shaquille
O'Neal. Today, Jordan is simply ``Mike,'' a cultural icon whose
influence as a marketer did not retire with him. Meanwhile, Shaq's
success as a corporate spokesman has been even less inspired than
his development as a pro basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after three years of flat revenue and soaring expenses,
two executives, John H. Duerden, who was praised for establishing a
rapport with retailers, and Robert Muller, a marketing executive,
resigned. It was part of a lengthy, at times messy, game of musical
chairs among Reebok executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that they have not had the
stability underneath Paul that some of the other companies have
had,'' said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence,
an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The fits and starts are evident, including in the attempts to
bring new products to market. The DMX technology is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a new cushioning design for athletic shoes to
provide both comfort and prevention against common injuries, DMX is
lauded by industry observers as the first technological advance in
the manufacture of athletic shoes since Nike's Air Jordans. But
after sinking $100 million into the development, Reebok brought
shoes to market that were so unattractive analysts say the
long-sought chance for a major, successful initiative was
squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The styling of some of their shoes by their own admission has
left a lot to be desired,'' analyst Shanley said. ``The DMX line,
which is really a great technology, is an ugly-looking shoe. And
it's not an ugly shoe in terms of the retro look, which would be a
cool ugly shoe. It's just plain ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if it can turn around some of its design problems,
Reebok continues to have problems with positioning at retail.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Nike has driven hard bargains with major
sellers, like Foot Locker and Champs, offering advanced deliveries
of major new models and exclusivity for some lines in return for a
majority of display on the store floors, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Reebok's niches at two major retail partners,
JC Penney and Just for Feet, are endangered. JC Penney has
announced plans to reduce the size of its in-store Simply for
Sports department. And after a failed bond offering and some other
problems, Just For Feet is promising investors to cut inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Sears also had been a major retail outlet for Reebok, but Nike's
strategy for this year includes a major move to suck up display
space at the retailer's stores. Analysts say that is likely to
further decrease Reebok's profile.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Fireman's earnings have taken an enormous hit.
Fireman and his wife, Phyllis, own 10,185,000 shares in Reebok.
Those shares, currently worth $120 million, were worth $526 million
just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's response to its problems through the years has been a
series of management shakeups and initiatives _ none of which have
resulted in a sustained uptick in performance. The company appears
to be continuing in much the same vein, with Carl Yankowski, the
president and chief executive of the Reebok brand, saying that
while change will come, it will not be immediate.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the company, Reebok officials
Thursday released a statement from Yankowski saying its goals
include becoming more stylish, solving the retail problems, and
launching new in-store marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we must bring a focused, consistent marketing
message to consumers, and we are working to develop a marketing
voice and platform that is distinctive, uniquely Reebok, and
presents the consumer with a clear point of difference from the
competition,'' Yankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl pretty much has the reins up there, right now, as I
understand it,'' Horan said. ``It's not that Paul isn't there and
isn't a factor, but it's Carl's show, right now. He's been in there
about a year, and I think it takes anyone a year to formulate a
real turnaround plan in that business, and then I think it takes a
year before you even start seeing the effects of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as seeing a turn, there certainly is no evidence of
it in their numbers right now.''

BLIND EYE 
How the Medical Establishment Let a Doctor Get Away With Murder 
By James B. Stewart 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 334 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Swango arrived for his morning shift with the Adams
County, Ill., Ambulance Corps in September 1984, the other
paramedics thought he must be feeling particularly generous. He had
a box of Honey Maid doughnuts for the crew. As they ate, however,
Swango's colleagues became violently ill and rushed from the room.
``What did you do, Mike, poison us?'' one joked later. Swango
looked incredulous and issued a vehement denial.
</P>
<P>
   But, as James B. Stewart documents in ``Blind Eye: How the
Medical Establishment Let a Doctor Get Away With Murder,'' that was
the moment when Swango's double life began to unravel. In a
meticulously researched book, Stewart makes the case that Swango
was a serial killer in a white coat _ a doctor who does plenty of
harm.
</P>
<P>
   A former editor of The Wall Street Journal, Stewart won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for his reporting on the stock market crash
and insider trading. In ``Blind Eye,'' he follows Swango's progress
through medical school at Southern Illinois University, to a
residency at Ohio State University, to a job as a missionary doctor
in Zimbabwe. Through interviews with doctors, patients, relatives
of victims, and nurses, Stewart penetrates the hermetically sealed
world of medicine. In the process, he exposes the arrogance and the
fraudulent professional courtesies that allowed Swango to move
ahead unchallenged. In other words, Stewart does the work that
hospital administrators and supervising physicians in Ohio, South
Dakota, and New York should have done.
</P>
<P>
   The tally is grim. Stewart writes: ``My own investigation has
found circumstantial evidence that links him to the deaths of five
patients at SIU, five at Ohio State, and five at the VA hospital in
Northport, Long Island, for a total of 15 in the United States. In
Africa, he became either more prolific or more reckless or both.''
By some law enforcement accounts, Swango may have dispatched as
many as 60 patients.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to pinpoint the making of a monster in Swango's
small-town Midwestern upbringing, but Stewart amasses telling
evidence. His father was a Vietnam veteran who was rarely home and
who apparently passed on a fascination with violent death to his
son. (Both kept scrapbooks of newspaper clippings about car
accidents and other traumas.) Swango's mother was a rigid woman who
did her best to keep a family of four boys together. Her special
focus on Michael, Stewart suggests, might have contributed to his
narcissism. This kind of diagnosis at a distance is always risky,
however, and Stewart would have done well to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   At SIU, Swango's medical career got off to a rocky start. He
flunked his OB/GYN rotation in medical school and couldn't graduate
with his class. In fact, serious concerns were raised about his
fitness to practice. Fearing a lawsuit, the school pulled its
punches in its written evaluation, and Swango snagged a prestigious
residency in neurosurgery at Ohio State University in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble seemed to follow the blond, clean-cut resident, and
nurses began to take notice. Patients died suddenly after his
visits, and one woman was mysteriously paralyzed. Academic politics
trumped sound medical practice, however, and OSU made only a
cursory investigation. Despite suspicions, Swango was licensed as a
physician in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finds dangerous gaps in the use of the National
Practitioner Data Bank, a monitoring system that took effect in
1990: Swango was accepted as a doctor in Sioux Falls, S.D., and at
State University of New York-Stony Brook because officials never
checked his history. According to a federal report obtained by
Stewart, about 75 percent of all hospitals in the United States
never reported adverse actions to the data bank. ``In other
words,'' Stewart writes, ``three-quarters of the nation's hospitals
over a three-year period either took no disciplinary action against
any physician _ something that strains credulity _ or failed to
report to the data bank when they did, as required by law.'' When
Stewart called the data bank to ask about Swango, he was told
indignantly that such information was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the rise in serial killings generally, and in hospitals
specifically, it seems inevitable that more Swangos will surface,''
Stewart writes, ``and it thus seems all the more critical that
criminal physicians be monitored and prevented from having access
to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   When the law finally caught up with Swango, it barely nicked
him. In 1994, federal authorities issued a warrant for his arrest
on charges that he gained admission to the Stony Brook residency
program by making false statements. The assistant US attorney
amended the indictment to include distribution of controlled
substances; conviction carried a maximum prison term of three
years. Swango was arrested when he returned to the States from
Africa, on his way to yet another hospital, in Saudi Arabia. Rather
than face a trial, he agreed last year to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he was sentenced to 42 months. But unless authorities
build a murder case, Stewart's story may have a chilling coda:
Swango will be eligible to move to a halfway house by next January.

FINDING ODD-SIZED BEARING BALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 05, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've looked all over for 5/8-inch ball bearings. I need three
for an old-fashioned glider. Hardware stores have everything but. I
wonder if the McMaster-Carr catalog has them, but I have misplaced
their address.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Isn't it strange that stores have every size ball bearing or
bearing ball but 5/8. But even as we speak, the handyman was
thinking of the McMaster-Carr catalog, given to him by a friend and
neighbor, John Lambert of South Weymouth, Mass., but had forgotten
the name of it. It's one heckuva catalog, with 2,735 pages. And,
yes, the catalog has several kinds of 5/8-inch bearing balls. The
phone number is 908-329-3200. Some catalog companies do not sell
retail, but it's still worth a call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My brother built a retaining wall of concrete block. Can I
put stucco over it?
</P>
<P>
   RUTH FAAS, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but it is not stucco, technically. You can apply a
skimcoat of mortar, but there is one step you must take to make the
mortar stick. Apply a bonding agent before applying the mortar.
Anyone who works with concrete and masonry will know this is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small cottage in Eastham, on the Cape. I would like
to finish the living room floor, which is a concrete slab, but I am
not sure what to use.
</P>
<P>
   BETSY HOLLAND, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have four choices: 1. Indoor-outdoor carpeting, which is
the standard finish for a concrete slab on grade or below grade (in
the basement). 2. Pergo, the new laminated plastic that looks like
hardwood. 3. A floating floor of hardwood. 4. Ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   As for pros and cons, carpeting will give good service but is
not very attractive (that's an opinion). The Pergo is easily
applied to a concrete slab and looks good for something that is
trying to look like something else. It is warranteed for 15 years,
which is not very long for a floor. The floating floor is a good
way to go, probably the best; it is not glued down but floats
freely on the slab. Ceramic tile is easily applied, looks great,
and will outlast us all.
</P>
<P>
   One good thing about the last three choices is that you can put
area rugs over them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone wants to paint a coffee table top that is a
high-gloss laminated plastic surrounded by a wood border. Is this
possible, or even practical?
</P>
<P>
   JASON ALBANO, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It certainly is possible. Practical? A good question, because
while laminated plastic can be painted, the finish is so hard that
paint might not stick to it very well or for very long. However,
since it is a flat, horizontal surface without sharp edges, chances
of success, without chipping, are good.
</P>
<P>
   Sand the plastic heavily, with power sanding and medium-fine
paper, to reduce gloss and roughen the finish. Mask off the wood
border with masking tape and use a spray paint when possible.
Krylon makes a good oil-based enamel. Apply a primer, and finish
with two coats of a flat oil-based flat spray enamel. The flat
finish will look like slate.
</P>
<P>
   Or, an entirely different way: Brush on a latex enamel
undercoater and finish with two coats of a latex semigloss or flat
enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: thin coats!
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My daughter bought an old house with original brass locks and
fixtures. Is there an easy way to clean and polish that old brass?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY MARIO, Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If that old brass is solid brass, you can clean it and polish
it easily. If it is merely plated steel, it will polish up OK
except vigorous rubbing may take off some of the brass plate. To
clean it, apply Noxon and buff with a power buffer. You can buy a
buffing bonnet for your power drill. It will work well; in fact
power buffing is necessary to get a proper shine.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the original brass has not been lacquered, so
polishing as above will work well. If it has been lacquered,
polishing will make a big mess, so any lacquer must be removed
first with lacquer thinner. I repeat: The brass in the old house
is, in all probability, not lacquered.
</P>
<P>
   A good homemade cleaner and polish is this: 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup
salt, 1/4 cup flour. Mix into paste and wipe on metal, let dry and
wipe off, buffing as you go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting new wood windows. How can I stain and finish
them on the inside to match the gumwood indoor trim?
</P>
<P>
   ALICE SOLOROW, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You will have to experiment by applying stain to the window
wood and comparing it to the gumwood color. You will never get a
perfect or even a close match because of the age of the gumwood
finish, but you should be able to come close enough to satisfy
everyone. Or nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
   And, to make the work easier and less expensive, you can buy
stains in small amounts. Minwax, makers of high-quality stains,
sells small quantities in pen-like tubes with a felt tip. They were
designed for touch-up work, but will work well in your quest for a
match.

HURRICANES SET TO CAUSE A STIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years we've heard the gloom-and-doom forecasts. Bad league,
uncertain future. Just bad football that would not be greatly
missed if it disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you remember the forecast for Big East football,
something right out of Nostradamus. But with another season about
to begin its first full week, look what has changed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Pac-10 that suddenly has become synonomous with soft
football, thanks to the public lashing suffered by Arizona at the
hands and feet of Penn State in last week's Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the Big East that may very well have a presence, if
Miami's victory over Ohio State in the Kickoff Classic is an
indication of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the great expectations of Virginia Tech, the
optimistic turn toward football at Boston College, and the expected
better-than-average seasons of West Virginia and Syracuse, and you
have signs of life that weren't all that apparent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The key to everything is Miami. Always has been and probably
always will be.
</P>
<P>
   With due apologies to Virginia Tech, the pulse of college
football doesn't change much if the Hokies make a BCS run, as they
have done the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they are still the beast of the Big East in terms of wins
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Tech does not carry any weight in terms of
perception. Most fans would be hard-pressed to say where Tech is
located (Blacksburg, Va.).
</P>
<P>
   Even the name recognition with the league might stump some fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami has a history. Not all of it is good, as the 'Canes
are just recovering from a probation stint. But there is also a
spark there, created by four national championships in a nine-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting the Hurricanes can regain that lofty status
any time soon. But they are moving on an upward curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will dominate the way they did in the 1980s and early
'90s,'' said Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese. ``It's
impossible with the scholarship limitations. But they can be a team
people will look in the eye and ask: `Can they win the national
title?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese has always been a Miami backer because he knows what's
good for Miami is also good for the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has recruiting implications for everyone,'' said
Tranghese. ``I've had coaches tell me, if Miami gets good, it helps
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami is getting good, but not great. That probably will take
another recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hurricanes are back in the national limelight. They are
back on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, other leagues are watching. The Atlantic Coast
Conference made a bold public move of courtship to the Hurricanes
about joining as a 10th team, with possibly two other teams (South
Carolina and Syracuse) as partners.
</P>
<P>
   The early trial balloons floated this summer did not go very
far, but Tranghese thinks the issue is far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami would be foolish to make such a move for a number of
reasons. First, why go into a league where Florida State resides?
Although the Hurricanes play the Seminoles each year, a loss now
counts only as a loss, not as an almost certain elimination game
from BCS consideration.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hurricane basketball team is just getting competitive in
the Big East. Why would they want to jump into the neighborhood of
Duke, North Carolina, and the other sharks in the ACC, still
regarded as the best basketball conference in the country?
</P>
<P>
   Those are problems for future consideration, however. For now,
Miami and the Big East should enjoy the ride and the respect that
is starting to come its way.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Big East must still deal with the problems of
Temple and Rutgers and how to get them competitive on a consistent
basis, and it must hope that Pittsburgh and BC rebound with their
programs, the future looks considerably brighter than it did a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it's primarily because of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Million reasons to change
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again college football administrators show that the bottom
line is as important as anything else. Latest case in point? Duke
has agreed to play its Oct. 2 ``home game'' against Florida State
in Jacksonville. The reason is simple. $$$. The Devils will receive
a million dollar guarantee for the move. They did the same thing in
1995, switching their ``home game'' against Florida State. Not that
the Devils could beat the Seminoles if they played the game in
Iceland, but it would be nice for the Duke fans who can't afford to
make the trip south to see a team of the caliber of Florida State.
But a million dollars is a million dollars . . . Even though the
regular season has yet to begin, don't mention the postseason to
West Virginia fans. The Mountaineers have lost eight straight bowl
games, one short of the NCAA record . . . In case you read about
Ricky Williams running wild in the Big 12 this season, don't think
it's a mistake. Texas Tech's Ricky Williams is arguably the best
runner in the conference, having picked up 2,476 yards the past two
seasons while running in the shadow of his University of Texas
namesake . . . Here's a sign that Miami is returning to its form of
old _ the Hurricanes have had 30 touchdown drives under two minutes
in their last 12 games . . . Just a first-glance look, but Florida
State's Peter Warrick looks like an early leader in the Heisman
clubhouse. Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington didn't hurt
himself with his performance in the Lions' 41-7 romp over Arizona
last week . . . Want to get a stadium named after you? Here's how.
Donate $12.5 million to the college athletic department of your
choice. That's what Al Reser did at Oregon State and now the
Beavers wil play in 35,362 Reser Stadium.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Quote of the week

America, Massachusetts leads the nation in percentage of two-year

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The pressures were inherent yet were always
internalized. No one ever came out and told Tim Hasselbeck he had
to grow up to be just like his father, Don, a former NFL tight end,
or just like his older brother, Matt, now with the Green Bay
Packers, by following his footsteps from Xaverian High to Boston
College and to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he took it upon himself to set that as his standard.
</P>
<P>
   The second of Mary Beth and Don Hasselbeck's three sons, Tim
made the determination early on that he was going to live up to his
family name on the football field. That much was evident in the
summer leading up to Tim's freshman year at Xaverian when he
diligently trained to become Matt's backup by running up and down
the hilly streets of his neighborhood in Norfolk . . . with a
parachute strapped to his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know our neighbors thought that we were weird and
probably saying, `Oh, look at what they're making him do,' '' Mary
Beth said with a laugh. ``But that was Tim just being Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   While things seemed to come more naturally to Matt and even to
younger brother Nathaniel _ considered by everyone in the family to
be the most athletic _ Tim had to focus and work harder than his
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having to wake him up at 5 a.m. so that he could go
and lift at Xaverian,'' Mary Beth recalled. ``It was like night and
day getting him and Matthew out of bed. With Matthew, it was
always, `Oh, give me five more minutes,' but Tim would wake up, get
out of bed, and say, `Thanks, Mom.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Beth Hasselbeck was driving him home one day that
summer, she quizzed Tim about why he was always working so hard and
training so feverishly. ``Mom,'' Tim said, incredulously. ``Do you
know how much pressure is on me? People are counting on me. I've
got big shoes to fill. I've got to fill Matthew's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, when BC hosts Baylor in the season opener, Tim
Hasselbeck will set out once again to fill his brother's shoes. He
will line up at quarterback, just like Matt did in 1996 when he
started 10 games. Matt again earned the starting nod in 1997 from
first-year coach Tom O'Brien and wound up passing for 2,239 yards
and 11 touchdowns to wind up ranked No. 5 on the school's all-time
passing list with 4,548 yards and 22 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as was the case in high school, Tim will wear the same
BC jersey Matt wore, No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may feel that pressure and I hope that he doesn't or never
did, but I'm sure that he did in the same way I felt it a little
bit with my dad,'' said Matt, speaking from Green Bay, Wis., where
he has enjoyed so successful a training camp with the Packers that
he has been elevated from clipboard-carrying No. 3 QB to Brett
Favre's backup. ``It's probably the same way with my youngest
brother, Nathaniel, now. But he shouldn't have felt any pressure
because of anything that we've done. It's just a tough situation.
You almost have to prove yourself, because people expect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pressure actually helped me,'' he added, ``but
there's a fine line there between having that kind of pressure
motivating you and also being something that really screws with
your head a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While the similarities _ same position, same jersey number _
will invite comparisons with his brother, Tim is intent on being
himself when he finally takes over the reins of BC's offense,
having won the starting nod over Brian St. Pierre and Dave Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing I learned when I was in high school was that
in my first game I was trying to be Matthew,'' said Tim, a
6-foot-1-inch, 212-pound junior who last season completed 9 of 12
passes for 140 yards and 2 TDs as backup to since-departed Scott
Mutryn. ``I was trying do to the same things that he did, and you
can't do that. I mean, Matthew can't go to Green Bay and do the
same things as Brett Favre. That doesn't mean he can't have success
like him or I can't have success like Matthew, but I just need to
do it my own way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I definitely took on that pressure when I was in high
school,'' he added. ``I said to myself that I at least had to do
what he did, or better.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Tim succeeded in doing better _ much better _
by passing for 4,700 yards and 50 touchdowns as a three-year
starter at Xaverian, including 1,970 yards and 21 TDs his senior
year in guiding Charlie Steveson's squad to an 11-0 season and a
repeat Super Bowl Division 1-B championship in 1995. And while he
could have had his pick of schools from Ohio State to Notre Dame to
Stanford, Tim chose BC to be close to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Tim will be joined by Nathaniel, a Xaverian wide
receiver who has given BC an early verbal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad that he'll get the chance to be here with me for
at least two years,'' Tim said of Nathaniel's college choice. ``But
it's good that he got it over with early, because I know that was
the toughest time in my life. It was good for about the first week,
then it got really, really tough on me. I even had to quit the
basketball team because of it. But when it came down to it, I came
here because I wanted to be with Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Matt know of the influence he had on Tim's decision? ``Oh,
absolutely,'' said Matt. ``I don't think Tim would've gone to BC if
I felt I hadn't steered him there. He had his heart set on going to
Ohio State or Notre Dame. It came down to Notre Dame and BC, and
that was the toughest time in his life, making that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he chose BC over Notre Dame, our family got all these
hate calls on our voice mail,'' Matt added. ``Stuff like, `How
could you do that?' and `What are you, an idiot?' That was a tough
time, but it was important to Tim that he was with me at BC,
because it helped in his adjustment (to college).''
</P>
<P>
   They might have been each other's biggest rivals, especially
when it came to tearing up the family basement _ ``It's called the
`wreck' room with a w-r-e-c-k,'' said Mary Beth _ with games of
tackle football, Nerf basketball, and ``sweatband'' baseball, in
which sweatbands were rolled up into balls and batted around the
room. But neither had a bigger fan than his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Matt got into the game against Hawaii and led them to a
(game-winning) touchdown, we were watching on TV and saw Tim get so
excited that he absolutely mauled Matt on the sidelines,'' Mary
Beth said with a laugh. ``Afterward, we were talking with Matt on
the phone and we asked him what happened with Tim, and Matt said,
`He kissed me on the lips.' ''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for the Hasselbecks.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Michael, 23, is in Green Bay looking very much like a
fixture as Favre's backup. Timothy Thomas, 21, is about to start
his first game at quarterback at BC. And Nathaniel Nicholas, 17, is
a BC-bound senior receiver at Xaverian. ``If there's any other
place I'd rather be than here in Green Bay right now,'' said Matt,
``it'd be with my brothers so I could have the chance to watch them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the times they waged epic battles in their
basement, which usually ended, Matt joked, ``when one of us came up
crying, and usually it was Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim smiled when his brother's playful jab was relayed to him.
``Yeah, he's going to say that now,'' he said. ``But, yeah, my
parents finished the basement and before you knew it we were down
there playing tackle football, putting holes in the walls and
everything. My Mom used to say, `You guys are down there screwing
around so much all the time, it'd better amount to something.'
Well, they haven't had to pay college tuition, so I guess it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to think about that, because we were so
competitive,'' Tim added. ``I'm competitive with Nathaniel, and
even Matthew and Nathaniel are competitive, and there's a greater
age gap there, but at the same time we're really close and the
three of us are as tight as anybody I know.

   ``I know my Mom probably wishes she had a girl somewhere along
the line, but we've definitely had some good times together,'' he
continued. ``That's why I've never felt like it was a burden to be
`Tim, the son of Don' or `Tim, the son of Don, brother of Matt.'
I've always considered it a blessing.''

HATOSY GOES BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FARRELLY BROTHERS' `OUTSIDE
PROVIDENCE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about ``Outside Providence,'' the latest film
to bear the Farrelly brothers' silly stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the guys behind ``Dumb and Dumber''
and ``There's Something About Mary,'' have peppered ``Providence''
with the trademark zaniness that made those films blockbusters.
There's a three-legged dog, plenty of marijuana references and Alec
Baldwin in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, however, ``Outside Providence'' is more than gross-out
bathroom humor and one-of-a-kind hair gel. The screenplay _ by the
Farrellys and Michael Corrente _ is based on an autobiographical
novel by Peter Farrelly and his experiences growing up in Rhode
Island in the '70s. The film's director is Corrente, whose previous
credits include ``Federal Hill'' and ``American Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   The story's reluctant hero is Timothy Dunphy, whose day-to-day
routine includes joyrides with his go-nowhere friends, trying to
pick up girls and sneaking bongs out of the house. When ``Dunph''
and his friends crash into a parked police car, his gruff father
(Baldwin) ships him off to prep school.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the role of Dunph is Shawn Hatosy, whose big-screen
credits include ``The Faculty,'' ``In &AMP; Out'' and ``Inventing the
Abbotts.'' It was a major step up for the young actor, who was
understandably nervous about his first leading role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the part so bad, but then when I got it I was like,
`What am I gonna do? I got the part!''' said Hatosy, 23, who
completed this film in 1997, before ``The Faculty.'' ``(It) was
exciting to have that responsibility. There were a lot of nerves
going into it. That's what the challenge is: You're forced to come
up with the goods. You're forced to do the work, or you're going to
be the guy that's sitting there with egg on his face, looking like
a total dork.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Hatosy maintains a humble charm. He looks comfortable
in baggy Gap jeans, and he clutches his cell phone tightly in his
hand, although he hardly seems to be showing off. He looks a bit
uncomfortable as the center of attention during a photo shoot, but
he eases into his chair for an interview and takes on a casual,
friendly tone, often using his hands to stress a point.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Outside Providence,'' Hatosy gives a nuanced, gentle
performance. His everyday demeanor is a nice change of pace from
the usual camera-ready, Colgate smiles that pepper the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of difficult because the story called for kids in
high school. The one thing we didn't want to do was go and try to
get the `Dawson's Creek' guys,'' said Peter Farrelly of the casting
choices. ``We didn't necessarily think that they were the best ones
for the roles, so we read everyone. Shawn Hatosy and Amy Smart,
they were the two best that we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy has a natural chemistry with Smart's character, Jane
Weston, the prettiest, most popular student at the nearby girls'
school. Despite her privileged upbringing, Jane is drawn to Dunph,
who opens her eyes to a world of freedom and excitement _ including
a few skipped classes and weekend getaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more like brother and sister now. We have that sort of
rapport,'' Hatosy said. ``It's a luck thing. Either you get two
people that are compatible or you don't _ and you're just really
good actors. But sometimes you can see when people don't get along.
Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts in `I Love Trouble.' ... They hated
each other. You could see it a mile away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy is a few years older than the `Outside Providence'
character, but he is often considered for teen flicks and he felt
this script offered something different from the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a movie about a guy who sees this girl and, like,
spends the rest of the movie trying to win her over. It was a lot
more honest,'' Hatosy said. ``They kind of meet, and they like each
other. It's effortless, really. That happens in real life. I could
identify with this character. I'd be reading (the script) and be
like, `That happened. I remember what that was like.' I really kind
of felt like it was screaming out to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy has chosen his roles carefully, and with the exception of
`The Faculty,' has steered clear of quick-edit horror flicks and
cutesy comedies. Every choice has been made with a reason in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a conscious decision. I mean, at the time, it wasn't
like I had a million other things to do anyway, but I had to think
about it,'' Hatosy said of his role as a jock-turned-zombie in `The
Faculty,' which was directed by Austin's Robert Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respected Rodriguez a lot. That validated it for me.
Actually, a lot of the cast in the movie were pros. I did it for a
lot of reasons. It was a challenge to play that character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' was also a change of pace for the
Farrelly brothers, who welcomed the more dramatic material. Relying
on a story stemming from a novel also presented a few unexpected
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of the book was the narrative, what the
character's thinking and what he's feeling,'' Bobby Farrelly said.
``We ended up throwing out most of the dialogue in the book and
then trying to rework the narrative into dialogue. It was a
challenge, and we made a lot of changes. The book was much more of
a slice-of-life thing. It was a little bit more grim than the
movie, and it didn't really have the character arc, that sort of
thing, that a movie needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the three screenwriters made sure the finished
product was true to the original story, Dunph's coming-of-age.
After that, everything else fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had that down, we could go and put in something funny.
We could sprinkle in the humor along the way, which is generally
the opposite of how we do it. We were much more true to what was
serious,'' Bobby said.
</P>
<P>
   The film was financed through a variety of independent
investors, most of whom are friends of the co-writer/director _
doctors, lawyers and dentists from his hometown of Providence. The
budget eventually ballooned to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy experienced Providence life himself. He spent two weeks
exploring the city before the 36-day shoot started.
</P>
<P>
   Up next for the actor are ``Down to You,'' starring Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles, and ``Anywhere but Here,'' a
mother-daughter drama starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.
In the latter, Hatosy plays the cousin and best friend of Portman's
character, who is dragged to California by her movie-star wannabe
mother (Sarandon). The film was directed by Wayne Wang (``The Joy
Luck Club,'' ``Smoke'') and is scheduled to hit local theaters Oct.
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is some of the best acting between two women I've seen in a
long time. Susan and Natalie are phenomenal,'' Hatosy said of his
co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Hatosy's star continues to rise, he is quick to insist
that he tries to keep it all in perspective, sometimes with a
little help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I balance it with my friends. I don't really get involved in
the industry at all,'' he said. ``If I start getting a big head
about something, or if I start expecting too many things, and I'm
hangin' out with these guys, they're like, `Shawn, just shut up.
You're being an idiot.' They put me in my place. It's good to have
people around that you're not constantly talking to about film.
It's a much more realistic relationship.''

THE LATEST IN ART? IT HAS FOUR WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On display now in the Sculpture Garden at the Museum
of Modern Art _ alongside the Rodin, the Miro, and the Matisse _
are eight new cars.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems strange for automobiles to be in an
art museum _ and a bit comical to see them decked out in all the
art-museum accessories: the long lines for ticket-holders, the
plaque-essays with their hushed solemnity, and the officious guards
who bark ``Stand back'' and ``Don't touch,'' as if the heathen were
about to mar a Picasso, not a Ford.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, though, there's nothing at all odd about this
spectacle, at least not in a New York art museum.
</P>
<P>
   According to official figures, 56 percent of the city's
households do not have a car. In Manhattan, the figure rises to 78
percent. As The Encyclopedia of New York puts it, the people who
live here ``do more walking over long distances than residents of
any other American city.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to most New Yorkers, a car is an exotic object
indeed _ no less so than any number of other objects called modern
art.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, the eight cars in the Sculpture Garden (and a
ninth, in a nearby corridor) qualify as modern art: their sleek,
rounded designs; arch two-tone colors; and internal control panels
that look like a Swatch watch.
</P>
<P>
   These are cars of the future _ the exhibit, which lasts till
Sept. 21, is titled ``Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next
Century'' _ but not the remote future. They're not the stuff of
Jetson fantasies, gleaming saucers that you can't imagine anyone
steering down the street. They're real cars, made by real car
manufacturers _ the Audi AL-2, the Ford Ka, the BMW Mini
Millennium, the DaimlerChrysler Smart Car and CCV, the Toyota
Prius, the Honda VV, the General Motors EV1, and the Fiat Multipla.
Some of them are sold in Europe and Japan today.
</P>
<P>
   But they are different from conventional cars _ and in ways that
make them especially appealing in an urban setting, which may be
why the show is packing in native gawkers who have not only never
been to an auto show but rarely been behind a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine another art museum doing this show,'' says
Christopher Mount, the curator who organized the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following a motor trend
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time MoMA has rolled cars into the Garden.
In 1951, it put on a show called ``Eight Automobiles,'' followed
two years later by ``Ten Automobiles.'' In 1976, there was ``The
Taxi Project: Realistic Solutions for Today.'' Earlier in this
decade, Mount curated an exhibit of Ferraris and another of
Jaguars. The museum's collection of objets, in fact, includes three
cars _ a 1990 Formula One, a '63 Jaguar XK-E, and the awe-inspiring
'46 Cisitalia 202 GT.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with cool-looking cars is an outgrowth of MoMA's
landmark show of 1938, ``Useful Household Objects under Five
Dollars'' _ described by the historian Alfred Appel, Jr., in his
book ``The Art of Celebration,'' as the first in a series of
exhibits ``that aspired to teach the American public that
inexpensive industrial items could be well designed and that
everyone should keep an eye out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The aspiration persists. ``This is the mission of Modernism,''
Mount says _ ``to display and promote good design that's
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   All the cars in the Sculpture Garden cost under $20,000 and the
enticing thing about them, certainly, is their sleek, streamlined
looks. ``Most Americans have come to see small economy cars as
something you settle for,'' Mount says. ``What's going on in this
show is a movement to affordable cars that are interesting in
design, that are likeable.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares the Ford Ka to the Volkswagen Beetle of the '60s _
``a solid, friendly-looking car.'' The Fiat Multipla, a
six-passenger vehicle, small on the outside but uncannily spacious
inside, has ``all these anthromorphic qualities _ rear lights that
look like bear claws, a shape like a frog or a duck.'' The BMW Mini
Millennium sports stripes like a bowling shoe.
</P>
<P>
   These are playful cars, fun cars.
</P>
<P>
   They're also socially minded cars. All of them feature
drag-cutting profiles and lightweight materials to boost
gas-mileage. GM's EV-1 is an electric car. The Honda VV and the
Toyota Prius each have a gas engine and a battery engine and an
array of computers that switch operations from one type of engine
to the other. On the highway, the gas engine takes over; in the
urban gridlock, the battery does. (Furthermore, the gas engine
recharges the battery automatically, so, unlike the case with a
pure battery-powered car, you don't have to stop to recharge.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sensible hybrids
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hybrids were causing a particular stir one recent afternoon
in the Sculpture Garden. Bryant Young, an architect who owns a
Mercedes station wagon but rarely takes it out of the garage, stood
shaking his head in admiration. ``The hybrid sure makes a lot of
sense,'' he said. ``I would definitely consider buying one.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Parker, a retired foreign service officer, agreed: ``If
you're going to have a car in the city, this looks like one to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Campbell, a worker for the city, and Eileen Duran,
who's retired, also seemed ready to take out their checkbooks.
``They're so adorable,'' Duran moaned. ``And the efficiency,''
Campbell added.
</P>
<P>
   But are these cars, or anything like them, ever really going to
show up on American streets in any large quantity, any time soon?
</P>
<P>
   Paul MacReady, an alternative-vehicles engineer in Monrovia,
Calif., designed GM's first electric car, the Impact, which became
the basis for the EV-1. ``I've never seen anybody get out of the
driver's seat without a smile on their face,'' he says of his
creation. He talks raptly of its responsive acceleration, its
handling, the new longer-lasting batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he thinks GM will try to sell the car
commercially, he replies, ``I doubt it. The use of batteries is
still experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Q. Riley, a leading automotive consultant, says of all
these exotic cars, ``I don't think that anyone in the auto industry
_ and I'm talking about executives now _ is hot on producing stuff
like this. It's good PR to design it, it keeps their feet in the
water, and it keeps the politicians happy. But nobody sees making
any money this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Hoyt, the New York spokesman for Toyota, confirms the
skepticism. ``Cars like these,'' he says, ``are a pretty tough sell
in a country where gas is cheaper than Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars have long been zooming through the center lane of the
American psyche. What could be more American than a machine that
lets you go anywhere, at any time, ripping away the enslaving ties
of fixed schedules and pre-determined routes?
</P>
<P>
   John Kouwenhoven, in his classic book of 40 years ago, ``The
Beer Can By the Highway,'' suggested that waste is a related
ingredient of Americana _ the essential flipside of abundance, with
the discarded can of his title serving as ``a sign that the person
who tossed it there inhabits a world ungrooved by routine, a world
in which he can be so mobile that he need not worry about that can
blighting any landscape to which he is likely to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouwenhoven wrote before the environmental movement made casual
pollution unfashionable, but there's still something to his point.
The oil crisis of the 1970s and the recession of the 1980s spurred
demand for small economy cars and motivated the hunt for
new-technology vehicles. High taxes and gas prices have even
created a large market for these experimental vehicles abroad. In
the United States, though, with prosperity restored and tax-hikes
politically impossible, not only are car sales soaring to an
all-time high, but trucks, SUVs, and other gas-guzzlers are leading
the way.
</P>
<P>
   New York, as is true with so much else, might be different from
the rest of the country. In a city where congestion slows traffic
to an average of 5 mph, subways are much faster for getting around.
And in a city where street-parking is scarce and garage-spots as
expensive as studio apartments, taxicabs are much more liberating.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the cars on display at the Sculpture Garden appeal
to New Yorkers. They may lack the zip or pow of some other cars,
but so what? Zip and pow don't matter in the traffic jam that is
Manhattan. What they also lack, or at least minimize, are the other
cars' headaches. Headaches do matter, a lot. And these cars look
good, in a funky, brazenly unconventional way. That matters, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, again, it's not at all strange that these cars are on
display at the Museum of Modern Art in the middle of New York City.
In fact, they may have found their ideal home.

GOING GAGA OVER THE GOO GOOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all seems so natural now: hordes of screaming fans, sold-out
concerts and platinum albums.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Goo Goo Dolls, the road to success wasn't paved with
easy-to-follow yellow bricks.
</P>
<P>
   It started simply enough. Lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik
met bassist Robby Takac and drummer George Tutuska in the early
'80s, and the group's first incarnation, the Sex Maggots, was born.
After a promoter urged the guys to change their name, the Goo Goo
Dolls signed with Celluloid Records in 1985 _ an alliance that
fizzled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The group landed a new deal with Metal Blade Records, an
offshoot of Warner Bros., and that relationship proved equally
unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The Goo Goo Dolls became entangled in a nine-month legal battle
with Metal Blade after the release of 1995's ``A Boy Named Goo,''
claiming they hadn't been fairly compensated. That album produced
the hit single ``Name.'' A new deal was negotiated with Warner
Bros., but not before Rzeznik and Takac fired Tutuska in 1995 over
long-simmering disagreements. Drummer Mike Malinin was called in
just a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you want to move back home, and not
surprisingly, the group often considered pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I would say (we thought about giving up) a lot,
actually, along the way,'' said Takac, 34, calling from a tour stop
in Philadelphia. ``There was always something that kept us in it
still _ little victories, sort of, along the way. The tour does a
little bit better; you sell a few more records. The band's playing
a little bit better. (Since) last year, the victories have gotten a
little bit bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all capped by the success of ``Iris,'' the
Grammy-nominated song from the ``City of Angels'' soundtrack. Once
loud and brash, the Goo Goo Dolls sweetened their sound with
lilting strings and a romantic, swooning delivery from Rzeznik. It
gave the group the biggest hit of its career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was necessarily a direction we were
planning on going,'' Takac said of the sweet ballad. ``I think it
was more of a direction we sort of ended up going, you know? We
blurted the song onto tape in demo form, and it pretty much didn't
change too much from that.''
</P>
<P>
   That success helped prime listeners for the group's sixth
full-length effort, 1998's ``Dizzy Up the Girl.'' Despite critics'
complaints that the group had gone soft, the album has sold more
than 2 million copies. It currently resides at No. 31 on the
Billboard 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Iris allowed us to make (``Dizzy Up the Girl''), which
is good. We were a little stalled for a little while there,'' Takac
admitted. ``I think we remembered how to do it again from the last
time we had made a record. We were able to take our time _ try some
different instruments and things like that. I think the biggest
difference, though, is that Mike's on this record. His drumming's a
lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, differences abound when comparing the struggling artists
of yesterday to the arena pop-rocksters that the Goo Goo Dolls have
become. A key difference is a passing of the mike _ literally.
Takac was initially the group's lead singer, but on ``Dizzy Up the
Girl'' he is front and center on only four songs. Rzeznik is widely
recognized as the group's leader and star attraction _ the humble
heartthrob with tattoos and funny hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``John started singing, and he's really good at it,'' Takac said
with a laugh. ``Records tend to fall together how they will, and
that's the way it came around this time. But I'm havin' a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's name was inspired by an ad in the back of a ``True
Detective'' magazine for a doll with a moveable rubber head. It's a
choice Takac doesn't seem completely at ease with, even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kinda wish we had chosen something else at this point in my
life,'' he said. ``We had a few (other names), but they wouldn't
print 'em in the paper, and now we're Goo Goo Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the group's new moniker, image and sound have
taken it up the concert-venue ranks in recent years. The current
bill, featuring Sugar Ray and the Austin-bred Fastball, is a
summer-lovin' dream-come-true for fans of Top 40 hooks and
pretty-boy lead singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an amazing summer,'' Takac said of the outing. ``The
bands are all playing great; the crowds have been great. It's sort
of a carnival when you get in, so it's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their music, the Goo Goo Dolls are committed to a number
of social issues. They are asking fans to bring nonperishable food
items to Saturday's concert _ food that will be distributed in
local communities by USA Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The group also endorses the PAX Youth Petition, an
anti-gun-violence organization that collects signatures at
concerts; and MTV's ``Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against
Violence,'' which distributes CDs featuring music and celebrity
commentary on reducing violence, as well as action guides at
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've raised almost 50 tons of food since the
beginning of the tour, so it's going really well,'' Takac said of
the band's causes. ``We got a lot of kids in one place at one time,
and we were never really able to do that before. It can't hurt to
have a little positive energy flyin' around.''
</P>
<P>
   The band plans to tour overseas once this U.S. jaunt is over,
returning stateside for MTV's New Year's Eve events in Times
Square. Takac said writing for the next album will begin in March
or April of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of so many failed starts before so much success,
Takac remains cautious in his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think success is something that you always hope for, but did
I think we were gonna actually get it? I don't think so. It just
sort of all sneaks up on us. We're workin' most of the time.''

   ``The Bridge,'' in which Depardieu co-stars as well as
co-directs with Frederic Aubertin, begins as what you think is
going to be yet another very banal melodrama about a bored wife who
dumps her laborer husband to take up with a glamorous engineer a
few notches farther up the social and economic scales. Its French
title, ``Un Pont Entre Deux Rives,'' suggests the bridge she
crosses from the bank of boring domesticity with a guy who's out of
work to the opposite bank of excitement with the engineer who's in
charge of building the bridge that finally gives the hubby a job.
Directing isn't the only stretch for Depardieu here. In previous
years, he would have played the sexual interloper. Here, he's the
cuckolded husband.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chewing the scenery and spewing outrage, he simply
implodes and is depressed when he learns what's happening. It's
unexpected and hence compelling in a film that more than redeems
itself by going a few surprising places. You forgive its
schematicism, its beginning with Carole Buquet emerging from a
showing of ``Jules and Jim,'' a film about a woman shuttling
between two men (the film is set in the early '60s). You even can
overlook its emblematic cars for each man. The engineer zips around
in a sharp little red sportscar, the husband in an old heap that
looks like an inverted bathtub. But the ending is fresh and
touching in this film that's infused with invigorating energies of
renewal, even for the wallflower husband, who, while hurt, never
gets melodramatic enough to pretend that he won't survive. ``The
Bridge'' moves from tiresome to expansive and, in its rueful way,
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Simple but heartfelt emotions, conviction, and nobility achieved
in pursuit of a calling are never out of date. All three are
abundantly present in ``Postmen in the Mountains,'' from China's
Huo Jianqi. The film depicts the last rounds of a rural postman
forced into retirement by arthritis. Working in a remote but
beautiful mountain province, he treks by foot to deliver mail to
residents spread over an area which is mostly devoid of roads. For
years he has set out, taking a few days to make each circuit. This
time he is being joined by his grown son, who is replacing him,
having inherited his father's sense of duty. As they go their way
with their dog, the father (sometimes literally!) shows his son the
ropes as we see what the old man's devotion to duty has meant to
the various people on his route. Never straining for meaning, the
film achieves it at a profound level, with much internal and
external beauty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Another deeply satisfying experience was Aviva Kempner's
documentary, ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg.'' Full justice
was done to the baseball feats of the great Detroit Tigers slugger
who hit 58 home runs to threaten Babe Ruth's record and led the
Tigers to a couple of pennants and World Series wins, one following
a four-year Army hitch during World War II. Kempner made the film
over 12 years and just in time, obtaining interviews with a lot of
now departed teammates who played alongside Greenberg, such as
fellow infielders Charley Cehringer and Billy Rogell. She had
access to the family archives and includes intriguing footage of
Greenberg, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was a dignified man as well as an accomplished one, and he's
quite candid about being a Jewish role model as well as a team
leader. He may not have been the first Jewish major leaguer, but he
was the first Jewish superstar and, as reminiscences from friends
and contemporaries make clear, he heartened a lot of Jewish kids
when anti-semitism was a lot more openly and virulently expressed.
Kempner doesn't overlook the fact that although Greenberg came back
from the war to win a World Series in 1945 (and the home run and
RBI crowns in 1946), his career ended when Jackie Robinson's began.
``He gave me encouragement,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he knew where Robinson was coming from. Later, as an
executive, he fielded champion teams with Cleveland and the Chicago
White Sox by opening the door to black players. ``The Life and
Times of Hank Greenberg'' conjures up the man with a gratifying
fullness, with lots of family footage from the Bronx, where
Greenberg starred at James Monroe High School, shots of his proud
parents, interviews with his brother and children and even a
Greenberg groupie. She once followed Greenberg to spring training
and had her picture taken, ``Bowfinger'' style, with Greenberg
standing behind her, oblivious to what was going on. You don't have
to be Jewish to find ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''
thoroughly engrossing and rewarding. You don't even have to know
baseball to appreciate the expectations this singular role model so
classily carried on his broad shoulders.

GROUNDBREAKERS KEEP TO THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Version 1.0: It's the summer of teenage boys and teenage girls,
those who fill the venues and those singing from the stages _
Britney, 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. A summer of froth.
</P>
<P>
   Version 2.0: It's the summer of macho rap/metal-heads suggesting
rage as the only response to life _ Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, etc. A
summer of aggro.
</P>
<P>
   Version R.E.M: ``We're a rock 'n' roll band,'' says guitarist
Peter Buck, blithely and merrily unconnected to either of the first
two versions of summertime success. ``It seems like the audience in
general is switching away from (rock 'n' roll) a little bit and
that's just fine with me. We can go out there and play street
corners. I've had a lot of great years out there'' in the arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, R.E.M. is nowhere near the busking stage. The band
will be at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield, Mass. Sept. 11 on its
first full-blown jaunt since 1995. No hi-tech contraptions on
stage, says Buck. The look will be ``cheap and cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mansfield date is the last on R.E.M.'s first extensive US
tour without founding drummer Bill Berry. The remaining three
members _ Buck, singer Michael Stipe, and bassist-keyboardist Mike
Mills _ visited Berry in Athens, Ga., the band's old home base.
``We all went over to his house, had dinner, and hung around,''
says Buck. ``It was great seeing him. I'm sure he feels ambivalent
(about leaving). But he doesn't want to be in the studio or
rehearsing; he doesn't want to travel. He made a point of telling
everyone how happy he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Waronker, a much younger man than his band mates, Buck
notes, is filling Berry's seat. How does it feel? ``Well, it feels
like a band,'' says Buck. ``It doesn't feel like the old band, but
that's good, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do a lot of stuff from various places of our
past. A lot of the new record (`Up') and the previous record
(`Monster'), new songs, some covers.'' He says the long-banished
first hit, ``Radio Free Europe,'' could even make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Up'' is what Buck refers to as a ``spacy, drum-machine
record,'' he says R.E.M. will not rearrange older material to fit
that style. ``We'll be true to the original material,'' even though
relearning songs from '80s records is ``like finding your way in
the dark. . . . But we're all in a really positive mood. We're just
revisiting ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s motivation, Buck says, remains simple: ``I don't think
we've made our best record yet. There may come a time where I'm,
like, `That's it.' Then, it'll be time to do something else.''
(Buck has several projects including the instrumental fusion group
Tuatara.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, R.E.M. has done something else: The band scored the
music to ``Man on the Moon,'' the Andy Kaufman biopic starring Jim
Carrey that will be released in December. (The soundtrack may be
out as early as October.) Six years ago, R.E.M. wrote the song
``Man on the Moon,'' about the late comic; that song is included,
Buck says, as well as one other rock song and the mostly
instrumental score. ``It's real mathematical,'' he says. ``We were
trying to score it to sheet music. I kind of liked it. It puts you
in this area where you have to make these decisions based on
different elements of what's happending in the film; the hardest
part is finding the melodies and the rhythms, but it's fun writing
with that kind of challenge. And, it is an amazing movie.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the great semisecret motivations as to why people form
rock 'n' roll bands: Job avoidance. Says Stuart Braithwaite, 23,
guitarist for the Scottish avant-rock band Mogwai: ``Most people
our age in Western society are pretty slack and don't wanna get
jobs. So, we just started the band and (only later) realized we had
some rocking to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came, he says by phone from the Glasgow record
label Chemikal Underground, a couple of years into the band's
inception _ this would have been early 1997 _ playing ``one of the
first live shows, when we supported Pavement in London in front of
a couple of thousand people. It went really well and we wanted to
see how far we could push the scam.''
</P>
<P>
   A lovely, albeit noisy, little scam it is. The Mogwai guys are
fans of Sonic Youth, Joy Division, Wire, and My Bloody Valentine.
Mogwai favors songs that mutate slowly from something moody and
contemplative into something gnashing, grand, and cacophonic.
Raison d'etre? ``I think the whole thing stems from a love of
jumping on my pedals at the same time,'' offers Braithwaite,
``really. It's interesting that it became an art form we kept
trying to perfect. Actually (on the new album `Come On Die Young')
we've gone away from a bit _ it had become a cliche _ but we still
enjoy doing it live. On our reccord, there's still tension there,
but it's not as much bludgeoning as it is underlying. It's more
`The Exorcist,' as opposed to `Cannibal Holocaust.' ''
</P>
<P>
   You won't hear many vocals. ``I'm not a really good singer for a
start,'' explains Braithwaite, ``and also it doesn't seem necessary
basically. We write music and if it feels empty, we can add another
layer. We've thought our vocals sound ridiculous next to the music
we enoy playing. What we do is based more on melody than
experimentation, but at the same time, to someone listening to
commercial rock music it would seem weird. But when we're up there
playing, we're imagining we're Led Zeppelin; we just think it's
just rock music.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you see me smiling?,'' asked John Felice,
singer-guitarist of the Real Kids. ``This was way more than I
expected it to be. I wasn't expecting such a turnout and a warm
response. I didn't think people cared about us anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But care we do. The improbable resurrection of the Real Kids, a
mid- to late-1970s Boston pop-punk band, happened in front of a
packed crowd at the Linwood Grill. In fact, Felice and his mates _
drummer Howie Ferguson, bassist Alpo, and guitarist Billy Borgioli
_ had a mini-Springsteen moment. Out in the crowd there was a
feeling of the world being just right.
</P>
<P>
   Felice, a former Modern Lover, has had four versions of his more
recent band, the Devotions through the past decade, but the Real
Kids is where he made his mark and where he still feels best. ``I
got into it,'' he says, of the Devotions, ``but there's nothing
like playing with these guys; it's my band and always has been.
some kind of chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the chemistry was, well, chemically enhanced,
and Felice admits that led to the group's downfall. ``We did
prematurely fade into oblivion due to drugs, alcohol, and bad
attitude,'' he says. The Real Kids, which existed sporadically into
the early 1980s and last played together in 1992, re-formed late
last year. Rancid's Lars Fredericksen is slated to produce a Real
Kids album, due for release on TKO next year. The Kids have a
single, ``I'll Say It,'' and a four-song EP coming next month;
that's when they begin recording the album, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun thing,'' says Felice, ``has been the younger kids not
treating us like an old dinosaur band, that we have a place in the
rock 'n' roll they're listening to, that we're `modern' enough
without sacrificing anything we had.''

`IDLE HANDS' GRASPS FAMILIAR PLOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
 
`IDLE HANDS' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1999, R, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Gratuitous sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   A choking cloud of marijuana smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Big, steamy helpings of gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Idle Hands'' is a traditional film, although not so
much for those tacky elements as the plot they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Its tale of a murderous hand with a mind of its own is steeped
in horror history, echoing such films as 1924's and 1961's ``The
Hands of Orlac,'' 1963's ``The Crawling Hand,'' 1981's ``The Hand''
and 1987's ``Evil Dead 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle Hands'' is most like the last, since both are comedies at
heart. Its twisted laughs also recall 1981's ``An American Werewolf
in London,'' thanks to a deceased duo (Seth Green and Elden Henson)
who return as mixed-up zombies.
</P>
<P>
   Their slacker pal (Devon Sawa) starts unwillingly killing with
his hand by virtue of demonic possession. It seems he's ignored the
adage about idle hands doing Satan's mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting it off doesn't help. That just turns the hand loose,
like the ``Addams Family's'' ``Thing'' gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonish slapstick and gross-out gags wear thin, but the
situations and characters are a stitch, especially the zombie boys.
</P>
<P>
   To them, being dead is no big adjustment. They were deadbeats
anyway. So they merrily make the best of things with an infectious
can-do spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this film is for a niche audience. Lurking at its core
are teen boys who read Fangoria magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But if you could stomach the gore of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
you can take this. Surrender to its subversive spirit and laugh
while you're being appalled. 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1986, G, Disney, CC, VHS $26.99
</P>
<P>
   Via advances in computer animation, this was a high point in the
lean years between Walt Disney's death in 1966 and his studio's
animation renaissance with 1989's ``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is a mouse spin on Sherlock Holmes, although its title
character is named Basil (presumably as in Rathbone), not Sherlock.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Mancini's music is lovely and lush; the voice actors are
superb (the late Vincent Price plays bad guy Ratigan); and
Victorian London looks alluring, though not as grand as it did in
``Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the film as a whole: good but not
great. 2 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOING BOLDLY TO DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obsessive ``Star Trek'' fans can rejoice _ or freak out.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can start collecting the original '60s series all over
again, but this time on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has boldly issued two ``Trek'' DVDs, each with two
episodes from 1966. Volume 1 features ``Where No Man Has Gone
Before'' and ``The Corbomite Maneuver''; Volume 2 has ``Mudd's
Women'' and ``The Enemy Within.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the shows are being reissued in sequence with their
original production, not their first air dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where No Man'' was the second pilot, but it didn't air until
several episodes into the first season. That led to some awkward
jolts, since the crew's uniforms were quite different, Kirk wielded
a phaser rifle (never seen again) and Spock even smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The first pilot, ``The Cage,'' is a double-length program that
isn't set yet for DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For DVD, these ``Classic Trek'' shows are being digitally
remastered and remixed for Dolby Digital sound. They include
English subtitle options, scene selection (or ``chapter stops'')
and the original broadcast previews.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested price is $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount intends to reissue the entire '60s series on DVD
eventually, but it will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Volumes 3 and 4 are set for Oct. 19, with Volumes 5 and 6 due
before year's end. At that rate, amassing all 79 episodes on DVD
may take three years.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has no plans for a DVD release of ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation'' or other ``Trek'' TV series. But if ``Classic
Trek'' sells well, you can bank on it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Trek'' movies are reaching DVD _ in reverse
order.
</P>
<P>
   Now available are the fifth through ninth films. ``Star Trek IV:
The Voyage Home'' is due Nov. 9. The movies cost a suggested
$29.99.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DISNEY TAKES THE PLUNGE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disney is finally taking the DVD plunge with its classic
animated fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio'' reaches DVD Oct. 26, followed by ``101
Dalmatians,'' ``Hercules and Mulan,'' Nov. 11; ``Lady and the
Tramp,'' ``Peter Pan'' and ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride,''
Nov. 23; and ``The Little Mermaid'' and ``The Jungle Book,'' Dec.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Titles will be priced for sales and will go on moratorium
quickly. Retailers can't reorder after 60 days, but many copies
should remain on shelves for months longer.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Disney has issued no theatrical animated features on
DVD _ at least, not traditional ones. ``A Bug's Life'' is on DVD,
but it's entirely computer-animated and, besides, was produced by
Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty and the Beast: An Enchanted Christmas'' also is on DVD,
but it was animated by Disney's TV arm for direct-to-video release.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for ``Lion King II,'' but the eight other animated
DVDs due soon all were theatrical hits _ if not bona fide classics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TV `AVENGERS' A HIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Avengers'' movie may have flopped, but the
original TV series is a hit on video, with more episodes arriving
this week.
</P>
<P>
   On VHS come two boxed sets of ``The Avengers '66.'' Each has
three tapes with a total of six episodes costing $29.95. Individual
tapes are $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The same episodes come on two DVDs, sold as a set for $44.95 or
separately for $24.95. Episodes from 1965, previously issued on
tape, also are new on two DVDs, sold for the same price as the '66
shows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VIDEO RATINGS &QL; 
 &QL; 
4 stars _ Excellent &QL; 
3 stars _ Good &QL;

JOHN POPPER MOVES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; John Popper's world has been in chaos. The Blues Traveler
singer, whose weight has risen to more than 400 pounds, suffered
chest pains that signaled the need for heart surgery earlier this
summer, forcing him to cancel a guest appearance with the Dave
Matthews Band at Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   More tough news came two weeks ago when Blues Traveler bassist
Bob Sheehan was found dead in his New Orleans home. The cause of
death has not yet been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that Bob Sheehan was respected, loved, and
revered by all who knew him, or knew of his music, he was easily
the most underestimated member of the band,'' Popper wrote in a
statement. ``The best friend I've had in the world has just died
and I don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Popper's summer has been a trying one, but he is about to
release his first solo album, ``Zygote,'' a gutsy survivor's
record. ``I just want to live/Before I didn't really care,'' he
sings in the song ``Once You Wake Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Popper has awakened and poured himself into the album, which is
due Sept. 14. The album is more song-driven and more Beatlesque,
compared to the jam-oriented Blues Traveler norm. It's one of the
year's better solo records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different side of me, but I think it's a side that I've
always had,'' Popper said recently, just days before Sheehan died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Blues Traveler is its own thing. The band is good at
doing epic-sounding stuff, but the solo record is on a different
dynamic, a little quieter. It's also a safe way to test out drum
loops and keyboards, which I think are things that Blues Traveler
wants to get into.'' (Traveler was expected to reunite later this
fall to record a new album, but that's uncertain now.)
</P>
<P>
   Popper will carry the Blues Traveler legacy with him on his
tour, during which he'll add some Traveler songs to new solo
numbers that range from the wistful ``His Own Ideas'' and
organ-drenched ``How About Now'' (``Could I be in your movie
somehow?'' he asks), to the funky ``Love for Free'' (``Goodbye to
you, I'll never love anyone more''), and the John Lennon-like piano
ballad, ``Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Popper's voice is much sweeter than his anxious belting with
Blues Traveler would imply _ and his music is also helped by the
presence of Dave Matthews Band drummer Carter Beauford, who adds a
lighter touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something more subtle than Blues Traveler,'' said
Popper. ``Blues Traveler has a very heavy bottom and that's what
makes us have such power. We have a very huge sound if we want. But
on my record, I wanted a more natural sound, so working with Carter
Beauford helped. It was a gift from heaven to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to contrast the solo record further with Traveler's music,
Popper explained, ``I think Blues Traveler is like a samurai band
where a display of your acrobatics kind of fits. But here I made a
real effort at making a song-driven album where I was singing
better and not using the harmonica as much as I do with Blues
Traveler, though it ended up being on half the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Popper deny the pronounced John Lennon flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge Beatles fan, and yes, some of the music is
derivative of John Lennon,'' he said. ``I'm also really into the
singer/songwriters on the Lilith tour. They have this great dynamic
of singing quietly, and I love that. But because I have testicles,
I'm not able to hang out with them. Yet that's the kind of music
I'm really excited about exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the New York-based Popper is also just excited to
be alive. He had a serious health scare when he was on vacation in
Hawaii in late May _ a vacation he gave himself as a reward for
finishing the new solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been having chest pains for a long time,'' he said.
``And in Hawaii, I was in a hot tub messing around with somebody
and I got more chest pains. I had always had chest pains, but could
always snap out of it, but this time I had to really stop what I
was doing and I went, `Wow, that was pretty bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Popper then flew to Los Angeles, where he stopped to see a
doctor. ``The doctor said, `You weigh 400 pounds, you smoke, and
there is not much else that those chest pains can mean but a future
heart attack. You'll get these pains more and more and one of them
will end your life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Popper quit smoking, but confesses to having a much harder time
controlling his weight. ``Somewhere this year, I gained 50
pounds,'' he said. ``I actually weigh 410 pounds. I can't weigh
that anymore. It's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he put on the 50 extra pounds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was stressed from making the record and I was in a
relationship with somebody that was very new and I was confronting
things,'' he added. ``And food was like my drug. You can quit
smoking, but you can never quit food.''
</P>
<P>

A NON-HOLLYWOOD MONTREAL FEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Montreal Film Festival, or as they prefer to call
it, Le Festival des Films du Monde, has been unreeling for a week
now in this most laid-back of cosmopolitan cities in North America.
No festival is immune to glitz, nor wants to be. Montreal has been
enjoying its share, slipping into smiling momentary overdrive when
Denzel Washington showed up to kick off his new fall thriller,
``The Bone Collector,'' partly shot here. And this largely
French-speaking city has reveled in the presence of Gerard
Depardieu, making his directing debut in ``The Bridge,'' and
Bertrand Tavernier, who unveiled his latest, ``It All Starts
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the festival will dish out its awards from a jury
chaired by the great Swedish actress Bibi Andersson, graciously in
evidence here and there throughout the week. But the great thing
about the festival is its ability to remind a filmgoer that there's
lots more to the world of film than Hollywood, and what a mistake
it would be to allow Hollywood to define film. What Hollywood does,
it does technically well, but most of its output is shallow and
jaded. Not that I mean to make ``The Bone Collector'' pay for the
sins of what is called, with frightening aptness, the industry.
Falling somewhere between ``Seven'' and ``Kiss the Girls,'' it
tells a story of a paralyzed cop and forensics expert, portrayed by
Washington, who plays cat and mouse with a sadistic killer, using a
promising rookie cop, played by Angelina Jolie, as his eyes and
ears.
</P>
<P>
   The film will nudge Jolie onto the A-list. Most of the time she
makes us feel what her character feels when Washington sends her
into some pretty scary places to find some unpretty murder victims.
Washington rises to the challenge of playing an immobile hero as
``The Bone Collector'' darkly and expertly tests the limits of how
far a film can go in terms of serving up grisly killings in the
name of entertainment. But for better or worse _ and I've loved
them both ways _ Hollywood films are large manufactured objects
that these days seldom bother to manufacture illusion as they once
did, but simply pound you into acquiescing to their agendas. If
Detroit can, metaphorically speaking, still be thought of as the
car capital of the world, Hollywood is the Detroit of the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a salutary dip into a festival to yank you momentarily
out of the usual responses to what would be the Hollywood assembly
line (if Hollywood would at least assemble its films better).
Festivals offer a megadose of alternative takes on what filmmaking
can be. Take Patricia Rozema's ``Mansfield Park,'' a film that
continues Jane Austen's winning streak on film, although in
slightly different fashion than any of the previous entries. What
makes Austen's novels so resonant today is their quite modern fix
on love and money, and their heroines' way, when the chips are
down, of betting on love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' is centered by a superb Frances O'Connor as a
poor relation tenuously attached to a rich family whose moneyed but
tottering world is sustained by the slave trade. Rozema says she
knew she was taking a chance extrapolating from Austen's letters
and other material in departing from a straight transfer from page
to screen of Austen's third novel. But it's intelligent
chance-taking that pays off. Rozema takes a few structural gambles,
too. At first, I found myself frowning at what was initially an
episodic vignette style. But as we get to know the characters, her
takes on them grow longer and our involvement with them grows
deeper. Certainly Harold Pinter, a piece of surprise casting as the
wealthy patriarch, knows how to suggest darkness lapping around the
edges of anything, especially the world of Mansfield Park, a great
stone pile on its way from decorous to crumbling. Against it, the
emotional integrity of O'Connor's Fanny Price glows like Liberty's
torch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France was well represented by Tavernier and Depardieu in their
respective films. After sitting through Tavernier's magnificent
``It All Starts Today,'' you wonder why there aren't dozens of
films working the same territory. It began when Tavernier's
daughter, Tiffany Tavernier, brought her boyfriend, a poet and
schoolteacher named Dominique Sampiero, home to dinner. His
impassioned description of his workday led to the film about a
decent guy, a miner's son (Philippe Torreton), trying to do a
conscientious job as a kindergarden teacher in a depressed
industrial city, which of course means he spends as much time being
a social worker as a teacher. He also spends as much time fighting
self-serving bureaucrats and administrators as he does fighting the
effects of poverty and unemployment on the families of the kids he
not only teaches, but ushers as kindly and encouragingly as he can
into life.
</P>
<P>
   His positive reinforcment includes a lot of little hugs and
kisses and, except for the occasional tiff, a lot of understanding
from his equally warm and equally working-class wife (Maria
Pitaressi). In texture, the film is semi-documentary, with
astonishingly natural performances from real kids in a real
kindergarden. It resembles Tavernier's sympathetic look at
overloaded Parisian cops in his ``L.627.'' Throughout, we never
feel we're watching sentimentalized performances of the sort that
ruin so many well-intended American teacher movies, but a small
corner of a real world that's very French, but whose frustrations
are universal.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any big answers, the film seems to be saying,
except to keep throwing yourself at the job with all the good will
you can muster and know that you'll sometimes make a difference. In
short, it's not only an exhilarating film, but one that compells
you to rethink the nature of heroism and conclude, unlike our
Hollywood product with its travesties of heroism, that real heroism
lies in dedicated people trying to make other people's lives
better. In short, they're the kind of people movies that don't get
made. Which is all the more reason to seek this film out and allow
it to reinvigorate your own flagging sense of humanity.

OCEAN RANCHING WOULD PRODUCE FOOD, ENERGY, PLAN DEVELOPER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YARMOUTH, Mass._ The name conjures up images of cowboys riding
on dolphins, but Brian Braginton-Smith believes his proposal for an
ocean ranch three miles off the coast here may provide a radical
new model for producing food and energy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Braginton-Smith, director of the Conservation Consortium
Foundation, met with top Clinton administration officials during
Vice President Al Gore's visit to Boston Thursday to promote his
plan for building an ocean platform where ocean ranchers would
generate electricity from the wind and the waves, while raising
fish in giant pens.
</P>
<P>
   These environmentally-friendly ranchers would spend their days
tending 250-foot-tall wind towers surrounded by submerged pens full
of flounder or bass.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million proposal is still in its earliest stages of
development. It weds two fast-growing new industries, renewable
energy and aquaculture, whose facilities have faced mounting
objections from neighbors. Though people generally like the idea of
windmills and fish farms, they often don't like to live near
unsightly towers or the waste from the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Braginton-Smith, who for years has tried unsuccesfully to build
wind mills on Cape Cod, hopes to end the conflicts by taking both
the fish pens and the wind mills out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this, 20 years from now our kids are going to
be suffering from higher and higher costs for imported energy and
imported seafood,'' Braginton-Smith explained. ``I see it as a
criticial issue for the future sustainability of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The ocean ranch project, which would be the first in the United
States, faces formidable obstacles. The structures would have to be
tough enough to withstand ocean storms, making them more costly
initially than their mainland rivals. And the project must survive
years of review by local, state, and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation Consortium officials are already considering a site
for their first ranch structure, a mainland hatchery where fish
would grow until big enough to live in the pens.
</P>
<P>
   Outside observers say the group starts with key advantages,
including a background in wind power and aquaculture, as well as
interest from large companies in both industries that may be
willing to finance the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as important, the group's timing is good, pushing a plan
to increase the supply of fish in New England just as Gore was
announcing disaster relief for the region's decimated fishing
industry. The ranch could also help meet the Clinton Administration
goal of encouraging nonpolluting energy sources to replace coal and
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of its strongest potential benefits is that it integrates
a couple of ideas a lot of us have been talking about,'' said Rich
Delaney, director of the Urban Harbors Institute at the University
of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Administration officials have not endorsed the plan, but
several agencies are interested, including Army Corps of Engineers
officials who believe an ocean ranch could help shield coastal
areas from storms.
</P>
<P>
   Braginton-Smith met Thursday with James Baker, administrator of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administation, whose agency
supports offshore aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Rhodes, Baker's top advisor on aquaculture, said that
offshore fish farms similar to what Braginton-Smith proposes ``may
be a substantial part of the growth in the US over the years to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Braginton-Smith hopes for active support from
federal agencies, perhaps including financial help.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, wind power and fish farming have both grown
quickly. Hundreds of wind turbines are under construction in the
Great Plains region, from Minnesota to Wyoming, an area sometimes
called ``the Saudi Arabia of wind'' because the winds are so strong
and steady. Wind power is now the fastest-growing renewable energy
source and a key part of the US Department of Energy's strategy to
reduce dependence on fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Fish farming has emerged as one of the nation's major sources of
food over the past decade. Three of the five most popular seafoods
are now pen-reared, but the aquaculture facilities are almost
always located ininshore waters that are easy to reach and
sheltered from storm.
</P>
<P>
   Even though wind power and aquaculture are touted as potential
boons to the environment, they have run into tough opposition from
environmentalists and residents as the industries have moved into
the populous Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of eastern Maine complain that the salmon farms
there are like fish cities, polluting the coast with concentrated
feces and uneaten fish food, while raising the threat of disease or
other problems for wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   Braginton-Smith knows firsthand about opposition to wind power,
which centers on the appearance of propeller-topped towers, as well
as the danger they present to passing birds. The developers of the
$100 million CanalSide Commons project in Bourne recently dropped
Braginton-Smith's wind mills from the project after they came under
attack from environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated on land, Braginton-Smith now hopes to solve both
industries' problems at sea, where the fish waste would disperse
and there would be fewer people to see the wind turbines. So taken
with the idea was Braginton-Smith that he became a partner in a
Hyannis aquaculture firm that raises oysters to learn more about
fish farming.
</P>
<P>
   His ranch would consist of wind turbines surrounded by giant
fish pens, with monitoring equipment and fish feeders drawing power
from the turbines. The main savings from this arrangement comes
from using the same platform for both businesses and from the
relative ease of adding research facilities or turbines that
convert wave enery to electricity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has ever built such a ranch, but a Scottish
company called Wavegen is gearing up to build one after
constructing two offshore energy facilities. ``We have been doing a
huge amount of studies; then it's a question of going out and doing
it,'' said managing director Allan Thomson, who has come to
Yarmouth several times to consult with Braginton-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Conservation Consortium officials hope to build a
187-acre ranch off Yarmouth, featuring 90 fish pens and 10 wind
turbines that would generate enough electricity for 10,000 people.
They expect to start smaller, in order to convince regulators and
their prospective commercial partners that the project can work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question this is new technology, but we've got to
do it,'' Braginton-Smith said. ``Offshore is really the smartest
way to go.''

GOP SENATOR BULLIES BUSINESS LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of our politics traces periodic waves of corruption
that peak, break, then recede in the wake of reform dictated after
public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The last giant tsunami was the Watergate scandal. The 25th
anniversary of the Nixon resignation focused on the burglary and
subsequent coverup. But those two-bit antics were financed by a
pervasive money-raising operation that virtually extorted large
sums from corporate America. Give, or else, was the Nixon threat;
we'll regulate you, tax you, prosecute you, hound you with IRS,
FBI, and antitrust investigations. We'll tap your phones, open your
mail, knuckle your subordinates. We have the power and we will use
it, unless you fork over.
</P>
<P>
   It was the excesses and brainless zealotry of CREEP _ the
Committee to Re-elect the President _ that brought Nixon down.
There were no heroes in the corporate world to come forward and say
``enough!'' The executives whose names and companies were dragged
through the mud never had the guts to take on Nixon's thuggish
regime. They left the hollering to the antiwar marchers and the
civil rights people.
</P>
<P>
   We are again in the wave-building stage of a gathering storm of
political corruption involving soft money and extortion of business
executives via loopholes in campaign finance laws. Virtually every
surprising development in the politics of the last decade stems at
least in part from public revulsion at the system where incumbent
politicians thrive with impunity because they can raise money as
easily as if armed with a mask and a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot's 19 percent of the '92 vote drew upon
disillusionment. Jesse Ventura proved that an ex-wrestler can
become governor and cavort with barely clad ladies because he's
seen as more genuine than suit-and-tie pols who sell out for
campaign cash. The successes this year to date of Bill Bradley and
Senator John McCain in the presidential races is based in large
part on their stand for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The apathy and cynicism so pronounced among the young, the
turnout trends that will have fewer than 50 percent of those
eligible bothering to vote, and the emergence of a flock of
fundamentalist candidates decrying political immorality all are
nourished by the manure of the current system. But there are
unmistakeable forces eroding the defenses of the status quo
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   And a fresh one popped up last week with an unusual letter
addressed to a very establishment and nonpartisan group of
executives, the Committee for Economic Development, from Senator
Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. In what seems like a crude
threat out of the Nixon-era, McConnell, chief fund-raiser for GOP
senators, asked 10 trustees of CED to sever their ties with the
campaign finance reform coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished,'' he began, that a businessman of your
prominence would support an ``all-out campaign to eviscerate
private sector participation in politics.'' Professing ``great
concern,'' he falsely claimed the reforms would ``ban corporate
political activism and render the Republican Party powerless to
defend pro-business candidates from negative TV attacks by labor
unions, trial lawyers, and radical environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said that the CED roster includes firms like
GM, Xerox, Merck, and Sara Lee Corp., many of which ``have
significant issues pending before Congress.'' There's the implied
threat: Stop trying to deprive us of our boodle, or we'll make your
corporation's life miserable on Capital Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
McConnell is acutely aware that his party's control of both Senate
and House is predicated to no small degree on the GOP's traditional
advantage in heisting campaign contributions from business
executives, whereas labor unions traditionally give more to
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from voters and the media, slim majorities in
both House and Senate have voted tentatively to embrace substantial
curbs on soft money and some other reforms. But the Republican
leaders in both branches have used devious tricks and strategems to
prevent passage of the soft money ban. It may take further
outrages, beyond McConnell's threatening letter, to stir business
leaders to demand an end to such tacit corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wave of reform will crest when a Colombian cartel
operator gets caught handing over millions to a US politician, as
happened with the previous president of Colombia. Right now the GOP
leadership is huddling behind McConnell's braggadocio. It would
help immensely if more prominent business leaders signed on with
CED, saying they're fed up and they're not going to take it
anymore. There's only one way to deal with a bully, and that's to
beat the stuffing out of him, with whatever means at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Until more business leaders are convinced they'll get a fairer
deal from a clean and open system than from the backdoor baksheesh
at present, they're like the third grader robbed of his lunch money
every day: until you stand up to the bully, you can expect to have
your pocket picked with impunity.

A JOYLESS LABOR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A century ago, the union organizer Samuel Gompers said that
Labor Day should be the day when workers' rights and wrongs would
be discussed. He said it should be the day ``that the workers . . .
may not only lay down their tools of labor for a holiday, but upon
which they may touch shoulders in marching phalanx and feel the
stronger for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gompers went so far as to proclaim that Labor Day is different
than all the other holidays of the year. ``All other holidays are
in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles of
man's prowess over man, of strife and discord for greed and power,
of glories achieved by one nation over another,'' Gompers said.
Labor Day ``is devoted to no man, living or dead, to no sect, race
or nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gompers would probably find Labor Day today to be a ghoulish
perversion of his vision. The workers will indeed lay down their
tools, but hardly to march down a street. Nearly 35 million
Americans are expected to travel at least 100 miles from home this
weekend to the beaches and purple mountain majesties. The only
visible phalanxes will be the backups at turnpike tolls. The
primary touching of shoulders will be for the application of suntan
oil and jostling for bargains at outlet malls.
</P>
<P>
   And the happiest people on Labor Day are precisely those men and
women who represent the opposite of its original intent. These are
the people who shamelessly celebrate their prowess, greed, and
power. For them, it is not Labor Day. It is Gap Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Day, of course, is for the CEOs of America, the Chief
Excessive Opportunists who now make 419 times the salary of the
average worker. The gap has grown tenfold since 1980 when CEOs made
42 times the salary of the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   It is even more stark looking at this another way. In 1968, the
highest paid CEO was James Roche of General Motors at $795,000.
That was merely 142 times the pay of the average worker's salary of
$5,602. In 1998, the highest paid Excessive was Michael Eisner of
Disney. His compensation of $575.6 million was 25,070 times the
average worker pay of $22,976.
</P>
<P>
   On Gap Day, Chief Excessive Opportunists honor no worker, living
or dead. You can not honor any workers if there are none to honor.
Last year, the progressive Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and
the Boston-based United for a Fair Economy (UFE), found that the
CEOs of International Paper, Service Merchandise, Citicorp,
NationsBank, Whirlpool, First Bank System, Hasbro, American
Express, and V.F. Corp. each cut between 3,000 and 9,215 jobs in
1997. The CEOs earned raises averaging 20 percent. Their average
pay was $2.6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In its new report ``A Decade of Executive Excess,'' the IPS and
UFE report that the raises for Chief Excessive Opportunists between
1997 and 1998 was 36 percent _ to an average of $10.6 million _
while the average salary for a blue-collar worker rose only 2.7
percent _ to an average of $29,267. The gap is so bad that even
executive compensation consultant Frederic Cook wrote that ``Gaps
of this magnitude probably are not sustainable over the long haul
without serious employee unrest, conflict between investors and
workers, and governmental intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no global proof that CEO pay relates to profits. The
total CEO pay at Chrysler was 27 times that of the total CEO pay at
Volvo of Sweden, but the net income at Chrysler was only 2.5 times
that of Volvo's. The total CEO pay at Colgate-Palmolive was 22
times that of the total CEO pay of the Dutch and British firm
Unilever, but Unilever's net income of $5.6 billion was 6.6 times
more than the $849 million of Colgate-Palmolive.
</P>
<P>
   US pharmaceuticals are notorious for blaming high drug prices on
research costs. UFE's research makes you wonder if the real reason
is to pay the CEOs. The total CEO pay at Bristol-Myers Squibb was
$56 million in 1988. The total CEO pay at the British firm
GlaxoWellcome (in 1997) was $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending 20 times more on its CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb
had virtually the same net income as GlaxoWellcome. Warner-Lambert
spent 25 times more on its CEOs ($15.8 million) than the Swedish
firm Astra ($630,000), but Astra made more money.
</P>
<P>
   With Wall Street surging, the gap has not yet sparked a national
discussion Gompers would expect. But there are rumblings. A few
CEOs have turned down raises either voluntarily or through
pressure. Some companies, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, have
granted universal stock options that have helped employees buy
homes and pay for college. Shareholder resolutions by UFE to shrink
the gap at firms such as BankBoston and General Electric have
forced some firms to admit there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Financier J.P. Morgan once said that CEOs should never make more
than 20 times what an average employee makes. With Chief Excessive
Opportunists currently making 419 times more, we may never return
to yesteryear's version of noblesse oblige. But we can return to an
America far more fair. Peter McGuire, a co-founder of the American
Federation of Labor, said that Labor Day is for those ``who from
rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold.''
Gap Day, unfortunately, celebrates those who rudely have carved out
all the grandeur for themselves.

PONDERING A DOG'S LIFE AND AFTERLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know how manipulative these drug companies are. The current
issue of Prevention magazine has a glossy, six-page advertising
insert from Pfizer, featuring a picture of a beloved, elderly
family member who has lost his memory. A plaintive headline above
the lonely visage reads: ``It's hard to say `welcome home' when I
can't remember your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph is of a basset hound.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is hyping a drug called Anipryl that purports to counter
canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome, or dog Alzheimer's. Pfizer
is advocating a whole program of senior care for dogs over 7 years
old (roughly my age, in dog years) to ``keep the senior years
golden'' and ``put the wag back in your dog's tail.''
</P>
<P>
   When our family cat Einstein finally returns from his protracted
summer vacation next week (don't ask), he will be surprised to see
how Bill Clinton's America has gone to the dogs. The New York Times
recently reported on the burgeoning field of ``animal law,'' which
sends men and women of the bar rushing into court to file suits on
behalf of chimpanzees and dolphins. No cats mentioned so far. Dogs
seem to be the perpetrators in a pet sheep-killing case being tried
here by Steven Wise. Wise's clients were very attached to their
pets, the lawyer told the Times. ``I am talking about people who
let the sheep in the house and baked them muffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Will those bad dogs go to heaven? Dog Fancy magazine devotes its
entire September issue to questions of the canine afterlife. The
magazine interviewed various divines, including a Roman Catholic
priest who ventured that heaven is primarily for people, though
dogs may make it in on our coattails. A rabbi asserted that ``every
animal based on how it lives in this world will reap its reward,
its divine bliss in the world to come.''
</P>
<P>
   A British minister and Mary Buddemeyer-Porter, author of ``Will
I See Fido in Heaven?,'' agreed that dogs were incapable of making
moral choices, though Buddemeyer-Porter thought their moral
blinders would get them into heaven: ``It doesn't make any
difference what dogs do because they are innocent of any sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual life of dogs also looms large in the summer issue
of Tricycle, the glossy magazine for rich North American Buddhists.
(The less fortunate Buddhists are all in Southeast Asia.)
Ruminating on his beloved black Lab, Sarah Lawrence College
professor T. Griffith Foulk poses the ancient question: Does a dog
have Buddha-nature?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the eighth century Ch'an master Chao-chou has
already answered this question, in three separate dialogues. Here
is the most relevant one: ``A monk asked master Chao-chou: `Does a
dog also have Buddha-nature or not?' The master said: `It does
not.' ''

poet Lucy Larcom, the review's first issue has poetry, photography,
fiction, and nonfiction prose. Editor Susan Oleksiw is a widely
published mystery writer who also holds a PhD in Sanskrit.
Publisher Ann Perott is a writer and former social worker who was
once the Commonwealth's director of programs for the disabled. For

. . After reading my recent swoon on John McPhee's profile of Bill
Bradley, Michael O'Daniel wrote to inform me that another
basketball classic is back in print: Oscar Robertson's training
manual, ``Play Better Basketball.'' Robertson and O'Daniel cowrote
and self-published the book in 1964, after Robertson's MVP year
with the Cincinnati Royals. It sold 100,000 copies and has just
been updated and reissued under a new name, ``The Art of
Basketball.'' You can get a copy at 888-327-1401 or check out the
Web site www.thebigo.com. Robertson is campaigning for Bradley, by
the way . . . A reader turned me on to Patricia Holt's weekly book
industry newsletter, Holt Uncensored, available for free at
www.nciba.com/patholt.html. Holt was the longtime book editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle, and her newsletter has become a
sounding board for people who equate chain bookstores with the
Black Death. I'm not one of those people, but I enjoy the
newsletter nonetheless.

FOR EX-CLOWN RON JENKINS, THE PLAY'S THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just inside the entryway to Ron Jenkins's home, on the other
side of the two wagon wheels, a pair of oversize umbrellas, a
Balinese dragon mask, a small tin circus wagon, and a giant
Peruvian mortar and pestle, there's a double-truck Life magazine
photograph featuring hundreds of clowns. On the left, down a half
dozen rows or so from the top there's a clown without makeup,
dressed in a colorful costume inspired by Uncle Sam. It's Jenkins.
The same person who translated Dario Fo's ``We Won't Pay! We Won't
Pay,'' which opens the American Repertory Theatre's season next
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a former premed student with a Harvard PhD end up as
a proud graduate of the Barnum &AMP; Bailey and Ringling Bros. Clown
College?
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, wearing a forest green shirt and khakis, smiles _
something he does a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impulse was the same,'' says Jenkins, who just assumed
several duties at Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Conn.,
including those of artistic director of the theater department. ``I
always wanted to make children happy, so I entered the premed
program at New York University with the idea of becoming a child
psychiatrist. I was working with autistic and schizophrenic
children at Bellevue (Hospital). But I didn't like the idea that
many of the children were just being drugged and put aside. I was
working with these children and I realized I was getting through to
some of them by making them laugh. Connecting. Making a bit of
progress. But I knew that the medical angle wasn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins decided, in the middle of an anatomy class, that he'd
quit pre-med and audition for the Clown College _ a move that must
have filled his parents with great joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they weren't pleased,'' says Jenkins, his eyes
rolling toward the ceiling on the hot air of his understatement.
``But after things worked out they were fine with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After touring with the circus in the '70s, Jenkins turned his
attention to the challenging pursuit of international clowning. He
performed and studied with comedy troupes in Bali, Japan, South
Africa, and Europe. In his fine book on comedy, ``Subversive
Laughter: The Liberating Power of Comedy,'' Jenkins creates a
persuasive argument that comedy among the poor and politically
oppressed is a way of maintaining dignity in the face of daily
humiliations. It's a smart, intellectual tome that owes as much to
Chaplin's Little Tramp as it does to Jenkins's Harvard education.
</P>
<P>
   It also echoes Jenkins's clown persona. In the circus, he was
the clown bullied by the others _ the baggy-pants guy who really
wants the prize but never gets it.
</P>
<P>
   In his life, things were different. When Jenkins talks about his
artistic relationship with Dario Fo, it's as if a calliope goes off
in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be with Dario Fo,'' says Jenkins. ``I sent
him a letter on Harvard letterhead stationery explaining my
interest. Fo never responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Jenkins caught up to Fo at one of his performances
in Turin in 1985 and introduced himself as the fellow who wrote the
Harvard letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant nothing to him,'' says Jenkins. ``But when I told
him I went to the Clown College he was very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins joined Fo's troupe and was soon being introduced as his
translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know Italian,'' says Jenkins. ``I still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That's funny _ a translator who isn't literate in the language
he's translating.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says that a sense of rhythm and Fo's use of language is
more important than literal translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what Fo does is invent language,'' he says. ``You need
to leave room for that in the translation. That also allows the
actors to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   During two previous open readings, one at the Agassiz Theater
last September with actors Marisa Tomei, Will LeBow, and Thomas
Derrah, Jenkins listened very carefully to both the performers and
the audience's reaction, and used the information in his
translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors were terrific . . . very helpful,'' says Jenkins.
``You don't realize what a great comic Marisa is until you see the
intelligence in her theatrical performance _ and her comments were
right on the mark. But the readings are important because Fo uses
the audience in each performance. Theater in flux. He sets up a
dialogue with the audience even though some of his work is in
monologue. That's a paradox. But it's paradox that intrigues Fo.''
</P>
<P>
   During several Fo performances Jenkins was the onstage English
translator and Fo made him part of the show, sometimes ridiculing
him, but all in an attempt to win over the audience. At a Kennedy
Center performance, Jenkins's grandmother, Assunta Petaccio, a
devout Roman Catholic who resented Fo's clerical satires, arrived
late in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He announced to the audience that my grandmother had arrived,
and she was like the queen of the Kennedy Center for that night,''
says Jenkins. ``Even though she's a committed Catholic, she
understood that Fo wasn't making fun of the religion, he was
satirizing the human misuses of the religion. The pomposity. And
that's what she understood _ that Dario's comedy comes from the
peasants. A comedy that still sustains them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is on a roll. He goes to one of his many
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and retrieves a guide that accompanied
an exhibit of the art of two famous Italian clown artists _ Fo and
Fellini. Inside there's a colorful painting of a robust woman who
seems to be going in different directions simultaneously. It's Fo's
pictorial interpretation of ``We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' says Jenkins. ``She's going backwards and
forwards. She can't control herself. It's funny. Whimsical.
Serious. The body condradicts itself. It's Fo.''
</P>
<P>
   Without disparaging the previous American translation of ``We
Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!'' by Ron Davis and the San Francisco Mime
Troupe, Jenkins charges that Davis's narrow focus on the political
angle of the play diminished the drama's richness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It eliminated the paradoxes,'' says Jenkins. ``They were after
the political element.'' Fo was denied a visa by the US State
Department in 1980 because he was a member of Soccorso Rosso, an
organization involved in aid to prisoners in Italy. He was
considered a subversive _ a subversive clown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does fight for political causes,'' says Jenkins. ``And
that's very important, but he's interested in so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo's artistry was limited to a small cadre of fans and
supporters until 1997, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Literature. ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, Fo opens our
eyes to abuses and injustices in society, and also to the wider
historical perspective in which they can be placed,'' wrote the
Swedish Academy. The choice of Fo created a controversy that sent
commentators and newscasters rushing to identify the Italian clown.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins appeared on a variety of television shows and
Christopher Lydon's radio program, ``The Connection,'' to defend
the selection. ``Dario was under attack for being what he was _ as
if the Nobel Prize for literature couldn't include a clown. I was
put on the defensive. I explained that the selection of Dario Fo
expanded the definition of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Fo was surprised that it wasn't a faux Nobel Prize. At first, he
thought it was a joke. It even sounded like one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dio e un giullare,'' said Fo, when told of the award. Jenkins
translates _ ``God is a clown.'' Then he smiles, knowing full well
that he got it right.

U.S. WORKERS LAG WORLD IN VACATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day is almost here, and it's time to do a little
comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the United States may have it good _ we get paid well
enough to own multiple televisions and telephones, and it's getting
increasingly rare to find a home without a computer. But other
nations have it over the United States in a big way when it comes
to measuring a valuable commodity _ vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   The typical U.S. worker gets a measly, paltry, minuscule 2.5
weeks of paid vacation. Workers in most of Europe receive at least
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``German for vacation is `July,''' said Tony Broomhead, senior
international consultant for Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Chicago.
``And French for vacation is `August.'''
</P>
<P>
   Broomhead, who grew up in Bristol, England, said the standard
holiday in England is four weeks: two weeks in the summer, a week
at Christmas and a week at Easter.
</P>
<P>
   And that's for folks who just started on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a day-a-month thing like in the United States,'' said
Broomhead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GERMANS GET A VACATION BONUS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's even better in Germany, where the standard paid vacation is
six weeks for someone with 10 years of service. And _ to make it
even better _ German employers typically give their employees an
extra ``vacation bonus'' equal to about three weeks of pay.
</P>
<P>
   That three-week vacation bonus also is popular in Belgium, said
Broomhead. The rationale is that relaxing workers have more time on
their hands to spend money, so employers customarily give workers
the extra pay.
</P>
<P>
   Those generous time-off policies sometimes come as a surprise to
U.S. companies that buy German firms or open an office in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know it's long but they just didn't know how long _ or
how much (it will cost),'' said Broomhead, who provides comparison
data to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Most European nations as well as Japan, New Zealand and
Australia have federal laws that require employers to give three to
five weeks of leave, said John Schmitt, labor economist for the
liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a job at McDonald's in Spain, you get 30 days of
paid vacation,'' Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such statutory requirement in the United States,
he said. And it probably won't happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   There was such a fight just to give employees 12 weeks off _
unpaid, mind you _ to care for their newborns, sick children or
parents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers have worried the U.S. unemployment rate will rise
if paid vacation is mandated here.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployment rates in vacation-rich nations are actually
lower than the United States, Schmitt said. Norway and the
Netherlands, for example, require 20 days of paid vacation but
their unemployment rates in 1998 were 3.3 and 4 percent,
respectively. The comparable jobless rate for the United States was
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUROPEAN MINDSET IS DIFFERENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is also a different mindset in Europe about vacations,
said Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States many people don't use their time off,
opting to cash it in when they change jobs or retire.
</P>
<P>
   There's a similar hard-working mindset in Japan where only 55
percent of the typical four weeks of vacation time is actually
used, Broomhead said. Workers worry that if they take off, the
extra work will burden someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation time can be a touchy issue for U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to gripe about it,'' said Marty Kunz,
director of human resources for Mustang Engineering in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas engineering company has an across-the-board
vacation policy of two weeks a year. Kunz, who recently surveyed
other firms' vacation policies, knows that's less than the norm but
the turnover rate is less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People aren't leaving because of the low number of days off,
said Kunz, speculating the company's retirement plan (employees
receive company stock worth 25 percent of their salary each year
into their retirement accounts) and a steady diet of fun events
(like the deep sea fishing trips the company sponsors).
</P>
<P>
   To add an extra week (to bring Mustang in line with what other
companies give their employees with five years of service) would
cost nearly a million dollars, Kunz said.
</P>
<P>
   And once it's given, it's hard to take back in case of another
significant downturn.

ADDING USB PORT TO AN OLDER COMPUTER IS EASY, EXCEPT IF YOU HAVE
WINDOWS 95 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My computer is a little old, not too bad. It doesn't have USB
ports, and I want to add them. I understand I need a newer version
of Window 95 to use USB ports, too. How would I go about doing
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can buy a card that fits in a PCI slot inside your
computer that will give it a pair of USB, or Universal Serial Bus,
ports. Several companies make them, including Entrega, Global
Paragon and Interex.
</P>
<P>
   Installing it is simple. Open the case, find a free PCI slot,
pop it in, close the case and fire your PC up. Windows will
recognize the card and may or may not ask for drivers. The cards
will come with installation instructions to help you along.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system question, though, is another matter. You're
right that not all versions of Windows 95 support USB. The
technology is relatively new, and was first added to the operating
system in 1997 with the OSR2 version of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   That version was only available on new PCs, or with some hard
drives. You could not buy it off the shelf, and Microsoft did not
make the USB component available as an upgrade. You can tell if
your computer has Windows 95 OSR2 by right-clicking on My Computer
and choosing Properties. OSR2 has either a B or a C next to the
version number.
</P>
<P>
   If you see an A, or no letter at all, you're out of luck for
USB.
</P>
<P>
   However, as users of Windows 95 OSR2 will tell you, the USB
support it has is less than perfect. I would highly recommend that
you upgrade to Windows 98 Second Edition if you want to use USB
devices. USB support in the original Windows 98 was much better,
and in Second Edition it seems to be rock-solid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see this acronym all the time in the computer world: OEM.
What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. As you've no
doubt figured out by now, the computer industry has a difficult
time with simple English usage. Rather than simply saying ``a
company that makes stuff,'' the industry has to come up with a
formal-sounding acronym.
</P>
<P>
   An OEM is a company that uses components from other companies to
build and sell a finished product. Compaq Computer Corp. is an OEM
_ it buys hard drives, modems, microprocessors, memory chips,
software and other parts from different vendors, then assembles
them into its own product.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also is an OEM, as it does the same thing. But Sony also
sells to other OEMs _ floppy disks and CD-ROMs, for example _ so
there are times when it is a supplier.
</P>
<P>
   You'll sometimes hear someone refer to the ``OEM version'' of
Windows 98. That simply means that Windows was installed on a
computer by the manufacturer, as opposed to being added later by a
user as an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, a great resource for learning the meanings of
computer acronyms and other technology terms is Whatis, at
www.whatis.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in buying a new mouse. I've seen mice that
plug into serial, PS/2 and USB ports. What's the advantage of one
over the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless you have a very old computer that does not have either
a PS/2 or a USB port, there's no benefit at all in getting a serial
mouse. If you have a PS/2 port _ the round connector into which
most mice and keyboards attach _ but no USB port, you should
definitely get the PS/2 model.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a PS/2 port and a USB port, which you'd get depends
on how you use your computer. Most regular users are happily served
by a PS/2 mouse. But if you play fast-action games and use the
mouse, you'll want to consider a USB mouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the USB port talks to the computer at a faster
rate, which in a fast game results in better responsiveness.

ZIPPY ONLINE ACCESS HAS ITS DRAWBACKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Few developments in personal computing have been as
highly anticipated as the arrival of faster Internet access to the
home. That's because no matter how zippy your online connection may
be, it's never zippy enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the promise of fast data pipes into residences
finally has started to be fulfilled. Cable TV companies have begun
mass rollouts of cable-modem service, while the phone companies
have begun offering digital phone lines in the form of ADSL, or
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these types of connections offer online speeds that are
dramatically faster than even the fastest traditional modem.
However, both have drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, I've been able to experience the joy _
and frustration _ of cable modem service at home. I've also tested
ADSL on a PC at work, and while I haven't lived as closely with it
as I have the cable service, I have been able to develop some
impressions of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPEED IS TRULY IMPRESSIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After living with high-speed or broadband access, I can say that
the speed is incredible and it will change the way you think about
and use the Internet. That is, when it works. When it doesn't work,
it will drive you crazy.
</P>
<P>
   I signed up with Time Warner Communications' RoadRunner at home,
which delivers Internet access via the same wire that transmits
cable television signals. I tried out a version of Southwestern
Bell's FasTrak ADSL, without e-mail or news groups, at work.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner is one price, about $40 a month, for both the
connection and the Internet access for those who already have a
cable TV connection. If you don't have cable TV, but want
RoadRunner, you'll pay $75 a month. Time Warner doesn't share its
network with other Internet providers, so RoadRunner is the only
service available.
</P>
<P>
   The price of FasTrak DSL varies, depending on the speed you
choose and whether you sign a contract. Basic service is about $40
for 128 kilobit uploads and 384 kilobit downloads, which is what
most consumers will want, and with a one-year contract. Prices can
go as high as $150 a month for six-megabit download service and no
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Those prices, however, don't include an Internet provider _ just
the digital phone connection. Southwestern Bell Internet Services
will charge an extra $10 for Net access when bundled with ADSL
service. Other Internet providers have similar deals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT METHODS AND PROBLEMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two services are different in their approaches to boosting
bandwidth, and one is distinctly faster than the other.
</P>
<P>
   Cable Internet access uses a shared network, usually based on
neighborhoods. Everyone in a neighborhood connects to a central
server. These servers then funnel their traffic to one or more of
the cable company's servers, which then funnel the traffic out to
the Internet. When a lot of people subscribe to cable-modem service
in one area, the shared data ``pipes'' can clog and slow down if
the system isn't designed to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL, however, is a direct, phone-line-based connection between
you and your Internet provider. That means your connection speed is
independent of how many people in your area sign up, with one
exception. If a provider signs up too many ADSL customers and
doesn't upgrade hardware to match demand, a slowdown can occur.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, not everyone can get ADSL. If you're too far from
your area's central office _ about 17,000 feet, or approximately 3
miles _ the digital signal is too weak. Some neighborhood phone
systems also have devices on them designed to boost voice quality,
or increase the number of lines available in a given area. These
devices, unfortunately, aren't ADSL-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner has its location problems, too. Not all areas in
Houston are capable of supporting it. The original Time Warner
territory _ generally the western part of town _ has the
capability, except for a few pockets. The TCI area, which Time
Warner now manages, won't start getting it until sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In general, I found RoadRunner significantly faster than ADSL,
but less reliable. And while I didn't get the chance to try out
FasTrak's customer service, I discovered that RoadRunner leaves a
lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two weeks I used RoadRunner, it was marvelous.
There were occasional glitches, such as brief mail and Usenet news
server outages and an occasional sluggishness, which later turned
out to be a problem with RoadRunner's backbone provider.
</P>
<P>
   When it was working well, I frequently saw connection speeds
close to two megabits a second, though the average seemed to be in
the 500 to 800 kilobit range. One site designed to test bandwidth
told me I was getting eight megabits!
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the ADSL connection was rock-solid at about 300 to
500 kilobits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the speed of either depends on general Internet
congestion and the capabilities of the server at the far end of the
connection. You can't get Web pages at rabbit speeds if the server
on which they reside is tortoise-like.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks into my RoadRunner usage, I began to see a
nearly rhythmic lag, in which connection speeds would drop to
nothing before resuming their normal speeds. It caused Web pages to
hang, file downloads to slow to a crawl and made online games
virtually unplayable. It's not much fun in Quake III Arena when you
suddenly freeze in your tracks and become an easy target for a
rocket-launcher-toting opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple complaints sent to RoadRunner's e-mail tech support
address went unanswered, as did a posting I made to the service's
internal news group. There wasn't even an auto-reply acknowledging
receipt, a lesson out of Customer Service 101. I did, however, get
to use a nifty feature that lets you do a one-on-one chat with a
technician.
</P>
<P>
   I think I even was able to determine which machine in
RoadRunner's network was causing the problem, and passed that info
along to tech support personnel. However, at this writing, the lag
continues _ and may even be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem that ADSL gave me was occasional delays in
finding Web sites before connecting to them. It would pause
sometimes as long as 10 or 15 seconds before finally finding a
site. This glitch was intermittent and rare.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner's local general manager, Cleon Smith, said the
company plans to improve customer service, as well as expand the
network capacity in Houston over the next three weeks. However, it
will be doing so while adding customers to a system that obviously
has bugs to work out.
</P>
<P>
   If I could get ADSL at home, I'd probably take that option over
cable, trading the greater speed for reliability. Unfortunately,
I'm too far from my area's central office. I'll just have to hope
that RoadRunner can get its act together _ and soon.

 &HT;    NORTH KOREAN MEDIA PRAISE THEIR LEADER, WHILE COUNTRYMEN STARVE
 &HT;    EDs: the Internet address for the Korean Central News Agency is
www.kcna.co.jb/
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Thousands have starved to death in his country and
thousands more have tried desperately to escape, but this week
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is being lavished with praise at
home for a great first year in power.
</P>
<P>
   While North Koreans have been reduced to dining on concoctions
of roots and leaves, the ``sun of the 21st Century'' is being
thanked in state-run media for his ``paternal love for the people''
and for guiding his countrymen to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il officially assumed the mantle of power last Sept. 5,
but had been running the poverty-stricken, Stalinist nation since
his father, North Korean President Kim Il Sung, died five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Central News Agency, which publishes many of its
dispatches on an English-language web site, pointed to Kim's
``on-the-spot guidance'' as a primary example of how Kim actually
``works heart and soul'' on behalf of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He visited Sinhung restaurant in Hamhung and informally took
an ordinary noodle, saying that he would like to taste noodle which
is winning popularity among people,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He noted with great satisfaction that strips of noodle are
viscous, and noodle broth is unique and noodle is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he urged the restaurant's employees to improve the noodle
even further and better serve people in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The normally reclusive Kim apparently has been doing a lot of
``on-the-spot guidance'' in recent months, with other news accounts
describing his tours of a fishery and of a chicken farm that was
pronounced ``reminiscent of an advanced science research center.''
</P>
<P>
   The country keeps such detailed track of Kim's rare appearances
that the news agency recently cited the popularity of ``June 2
camps'' for young people, which harken back to the June 2nd in 1956
when Kim began camping during his middle school days.
</P>
<P>
   It also noted last month the 20th anniversary of the ``on-site
guidance'' he supplied in a 1979 visit to the international
friendship exhibition, a monument displaying gifts world leaders
have given to his father and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Better to focus on camps and monuments than on food in North
Korea these days, considering the reports that relief agencies
permitted in the country have been making on conditions there.
</P>
<P>
   One South Korean charity group recently estimated that 3.5
million people have died of starvation in North Korea in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, finished a four-day trip to North
Korea early this week, and said the food situation seemed to be
improving.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was visiting in late summer, when more food is
available than any other time of year.
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of winter desperate North Koreans have tried to
flee their country, with tens of thousands sneaking across the
difficult border into China's northeastern provinces where they
have been meeting an increasingly hostile reception.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Kim officially is the general secretary of the
Workers' Party and the chairman of the National Defense Commission.
When he took the latter title a year ago and was acknowledged
publicly as the head of state, the title of ``president'' was
retired _ Kim's late father was bestowed with the title of
``eternal president.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, North Korea has recognized that the son of the
founder of the nation has come into his own. The government has
just published an English translation of the younger Kim's
political philosophy, entitled ``Kim Jong Il, the Lodestar of the
21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing it, the news agency proclaimed: ``Now, in name and
reality, the era of Kim Jong Il has begun.''

Fed will raise rates again in October. The economy added 124,000
jobs, compared to a forecast of 220,000, as the the unemployment
rate fell to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent in July _ tying a 29-year
low. Workers' average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent _ lower than
analysts' forecasts of a 0.3 percent gain _ to $13.30 in August
following a revised increase of 0.3 percent during July. By Slyvia

   MALAYSIA-ECON (Kuala Lumpur) _ Unlike Indonesia, Thailand, or
South Korea, Malaysia chose to fend off the Asian economic crisis
by shutting its doors and boarding up its windows. Risking the
wrath of foreign investors and free-market political leaders in the
West, it imposed strict controls on its capital markets. Now, a
year later, with a major part of the controls lifted, economists,
fund managers, business people and even officials at the
International Monetary Fund concede that Malaysia appears to have
won a risky gamble. By Mark Landler.

   SCHOLARLY-TOOLS (Undated) _ If footnotes, quotations and

``Yippee! Good riddance to all that pompous wisdom and tiny

hold on. Three scholars from three different fields have
independently given these tools of scholarly oppression a

   WEIMAR-AVANT-GARDE (Undated) _ Anointed as this year's
``cultural capital'' by the European Union, the East German town of
Weimar is basking not only in the accomplishments of such estimable
sons as Goethe, Schiller and Bach, but also in the avant garde of
``the golden 20's'': Walter Gropius's Bauhaus; the paintings of
Oskar Kokoschka and Max Beckmann and the drawings of George Grosz;
the collaborations of Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht and the
theatrical excitement generated by Erwin Piscator and Max
Reinhardt. But if Weimar wants to live up to the artistic
reputation of that decade's cultural elite, it may also have to
live down their politics: While the young and frail German Republic
struggled to find a road between the former autocracy and a looming
fascism, many of Germany's foremost artists and intellectuals
displayed indifference or outright antipathy to the embattled
democrats. A critic's notebook by Walter Goodman.

reports that she no longer trusts the FBI or its director, Louis
Freeh, because of recent revelations about the bureau's use of tear
gas during the 1993 Branch Davidian siege. She says her decision to
appoint an outsider to investigate the FBI's handling of the case

   KOREA-KIM _ BEIJING _ Thousands have starved to death in his
country and thousands more tried desperately to escape, but this
week North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il is being lavished with praise
at home for a great first year in power. While North Koreans have
been reduced to dining on concoctions of roots and leaves, the
``sun of the 21st century'' is being thanked in state-run media for
his ``paternal love for the people'' and for guiding his countrymen

   CHINA-ANNIVERSARY-$ADV04 _ BEIJING _ Chairman Mao Zedong surely

paean to the 50th anniversary of China's Communist revolution. It
is one of scores of projects, including a new subway line and
airport terminal, under construction round the clock to be finished
in time for the Oct. 1 festivities. But among the more than $13
billion in capital improvements, the Wangfujing Street renovation
most clearly demonstrates how far the New China has altered its
course in five decades. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service) WITH

   RUSSIA-CAUCASUS _ TBILISI, Georgia _ It may seem like a small
war. But looks are deceiving. Russia's latest military action in
its southern republic of Dagestan has far-reaching implications for
the stability of the former superpower and the well-being of the
oil-rich Caspian Sea region. Russia declared victory two weeks ago
when Russian forces managed to re-take several villages and push
many of the guerrillas out of Dagestan, back across the border into
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. But the Chechen warlords, now
back in Chechnya, vow they will regroup and return to challenge
Russian forces in Dagestan. It was a clear sign that Russia may
have won some battles, but it has not won the war. (Cox News

Travel down peaceful-sounding Orchard Lane, take Loop 340, hit

wavy metal gates, turn left onto Double EE Ranch Road and then take
a quick right into the Branch Davidian property. You see that six

versity.com officials say the service isn't aimed at helping
students skip class but rather to augument their studies. (Dart,

   VIRGINMARY-DISPUTE _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Nancy Fowler says she never
paid attention to the secular responsibilities of crowd control and
book publishing, by-products of the enormous religious gatherings
she held for nine years at her Conyers estate. She says she is just
now realizing that colleagues she once trusted are using her
spiritual work to make money. At the center of her accusations is
another seer, a Bolivian woman who claims to see visions of the
Virgin Mary in the same way Fowler did for nine years. In an
interview, she speaks for the first time about a federal court case
stemming from a dispute between her and a group set up to organize
massive gatherings held for eight years at her Conyers farm. Until
the dispute is resolved, neither Fowler nor her former allies is
allowed publish a book of divine messages, ``Be Children of God.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, my favorite conversation with taxi
drivers in the nation's capital involved mutual clucking about the
dangers to life and limb of endless jagged potholes and gaping
roadway craters the city never bothered to fix.
</P>
<P>
   But now Washington has a fine new mayor, Anthony Williams, who
is digging up the streets and pouring fresh asphalt in every
direction. Although tempting, it doesn't seem fair to complain
about the traffic jams this construction produces, since we are so
much in need of the results.
</P>
<P>
   So the taxi drivers and I have turned to a new problem that
makes us jointly cranky. We are terrified of drivers who have one
hand on the wheel and the other hand on a cell phone, talking
animatedly to some distant someone rather than paying attention to
some nearby someone in another car that's rapidly approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting into a cell phone while inching along in the summer
traffic congestion crawling toward the beach may not pose a great
danger to others. It beats pounding the windshield out of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   But we are talking here about people, usually alone in the car,
who are speeding along on busy superhighways or driving through
crowded city streets. Distracted by their conversations, they
cannot possibly be paying adequate attention to what they are doing
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   I watched a young blonde in a convertible the other day tooling
down a narrow street in the Georgetown section of Washington,
gabbing away into her phone, oblivious to cursing drivers and
several near side-swipes. If she reached her destination intact, it
was a roadway miracle. She did not seem drunk, but she was
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   So three cheers for Brooklyn, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, where
officials began last week to ticket drivers for using hand-held
cell phones while whizzing along. At a population of 11,000, this
is a small town with big common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The law making the practice of cell-phone chatting while driving
illegal had been approved last March and finally began biting. The
offense is a misdemeanor, with fines at a measly $3 for the first
time, increasing to $100 for repeated infractions.
</P>
<P>
   No jail time. More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of driving while distracted are real. A New England
Journal of Medicine study in 1997, two years and several million
fewer cell phones ago, found that talking on a phone while driving
quadrupled the risk of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooklyn, Ohio, may be the first U.S. city to outlaw such
behavior. This year 15 legislatures considered similar state-wide
motorist restrictions, but none has yet been approved. Phone
companies and business groups that increasingly rely on cell-phone
communications lobby against such bills although the measures would
forbid only their use by drivers while cars are in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, forbidding their use while walking on the street,
sitting in an airplane or on a train, relaxing in a hotel lobby or
any other public location would be welcome as well. It may not be
dangerous, but overhearing some stranger's phone conversation while
you are going about your own business is certainly irritating. Some
fancy restaurants are already banning the use of cell phones while
dining.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 76 million Americans now subscribe to wireless
phone service, and 80 million users are predicted by next year.
Surveys indicate that 85 percent of them are used in cars. The
National Safety Council reports that drivers using cellular phones
in their cars run a 34 percent higher risk of having a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Driver-used cellular phones were a factor in 57 fatal accidents
in 1997, according to federal figures. The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration plans a major study of the issue later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry points out that such phones can save lives because
drivers are able to report accidents on the road. True enough. But
most calls are not made to alert the police. They are made to
conduct conversations with business associates, buddies, children,
lovers and tennis partners.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign countries are way ahead of us on all this. Germany,
Italy, Brazil, Portugal and Chile have imposed cell-phone bans or
restrictions on all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, guys, let's get with it. We accepted the inconvenience
of seat belts in cars and helmets for bike riders because it made
everyone safer. We should clamp down on careless car-phone use too.

been reduced to dining on concoctions of roots and leaves, the

airport terminal, under construction round the clock to be finished
in time for the Oct. 1 festivities. But among the more than $13

its southern republic of Dagestan has far-reaching implications for

oil-rich Caspian Sea region. Russia declared victory two weeks ago
when Russian forces managed to re-take several villages and push
many of the guerrillas out of Dagestan, back across the border into
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. But the Chechen warlords, now
back in Chechnya, vow they will regroup and return to challenge
Russian forces in Dagestan. It was a clear sign that Russia may
have won some battles, but it has not won the war. (Cox News

 &HT;    Elton's passion for photography will come into focus in High
Museum exhibit
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elton John has quietly made Atlanta his part-time home
since 1990, but his visibility always seems to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   There's his AIDS foundation and the premiere of his rock musical
``Aida'' at the Alliance Theatre last fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, he will be the opening act for the new Philips
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the British-born rock musician will be the millennial act
for the High Museum of Art, which will mount ``Chorus of Light:
Photographs From the Sir Elton John Collection'' Nov. 4, 2000,
through Jan. 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will be the only venue for this display of 200 of his
2,000 photos, many of which hang in his Peachtree Road penthouse
here but are also found in his homes in England and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a revelation for people to see how serious a
collection this is,'' says High director Ned Rifkin, who is chief
curator of the show. ``Everywhere he goes, and he goes everywhere,
he looks at photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, dealer Jane Jackson, who has served as consultant to
John and many other serious collectors in this city, says that
``Elton's collection is easily the biggest and the best in Atlanta.
In terms of quantity and quality, probably no one in the world has
that depth.''
</P>
<P>
   John was unavailable for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The show's selection is intended to give a sense of the British
rocker's photographic interests, which range from fashion shots by
Horst to portraits by Robert Mapplethorpe, from Man Ray's
experimentations to the documentary approach of Robert Frank.
Irving Penn and the late Atlantan Harry Callahan are among the
artists collected in depth. John has also acquired works by
regional artists such as Todd Murphy and Radcliffe Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The musician, who has frequented local galleries since he moved
here, took up photography with a vengeance in 1991. The collection
centers on the 20th century, encompassing vintage black-and-white
modernism, contemporary color and mixed-media pieces. He has gone
to great lengths to get what he wants, acquiring rare prints of
Andre Kertesz' famous ``Mondrian's Glasses and Pipe'' and Richard
Avedon's ``Dovima With Elephants'' through record-breaking auction
bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton also loves framing and presentation,'' Rifkin says.
``While we're not going to re-create his apartment, we will try to
give a sense of how he has displayed his collection, by including
glass objects and classical marble statues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin credits Jackson as the catalyst for the show. She
introduced the museum director to John at a dinner party in her
home in 1994. That evening, John offered to exhibit his collection
during the Olympics, a time slot that had already been filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, I went back to Ned and said, `Elton's collection is
really ready to be shown,''' says Jackson, who is working with
Rifkin and photography curator Tom Southall to assemble the show.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says John is thrilled about the project. ``Like most
truly passionate collectors, he wants people to come and become as
excited as he is,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   His presence will remain after the exhibition comes down. Net
proceeds from the show's admission fees will be used to establish a
fund for photography acquisitions that will bear his name.

 &HT;    U.S. on verge of victory over measles
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Measles still causes 1 million deaths worldwide each year, but
the disease is on the verge of being eliminated in the United
States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the disease detective agency is not popping the champagne
corks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't ready to celebrate just yet,'' said Dr. Mark Papania
acting chief of measles elimination at the CDC. ``We think we have
gotten rid of it as an indigenous disease. We're assembling a panel
of experts from outside CDC to review the data and possibly make a
declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released Thursday in the CDC's weekly report concluded
that only 100 cases of measles were identified in the United States
in 1998; 71 of the 100 were clearly caused by infections that
originated outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is no proof the remaining cases were linked to
imported infections, Papania said that was likely. The 29 cases, in
several small clusters, were so far apart that they were unlikely
to have been caused by an ongoing U.S. infection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no imported measles, there wouldn't be any
measles in the U.S.,'' Papania said.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 cases reported last year represent the lowest rate yet
seen in the nation _ a far cry from the 1950s, when 450,000 cases
were recorded each year and most of the population expected to
contract measles before age 15. Measles has become so uncommon _ 90
percent of American children get at least one of the two required
doses of vaccine before they are 2 _ that parents may have
forgotten how serious a threat it can be, Papania said. Before the
vaccine was introduced in 1963, one or two children out of every
1,000 infected died each year from pneumonia or encephalitis
associated with measles. In undeveloped countries where vaccination
is not routine, the death rate is one to two children out of every
10.

   The 100 cases reported last year represent the lowest rate yet
seen in the nation _ a far cry from the 1950s, when 450,000 cases
were recorded each year and most of the population expected to
contract measles before age 15. Measles has become so uncommon _ 90
percent of American children get at least one of the two required
doses of vaccine before they are 2 _ that parents may have
forgotten how serious a threat it can be, Papania said. Before the
vaccine was introduced in 1963, one or two children out of every
1,000 infected died each year from pneumonia or encephalitis
associated with measles. In undeveloped countries where vaccination
is not routine, the death rate is one to two children out of every
10.

CALIF. BANS PROMOTION OF BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS IN STATE TEXTBOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A bill banning promotions of brand-name products
promotions in state textbooks has been signed into law by Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news,'' said Joe Stein, a lawyer for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services in San Francisco. Stein,
who became appalled by a mathematics textbook given to his
sixth-grade son that ``looked like an ad for a chain electronics
store,'' first brought the problem to the attention of state
education officials and Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni, a Democrat
from Novato, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoni went on to sponsor the bill, signed by the governor
Wednesday, that outlaws product references in schoolbooks bought
with state money for classroom use.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote the measure with encouragement from the Oakland-based
Center for Commercial-Free Public Education, where program director
Dylan Bernstein said the law is likely to have national impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people become aware that California has banned
commercials in textbooks, we're going to see more of a trend,''
said Bernstein. He said only one other state, Louisiana, is
currently contemplating a similar step.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill published the book called ``Mathematics:
Applications and Connections'' that first drew Stein's wrath.
Issued in 1995, the book is replete with product references and
logos, including Barbie dolls, Cocoa Frosted Flakes, Sony
PlayStations, Spalding basketballs, Disney and Warner Bros.
characters, Nike shoes and fast-food outlets Burger King and
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jordan, McGraw-Hill's director of media relations, said the
references do not constitute advertising because the company
accepted no payment for the product plugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we develop textbooks,'' he said, ``we get a lot of feedback
from a lot of users of our books, and one thing that kept coming
through loud and clear was: Use real-world examples, make it
relevant to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Current books in use will be ``grandfathered in'' under the new
bill, which will affect only new purchases. McGraw-Hill spokesman
Steve Weiss said the company already has books with no brand names
coming down the pipeline.

STILL LIVING IN A `YELLOW SUBMARINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As tripped-out musical fantasias go, the Beatles' animated
``Yellow Submarine'' must have had the most profound effect on my
subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea how true this was until I sat enthralled by a
visually enhanced, digitally remastered, restored print of the film
a few weeks ago and was overcome with a nauseating, deeply
perplexing wave of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   The remastered version, which begins its nine-city tour in San
Francisco before it finds a permanent home on DVD, restores ``Hey
Bulldog'' to the mix and sounds crisp and heaven-sent on the
Castro's Dolby Surround.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Al Brodax, Roger McGough, Jack Mendelsohn, Lee
Minoff, Erich Segal and Roger McGough (who went uncredited in 1968)
``Submarine'' is still confounding its simplicity _ cartoon John,
Paul, George and Ringo ride through some non-geographic landscape
using the power of love and music to save the people of Pepperland
from the Blue Meanies. Its sentiment is so obvious that ideological
satisfaction seems achievable only if you could play the movie
backward. Although watching it forward, you can see how smitten
``Sesame Street'' was with it, and there's enough 8-track
flashback-story to give VH1 pause to think about ``Behind the
Musical.''
</P>
<P>
   A euphoric New York Times review described ``Yellow Submarine''
as being a ``family movie in the truest sense _ and _ something for
the parents who can see the best of what being young is all
about.'' Hovering Buddhas and crazy rabbits? Try telling that to 50
confounded, sugar-shocked 8- to 12-year-olds whose music-video
vocabulary at that point was as deep as the gang Michael Jackson
rolled with in ``Beat It.'' Not very.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it again with an older eye, I found what frightened and
enthralled me as a kid was precisely what is so ingenious and
stunning about it now: Heinz Edelmann's art direction with the
added input of animation directors Jack Stokes, who oversaw the
Pepperland sequences, and Bob Balser, who was responsible for its
more fantastic outlying terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' takes a magical mystery tour through the
history of art and spends a splendiferous good time splashing in
the pop art of it all. Under the colliding-collage influence of
James Rosenquist, Richard Hamilton, Willem de Kooning and Robert
Rauschenberg, Edelmann and company forge a Wonderland so visually
ornate and adventurous it would make Alice blanch. It's also one of
those rare occasions for which Technicolor seems too clinical and
DeLuxe only begins to approach the magnitude of the pinwheels
blowing prisms and rainbows all over this parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite sequence is the ``Eleanor Rigby'' transition from
Pepperland to Liverpool. It's alive with a dreamy industrialism.
</P>
<P>
   The multidimensional planes of images undulating across the
screen with cold, gray panels folding into live action probably
seemed like an unpleasant affront to my elementary schooling 15
years ago; it's eloquent and visionary now.
</P>
<P>
   Also magnificent is the kaleidoscopic loopiness of ``Nowhere
Man'' (who's the film's best character) with the boys doing
something like dancing. The Toulouse Lautrec-for-kindergartners of
``Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'' _ flappers deliriously are
intercut with warped, water-colored can-can girls _ plays as if the
film has stopped for a few drinks at the Moulin Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   All this was lost on me the summer when I first saw the film _
useless beauty, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Why the counselors at my summer camp showed us ``Yellow
Submarine'' is still a mystery, where the print even came from is
even a bigger question mark, but I've met other kids who've seen it
in relative sobriety with their parents, who thought it'd be cool
to expose their kids to a critical moment in their childhoods. I
see in them a lot of my bemusement: They still have kaleidoscope
eyes.

<P>
   In 1994, seven executives from the tobacco industry sat in front
of U.S. representatives and proceeded to circumvent the
congressional panel's single question: ``Is your product
addictive?''
</P>
<P>
   No more so than a Twinkie, to paraphrase the lawyer for Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was carried on CSPAN in a session called ``Tobacco
Products and Health`` during which Big Tobacco said it doesn't
believe smoking is deadly. Oddly, neither do the movies. So, to
expose the forces of art 'n' capitalism snubbing the facts,
director Kevin Rafferty has made ``The Last Cigarette,'' an
inspired porno for smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Employing an onslaught of montages pilfered from Zeitgeist
archives _ cigarette ads from the '50s, Bogart and Bacall,
pro-smoking public-service announcements played with such ``tunes''
as Bernard Herrmann's ``Psycho'' score _ and assembled by editor
Frank Keraudren, ``Last Cigarette'' smokes so much and in so many
ghastly, gross, and, once in a while, gorgeous ways that it comes
off more like a ``puff film,'' a bizarro one in which no one dies.
In fact, they look just vaguely larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty draws a line in the sand between the reality of smoking
and its representation. Like movie sex, movie smoking isn't lethal
_ no one gets cancer or emphysema in the same way there is no AIDS
from sex in movies. Smoking and its culture are treated with a
complex fascination that taken in toto is enough to make you sick,
not unlike some porn.
</P>
<P>
   The film, constructed without narration or on-camera interviews,
takes a hard stance that deglamorizes smoking by making grotesques
of everybody who practices and peddles the habit _ which, according
to several segments on nicotine, really is a nasty one. A guy in
one of the vintage ads talks about the great taste with an
``all-the-cool-kids-are-doing-it'' urgency that probably had them
smoking in the boys' room between Saturday matinees. Follow that
with this woman's analogy: ``Secondhand smoke is rape, and that's
defined as an outrageous violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty presents the House hearing with the same hands-off,
let-'em-hang-themselves acerbity that he used like a devious
fly-on-the-wall in ``Feed,'' his assault on the '92 New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   There's some unalloyed, beautifully screwed-up work by the
tobacco execs, particularly James Johnson, of RJReynolds, who
convincingly casts himself as the worst man on Earth. Not to be
outdone, the bloated silver-haired gentleman to his right delivers
a black-hearted response to an asthmatic child's plea to stop
manufacturing tobacco products that sounds like an audition for
``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the film is uncertain is in its juxtaposition of the CSPAN
hearing with the barrage of clips. The crosscuttings have a
cumulative, not didactic, impact. There's an ambiguity and an
ambivalence about the tobacco industry that exposes the seams of
Rafferty and Keraudren's manipulation. (The film isn't anti-smoking
as much as it is astonished that anyone would enjoy it.) But once
it enters a literal ``Twilight Zone,'' ``The Last Cigarette'' is
all the patch you'll ever need.

IT TAKES A HAMLET TO HOUSE THE CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So much for all those bumper stickers that said,
``From the White House to the Big House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton have bought a $1.7 million house in
Westchester County, N.Y., on Old House Lane. That's not exactly
doing hard time, the kind Kenneth Starr wanted them to do. It means
hard times for their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Old House Lane is in a town in the gilded suburbs of New York
called Chappaqua. That's not short for Chappaquiddick, although the
Westchester town may draw as many tourists as that island resort
did after Edward M. Kennedy made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   In the language of the Indians native to the region,
``Chappaqua'' means ``Where'd they get the money?''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Chappaqua. Get ready for a permanent press corps
camped outside your country clubs and mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for photographers with cardboard cutouts of the First
Couple.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready to be simultaneously ripped and celebrated by Maureen
Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for a guy who cheats at golf.
</P>
<P>
   This is how rich Chappaqua is. New reports have been calling
this town of 17,000 a ``hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   How many things are called hamlets, besides the prince of
Denmark and Mario Cuomo? People who really live in a hamlet,
somewhere in Arkansas perhaps, call it a town or even a
municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Only rich people like to think of themselves as living in a
hamlet. It sounds so quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye quaint, hello CNN. Chappaqua is no longer a hamlet, it's
a dateline.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have already ruined Martha's Vineyard, turning the
Edgartown School into a press room and the Black Dog restaurant
into a bigger tourist trap and T-shirt emporium than it was before.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists go there just to buy the Black Dog bag Bill gave to
Monica. At least Chappaqua has managed to stay out of the trinket
business until now.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous thing to come out of Chappaqua was the 1966
movie ``Chappaqua'' about a rich kid who's an alcoholic and drug
addict.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes more bad publicity for Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Chappaqua are worldly enough to know what's in
store for them. But the Clintons, who have been isolated and never
owned their own home, have no idea what they're in for.
</P>
<P>
   How are they going to make that mortgage payment estimated at
$10,000 a month? Just think of it in terms of billable hours, Bill.
Counting all the hours in a month, it works out to $14 an hour,
which is a lot less than your lawyers have been charging.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will be paying $26,000 a year in taxes on the
house. This could be tough for a guy who's used to spending tax
money. But it's for fixing potholes, not making them with cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes with neighbors could make Bosnia look easy. Just wait
until they want to build a pool house so campaign contributors can
be soaked in comfort. There's no neighborhood dispute like one
among the rich.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect Hillary Clinton will be a big hit in Chappaqua. Women
love her, particularly rich women, the kind who have been writing
big checks at her fund-raisers in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about the president. I'm sure all the rich guys
would love to shoot the breeze with him at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder if Clinton will be invited to join a
country club after a recent story in the New York Times reporting
that he takes second drives off the tee if he doesn't like the
first one.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things you can do as commander in chief that
you can't do as a civilian in plaid pants.
</P>
<P>
   The house has a 1-acre lot, a pool, four bathrooms, an exercise
room and five bedrooms. That's plenty of room for Bill, Hillary and
Chelsea, with two bedrooms left over for overnights by Hillary's
campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Their new house is attractive and was built in 1889, a year that
marked the transition from the administration of Grover Cleveland
to Benjamin Harrison. They were two presidents so undistinguished
that all anyone can remember is Cleveland's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted having an illegitimate child, no redefinition of
``is,'' and that ended the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine bon vivant bubba Bill Clinton living in
suburbia, even if it's a suburb so wealthy it's called a hamlet.
How much jogging can you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a new role,'' Clinton said the other day. He
also said, ``I can work for cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I can't see him mowing lawns. I can't see him as a
househusband or a Senate husband.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary loses to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, maybe
they'll escape that hamlet and move to the San Francisco Bay Area,
where we know how to treat celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   We pretend to ignore them unless we want them to be auctioneers
or celebrity hosts at charity fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton seem to love fund-raisers, so they'd
have a grand time _ if they could get into charities besides
themselves.

FALSE CLAIMS ACT DOESN'T NEED FIXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barrels labeled ``gunpowder'' that turned out to be filled with
sawdust when opened. ``Leather'' shoes that disintegrated on the
soldiers' feet when they got wet. Hardtack so infested with maggots
that it literally moved in one's hand.
</P>
<P>
   President Abraham Lincoln was so outraged by war profiteers
selling shoddy goods to his Union troops during the Civil War that
he signed the first law that allowed individuals to sue companies
that billed the government for nonexistent products and services or
sold poor-quality goods.
</P>
<P>
   In 1863, Lincoln opened the door for whistle-blower lawsuits.
Certain members of Congress will be trying their darnedest to close
that door when lawmakers reconvene next week.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of modern-day examples exist as to why the False Claims
Act needs to be left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward from the Civil War to the Vietnam War, where
American GIs were plagued by problems with M-16 rifles that worked
miserably. Turns out that performance tests were falsified during
the weapon's development, putting the lives of U.S. military
personnel at even greater risk than one would expect for armed
soldiers in a war zone. No telling how many young men died because
their government-issued weapons jammed during the frenzy of a
firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, a California federal jury awarded a defense
contractor employee $125 million after he was fired for exposing
defects in the Army's highly touted Bradley Fighting Vehicle _
defects that the manufacturer knew existed in the early models. The
tracked armored vehicle, supposedly amphibious, leaked worse than
Tammy Faye Bakker on a crying jag. FMC Corp., the maker of the
Bradley, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt Building Corp. of El Paso paid $8 million to settle a False
Claims Act charge that it cut more than corners when it constructed
housing units at Ellworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The
Defense Department inspector general's semi-annual report to
Congress this March described violations of ``fire safety rules,
flawed heating systems and improper design and construction causing
units to break apart in high winds.'' In some of the units, ``pipes
were simply inserted into the ground to make it look like mandatory
sewer clean-outs had been installed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the defense industry are putting pressure on their
congressional reps to loosen some of what they believe are overly
restrictive provisions of the False Claims Act, despite
recommendations by the Justice Department and the Defense
Department's general counsel and inspector general to leave the
statute alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the House Judiciary and Armed Services committees
sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno this spring bemoaning
the ``low burden of proof and lack of intent requirements'' that
they contend flaw the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to amend the statute to more clearly
distinguish between fraudulent conduct and ``honest mistakes,
contract disputes or even contract breaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Defense Industrial Association is concerned that
some high-tech companies are shying away from bidding on government
contracts for fear of whistle-blower suits. This may be a
simplistic view on my part, but if the companies perform as
required, they have nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rub: If the bar is lowered on the False Claims Act,
the people affected aren't going to be the big brass at the
Pentagon or the suits sitting on Capitol Hill or the defense
industry lobbyists with their Palm Pilots ever at the ready. It's
the taxpayers and the working stiffs, often men and women wearing
the uniform of this country, who rely on the materials produced
under government contracts to perform as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers Against Fraud, a nonprofit and nonpartisan public
interest group, expects the appropriations bills that were left
unfinished when Congress recessed last month to become the soil in
which to sow changes in the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the products delivered under government contract
meet specifications to a T, come in on budget and work as designed.
But the whistle-blower act is good law, a way in which private
individuals and the government can hold corporations responsible
for their products and services. Congress needs to leave it alone.

   SUDAN-WAR (Tajura, Sudan) _ When Sudanese government forces
attacked this village, killing its inhabitants was of little
immediate concern. As it has been throughout the campaign to
cleanse Sudan's isolated Nuba Mountains of its rebellious
population, the primary mission was to destroy the people's ability
to feed themselves and to drive them off the land. The current
round of the civil war between the fundamentalist Islamic
government of Sudan and the mostly non-Islamic tribes of the south
has lasted for 16 years and has caused the deaths of nearly 2
million people. By TONY FREEMANTLE. (Photos available on NYT
database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-NUBA (Nuba Mountains, Sudan) _ Since 1989, when the people
of the Nuba Mountains aligned themselves with the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army, the rebel movement that controls much of the
southern half of the country, they have been under virtual siege by
the government. By TONY FREEMANTLE. (Photos available on NYT
database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-AID (Panthou, Sudan) _ The people of Panthou seemingly
have spent lifetimes fleeing tribal rivals, Islamic holy warriors
and pro-government mercenaries bent on carnage. Their cattle have
been rustled, their crops laid waste, their homes gutted, their
culture battered. A ground-level look at how the aid operation and
the war have affected one village in southern Sudan. By DUDLEY
ALTHAUS. (Photos available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-AID-WORKERS (Lokichokio, Kenya) _ For a decade now, people
like Charisse Tillman have labored under an umbrella of U.N. and
private relief agencies that has delivered thousands of tons of
food and other supplies to the victims and perpetrators of one of
the world's deadliest and most intractable wars. Theirs is tricky
work at best. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-HISTORY (Ajiep, Sudan) _ A nuts-and-bolts look at Sudan's
civil war and a brief history of the country. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-US (Undated) _ The U.S. government supplies most of the

aid agencies. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.

   SUDAN-ATTACKS (Ajiep, Sudan) _ What happens if there is an
attack, asks a woman new to Sudan, at a meeting of relief workers?
Good question. Nothing has been more disruptive to the relief
effort than the constant warfare scraping back and forth across
Sudan's south. The fear of an attack prematurely ends the meeting
before anything is accomplished. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS. (Photo

ENOUGH ALREADY WITH CRITICS, FRIENDS AND TV SHOWS RUINING MOVIE
SURPRISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all went well, by the time you read this, I will have seen
the late-summer hit ``The Sixth Sense.'' If all went well, I will
have been surprised by the ending. That is, if I managed to avoid
seeing the scene on ``Entertainment Tonight,'' or reading about it
in Entertainment Weekly, or hearing about it from the
everybody's-a-critic faction that inevitably inhabits the lunchtime
table next to mine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you had to put money on whether I made it to the
screening without someone revealing the surprise ending to
``Sense,'' the smart money goes to ``no.'' Because, more than ever,
Hollywood's hype machine and the media elite it feeds seem to be
intent on spoiling every good joke or plot twist in a movie before
you have a chance to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when ``The Crying Game'' was released in 1992, people
were furious if movie critics revealed the primary, uh, twist in
the film's plot. As opening weekend box-office take became more
important to studios than long runs _ too many movies, too many
variables, too much money involved to hope people discover a movie
_ they began running The One Big Wow Scene as part of the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to see ``Independence Day,'' for example, you knew
that the aliens blow up the White House. There was no surprise when
the attack occurred in the film. And although you didn't see New
York wiped out in the preview for the meteor movie ``Deep Impact,''
the 1,000-foot tidal wave gave you a pretty good indication of what
was going to happen to the Big Apple. Again, this diluted the
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing compared with the blatant disregard for film
secrets, movie moments and on-screen jokes that exists now.
Witness:
</P>
<P>
   What suspense the recent thriller ``Arlington Road'' holds is
tied to the ambiguity of Tim Robbins' character _ i.e., is he a mad
bomber? The film doesn't make this clear until late, but the
trailers all but place a neon sign above his head, blinking ``EVIL
BOMBER HERE.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many funny moments in the Steve Martin/Eddie Murphy
comedy ``Bowfinger,'' but the most hilarious visual gag takes place
in a parking garage. It's a laugh-out-loud gut-buster of a scene,
unless you saw the ``entire scene'' when it was played a few weeks
back on ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several wonderful cameos in the new Albert Brooks
kvetch-fest ``The Muse.'' Oh, but you already knew that, and you
know exactly who stars in those cameos, because you saw the trailer
that gives nearly every one of them away.
</P>
<P>
   Space constrictions prohibit more ranting and examples. Suffice
it to say that spoiling movie secrets has become my newest No. 1
Moviegoing Peeve, replacing the practice of bringing 5-year-olds to
R-rated movies. In the latter case, though, I can do something
about it _ complain or beat someone up or something. When a moment
is spoiled, there's a complete sense of frustration, because
nothing can be done. Too late, the magic's gone, so turn on the TV
or read a book.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if someone ruins ``Sense'' for me before I get a
chance to go, I'll say now that's exactly what I plan to do. I'll
set aside a copy of Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' _ the one where
the rich guy loses everything and becomes a nutso stoic after a
bizarre press conference at the end of the book _ so that I can't
be bothered by people who are so inconsiderate as to spoil a good
movie.

RABBI'S WISDOM TOUCHES PEOPLE OF VARIOUS FAITHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Harold S. Kushner is the author of several books,
including the international bestseller ``When Bad Things Happen to
Good People'' (Avon, $5.99). His perennially popular book grew out
of tragedy in his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Now he speaks around the world and is sought after for programs
on national television. But one thing continues to puzzle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ceases to amaze me that so many Christians come to a
Conservative rabbi to learn more about spirituality and God,''
Kushner said this week. ``Eighty percent of my mail comes from
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard Kushner speak before, and I've read some of his
books. He has deep insight into life and spirituality and expresses
it in a crystal-clear manner that reaches all people.
</P>
<P>
   Although different in many ways, Kushner's books remind me, in
some respects, of the religious writings of C.S. Lewis, the Oxford
University don who converted to Christianity late in life. He then
produced some of the most profound and easily understood arguments
for the Christian faith that have ever been written.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lewis, Kushner wrote out of his life experiences. Lewis
wrote ``A Grief Observed'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $11) after his
wife, Joy Gresham, died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' was written after
Kushner's only son, Aaron, died of a rare rapid-aging disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner has spoken many times in Texas and will be back for an
appearance at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth on Sept. 14.
He will deliver the Gates of Chai Lectures sponsored by TCU's
relatively new Jewish Studies Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to highlight what Jews and Christians share, especially
the values we have in common as we confront an increasingly pagan
world,'' Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Christians and Jews would like to restore the value of faith in
modern life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today have the problems they've always had,'' he said.
``At one time religion answered those problems. Now we have become
so cynical and sophisticated that we have forgotten that religion
has those answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem cited by Jews and Christians is that people have
turned away from their religious faith as a guide, making it harder
to identify what is right and wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our God demands morality,'' he said. ``That was the new
idea that Abraham brought into the world. We've lost our sense of
right and wrong in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner will also speak to TCU students on the topic: ``What You
Get Out of Being Religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious faith, he believes, can save us from being afraid of
death and can offer a sense of community in a lonely world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us spend our entire day dealing with strangers, and
human beings were not meant to be that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish faith, the sense of community and relating to
other people is a unique emphasis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable for us to have a one-on-one relationship
to God that is not mediated through a community,'' said Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, a Brooklyn native, was a young rabbi in the 1960s when
his greatest test of faith came. His son was found to have
progeria, a rare disease that causes premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner was devastated because his son, who died at age 14, got
the idea that if he were only good enough, God would heal him. The
book, ``When Bad Things Happen to Good People,'' grew out of that
heartbreaking experience.
</P>
<P>
   The book makes the point that God doesn't bring on the tragedies
of life, but he gives us the strength to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been translated into 12 languages. Everywhere he
travels, people come to Kushner and tell him how much they
appreciate the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man told me he had been mad at God for 15 years after his
child was killed in a freak accident,'' Kushner said. ``He had quit
going to church. But he started back to church after reading the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``When Bad Things Happen to Good People'' came out
18 years ago, Kushner said that the strength of its message hasn't
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I travel a lot,'' Kushner said. ``And everywhere I go, I can
predict that a dozen people will come up to me and say that my book
has changed their lives.''

 &HT;    Church hit hard by Holy Spirit
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALHOUN, Ga. _ ``The Revival Continues,'' says the sign outside
the East Calhoun Church of God, a modern brick-and-stone A-frame
building an hour north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And so it does.
</P>
<P>
   For 150 weeks now, in lengthy services that begin with
enthusiastic singing and end with people literally lying on the
floor, this church has been hit hard by the Holy Spirit. Or by the
devil, say some critics, or simple mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   People from all over have traveled I-75 to Calhoun, a carpet
town of 8,500 souls, pulled by curiosity, a spiritual quest or some
of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all the time having people come down, and they stay
with us,'' says Matthew Robertson, manager of Shepherd Budget Host
Inn on Ga. 53, the exit nearest the church.
</P>
<P>
   And at the nearby Huddle House, manager Taylor Smith says it's
not unusual to hear customers comparing their revival experiences.
</P>
<P>
   East Calhoun is one of several churches around the country, from
Southern Baptist to Pentecostal, that are experiencing spillover
from a phenomenon often called the ``Pensacola Outpouring'' _ a
long-running revival at Brownsville Assembly of God in that Florida
Panhandle city. Some say Brownsville is ushering in another ``Great
Awakening'' like the one of the 1730s and 1740s, led by Calvinist
evangelists Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the phenomenon may be more secular, if not sinister.
</P>
<P>
   An article in a journal called Personal Freedom Outreach,
published by a nonprofit Christian cult-watch group headquartered
in St. Louis, goes so far as to say, ``It is the belief of many of
the careful observers of the phenomenon that the unbelievable
practices can be accounted for by peer pressure, expectation, crowd
control, hypnotic techniques, suggestibility and altered states of
consciousness. Some even suggest the demonic at work.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a Sunday night in the light-filled, 650-seat sanctuary of
East Calhoun Church of God, no one seems to care how others
characterize this force. They are just here to feel it for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wor-ship the Lord, Wor-ship the Lord,'' the 50-voice choir
sings staccato. The singers are accompanied by guitars, a piano and
drums, played by a man in an acoustic capsule that looks like an
upside-down aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The song is jubilantly choppy and its repetition mesmerizing.
Some singers raise their hands and sway. The congregation keeps
time by clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Then the choir chants in explosive little syllables like a
cheer, ``Wor-ship-the-Lord-for-he-is-worrrrrrthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The music somehow segues into Handel's magnificent
``Hallelujah'' chorus and ends in a frenzy of ``hallelujahs.'' One
singer thrusts his tattooed arm into the air in a sign of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The choir's performance is followed by gut-busting
congregational singing that climaxes with verse after verse of the
old standard ``Victory in Jesus,'' led by the Rev. Jamie Chant, his
yellow dress shirt transparent from moisture. He mops the
free-flowing sweat from his balding head and reddening face with a
white handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   A plump blonde in a long blue cotton dress runs through the
sanctuary shaking her hands as if to dry them, appearing to be
hardly aware of her movement. A gangly youth in a golf shirt steps
in front of the altar and rocks back and forth with his eyes closed
and mouth open. And, in the fifth row, a woman seems to be spinning
uncontrollably. By the time the music ends, 50 minutes after it
began, half the crowd is bouncing like an army on pogo sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Just another Sunday night at East Calhoun _ and not even the
biggest, loudest, most zealous worship gathering of the week. That
would be the long end-of-the-workweek Pentecostal version of
``happy hour'' known as ``Friday Night Fire,'' which draws crowds
of up to 1,000. Saturday night targets young people; Tuesday is
corporate prayer attended mostly by locals; and Wednesday is a
revival service much like tonight's _ if one night can be like any
other in this spiritually charged atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   An insatiable urge
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9, 1997, ``The power of God hit this place like an
atomic bomb,'' says church pastor the Rev. Keith Reid of the day
this revival began.
</P>
<P>
   For Reid, a small, wiry man of 44, it was an answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going well at East Calhoun, but everything was
wearing me out,'' he says of the fall of 1996. ``I was getting
frustrated with the ministry and most of all frustrated with
myself. I just thought, `There's got to be more to church than what
I'm experiencing.''' &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he says, attendance at the church ran about 200,
services were predictable and the congregation seemed complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Reid heard about the revival at Brownsville Assembly of God in
Pensacola, which had begun on Father's Day 1995 and which had
people lining up before dawn for services that didn't begin until
sunset. Dozens of people nightly were being ``slain in the spirit''
_ falling down, overcome with fervor _ and many were reporting
religious conversions. The church had not seen the like of it
before.
</P>
<P>
   When Reid heard that some of the Pensacola leaders were going to
be at North Cleveland Church of God in Cleveland, Tenn., he decided
to go. At the end of the service, he stepped forward for the altar
call when the minister invited people to come forward for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 45 minutes to be prayed for, because there
were so many people in the church,'' Reid recalls. ``When I was
prayed for, I fell on the ground, and the spirit of God spoke to
me, not in a word but in a knowing. God said, `If you'll get out of
my way, I'll do something.'''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't his first personal encounter with God, Reid says.
Raised Southern Baptist in Hartwell, a northeast Georgia town at
the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he was taught to be
``anti-Pentecostal,'' suspicious of the manifestations of the Holy
Spirit that Pentecostals claim: miraculous healings, prophecy and,
especially, ``speaking in tongues,'' or uttering unknown languages.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baptist preacher had been repeating the prayer ``I want
your power'' to the Almighty. And in 1977, he now believes, he got
an answer. It was like a dream, he says, of a man he didn't know,
sitting on a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   In the vision, he prayed for the man, who jumped up and shouted.
``And I began to speak in this foreign language,'' says Reid. ``I
woke up in bed speaking this language. I put my hand over my mouth
and tried to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, as he was visiting a patient at Hart County
Hospital, the events of the dream actually happened. Afterward,
Reid developed an ``insatiable urge'' to lay hands on people and
pray. ``When I started praying for people,'' he says, ``many times
they would fall on the floor.'' But his actions caused ``so much
friction'' that he left the Baptist church and became an evangelist
for the Church of God, preaching wherever he was needed.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 12 years before he came to Calhoun in 1995, he
pastored Perimeter North Church of God in Chamblee, where average
attendance rose from 40 to 200 _ then fell to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Chamblee a very proud man,'' Reid says. ``The past
few years at Chamblee, I saw the church continually decline. I
think what God did there was let me know sufficiently that I can't
do anything apart from him.''

   ATLANTA: anything apart from him.''
</P>
<P>
   `Daddy, who's that man?'
</P>
<P>
   After his encounter with the Brownsville leader, Reid says he
had a ``knowing in my heart'' that revival would hit East Calhoun _
and soon. On a Tuesday evening, a day after his visit to Cleveland,
he gathered with his family and a visiting pastor in his living
room to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I said, `God, I want your will but I'm kind of
afraid. See me through this,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He was astounded at what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is not emotional at all. She fell on the floor. My
son-in-law, who's a doctor, flipped back over the couch. My son,
who was 18, fell on his knees and began to pray. My daughter, about
7, began to pull on my coat and say, `Daddy, who's that man?
There's a man behind brother and his face is glowing.' I didn't see
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started praying and I was out,'' says his wife, Patty,
45. ``The presence of the Lord was so strong you couldn't stand
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Wednesday, Reid took the pulpit at a 7 o'clock
service and preached a classic message of repentance, with a
newfound intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one problem,'' he told the congregation, ``and that's
sin. There's only one answer to that one problem. That's the blood
of Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended with the invitation, ``If you really want revival and
you want God to touch you, come to the altar and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. ``They lined the altar wall to wall,'' Reid says.
``That night at 11 o'clock, we carried people to the car because we
needed to close the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that night, he says, the altar calls have seldom lasted
less than an hour. Sunday morning attendance averages 625, and
during a typical week as many as 2,000 people pass through the
church doors.
</P>
<P>
   A few longtime church members were so disturbed by the changes
that they left. But many more new ones came _ membership is up to
990.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the revival first hit, we had such an influx we bought
ads in the paper apologizing for people not getting into the
building,'' Reid says. ``We've added on to the building four times.
All have been paid for, debt free.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the service ends with ministers and ``prayer
partners'' walking through the congregation and praying
individually for people, who frequently collapse to the floor and
then stagger around as if stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of God will fall like a river. It happens every
service,'' Reid says. ``A lot of people come and get caught up in
the emotion. Emotion is fine, but you don't regulate spirituality
by emotion. You regulate spirituality by lifestyle, by fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   A marriage healed, a son born
</P>
<P>
   On this night Reid steps up to the pulpit to make a promise:
``Anybody here who's not saved, you're gon' get saved before you
leave here tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He invites people to share their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Husband and wife Brent and Shayne Parker come forward in their
choir robes to tell how, in 1992, they were told that they had a
very small chance of having children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't living right,'' Shayne says in a choked voice. ``We
were drinking. Our lives were out of control. We were on the verge
of divorce. You could have stamped a sticker on our foreheads that
said, `Hell Bound.'''
</P>
<P>
   When they visited the revival, ``we went in one way and came out
another,'' she says. Their marriage was healed, they were able to
buy a house and, the best miracle of all, they had a little boy,
whom they named Samuel as they say God told them to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get in God's will and blessings will be
bestowed upon us,'' she tearfully told the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The music and testimonies have gone on for an hour and a half
before Reid finally begins to preach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When God saves you, he is not through with you,'' he
pronounces. ``I want to preach tonight on how God purifies us.''
</P>
<P>
   He preaches about Saul and David and the fruits of the spirit.
He pounds the lectern and slings his Bible, covered in black
leather, into the air, holding it by an edge. Sometimes he raises
his voice, in both pitch and volume; sometimes he almost whispers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody say, `I'm God's child,''' he orders the congregation.
``Somebody say, `I'm somebody.'''
</P>
<P>
   They shout the phrases back.
</P>
<P>
   When he's almost through he tells them to stand and, if they
don't know Jesus, to repeat after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess,'' he leads them, and they chime back, ``I
confess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is Lord. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, each has stated publicly, ``I am holy. I am pure. I am
forgiven. I am saved.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Reid and the other pastors are ready to step down and
pray for individuals, dozens crowd toward the aisles, waiting for
the touch. Reid reaches out a cupped hand toward their foreheads
and says, sounding almost like a sneeze, the single word ``Fresh!''
to signify a new spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As he prays for people, two male ``catchers'' stand beside them
to assure that they aren't injured when they fall to the floor.
Carol Pearce follows, a stack of peach-colored cloths over her arm
to spread across the thighs of collapsed women for modesty's sake.
</P>
<P>
   In the aisle, a young woman lies, hands across her abdomen,
arching as if in pain. A gold cross glitters on her neck; her long,
light brown hair is spread like a fan around her head. A man in a
``God's Locker Room'' T-shirt shakes as if from convulsions. Around
the altar, the body count is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cox, a dignified, middle-aged piano teacher from
Canton, is lying on the floor, her sleeveless lavender dress bright
against the dark blue-green carpet.
</P>
<P>
   When she is upright again, she explains that she was raised
Baptist and this is her third visit to the revival. ``I always have
a very strong encounter with the presence of God,'' she says.
``It's always different every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, she says, ``I felt like there was a fire in my hands,
and I heard God speaking to me about some personal things in my
life I had been asking him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's things happening,'' says Janet Johnson, 46, a lifelong
member of the Church of God. ``The Lord's doing things I've never
seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, many have left. Near the altar, Pearce and a
small cluster of people still pray around a tall woman in a black
dress. A young man stands, swaying in front of the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a pew near the back of the church, the Rev. William
Legge, 42, watches. Visiting from Connersville, Ind., where he is
pastor of the Connersville Church of God, Legge first came to the
Calhoun revival in 1998. Since then, he and two other pastors have
``covenanted'' to try to bring 2,000 people to Christ by the end of
the year 2000, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that Connersville can be another East Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some tremendous things starting to happen,'' Legge
says. ``We believe it's just the beginning for us.''

FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Frampton is forever linked to the '70s, so it's only
natural that he's been hired as an ``authenticity adviser'' for a
film about that era. The film, as yet untitled, is being written
and directed by Cameron Crowe, who also worked on ``Jerry Maguire''
and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron and I both felt that there hadn't been a movie that
had everything right about that era _ the clothes, the look, and
even the right musical equipment,'' says Frampton, whose 1976
album, ``Frampton Comes Alive!,'' sold 16 million copies and
remains the top-selling live album of all time.
</P>
<P>
   A further sidelight: Crowe, a former Rolling Stone writer, was
16 years old when he wrote the liner notes to ``Frampton Comes
Alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton has an acting role in the film (which stars Jason Lee
and Billy Crudup), as well as a musical one. He plays the road
manager for Humble Pie _ a band to which he once belonged _ and
performs on the soundtrack with Heart's Nancy Wilson (Crowe's wife)
and guitarist Mike McCready of Pearl Jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got along great with Mike,'' says Frampton. ``It's either
him playing lead or me playing lead on guitar. And Mike has really
studied the rock 'n' roll from that period. He'd ask me, `What is
that riff you used to do in Humble Pie? Can you show me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton's '70s hits include ``Show Me the Way,'' ``Baby I Love
Your Way,'' and ``Do You Feel Like We Do.'' These are staples from
an era now embraced ``by not only sons and daughters of baby
boomers, but their sons and daughters as well,'' Frampton says with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the British-born Frampton is living in Nashville
with his third wife and two children _ a much calmer life compared
to the excesses that seemed almost de rigueur in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has become vitamins and Evian water and working out,
instead of all that other stuff that we used to get involved in,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Frampton has also done two tours as part of
Ringo Starr's All-Stars, while staying active with his own band
that includes keyboard/guitar player Bob Mayo, who was on
``Frampton Comes Alive!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chart hit in a while, but I'm still a road
hog,'' says Frampton, who also toured in David Bowie's band on the
latter's ``Glass Spider'' tour in the late '80s. Bowie had been a
student of Frampton's dad, who was an art school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in between trips to Los Angeles to work on Crowe's
film, Frampton has been doing a lot of outdoor dates in unusual
places, from state fairs to the 1,500-capacity WaterWorks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've enjoyed the outdoor shows this summer,'' says Frampton,
who will perform '70s hits and some new material from Crowe's film
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seeing the different ages and the cross-section of the
crowds has been fun,'' he says. ``All of a sudden I'm getting busy
again, which is really exciting.''

BASEBALL OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO SUCCESS, FAILURE OF UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you want to understand everything that is
wonderful and not-so-wonderful about labor unions, go to a baseball
game. Even if your body doesn't last the full nine innings, your
insight into labor and management will go the whole nine yards:
</P>
<P>
   _ In The Beginning, there was arrogant management.
</P>
<P>
   If your company has a labor union, it's almost certainly because
the current management or the previous management or some
competitor shortchanged workers so blatantly that they wanted to
unionize. Union organizers may plant the seeds, but it's usually
management that provides the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many greedy business owners, baseball's management didn't
share enough of the profits with the workers. Even superstars like
Willie Mays had little leverage because they were bound to one team
for life unless they were traded or released.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad that the players finally formed a strong
union, fighting for the right to free agency and better treatment.
The union made sure that as baseball thrived, so did the players.
Salaries and benefits soared.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrogance is not limited to management.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most workers, the umpires have it made. Although
they face a lot of scrutiny and have to be away from their families
for long periods, they earn six-figure salaries, have lots of time
off and are unlikely to be threatened with layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They also have a particularly good reason to be unionized, just
as government workers, journalists and teachers do. They need to be
able to do their jobs without worrying about alienating an
influential owner or political figure or parent.
</P>
<P>
   But their powerful union went one step too far this summer,
persuading almost all the umps to resign as a negotiating ploy.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball officials just shrugged, the umpires hastily tried
to take back their resignations, but 22 already had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires overestimated their strength. The owners and fans
had grown tired of their act, and the players were not about to
back them up. Although many umpires are excellent workers, their
union had become a symbol of arrogance and incompetence, protecting
even the weakest and nastiest umpires from any sort of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Striking out.
</P>
<P>
   As the umpires found out, the threat of a work stoppage is not
nearly as powerful as it used to be. Even when they go on strike,
unions can end up hurting themselves because competition is more
intense than in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service drivers, for example, made some gains in
their contract when they went on strike a couple of years ago, and
the public generally supported them. But the strike caused UPS to
lose customers to other delivery companies. Fewer customers mean
fewer jobs, and the workers lost thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   The other major threat, of course, is that your company can hire
replacement workers, so it can continue making money while you're
on strike. If bosses and customers are willing to accept those
replacements, you're in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Major League Baseball players have such tremendous
power. There is no real competition, and fans won't accept
replacement players. The threat of a strike is a much stronger
weapon for them than for most unions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of organized labor hate replacement workers, calling
them ``scabs.'' But there aren't nearly as many people involved
with labor unions as there used to be. At their peak in the 1950s,
unions represented about one out of three American workers. Now
it's one out of seven.
</P>
<P>
   That means companies that use replacement workers don't face the
kind of public backlash that they used to _ giving unions a weaker
bargaining position. It also means that nonunion workers don't get
the benefits that used to trickle down to them, things like shorter
workweeks and increases in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Nonunion companies had to come close to matching
union-negotiated benefits in order to recruit good workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being safe is out.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires have the kind of union some workers would love.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they do something stupid (like, say, resigning en masse),
the umpires keep their jobs year after year, regardless of how
poorly they perform, regardless of how unpleasant they are to deal
with. Their pay is based mostly on longevity, not quality.
</P>
<P>
   Players, on the other hand, have almost no guarantees. Their
union ensures a great minimum salary and protects them from
management vindictiveness, but it does not pretend that every
player's work is of equal quality. Great players usually earn
substantially more than good players, and lousy players find
themselves out of work.
</P>
<P>
   So, thanks to their union, the umpires have more security than
the players, right? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Even if fans are frustrated with high salaries, they know the
players offer them the best product available. Union members have
convinced everyone _ including the owners _ that if they go on
strike, their replacements will offer an inferior product.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' union, on the other hand, has built a reputation
for defending its members. The quality of work is a distant second.
So if the umpires quit or go on strike, players and fans are more
willing to accept their replacements.
</P>
<P>
   _ The late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though unemployment is down, the last 15 years have been a
fragile time for workers, union and nonunion. Although talented
workers are in heavy demand, there has been wave after wave of
layoffs, leading to wave after wave of goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   Because everyone is so vulnerable, it's a time that creates a
lot of heroes and goats. Companies that don't share profits or are
callous about laying off workers not only will have trouble
recruiting talent, but will be encouraging workers to unionize,
just as the baseball owners did.
</P>
<P>
   Unions want to play to their strength: negotiating good
severance packages and fair treatment for their members. On the
other hand, if all they're concerned with is seniority and
protecting jobs _ rather than retaining good workers and helping
the company compete _ they can alienate management, customers and
some of their own members, just as the umpires did.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for labor and management to be seduced by short-term
benefits at the expense of long-term gains. Management that is
obsessed with short-term profits can wipe out morale; unions that
are obsessed with short-term protectionism can wipe out profits. In
either case, both sides eventually lose.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and unions that might emerge as the heroes are
those that guarantee workers a decent wage, but also reward merit
and give workers a financial stake in the company's success. This
is one time that baseball players should be thankful they're ahead
of the curve.

Princeton Review to relieve guidance counselors of major aspects of

City and the surrounding region, are considering their offerings.
By contracting out some guidance services, the schools are seeking
a way to solve major problems: budget cuts that have burdened many

   Forget wearing a football shirt and never mind screaming
yourself silly: cheering makes absolutely no difference to the
outcome of a complex sports event, says a researcher in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Strauss of the University of Mynster wanted to find out if
there was any truth in the popular belief, shared by fans and
players, that cheering can positively influence the outcome of
play. He analyzed both the spectators and the teams in four home
games of the New Yorker Hurricanes, a team in Kiel that plays
American football.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss videotaped 631 downs, discrete plays in which one team
attempts to move the ball down the field. On a separate tape he
recorded the behavior of the team's most loyal supporters, a group
of 300 fans who typically sat together in a certain section of the
stadium. All the games were sold out, and the crowds could be
clearly seen and heard by the players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   One group of judges called each down a success, a failure or
neutral depending on whether the team lost or gained territory.
Another two judges assessed the crowd's behavior. They deemed the
fans supportive when at least half clapped, cheered or shouted
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss found that crowd support had absolutely no impact on the
outcome of an individual down. He says cheers are probably
ineffective in other complex team sports as well, such as soccer
and ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that positive and negative effects of cheering may
cancel each other out. On the one hand, cheering seems to improve
speed, while on the other it seems to hinder coordination. But it
makes the spectators feel better, he says, giving them the illusion
of control. &QL;

   Don't blame society. It's the kids who impose stereotyped roles
on the people who care for them, according to a pioneering study of
lesbian adoptive couples.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Ciano-Boyce and Lynn Shelley-Sireci of Westfield State
College in Massachusetts wanted to know if the experience of
adopting a child differed between homosexual and heterosexual
couples. Massachusetts is one of the few states where same-sex
couples can adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers asked 10 lesbian and 26 heterosexual couples who
had adopted a child to fill out an extensive 20-page questionnaire.
On most topics, heterosexual and homosexual couples responded
similarly. But lesbian parents reported significantly more
dissatisfaction with the division of childcare.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts to be totally egalitarian, they said
that the child always seemed to insist on one parent for primary
needs _ such as comfort, food and tucking in at bedtime. Meanwhile,
the child treated the other parent almost exclusively as a
playmate. While heterosexual parents reported a similar division of
roles, with the mother usually performing primary tasks, they
didn't consider it a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The child chooses one parent over the other,'' says
Ciano-Boyce, and the two roles appear to be mutually exclusive.
Since both parents in the lesbian families were interested in being
primary caregivers, and neither was the biological mother, it's not
clear what criteria the child uses to pick its caregiver,
Ciano-Boyce says. &QL;

   Prehistoric viruses are lying dormant in the polar ice caps _
and a bout of warm weather could release them into the atmosphere,
sparking new epidemics. This chilling warning follows the
discovery, for the first time, of an ancient virus in Arctic ice.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, found deep within the Greenland icepack, is known as
a tomato mosaic tobamovirus or ToMV, a common plant pathogen. The
discovery suggests that other viruses, such as ancient strains of
flu, polio and smallpox, may also be entombed and could make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know the survival rate, or how often they get back
into the environment. But it certainly is possible,'' says Tom
Starmer of Syracuse University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Starmer's colleagues Scott Rogers and John Castello had earlier
found ToMV in clouds and fog. The virus can survive in such
environments because it belongs to a family with particularly tough
protein coats. ''Since it's widespread, moves in the atmosphere and
is very stable, we deduced that we would find it in the Arctic
ice,'' says Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   So under sterile conditions, the researchers examined four cores
containing ice between 500 and 140,000 years old from three sites
in Greenland. To prevent contamination, they first disinfected the
outside of each core using ultraviolet light, then searched the
inner core for RNA from the tomato pathogen using the polymerase
chain reaction. Sure enough, the telltale RNA was present. What's
more, sequencing revealed 15 strains of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The frozen viruses were probably still infectious. The
polymerase chain reaction destroys organisms as it amplifies their
genetic material, so the researchers can't be sure the viruses had
retained the protein coats that help them invade cells. But
Castello says they probably needed their coats to survive for
hundreds of years in the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The team says that a brief rise in temperature could unleash the
entombed viruses. ''The ice is melting constantly around the
poles,'' says Rogers. If released, they could cause outbreaks of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've got these things lying in the ice for a thousand
years or more and their usual host has not had to deal with them,
this may be a source of epidemics,'' says Alvin Smith, a virologist
at Oregon State University in Corvallis. He has already found
evidence that caliciviruses, which can cause diarrhea, periodically
re-emerge from the oceans, causing new infections.
</P>
<P>
   The findings may answer some puzzling questions, Smith adds.
Viruses evolve fast, continually changing their protein coats. Yet
identical caliciviruses have appeared at 20-year intervals on
opposite sides of the United States, he says. ''How did these
viruses stay the same for so long? Where have they been hanging
out?'' He thinks they might have spent years trapped in polar ice
before re-emerging to strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Such exchanges could put a spanner in the works of viral
evolution studies. Castello says that instead of representing the
endpoint of steady evolution, modern populations of viruses might
be a complex mishmash of highly evolved ones and others that have
taken a holiday from evolution in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps they are actually ancient populations that have been
recycled over and over again,'' he says. ''How can you do
evolutionary studies if that's true?''
</P>
<P>
   The New York team plans to use other techniques to find out if
viruses in other cores are still viable. As well as Arctic ice,
they will look at ice from Antarctica that is up to 400,000 years
old.Matt Walker

   Frequent use of aerosols and air fresheners in the home may make
babies and pregnant women ill. British researchers say they have
found evidence that chemicals in these products could be linked to
headaches and depression in mothers, and to ear infections and
diarrhea in babies.
</P>
<P>
   Aerosols and air fresheners contain dozens of volatile organic
compounds such as xylene, ketones and aldehydes, which can be toxic
in high doses. Britain is the biggest producer and user of aerosols
in Europe, with the average British household buying 36 aerosol
spray cans a year, including deodorants, hair sprays and furniture
polish.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 14,000 pregnant women, epidemiologists at the
University of Bristol found that those who used aerosols and air
fresheners most days suffered 25 percent more headaches than those
who used them less than once a week. There was also a 19 percent
increase in postnatal depression among women who frequently used
air fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was presented at an international conference on
indoor air pollution in Edinburgh last month, found that babies
under six months old who were exposed on most days to air
fresheners had 30 percent more ear infections than those exposed
less than once a week. There was also a 22 percent increase in
diarrhea among babies frequently exposed to aerosols.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that ''caution should be advised'' on the
use of aerosols or air fresheners more than once a week. ''We have
found a possible causal link and it needs further investigation,''
says one of the authors, Jean Golding of Bristol University's
Division of Child Health.
</P>
<P>
   The biological mechanisms by which the chemicals may make people
more susceptible to diseases still need to be worked out. However,
experiments on mice suggest that the chemicals in air fresheners
may weaken the body's defenses by making the skin more permeable.
</P>
<P>
   Golding's findings are supported by work done at the
government's Building Research Establishment in Watford. The BRE
discovered that the annual average level of volatile organic
compounds in 170 of the homes in the Bristol study was 415
micrograms per cubic meter of air, some of which came from aerosols
and air fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is below the level at which health effects would
normally be expected, Jeff Llewellyn of the BRE points out that
some people could be exposed to much higher doses for short
periods. The suggestion that this may cause headaches and other
symptoms is plausible, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the United States, also reported at the Edinburgh
conference, claimed that mice exposed to volatile organic compounds
from a solid air freshener experienced breathing difficulties.
Rosalind Anderson from Anderson Laboratories, a private research
facility in Vermont, believes that humans could be similarly
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The British Aerosol Manufacturers' Association said last week
that it was not aware of the Bristol study. ''However, BAMA is
always interested in any research or findings concerning the use of
aerosols,'' added a spokeswoman, ''and will look into this
matter.''

 &HT;    NEW FBI TAPES DESCRIBES USE OF GAS GRENADES AT WACO
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI released a new videotape Friday in which a
federal agent describes the use of incendiary tear gas grenades
during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the military gas did not penetrate that, uh, bunker
where the bus was,'' reports Charlie One, an agent inside a Bradley
fighting vehicle. ``It bounced off.''
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of the conversation on the infrared videotape
provides graphic evidence of what federal officials had denied for
six years until recently _ that military-issue CS tear gas, which
uses an incendiary device to disperse the contents, was used in the
April 19, 1993, assault that ended with the deaths of Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers, including 21
children.
</P>
<P>
   The new transcript also supports the FBI's assertion that the
grenades hit a bunker consisting of concrete poured around a buried
bus that was well away from the wooden compound where the Branch
Davidians died in the blaze that erupted several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape and transcript were released shortly after
Attorney General Janet Reno said that she and FBI Director Louis
Freeh were very close to naming an independent investigator into
the FBI's handling of the Waco matter.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also denied that any rift had formed between her and Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two weeks, I, along with many Americans, have
been troubled, very troubled over what has transpired,'' said Reno.
``But Director Freeh and I are dedicated to finding the truth in
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the FBI had released an initial videotape in which
permission to fire grenades is given by Richard M. Rogers, the
assistant special FBI agent in charge of the hostage rescue team.
On the second tape, the report comes back at 8:08 a.m. that the
first shot did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The agents then discuss moving into a better position. However,
the audio portion of the videotape ends before any further mention
of attempts to use the CS canisters, which can be shot from an M-79
grenade launcher. The FBI said the audio recording was stopped at
the request of a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In her weekly meeting with reporters, Reno refused to comment on
reports that two highly respected former Republican senators, John
Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, are under
consideration to head the new Waco probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure that any individual has no conflicts, would
be well-received and has the time to handle the task in an
appropriate manner,'' said Reno. ``That is a lot to ask of any
individual, and it is appropriate to let any individual have the
time to think it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports of a rift between the Justice Department and
FBI, the attorney general said reports that U.S. marshals were
dispatched to seize Waco documents from FBI headquarters as a
public rebuke for the agency were ``just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said her relationship with Freeh ``is one of the best
relationships that people can have in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we seek the truth, it's very important that people don't
play one off against another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno made it clear that her orders were that no incendiary
devices were to be used in the Waco operation period _ making no
allowances for the concrete bunker that the FBI has admitted
hitting with the M-651 CS grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I asked for were assurances _ and I received assurances _
that we would not use incendiary devices or pyrotechnic means of
delivering incendiary devices,'' said Reno. ``And I made no
distinction between any part of the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the right circumstances, the M-651 CS grenades could cause
a fire, said Charles Cutshaw, an editor at Jane's Defense
Information Group and a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
   The canisters ``generate CS powder by burning, rather than
exploding,'' explained Cutshaw. he metal surface of the grenade
becomes ``hot to touch'' but probably not hot enough to cause a
fire if it landed on a wooden surface such as a table or floor.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``incendiary process involved in generating the
CS'' could ignite ``flammable vapors such as gasoline,'' he said.
``It is akin to striking a match adjacent to the filling neck of a
gasoline tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``We may find that this was not considered
incendiary. Other people indicate it may have been. Let us judge it
with an outside investigator so that we can see the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general maintained that the facts still
indicate that federal agents did not cause the fire at the Branch
Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   Reno sidestepped questions about whether she is angry at being
kept in the dark for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a matter of anger. This is a matter of
getting to the truth. And whatever I am, I am as dedicated as I
possibly can be to getting to the truth,'' said Reno. ``Sometimes
anger obscures the truth and so I try to do so as calmly and as
clearly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would resign, she replied, ``If the truth
shows I've done something wrong, then I will accept the
consequences.''

DAVE HICKEY: EMINENCE TERRIBLE OF THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The physical boundaries of Dave Hickey's world are
clear enough. He lives in a nondescript apartment complex
improbably called Country Club Towers, wedged in a triangle made by
the Las Vegas Country Club, the Las Vegas Convention Center and the
World Trade Center Hotel and Casino, a low-rent gambling hall with
a line of faux Grecian statues in the front.
</P>
<P>
   He has a sunshine-to-neon, skyline-to-mountain view of that
singular slice of the American landscape, the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   But the parameters of Hickey's intellectual universe seem
limitless. His gentle, nicotine-laced drawl drifts effortlessly
from Rembrandt to Norman Rockwell, from Jackson Pollock to ``Perry
Mason,'' from Willie Nelson to Andy Warhol and back around to
Robert Mitchum.
</P>
<P>
   He's a writer who learned to make prose by listening to the
``long, lapidary lines'' of Chet Baker's jazz trumpet, and he's a
former Nashville songwriter and musician who once copied out the
first 50 pages of ``The Great Gatsby'' ``just to see what it looked
like to have good writing come out of your typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 59 years he has owned one art gallery and run another,
been an editor at Art in America and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
played in a band with Janis Joplin, dropped acid, snorted cocaine,
swallowed speed and written short stories about dying old
cowpunchers and mystic young gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as a tenured professor of art criticism and theory at
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, he is a smiling eminence
terrible of the art world, enrapturing admirers with his
impassioned defense of beauty and beauty alone as an inherently
valid way of judging art without the imprimatur of official
authority _ and infuriating all manner of official authority for
roughly the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can kind of divide the art world into those people who
find that art's closest analogy is with literature and those who
find its closest analogy is with music,'' he said one weekday
morning between the plumes of nonstop Marlboro Lights at his dining
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people like myself, who find it to have been with music,
have been radically out of fashion for many years. You know, people
are concerned with `what it means.' I'm much more concerned with
what it does.'' Or as he put it at another point: ``I'm not
interested in the intentions of artists; I'm interested in
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultural world is divided into those people who look at
Raphael as if it's graffiti, and those who look at graffiti as if
it's Raphael, and I prefer the latter,'' he said. ``That is, if I
address pop culture, I try to bring the full equipment of
disciplined criticism. I'm willing to take it seriously. Having
been around both worlds, I really never have found any moral
distinctions. The distinction is the audiences they attract.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has not always won favor with his colleagues in
the rarefied world of art academe, who have derided him as Satan
and worse for questioning the received canonical wisdom of high art
by veering happily into the cul-de-sacs of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Hickey's iconoclasm and the sheer range of his polymath's
perception have endeared him to legions of admirers, who have
helped make his most recent book, ``Air Guitar: Essays on Art and
Democracy'' (Art Issues Press, 1997), a phenomenal success for its
genre, with more than 20,000 copies sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is the smartest person I've ever known,'' said his friend
Christopher Knight, the Los Angeles Times art critic. ``I'll say
that without qualification.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why has he so incensed some peers?
</P>
<P>
   Hickey's critics variously disdain his insistence that pop
culture and high culture equally deserve critical inquiry, take
umbrage at what they see as his unfair attacks on the academic
establishment and admittedly envy his graceful prose style.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the crux of the criticism is that by trumpeting
beauty as a theoretically objective and spontaneous universal gauge
of art, Hickey is a retrograde. Like John Ruskin and other
Victorians, he chooses to overlook the view that beauty may be
merely what the ruling economic and social elites say it is. In the
process, his adversaries argue, he substitutes his own bad-boy
outsider judgments for those of narrow-minded art professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the revival of an abstract notion of beauty, we return
not only to Ruskin but also by implication to the imperialist and
exclusionary logic of cultural value that gave Ruskin and his
contemporaries their social authority as arbiters of taste,'' one
critic, Amelia Jones, wrote in a recent issue of X-tra, a Los
Angeles-based art journal. Ms. Jones, an associate professor of art
history at the University of California, Riverside, and the author
or editor of several books on 20th-century art, called such hubris
unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Similar intellectual debates bubble in fields from law to
philosophy, and as Knight said of the anti-Hickey voices, ``if
Dave's right, they're way wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge academic industry that is predicated on all
kinds of things that Dave opposes and does not believe in, like the
whole politically correct routine of the last 10 years,'' Knight
added. ``That is something that drives Dave crazy, and a lot of his
writing has been about trying to pull the rug out from under those
ideas of academic norms. As Dave says, art is about the specificity
of experience, and governments are about establishing norms which
exclude.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Hickey's latest heresy _ though one endorsed by a roster of
other art heavies _ is his celebratory essay on Norman Rockwell in
the catalog for an exhibition of the artist's work organized by the
Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge in Massachusetts and the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta. It opens at the High on Nov. 6 and is
scheduled to wind up two years later at the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his optimistic essay, ``The Kids Are All Right,'' Hickey
parses Rockwell's ``After the Prom,'' a highly formalized portrait
of teen-agers on a date after World War II. In the canvas a smiling
soda jerk sniffs the girl's gardenia corsage, and a grizzled Air
Force veteran on the next stool casts a wry glance.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey compares Rockwell's skills of composition to those of
artists like Fragonard and David, and he discerns a spirit of
tolerance and permissiveness in pictures more often seen as
confining. He imagines, for instance, the prom couple grown up _
his chronological contemporaries _ ``sitting around the campfire in
some commune in New Mexico trying to recapture the golden glow of
that night at the soda fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing from a theoretical point of view about
Rockwell is that in the history of artists' reputations, artists
gain a kind of public vogue and then they're institutionalized, and
the work goes into museums and it goes into books and the
reputation survives there,'' Hickey said by way of explaining his
own appreciation for ``an exquisite maker of pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Rockwell never achieved that level of
institutionalization, but for 30, 40 years after his prime, he
still remains a creature in the public's imagination, you know,
profoundly influential. The opening scene of every science-fiction
movie in the world is a Rockwell scene. If you look at
`Independence Day' or anything like that, it's like, `Here's Norman
Rockwell and heeeere come the aliens!' Spielberg couldn't exist
without Rockwell.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey's own life has not been Rockwellian. He grew up bouncing
between Texas and California, the son of a man who made his living
setting up distribution warehouses for General Motors but loved to
play jazz saxophone and clarinet. He committed suicide when his son
was 11. His mother was a Marxist economics professor at Texas
Christian University and ``a part-time rapacious entrepreneur'' who
ran a family flower shop.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dave attended 13 grammar schools, left home early and
entered Southern Methodist University in Dallas at age 15, majoring
in engineering ``principally because the engineering school was
across the street from the Kappa Sig house and it was extremely
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning an undergraduate degree in English from Texas
Christian, he enrolled as a graduate student in linguistics at the
University of Texas at Austin for much of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was doing was telling myself that I was a serious
graduate student and what I was really doing was not being
drafted,'' he says now. ``The day that I turned 26 and was
ineligible for the draft, I was totally amazed at the way my
enthusiasm for an academic career seemed to dissolve.'' He and his
first wife, Mary Jane Taylor, opened a gallery in Austin called A
Clean Well-Lighted Place, representing young contemporary artists.
He eventually wound up in Manhattan, managing the Reese Palley
Gallery in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago _ many late nights, freelance articles and a
couple of relationships later _ he traded his vagabond life for
health insurance as a faculty member at Nevada and marriage to
Libby Lumpkin, an art scholar who recently stepped down as curator
of Stephen A. Wynn's new collection at the Bellagio casino and
hotel in Las Vegas. She is to join her husband on the university
faculty next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey says he chose Las Vegas because he could eat at all hours
of the night and he finds release in its lingering frontier air,
describing it gleefully as ``Dodge City built by Jews and
Italians.''
</P>
<P>
   He is less thrilled with academic bureaucracy, acknowledging
that he has been unable to fulfill his dream of having ``some guy
come up to me and say, `Tony Two Fingers Tattaglia, dean of fine
arts!''' Instead, he says, ``Universities are universities.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Hickey does not suffer fools, and for all his
roguish charm in conversation, he leaves little doubt that he would
be hard to live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incredibly interesting person to edit,'' said Gary
Kornblau, his friend and editor at Art Issues. ``I wouldn't call it
easy.'' Hickey says his pet peeve is the ``growing hegemony of the
presumption that there needs to be consensus'' in the world of high
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an art critic is one of the few professions in which one
is actually paid for one's eccentricity, and paid to be
disagreeable,'' he said. ``In other words, if two art critics
agree, there's no real reason for one of them to be there.'' He is
galled by the idea ``that there's a right-thinking world in art,''
adding, ``I mean, most of us get into art to get out of that
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a public servant. The presumption that you're a public
servant and therefore you have certain obligations _ I mean, I'm an
art critic, you know. I certainly strive to be elusive. And in a
sense, the fact that you're doing this article means that my
effectiveness is waning, simply because the curve has caught up
with me.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: AN ELITE TO LIVE UP TO AND TO LIVE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anointed as this year's ``cultural capital'' by the European
Union, the East German town of Weimar is basking not only in the
accomplishments of such estimable sons as Goethe, Schiller and Bach
but also in the avant-garde of the golden '20s: Walter Gropius'
Bauhaus, the paintings of Oskar Kokoschka and Max Beckmann and the
drawings of George Grosz, the collaborations of Kurt Weill and
Bertolt Brecht, and the theatrical excitement generated by Erwin
Piscator and Max Reinhardt and movies like ``The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari'' and ``The Blue Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Weimar wants to live up to the artistic reputation of
that decade's cultural elite, it may also have to live down their
politics. For even while the young and frail German republic
struggled to find a road between the former autocracy and looming
fascism, many of Germany's foremost artists and intellectuals
displayed indifference or outright antipathy to the embattled
democrats.
</P>
<P>
   True, few avant-gardists joined the resurgent nationalist forces
in the party-political battles of the 1920s that culminated in the
victory of Nazism, but not many became champions of the republic
either.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with what they viewed as bourgeois squabbling, artists
failed to see how much their own freedom to experiment owed to the
unexhilarating operations of democracy. Even Thomas Mann, who in
time became a supporter of democracy, had expressed a widely shared
German scorn for democratic arrangements in his 1916 book
``Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man.''
</P>
<P>
   What became known as Weimar culture (although Berlin and Munich
were its centers) had its roots in turn-of-the-century
Expressionism, which one student of the movement summed up as ``a
mood of revolutionary discontent and radical rejection of bourgeois
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to military defeat, economic distress and political
disarray, practically all the new fashions in cultural life after
World War I, whether of the left or the right, were radical. The
historian Hans Kohn summed up their mood: ``They despised and
rejected the middle road, reasonableness and common sense, the
live-and-let-live, the practical art of politics, the foundation of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Expressionist activists became convinced supporters
of the republic, and some became determined enemies. Grosz was at
his cruelest in his cartoons of politicians, and the popular
novelist Franz Werfel had only contempt for politics and
politicians. He wrote, ``The politician looks at life coldly; the
evil of power has triumphed over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brecht, that champion of a Marxist ideal, called for violence to
destroy middle-class politicking. A chorus in one play exhorts,
``Submerge in the filth, embrace the butcher, but change the world:
it needs it.'' The British historian A.J. Ryder called Brecht ``a
literary Stalinist'' who was guilty of the ``trahison des clercs,''
the apostasy of intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Others were equally dismissive of bourgeois politics, with dire
consequences. Ryder brought this indictment against them: ``In
their wholesale rejection of Weimar Germany as an inadequate
society, in jeering where they might have helped, such critics
unwittingly contributed to the tragedy which engulfed both it and
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The avant-garde's disdain for democracy spilled over into scorn
for the mass audience. It was reciprocated. Whether their creators
called themselves Expressionists or objectivists or just
modernists, their works found limited appeal. Eberhard Kolb, a
chronicler of Weimar, drew attention to the ``scarcely bridgeable
gap between the artistic achievement of the avant-garde and the
taste and mentality of a large part of the population, middle-class
and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an unfamiliar phenomenon, but in Germany cultural divisions
reflected political divisions. What artists viewed as progress was
seen by many of their countrymen as an insult to tradition. And the
blame was laid on the Weimar democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In his study of Weimar culture, Peter Gay wrote, ``While not all
Expressionists loved Weimar, the enemies of Weimar hated all
Expressionists.''
</P>
<P>
   So the avant-garde remained largely aloof from the critical
decade-long conflict between socialists and right-wingers for
political power. While conservative writers became a major force
against the democratic republic (though drawing the line at
Hitler), no equivalent pro-republican intellectual force made
itself felt.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sethe, a writer who was sympathetic to the beset democratic
politicians at the time, lamented: ``They could have used help. All
they got was scorn and laughter.'' The artistic achievement of
Weimar's best and brightest was a handmaiden to political disaster.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haime Kedmi, the owner of the downtown street-wear
store Transit, eyed his chaotic display of pink gel-soled running
shoes, aerodynamic high-tops and aquatic socks. Gingerly he
selected a Nike Air Lava Dome sneaker with a bright orange swoosh
and a rounded, reinforced toe that gave it the look of a corrective
shoe. ``Aren't they hideous?'' he said proudly. ``They're one of
our most popular models.''
</P>
<P>
   Kedmi has built a reputation with customers of athletic-inspired
street wear for stocking styles that are relentlessly up-to-date.
To maintain his edge, Kedmi, 31, sweet-talks manufacturers into
Federal Expressing shipments so that he can get the product on the
shelves three days before his competitors. Another method is to buy
what the rest of America considers ugly. ``If none of the other
stores carry the style,'' Kedmi reasons, ``then that makes it
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcity has long made some fashion desirable. Just ask the
women who add their names to waiting lists for $3,000 embroidered
Gucci jeans or suede handbags from Prada for $1,140.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest for few-of-a-kind fashion is no longer limited to
high-priced designer wares. It has trickled down from Madison
Avenue to neighborhoods below Houston Street, and in the outer
boroughs, where fans of street wear chase limited-circulation goods
from mass brands like Nike, Adidas and Seiko, or from underground
labels like Maharishi, Under Cover and A Bathing Ape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, if you could afford it, it was cool,'' Jason
Farrer, fashion director of Spin magazine, said. ``Now, if you can
find it, it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly describes Eric Kvatek, a New York photographer
who drove to the Midwest, posing as a track coach on visits to
sporting goods stores, all so he could buy discontinued sneakers
that would seem rare back home. ``The funniest part was I don't
look anything like a track coach,'' said Kvatek, 27, who has
sideburns, tattoos and generally wears old (read: vintage) Levi's.
``Plus I don't know anything about track so I'd make up names of
races like `the 6-60' or `the 10-40.' '' His pose generally worked,
and he returned with rare Nike Air Max 95 sneakers bought for $150.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Altschul, an MTV news anchor, spent weeks scouring
downtown Manhattan for Seiko's Pulsar Spoon watch last year before
it became widely available. When she located one at a store on
lower Broadway, she called the distributor and ordered more for her
closest friends. ``It's cheating if you can just spend a lot of
money or ask your stylist,'' she said. ``It's much more exciting to
track down the object of desire yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because an item is super-casual street wear _ sneakers, a
hoodie, baggy pants _ doesn't mean it will ultimately be low cost.
Ramon Yang, 28, a magazine art director, had to go all the way to
London to find a hooded jacket with a camouflage pattern of apes
from the obscure Japanese label A Bathing Ape. ``I paid $700 for it
at a store called Hit and Run,'' said Yang, who describes his style
as ``upwardly street,'' a mix of Gucci pants and artist-designed
T-shirts. ``But it was worth it because all my friends wanted it,
and I got there first.''
</P>
<P>
   The subculture that pursues obscure street fashion spills onto
the Web, where sites like Sneaker-Nation.com and Fashionthreads.com
bring together fanatics who buy, sell and chat. Sneaker-Nation
anoints a ``Sneaker Freak of the Week'' based on answers to
questions like, ``How many sneakers do you own?'' (15 pairs seems
average) and ``How do you clean your sneaks?'' (Sample answer:
``With toothbrush, soap and water''), and an electronic bulletin
board that doubles as a personals column. (One posting reads:
``London bloke seeks girl whose Nikes show off her bare ankles.'')
</P>
<P>
   The potential market for street wear that is hard to find _ or
whose scarcity has been intentionally created _ is increasingly
recognized by global brands like Nike and Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, which owns Christian Dior and
Givenchy, is backing Boo.com, a new E-commerce site that will sell
hip athletic wear in markets where it has previously been scarce.
The idea is to offer sneakers with a cult following in New York,
like Converse low-cut basketball shoes, to customers in London, and
similarly, to make available to Americans brands like Britain's
Fred Perry, known for preppy polo shirts, which have been popping
up on the backs of rock groups like Oasis and Stereophonics. Even
before the Web site is up, hype about it has generated articles in
Vogue and Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, street-fashion fanatics are a tiny group of
consumers. But many companies recognize the value of courting them.
The anointment by the most style-savvy consumers of a sneaker or a
pants style ripples outward, setting trends for the masses. Nike,
which makes as many as 1,000 footwear styles worldwide in any given
season (there are three seasons a year), produces some styles in
``limited editions'' for regional markets and specialty stores. In
so doing, a global mass marketer creates an image for itself as a
small, home-grown label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited editions make up less then 5 percent of our total
business, but it's incredibly important to brand building,'' Craig
Zanon, Nike's director of footwear, said. ``It's a way to show the
consumer that we're still willing to do something outside the
mainstream, big-volume business. The consumer today wants to feel
individual, and they want to have something that not everyone else
has, so the limited-edition helps lay the foundation for the rest
of the business.''

<P>
   In street-wear lore, the saga of Nike's Air Max 95 looms large.
To the company _ and to other companies that were paying attention
_ it proved that engineered shortages could work for mass marketers
catering to the fashion whims of the street. The running shoe, with
wavy bands of color and distinctive ridges along the sides, was
released in 1995 in limited numbers. Soon its stylishness and
rarity caused it to turn up in fashion-magazine layouts, on runways
and on the feet of rock stars. Stores sold out and customers
canvassed out-of-the-way outlets and the Internet. (This is the
shoe that Kvatek drove to the Midwest to find.)
</P>
<P>
   Nike executives heard rumblings of the shoe's hipness, but
refused to satisfy the demand. It wasn't until last year that they
finally reintroduced the Air Max 95 to select stores. A broader,
mainstream release is planned for this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nike comes upon a trend like the Air Max 95 and it
creates a craze, we're very aware of that and it gives us reason to
smile,'' Dave Mingey, a Nike spokesman, said. ``But at the same
time we can't stop the production presses and say, `Let's remake
this real quick,' until a) we can fit it into the production
schedule, and b) we're sure that the demand is sufficient to make
it a smart business move.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other global fashion and apparel companies trying to woo
whimsical youth, including Puma, Levi's and Tommy Hilfiger, have
followed Nike's example. In the last few years, they've all begun
to offer limited editions to satisfy the cravings of young
consumers turned off by mass-market goods. ``It's really weird,''
said Una Hayes, who has advised companies like Motorola, Addidas
and Coca-Cola on advertising strategy. ``Suddenly `real' has come
to mean that only a select few people have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's, which once ruled the blue jeans world by selling a
single style, the classic 501, to almost every customer, has seen
its market share erode in the 1990s as the consumer mind-set has
changed. To regain momentum, Levi's in the last 18 months created
four new lines _ Red Tab, Dark Denim, Mod Squad and Work Wear _
that were designated ``rocket releases,'' meaning that only limited
numbers of jeans appeared on store shelves, for three to five
months. The strategy worked, the company says, and more limited
releases are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend toward limited editions started about four years
ago,'' said Devon Burt, Levi's creative director, who was hired
away from Nike. ``Consumers were becoming more educated and
diverse, which meant a big company like Levi's could no longer be
one thing to everybody. We had to start looking at ways to offer
more individual-type products.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the advertising campaign for a line of Levi's tied to the
film ``The Mod Squad'' earlier this year was meant to suggest the
clothes were as limited as rare artist prints. On billboards, the
film's star, Claire Danes, wore the new jeans while staring out
intently above the number 1/150.
</P>
<P>
   With mass marketers borrowing the aura of small, limited-run
labels, where does that leave true independent street-style lines?
Some are pursuing anti-marketing strategies, like refusing to
advertise or to expand distribution. The goal is to keep the brand
from becoming overexposed and, like a once-hot night club, passe.
</P>
<P>
   Maharishi, a London-based label known for its Asian- and
military-inspired cargo pants, some with colorful embroidery on the
leg, has inspired a cult following. But even as the line attracts
imitators by the score, Hardy Blechman, the company's founder and
designer, says he regularly rejects offers from outside investors
to capitalize on the craze and grow the business. Instead, he
prefers to be carried by a few select stores like Nylon Squid in
Manhattan and Fred Segal in Los Angeles. ``These businessmen write
me letters back and say, `Are you crazy?' '' Blechman said. ``But
part of the reason people like Maharishi is because of the vibe. No
one in our company is involved for the cash, and the customers can
sense that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to defending street credibility, no one outdoes
Japan's Bathing Ape, which makes T-shirts, cargo pants and jackets
with imagery inspired by the film ``Planet of the Apes.'' The label
has a rabid following in Tokyo and hipster circles in New York, Los
Angeles and London, but is almost impossible to buy.
</P>
<P>
   David Marx, an American college student who worked at a Tokyo
fashion magazine in the summer of 1998, told of a bizarre shopping
trip to buy a simple $48 T-shirt. Through connections, he was
directed to a sign-less store appropriately known as Nowhere, in
the trendy Harajuku shopping district. He waited in a line for
two-and-a-half hours, monitored by security guards in Bathing Ape
scout uniforms. Finally he was able to buy a shirt with an ape and
the company's motto, ``Ape Shall Never Kill Ape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite attempt to confuse the public,'' said Marx,
20, who set up an unofficial Bathing Ape Web site when he returned
to Harvard for his junior year. He posts updates on where to find
Bathing Ape clothing, buying tips and explanations like ``Nigo is
the President and Director of the label, but it is unclear whether
he actually designs any of the clothes.'' Marx said, ``It's like
this secret society and there's not that much info about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only U.S. store with the line is Recon on Eldridge Street on
the Lower East Side, which is owned by the longtime graffiti artist
Futura 2000, who designs graphics for the label. ``It's not about
selling as much as you can,'' Futura 2000 said. ``If an item gets
popular you make hundreds not thousands. Customers should like the
way you do business. They shouldn't be thinking, `Look at these
guys they're making a killing off something that's supposed to be
underground.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, A Bathing Ape does no advertising. When a
photographer shooting for The New York Times sought to photograph a
T-shirt, store personnel turned him down. Apparently, a picture in
The Times would make the label seem mainstream. When the
photographer tried to buy a shirt, he was refused.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Krell, international fashion director of Japanese Vogue in
Tokyo, finds that the anti-commercialism practiced by small, trendy
labels that close their doors except to a select few is
ill-conceived. ``It's no different than buying Guy Laroche,'' he
said. ``Once you prohibit people, you become the very thing that
the underground is supposed to detest, and that's elitism.''

IT MAY BE A HEAVY BOOK, BUT IT SURE IS A PAGE TURNER 
</HEADLINE>

 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thump! Ouch! Er, sorry. I dropped my September Vogue. I know, I
know. Jokes about the magazine's increasing heft are beyond cliche,
but this year attention must be paid, for the thing is truly
enormous. Four pounds and some 700 pages of Lincolns and Apples and
BMWs, of clothes made of weird animal skins like Chinese genet and
pony skin and goat, and lots of really cheesy makeup (frosted pink
eye shadow on Cindy Crawford).
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets any bigger,'' said my friend Jonathan, ``it's going
to split like a stock.'' Or just split wide open. To say that I am
daunted by the prospect of blithely sitting down and reading the
magazine cover to cover is to toy cruelly with understatement. I am
pulled up, stopped short, frozen. Isn't everybody?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some Vogue readers spend eight hours with it,''
said Harry Heller, the chairman of the Heller Research Group, a
marketing and public-opinion company that has done work for Conde
Nast, Vogue's publisher. ``These people take off their shoes, lie
down in a special place. It's their own personal time that they
want to use to relate to it. Different readers enter their
relationship in different ways. No one style dominates with the
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller's respondents seem to be a take-charge bunch. Good luck
to them, I say. But I need help this year sorting through the
volumes of fashion titles that seem to be metastasizing wildly. So
I phoned a few professionals _ some media studies folks, some
comparative lit people, expert readers all _ to see if they could
make sense of the weightiest issues of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, W
and Elle.
</P>
<P>
   Many were sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roland Barthes would call these magazines `an empire of
signs,' and I agree that the lack of narrative can be
decentering,'' Krin Gabbard said soothingly. Gabbard is a professor
of comparative literature at the State University at Stony Brook,
N.Y. ``How to read them? H-m-m-m. Most academics these days are
practicing a little decontructionist thinking. You could just say,
`Here is this clutter' _ and I'm not sure that clutter isn't the
point, this bunch of stuff that corporations want you to buy, buy,
buy _ or `Here is this pleasure, this yumminess,' that allows you
to explore your own femininity and your own role in the culture.
That's what Amy Aronson did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aronson, Gabbard's colleague, wrote her master's thesis on
the history of women's magazines. ``What I tried to do was to get a
sense of a magazine's agenda through the points of conflict,'' she
said. ``This allows us to see the range of thinking the magazine is
trying to encourage.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller had said that Vogue readers didn't differentiate much
between the editorial and the ads. Neither did Ms. Aronson in her
examination of pre-20th-century magazines. Heck, I thought, I'm not
even going to bother with the editorial pages. Ms. Aronson
encouraged a closer reading of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generally assumed that all advertising is detrimental or
exploitative,'' she said, ``or at least univocal. That's just not
true, and it never has been true.''
</P>
<P>
   I flicked open the magazine. The ads were positively throbbing
with conflict. I found a little hunter/prey opposition between two
of them, one for St. John, a conservative clothing line, that
showed a woman in a hacking jacket in a Land Rover barreling along
the Serengeti, or some place like it (on a preceding page she's
curled up with a leopard), and one for Vassarette underwear, which
consisted of a photograph of a model naked except for her leopard
print underpants and a net (as in a zoo net). So maybe the
conversation here is: you are looking for the kitty and then _
badabing _ you are the kitty. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Kipnis teaches media studies at Northwestern University.
She is also the author of ``Bound and Gagged: Pornography and the
Politics of Fantasy in America'' (Duke University Press, 1999).
``My favorite approach might be a psychoanalytic one, taking off
from Louise Kaplan's `Female Perversions,''' she said. ``Louise
Kaplan talked about something she called homovestism, which uses
clothing to emphasize the stereotypical behaviors associated with
particular styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kipnis makes reading fun, because in her view all fashion is
transgressive. Just look at the Louis Vuitton ad in W, which
pictures a stiletto-shod foot mashing the back of some guy's hand.
Certainly it appears to be the defining principle of every Gucci ad
(have you noticed the pierced fingernails?). In any case it's
awfully enjoyable to look at something as benign and mainstream as
a billowing red Ralph Lauren skirt in Harper's Bazaar and consider
it drag.
</P>
<P>
   (Another question: Can someone explain to me why Esther Canadas
has a what looks like a white fitted sheet hanging from her
shoulders in Vogue's DKNY ads?)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kipnis added another thought: ``My own theory would be
something about fashion and fantasy. Fashion allows you to
fantasize different identities, to have a kind of mobility:
obviously gender mobility but also things like age mobility, Gen X
to geriatric.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kipnis proffered analyses like after-dinner mints, including
a tasty Marxist interpretation, which argues that fashion ads play
off commodity fetishes, a result of people's own alienation from
the products of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   An ad for Movado supports this view: a woman in a white bathing
suit sits in lotus position on a pool of water, her back to the
reader, before an SUV-size diamond-edged watch. Get it? Less
heavy-handed are the single-image ads that show objects of desire
but no people at all: A (breathless pause) handbag, from Dooney &AMP;
Bourke. A ... ring, from Cartier. An ... eyeshadow, from Clinique.
And so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion ads can be so monolithic,'' said Mark Crispin Miller,
a professor of media studies at New York University and a real
sport: Miller called me from his honeymoon vacation on Shelter
Island. ``It's a fantasy of perfect affluence,'' he said. ``The
only thing you contemplate is yourself at peace. And of course, you
know you're being looked at. So it's a fantasy of perfect
narcissism. It is very appealing!''
</P>
<P>
   What a relieving thought! I'm going to forget about points of
opposition and metamorphosing identities. I've gone beyond
window-shopping, or browsing. I'm no longer concerned with
``keeping up.'' I am at peace, like the sleeping nude woman in the
Concord watch ad on the absolute last page of Vogue. This is
because I have made it to the absolute last page, the back cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be late,'' the ad reads. ``Time is a luxury.''

FACING 2000, COMPANIES STOCK UP ON MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   That is a likely mantra for the next four months, as the
abstraction that has been Year 2000 becomes increasingly real.
</P>
<P>
   Many people may be postponing their preparations for the end of
the century. But this summer, companies have been busy provisioning
themselves at the money store.
</P>
<P>
   Including initial public offerings, common stock issuance
between June and the end of August was up 27 percent in dollar
terms from the corresponding period last year, according to Thomson
Financial Securities Data. The amount of debt raised in the last
three months is down a bit from a year ago, but the number of
issuers is up nearly 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the next couple of months, chances are that will still be
lots of money-raisers in the public markets. After that, Wall
Street expects demand to dry up until sometime after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have had an effect on financial markets, and
will for the balance of the year. Thomas M. Likovich, managing
director and head of United States high-grade credit trading at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., took some time last week to chat about them.
Here are excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why have companies been so active in raising money through
debt and equity offerings? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a decent amount of uncertainty about what is going
to happen at year-end, and while we at Merrill Lynch are confident,
no one is certain. So it is prudent to minimize the risk, and come
to market sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing now, companies are hedging against the potential of a
lack of liquidity for financings at year-end. If the liquidity
isn't there, that could make terms quite punitive. With the
millennium coming, satisfying credit and equity needs before
year-end is probably a smart thing to do. We have seen quite a bit
of supply come to market over the last couple of months. More will
be coming over the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of potential horror stories are they trying to
avoid? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a lot of different scenarios out there, the worst
being that there is absolutely no liquidity in the system at all.
</P>
<P>
   I could see a scenario, unlikely though it may be, where in
December a country announces they may have problems with their
infrastructure due to Y2K. That sort of an announcement might make
people concerned about whether that sort of a shoe could fall over
here.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are not suggesting this is going to happen. But it is
prudent to think out all possible scenarios and be prepared for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, we will be getting more and more positive reports
that corporations, countries and utilities are in very good shape.
The more positive the news is, the greater the confidence in both
the equity and fixed-income markets will be. I think that is the
likely scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have there been any other factors influencing this decision
to come to market early? Specifically, has the Fed's decision to
raise short-term rates quickened the pace?
</P>
<P>
   A. Every corporate treasurer has his or her own perspective on
what the Fed might or might not do. But I don't see any evidence
that people are trying to come through the door to get ahead of
further rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There have been a number of market participants who have said
the heavy issuance of new bonds has put upward pressure on rates,
apart from the Fed's actions this year. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A. The environment has not been terribly friendly for issuers
over the last six weeks to two months. It is more expensive to
issue debt now than it was two months ago, and the increase in the
credit spread is due almost exclusively to the increase of supply.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have moved up because of what the Fed has done
already. But due to the heavy supply, rates are one-quarter to
one-half a percentage point higher than they would have been
otherwise. The supply has had a material impact.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If debt issuance remains heavy, all other things being equal,
will there continue to be upward pressure on interest rates for the
next couple of months? And will rates trend lower after that?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is possible that market interest rates will go up. But we
know the supply of new issues will start to slow as the fourth
quarter progresses. That bodes well for a much better technical
picture as we go forward.
</P>
<P>
   I think a large segment of investors have raised more cash than
normal. As we go through year-end, a lot of that cash will be
converted into new investments.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What stance should individual investors adopt to take
advantage of such anomalies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Depending on what happens, if the market does cheapen
significantly it could represent a pretty good opportunity. There
were a number of people who took advantage of the opportunities
created by the financial crisis in the fall of 1998.

STANFORD, BERKELEY CONTEST ISN'T THE ONLY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know what the problem is, don't you? You
look at the Stanford football schedule, you see a bright shiny
Saturday just aching for your presence, you decide you want tickets
and you dial ... 1-800-BEAT-CAL.
</P>
<P>
   You know what the problem is, don't you? You're sitting at home,
waiting out the commercials between segments of ``Loveline,'' and
you see a clever little ad about the defensive stars at the
University of California at Berkeley wrecking a car, and as they
explain to you how good they're going to be, you see the last shot
... a bit of broken glass and a car air freshener shaped like ...
the Stanford Tree.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you do see what the problem is. UC-Berkeley plays one game,
Stanford. Stanford plays one game, UC-Berkeley. The rest of the
schedule is there just to fulfill contractual obligations. Or so it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   This point has been raised before _ that by encouraging this
Big-Game-Is-The-Only-Game approach, UC-Berkeley and Stanford have
reduced their football programs in the eyes of their fans into a
one-Saturday season.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, will come as a great shock to the coaches and
players who have been preparing for their other 10 games with equal
fervor. But the declining crowds and diminishing interest through
the bulk of the '90s tell the tale too well. Inside the football
offices of Tom Holmoe and Tyrone Willingham, they all matter.
Outside, one matters a lot more than all the others.
</P>
<P>
   The maddening thing is that many UC-Berkeley and Stanford
supporters have no problem with this. The Big Game provides a
natural fallback position that allows them to ignore the 10-game
exhibition season. They have come to expect that the season should
run this way, so the idea of aiming higher seems, well,
undignified.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be the only way to endure the time until the
basketball season begins. After all, Stanford ranks eighth in the
conference in winning percentage in the '90s (47-44-2, .505), and
UC-Berkeley ninth (51-52-1, .490). Not only that, there are only 15
teams in the entire country that have waited longer for a
conference title than Stanford (1971), and only three longer than
UC-Berkeley (we're throwing out Stanford's first-place conference
tie in '92 and Berkeley's in '75 because if you didn't go to the
Rose Bowl you didn't win).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the fans have at least some reason to inflate
the Big Game to 16 times its normal size. On the other hand, to
beat UC-Berkeley is to be eighth, to beat Stanford is to be
seventh. If you put it that way in an ad campaign, you'll be lucky
if the team shows up.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of alleged parity in college football, there's
nothing wrong with aiming the customers' sights a little higher
than Week 11. There are three ways to do this.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cheat. You know, white-out the transcripts, breeze 'em
through classes, hire Jan Gangelhoff, pay off the cops. It hasn't
really been tried to any great extent at either school, so the
element of surprise will work heavily in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   2. Throw immense amounts of money into recruiting, and send the
admissions office to the Sydney Olympics free of charge. It isn't
as though the school presidents are eating macaroni and cheese,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   3. Change the phone number and the ad campaign. I mean,
1-800-BEAT-CAL ... is that what made Stanford the institution it
is? And the Stanford artifact among the broken glass ... did
UC-Berkeley become a great university by saying, ``Harvard,
Schmarvard, what about those slugs down the road?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it isn't as though the really top-flight football
schools don't have rivals. Florida State's goals are not ``1. Beat
Florida, 2. Win national title.'' It's really a matter of
prioritizing a marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the phone number. It's a couple of hundred bucks to the
phone company, maybe a grand or two changing the stationery, but
something other than BEAT CAL is clearly called for. Say,
1-800-BRAINYS, or 1-800-BIG-CASH, or 1-800-BUY-STUF, or even
1-800-WASTE-'EM. The opponent is no longer specific but generic,
and the accent is on what Stanford does best _ think, and spend.
</P>
<P>
   For two, the ads. If UC-Berkeley must have its best defenders
standing amid automobile wreckage, why not a smoking headset that
reads ``Coach Snyder?'' Maybe a dented fender with a ``Go Bruins''
bumper sticker, or even a rearview mirror with a Trojan on a horse
that reads, ``Objects May Be Closer Than They Appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this may not do much to change the fortunes of the Golden
Bears and Cardinal. That, they'll have to do themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But a change in outward focus may remind folks that there's a
calendar out there with 364 squares on it besides Nov. 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When battle-weary Odysseus thinks of Troy, Homer tells us,
``sometimes hot tears come, and I revel in them, or stop before the
surfeit makes me shiver.'' There is an unexpected, sensuous
pleasure to be found in tears. The Romanian writer E.M. Cioran
called tears ``music in material form.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also unexpected mystery in them. Tears are the marks of
saints (St. Francis of Assisi was said to have been blinded from
weeping) and sinners (``You're good, sister,'' Bogart sardonically
tells the tearful Mary Astor in ``The Maltese Falcon.'' ``Very
good.''). They seem to challenge some gender stereotypes (Norman
Schwarzkopf publicly wept; so did Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and
Babe Ruth) and reinforce others (several studies have shown that
American women cry four or five times as often as men). Tears have
been treated as aphrodisiacs, sacraments, curses.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is not dissolved by Tom Lutz's unusual new book,
``Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears,'' but that is
part of his point. An English professor at the University of Iowa,
Lutz is almost weak-kneed from the sheer immensity of the subject
and its stubborn resistance to a grand schema. Tears are shed in
varied response to beauty, horror, or a mite of dust. And Lutz's
accumulation of detail is extraordinary, with a bibliography
ranging from Aeschylus to the Journal of Genetic Psychology. We
learn that crocodiles weep because their lachrymal ducts are
squeezed as they open their jaws wide to swallow a victim; that the
chemical composition of emotional tears differs from that of tears
produced in response to eye irritation; that at birth most babies
cry at a pitch of C or C-sharp; that the average American cries
three or four times a month for five minutes at a stretch; that
there are diseases that cause incessant crying and diseases that
prevent tears from forming at all.
</P>
<P>
   And while the detail is often left to accumulate on its own _
the book is flawed by the lack of a strong central argument _ that
can also seem appropriate to the subject. In Lutz's portrait, tears
are almost defined by their slippery quality, their ability to flow
between categories. Nothing about tears is clear or simple. As Lutz
points out, they even arise out of piquantly mixed emotions: When
fear is combined with desire, or hope with despair. And while tears
seem to be universal expressions of nature _ every body produces
tears; all societies expect weeping at deaths or funerals _ they
are also irrevocably shaped by culture (babies were often silent in
one tribe, in Tierra del Fuego, because adults would scream into
their ears whenever they cried).
</P>
<P>
   It is at that boundary between nature and culture that Lutz
finds his most fertile ground. Tears were once considered a purely
physiological phenomenon, an expression of natural law. One
16th-century British physician called tears ``the brain's thinnest
and most liquid excrement.'' Descartes believed that tears were
created by hot blood meeting the cool vapors in the eye, causing
condensation. There has also been a long tradition, going back to
Aristotle, that the release of tears is a natural response to a
crisis: crying is cathartic, both physiologically and emotionally.
Some recent research even suggests that tears contain chemicals
that cause depression; their expulsion, like the production of
sweat, is a way for the body to maintain its equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   But Lutz argues, ``There is still no hard evidence that tears
are in fact cathartic.'' Instead, much current physiological
research suggests that crying does not occur at an emotional climax
to release tension, but occurs afterward, after the body is already
returning to its normal state. Crying is not a response to crisis;
it is post-crisis. It is part of the restoration. Even portraits of
the crucifixion tend to show those closest to the body in a state
of grim anguish, while the crying is done by those standing apart
and looking away; crying requires distance and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz cites anthropological studies suggesting that this is also
true on a wider scale. People weep at funerals, rites of passage,
weddings, ceremonies of reconciliation _ occasions when social
bonds are being affirmed and restoration is taking place. This may
make crying one of the most important of social acts. Some of
Lutz's examples of crying in popular films suggest that
difficulties with tears is a sign of an ailing social compact. In
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' the children are recognizably
alien because they don't cry. In ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the Tin Man
_ a weeper who lives in isolation and thinks he has no heart _ must
stop himself from crying or he will rust. And in recent political
culture, tears or the lack of them, have taken on an unusual
importance in the careers of Edmund Muskie, Bob Dole and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the influence of tears, in fact, the private and public
are intermingled; nature and culture intertwine. But the greatest
paradox in tears may be that they often seem to be just the
opposite of what they are. They may declare helplessness _ weakness
in the face of death, war, illness, fate _ but as they begin to
flow, they are already carving currents of restoration.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   After drifting erratically for the past several days, Tropical
Storm Dennis will make a more definitive jog to the west toward
North Carolina Saturday as steering winds associated with an
expansive high pressure system off the New England coast start to
blow from the east-southeast. In turn, bands of showers and
thunderstorms will penetrate farther inland across North Carolina
and Virginia. Some rain will also spread northward into the
Delmarva Peninsula and southern New Jersey, with clouds thickening
across Long Island and the lower Hudson River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's strongest winds will extend from northeast North
Carolina to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and the southern
Delmarva Peninsula. Some beach erosion from pounding waves and
coastal flooding are likely. With steering winds around the high
off New England holding steady, Tropical Storm Dennis will likely
drift northward this weekend after making landfall along the North
Carolina Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly rain will fall across parts of the western Dakotas as a
low pressure system rippling northeast along a cold front draws
warm, moist air northward from the central Plains. Isolated but
potent thunderstorms will erupt across parts of Nebraska and Kansas
as the southern end of the cold front lifts very warm surface air.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of moderate to locally heavy rains will develop across
the western Gulf States Saturday as humid air is lifted by a
weakening low pressure system aloft. The sea-breeze front from the
Gulf of Mexico will also incite a few storms.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Making Waves
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes can reshape coastlines. Pounding waves and the
onshore surge of water erode beaches and push sand dunes inland.
The degree of damage depends on the duration and size of the waves,
which are determined by wind speed, duration of onshore winds and
the span of the ocean over which winds blow. This week, Dennis has
stalled off the Carolina coast, directing tropical-storm winds over
a large part of the ocean toward shore, creating large swells.
Though winds have ebbed and swells have decreased in size, many
North Carolina shores have been eroded and reshaped.

much of the country, there's so much work that needs to be done -
finishing that Web page, getting out that legal brief, putting the

<P>
   INDONESIA-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ Indonesia, the world's fourth
most-populous nation, is deep in a crisis of economics, politics
and national identity. Its leaders and institutions have lost much
of their popular standing and even their legitimacy. The forces
that most overtly held Indonesia together _ the unquestioned grip
of a dictator and the harshness of his military _ have retreated
since the forced resignation 15 months ago of President Suharto. A
country so unsure of its unity that it has made oneness an
obsession is being forced to rediscover the logic of its
nationhood. By Seth Nydans.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Washington) _ By many measures,
international arms control seems to be on the verge of unraveling,
if developments in the U.S. Russia, Iraq, Iran and North Korea,
India and Pakistan are any indication. Why, then, are many arms
control advocates echoing the bullish declaration of former CIA
Director Stansfield Turner, `This is the most opportune moment in
past 40 years for nuclear arms control'? By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   LANDMINES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It has been two years since the
death of Princess Diana gave a last, emotional boost to an
international treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines, then being
feverishly negotiated in Oslo. Some say her efforts to draw
attention to mines may be one of her greatest legacies. But what
kind of legacy is it? Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to
ban their use, production and stockpiling, antipersonnel landmines
appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days. By

 &HT;    $1.35 MILLION HELP FROM CLINTON FRIEND SEEN AS UNUSUAL, YET
LEGAL
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's purchase of a $1.7 million
house _ with the help of a mortgage guarantee from his chief
political fund-raiser _ raised a few eyebrows Friday, but
apparently hit no legal snags.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts from past and current administrations concurred
that presidents can accept such help, or even an out-and-out gift,
without limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is given a pass,'' said C. Boyden Gray, who
served as chief counsel for President Bush. ``He can legally accept
almost anything he wants to. That's the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gray added of the Clinton house purchase: ``It's not
something that we would have allowed in the Bush or Reagan
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a special arrangement, the president and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton can afford their new suburban New York Dutch
Colonial house even though they owe at least $5 million to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Their financing plan calls for Terrence McAuliffe, a golfing pal
who headed the president's fund-raising for his re-election in
1996, to deposit $1.35 million into Bankers Trust as collateral for
the mortgage. Only the interest paid would be available to
McAuliffe for the five-year term of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons paid $350,000 from their blind trust as a down
payment and would pay monthly payments after closing, set for
November. At the end of five years they would have to refinance or
pay the balance owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mortgage product offered to other customers,'' said
White House legal office spokesman Jim Kennedy. ``It's not unique.
It's something anyone can obtain.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not just anyone would know a person who could
provide such as favor as McAuliffe has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a personal friend of the president, and he's happy to
help out in this way,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal cleared the Government Ethics Office, which oversees
executive branch conduct. In fact, the office told the White House
that the president was not required to disclose McAuliffe's help
because the collateral was not considered a gift. Under current
law, presidents may accept gifts of any value, but they must
publicly report any that exceed $260 in value.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Miller, a Washington attorney who tracks ethics issues,
said the financing plan raised questions. ``I've never seen
something like this before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on where we stand today, they probably don't have the
credit that would qualify'' for such a mortgage without the
collateral, he said. ``They've got to live somewhere.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With anti-independence militias on a
rampage in East Timor and with its own personnel under threat, the
United Nations said on Friday that it would announce the results of
a referendum on independence from Indonesia earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in New York said the announcement, which had
been expected next week, would be made early on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, voters in this tiny territory were asked whether they
would accept an offer of autonomy within Indonesia, which invaded
East Timor in 1975 and annexed it as its 27th province the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, East Timor would be self-governing except
for external defense, foreign affairs and some aspects of judicial
and financial administration.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President B.J. Habibie said if East Timor rejected
the offer, his government would simply let it go free, after a
generation of separatist guerrilla war in which 200,000 people have
died.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is not binding, however. Technically, it is a
``popular consultation'' that would have to be endorsed by the
Indonesian Parliament at the end of the year. But most analysts
said political realities would circumscribe the Parliament's
ability to reject the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the anarchic situation that has swept parts of the
remote territory of 800,000 people, Indonesia said on Friday that
it was sending additional security forces to try to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting, burning, killing and terror of the ragtag
militia gangs may be beyond the control even of the Indonesian
military that created them this year assurrogate spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are burning everything,'' said one of 54 U.N. officials
who reached the East Timor, capital, Dili, on Friday after having
evacuated the southwestern town of Maliana, which the militias have
taken over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't respect anything,'' said the official, who refused
to give his name. ``They are out of control. They are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and witnesses said that more than 12 East
Timorese had been killed since the referendum. David Wimhurst, a
spokesman for the United Nations in Dili, said that at least four
local U.N. staff members had been killed since Monday and that six
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear to what extent the violence has been centrally
controlled and organized or what its purpose is.

<P>
   Assuming that the militias were the creation of the military,
which has been reluctant to cede its hard-fought battleground, they
may have rampaged beyond the control of their masters, said Jusuf
Wanandi, director of a policy institute, the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   But if the militias had really intended to derail the
referendum, it was notable that they had not taken any high-profile
actions that might have accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   After months of intimidation and violence, the militias fell
suddenly silent on voting day, when they could have been severely
disruptive. Instead, nearly 99 percent of the registered voters
turned out in a largely peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Then the killings and intimidation were redoubled. Although the
atmosphere of threat was intense, important targets like the Dili
Museum, where the ballots were counted, were left untouched. The
United Nations has no armed presence in East Timor, and security is
in the hands of the Indonesian police, who have been utterly
ineffective in stopping the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although foreigners and journalists were targets of the
militias' anger and threats, most of the violence appears to
involve local hatreds over the divisive issue of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke rose on Friday once again in Dili from burning houses in
the largely pro-independence Becora neighborhood, which has been
the target of repeated militia attacks. ``People are running for
their lives,'' a resident told The Associated Press by telephone.
``There is panic. The shooting is coming closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse violence was reported from rural areas, including
reprisals against people who had helped the United Nations conduct
the referendum. Their very participation put them at odds with the
forces that were trying to block it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly an attempt to terrorize them,'' Wimhurst
said. ``We have been defenseless from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maliana, which has been the scene of some of the most brutal
militia violence, the United Nations reported that two of its
drivers were killed overnight and that other staff members were
missing. Thirty-three foreign and local U.N. workers were forced to
spend the night in a police station.

CAMPAIGN TORCH PASSES TO HILLARY CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. _ With more money in the campaign coffer and a new
house under contract, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
returned to Washington on Friday to prepare for their latest quest
_ the first lady's unprecedented candidacy for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, accompanied by daughter Chelsea, ended a 16-day
vacation that saw them mix as much politics as pleasure during
respites on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and Long Island and
Skaneateles in New York.
</P>
<P>
   During their break, it became clear the Clintons had passed the
campaign torch from him to her, and that they will approach her
prospective Senate campaign in the Empire State just as they did
his political career _ as partners.
</P>
<P>
   The president emphasized that partnership during two
fund-raising events late Thursday for the first lady's Senate
exploratory campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his wife's public service during his dozen years as
the governor of Arkansas gave her an understanding of economic
development and that during her years as first lady she as been a
key advocate of health care reform, education and efforts worldwide
to unite people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm heavily biased, but I also have more experience
than most people do in this year,'' Clinton told a group of
contributors gathered under a white tent. ``I have known thousands
and thousands of people in public service. I've never known anybody
with the same combination of ability and experience and compassion
and unrelenting dedication as my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Catherine Gale, a guest, afterward, ``She would make a
great senator.'' But Gale could only flinch when asked if she was a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady chose to vacation in the central New York region
where Republicans outnumber Democrats 2-1. It is just this region
where Hillary Clinton must run well against her likely Republican
opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, if she is to win the
Senate seat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who attended two fund-raisers in Massachusetts
and three in New York for her exploratory campaign, expected to
raise $400,000 during the 16-day vacation. But the final event at a
sports bar called Mulronneys netted $100,000, four times its goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're helping me do is explore the possibility of having
the great honor of representing the people of New York in the
United States Senate,'' she told 400 people crammed into the bar.
``And I want you to know it not only would be a great honor, but I
would take the honor and responsibility very seriously and I would
represent the entire state of New York and all of its people who
live here.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady still has not made her candidacy official.
However, she took a major step, even beyond her campaign rhetoric,
as she and the president signed a contract on a $1.7 million home
in Westchester County, a wealthy suburb of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, a native of Illinois, must be a resident of New
York state on Election Day to be eligible for the Senate. The
Clintons, who have not been property owners since they were
newlyweds, made their home in Arkansas prior to his being elected
to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But all that appears ready to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I have felt so much at home here,'' the first lady
told the bar crowd, promising to return. Indeed, she'll be back in
the state next week, without her husband.
</P>

HITCHCOCK COLLABORATORS REVISIT SITE OF `THE BIRDS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE LAUER   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BODEGA, Calif. _ Revisiting scenes from ``The Birds'' sparked
memories almost four decades old Wednesday for two of Alfred
Hitchcock's key collaborators and a handful of local extras.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boyle, Hitchcock's longtime production designer, remembers a
clever idea that backfired, involving magnets holding stuffed birds
along the edge of the Potter School roof line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was really a good idea, these magnets holding
the birds on the gutters up there,'' Boyle remembered with a
chuckle, peering up at the roof of the building made famous by the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a wind picked up and pushed the birds over, and there
were all these birds hanging upside down. Hitch was pretty upset
about that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, 90 now and still active in the movie industry, and
illustrator Harold Michelson, 79, visited Bodega and Bodega Bay for
a documentary about Boyle's career. The full-length feature, ``Make
It Human,'' by director Daniel Raim should be released in January.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 37 years since Doyle and Michelson walked up and
down the road where some of the most famous footage in movie
history was filmed in 1962. The visit sparked many memories, some
of them having nothing to do with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did Rose Gaffney's struggle with PG&AMP;E turn out?''
Michelsen asked. ``She was just a wonderful bundle of energy, and
she was not going to let anybody push her around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, whose ranch on Bodega Head served as Rod Taylor's house
in the movie, was one of the leaders in a fight against PG&AMP;E's plan
to build a nuclear reactor on Bodega Head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they were serious,'' Boyle said, shaking
his head. ``The San Andreas Fault runs right through there.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E acquiesced and went elsewhere with its reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Other memories spoke of the inexorable passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, look at that tree,'' Boyle said, looking at a young
redwood in front of the former Potter School, now a private home.
``I don't remember there being trees here at all,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Leah Taylor, who lives there now, explained that her
parents planted the redwood in 1966 when they bought the property.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bodega Bay residents who appeared as extras in ``The
Birds'' had lunch with Boyle, Michelsen and the film crew at
Compass Rose Gardens, owned by Donna Freeman, who played a parent
at a birthday party spoiled by diving birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us were only on screen for just a second, but we're
very proud of Shirley here,'' Freeman said, putting her arm around
Shirley Ames. ``She had a full-face shot long enough to recognize
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blink if you're really going to try to catch it,'' Ames
said with a laugh. She was also a parent in the same scene. ``We're
at this party, the birds come and we run in the house. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames' daughter Janet Mantua, one of the kids at the party, and
Hazel Mitchell, who appeared as a waitress in the movie, also
showed up for lunch Wednesday. Mitchell brought a framed
illustration _ probably by Michelsen _ of the exploding car scene
in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell remembers serving Hitchcock, Taylor, Tippi Hedren,
Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette in real life as well as on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Hedren, whose character in the movie is named Melanie, brought
her young daughter Melanie with her when she filmed several scenes
in the movie, and many locals have memories of the youngster who
grew up to become more famous than her mother, Melanie Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Raim, a recent graduate of the American Film Institute in Los
Angeles, is hoping to cash in artistically as well as economically
on a recent upsurge in interest in documentary films. Films such as
``Full Tilt Boogie,'' ``Buena Vista Social Club'' and ``Visions of
Light, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese,'' have met with
critical and box office success.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, whose film career spanned almost 70 years and more than
80 films, found and shaped locations for several Hitchcock films
including ``The Birds,'' ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' ``North By
Northwest'' and ``Marnie.'' His non-Hitchock films include ``Gaily,
Gaily'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Bob Doyle's contributions so important in this
industry is his ability to bring out the human aspects in cinema,''
Raim said between filming sessions. ``He's always been less
interested in the gloss and glamour and more interested in
capturing the human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Boyle's career spans the golden age of film from the
studio system to the present,'' Raim said. ``He's just a gold mine
for this industry, and we're very lucky he's participating in this
project.''

BELIEVERS SAY SPIRITS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY WANT TO HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years ago, as she first set her eyes on the casket that
held the body of her 19-year-old daughter, Ann, Kathy Wilson
thought she was going ``to die from the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a moment, as she searched the face of her daughter, a
young woman whose life had been cut short by a car accident, Wilson
said she also found a degree of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole face lit up and her spirit came up over the top of
her face and she had the most profound, beautiful smile,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Wilson said, she heard Ann speak to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so devastated by grief,'' Wilson said. ``She came
to me and said, `I'm OK, Mom. I love you and everything is the way
it's supposed to be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though movie audiences are accepting of such on-screen spirits
as dead boyfriend Patrick Swayze in 1990's ``Ghost'' and the
troubled assortment of spirits in this summer's suspense hit ``The
Sixth Sense,'' these same people might dismiss Wilson's experience
as the overwhelming sadness of a grieving mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some _ many, Wilson would argue _ who would
quietly nod their heads in recognition of a similar encounter with
the spirit world. It could be the story of a mother offering
condolences from the grave, or of a husband saying, ``I love you.''
These incidents would likely be closely held secrets kept to
themselves by the people who experienced them, for fear of
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to be perceived as is a weirdo or a
New Age freak,'' Wilson said. ``But there are a tremendous number
of people who have these sorts of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Sixth Sense,'' child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, played
by Bruce Willis, is faced with a decision as he tries to help a
troubled young boy: Will he recognize the existence of the spirit
world, or will he use terms such as ``pathology,''
``hallucination'' and ``paranoia'' as he attempts to calm the fears
and pain of his elementary-school-age subject, Cole Sear?
</P>
<P>
   But for Wilson, a hypnotherapist in Arlington, and others,
including leaders of various religious traditions, there is no
decision to be made. Spirits regularly visit the living, offering
comfort and guidance, not fear, as often depicted on the silver
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know that those energies are available and are
not negative,'' said Wilson, who teaches classes on angels in
Grapevine and Dallas. ``I have never in my entire life run into
something that was a negative experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Various religious traditions, including American Indian
religions, recognize spirits. In Roman Catholicism, for example,
there is a long tradition of spirits _ particularly the Virgin Mary
_ reaching out to the living, said Monsignor Charles King, senior
pastor of St. John the Apostle Catholic Church in suburban Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In Medjugorje, a tiny village in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mary is
said to have appeared to a group of children; in Fatima, Portugal,
she appeared to three shepherd children; and most famously, in
Lourdes, France, she spoke to a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Masses are said for the dead and prayers are exchanged between
the two realms, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that contact between the living and the dead is
more than possible,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may make a great movie, but theologically _ no,'' said
Rabbi Ralph Mecklenburger of Congregation Beth-El in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the evangelical tradition, spirits and the living do not
communicate, said John P. Newport, former provost and professor of
the philosophy of religion at Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   And Danny Barnett, president of the North Texas Skeptics, warns
that there is a long tradition of channelers or mediums conning
widows out of their cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the likelihood of an actual spirit medium out there is
pretty low,'' he said. ``I won't discount it outright.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are folks who claim to have the ability to see or hear
the dead and use these skills to pass on messages to the living.
</P>
<P>
   For George Anderson, a spiritual medium and author of We Don't
Die and George Anderson's Lessons From the Light, communicating
with spirits or ``discerning'' them, as he describes it, is neither
scary nor particularly unusual. Anderson, 47, first discovered his
``sixth sense'' when he was 6, after a long bout with chickenpox,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as normal as brushing my teeth before I go to bed at
night,'' Anderson said in a telephone interview from Deer Park,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But all things being Hollywood, the ghosts who prick up the
``sixth sense'' in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), dropping room
temperatures and jacking up heating bills for a single mother, are
far from as routine as a squirt of toothpaste on a brush.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they appear in comforting visions of eternal motherhood
to share the good news of the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening crowd that haunts the south Philly row house in
``The Sixth Sense'' has come to complain. As if navigating the
mines set by classroom bullies, insecure teachers and sweet but
struggling divorced moms were not enough for the young hero, Cole
Sear (that's See-er) gets stuck listening to whiners from the other
side. Having the sixth sense, it would seem, opens a person up to a
rather needy spirit world.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of treatment from the other side is not something that
Fort Worth clairvoyant Pat Baylor would put up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``My door is not open to just anyone physically or spiritually,
otherwise I couldn't live,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who said she was born a clairvoyant, said she
communicates with spirits when a client arrives at her door with
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike young Cole, who fears he is a freak, Baylor said she
always assumed that everyone could see or hear spirits and
communicate with the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Her skills have nothing to do with any dark side, the occult or
phone services that air commercials late at night, she said. The
point of the service is to transfer information from the dead that
can help the living, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really basically communication,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a way of communication that everyone can participate in _
if only they open their minds and hearts to it, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of who we are,'' she said. ``We keep denying the
spiritual side of who we are in this culture. ... The spiritual and
spirituality are nothing to fear.''

   &UR; Where the Fed Goes, Mortgages Don't Follow &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has made headlines this summer by raising
interest rates twice, but if you are a prospective home buyer
focused on getting a mortgage, maybe you haven't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to the latest tally by Freddie Mac, interest
rates on conventional 30-year mortgages averaged 7.83 percent for
the week that ended Friday, one-tenth of a point less than the 7.93
percent that prevailed just before the central bank raised its rate
target by a quarter point on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage rate averaged 7.55 percent for two weeks in
mid-July, a bit less than the 7.63 percent that prevailed on June
30, the day of the season's first Fed rate increase, also a
quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's increases typically raise the entire interest-rate
spectrum, including mortgage rates, although the official target is
only the rate on overnight loans among banks. So why didn't it
happen?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, investors correctly anticipated what the Fed would
do. Pleased that the increases were no more than had been expected,
the bond market rallied after the Fed's announcements, driving
interest rates down _ and letting mortgage shoppers breathe a sigh
of relief.

   &UR; Wider Coverage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, fewer than two dozen employers in the United
States offered health insurance that covered the same-sex domestic
partners of their employees. But a report that is to be released
Tuesday by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian lobbying group, shows a big change. As of Aug. 6, the
organization had identified 2,856 employers that offer such
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth came after 1997, when a law mandated that any
company doing business with the city or county of San Francisco
offer the same benefits to the domestic partners of its employees
that it offered to legal spouses. The study reported that 2,168 of
the 2,343 employers that added benefits in the past three years had
done so because of this law.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employers who now have domestic-partner coverage _
69 percent _ offer the benefits to unmarried opposite-sex as well
as same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is not in an Ozzie and Harriet household with a
husband, wife, two kids and a dog,'' said Kim I. Mills, the author
of the study. And today, she added, it is becoming more common that
``your benefits depend on what you do on the job, and not who
you're married to or whether you're married at all.''

   &UR; Hassled Gap &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Traveling on business can be a bother, but women are less likely
to mind it than men, according to a survey of 606 business
travelers by New York University's Center for Hospitality, Tourism
and Travel Administration and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. The
survey found that while 55 percent of the men cited the hassle
factor, only 40 percent of women did. And 63 percent of the men,
compared with 52 percent of women, said they try to avoid overnight
trips. One clue to the differences: 68 percent of the women saw
business trips as a way to incorporate leisure time; only 52
percent of the men did.

   Not Doing Better by Doing Good
</P>
<P>
   For corporations, it looks like virtue may have to be its own
reward after all.
</P>
<P>
   Two Arizona State University West economists examined the
popular notion that good corporate citizens _ companies that
support local charities, promote diversity, run clean plants and
make safe products _ wind up with better bottom lines and higher
stock prices than their less altruistic brethren. They found that
the best that can be said for doing good is that it doesn't do much
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The two professors, Donald Siegel and Abagail McWilliams, found
no statistically significant difference in 10-year stock price
performance between a group of 950 companies selected for good
corporate social performance and another of 1,200 randomly selected
companies. Nor did any pattern emerge from their study of six years
of profitability figures for 524 companies whose social
responsibility ratings ranged from saintly to dismal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no relationship between corporate social
responsibility and any financial measure of performance,'' Siegel
concluded. So what about all those earlier studies that found
bottom-line benefits of benevolence? ``The empirical analysis was
horrendous,'' Siegel said, adding that earlier researchers erred by
omitting research and development from their equations. The
companies with the money to invest heavily in research are often
the ones that can also afford to be socially generous, he noted,
``but the empirical connection is between economic performance and
R&AMP;D, not social responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The study isn't going down well in some quarters. When the
authors presented their findings to the Academy of Management last
month, ``We were accused of being Machiavellian,'' Siegel said.

GARTH BROOKS HAS REMARKETED HIMSELF; RESULT SO FAR IS MIXED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music industry scratched its collective head weeks ago when
Garth Brooks announced plans for his next CD.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoman who had sold more than 60 million CDs, filled
stadiums and arenas around the world, and given country its
greatest success ever in mainstream pop was going to morph into a
fictional Australian pop/rock singer named Chris Gaines, and the CD
(set for release Sept. 28) would be a greatest-hits collection of a
career that never happened, culled from CDs that were never
released.
</P>
<P>
   And Garth's new look was pensive, with long bangs coming down
past the eyes and a little soul patch under the lip.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more: 2000 would see the release of ``The Lamb,''
a movie based on, yes, this nonexistent man (Gaines) and his
musical career.
</P>
<P>
   Say again?
</P>
<P>
   It was brash, it was weird, it was totally unexpected and not
completely explained. And totally Garth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the release of two singles, the pop/R&AMP;B ``Lost in
You'' and the country ``It Don't Matter to the Sun,'' the huge
publicity machine that always accompanies anything Brooks does has
been turned on.
</P>
<P>
   And at least so far, the morphing seems to be paying off:
``Lost'' was the No. 1 most-added song on top 40 and adult
contemporary stations around the country last week, while ``Sun''
was the most-added track on country radio two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone calls have been real positive _ and all women,''
says Lisa Thomas, music director for 102.9/KDMX FM, which has been
playing ``Lost'' ``12 or 13'' times per week. ``It's a great love
song, a strong female song, and I think what Garth has done is
brilliant _ he'd really niched himself in country, and now he's
reinvented himself, like Madonna or Cher.''
</P>
<P>
   Annette M. Lai, adult contemporary editor for Gavin, says that
nationally, ``people love the song _ and they're surprised it's
Garth Brooks. It's definitely an event and it'll be interesting to
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   And well they should be surprised. Brooks is one of the biggest
stars of this decade, and his ``Sevens'' and ``Double Live''
releases have both hit No. 1 on the national country charts and
sold a combined 18 million copies. Brooks, in other words, could
cough hard, record it, release it, and sell a million copies of it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lost in You'' is a complete about-face from his patented
country sound: A soft R&AMP;B ballad, it has some listeners wondering
if it's the new Babyface or Tracy Chapman, or maybe Kenny Loggins.
</P>
<P>
   The CD single includes a Gaines biography and discography,
detailing his life from son of Olympic swimmers to pop star to
scarred veteran of a one-car accident in 1992 and subsequent
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its popularity is a combination of both the song and
the Chris Gaines persona,'' says Stan Atkinson, program director
for Milwaukee's WLTQ/97.3 FM, where ``Lost'' is featured alongside
the Backstreet Boys, Cher, Eric Clapton and Britney Spears. ``It's
not really a gamble _ I think some country people aren't happy,
because they're protective of their artists, but if he wants to
take on a new challenge, he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Are people just enjoying the song, or
are they really intrigued by the whole Garth-is-Chris persona?
</P>
<P>
   Many people say it's the former, not the latter. Although pop
audiences do enjoy ``Lost,'' and country fans like ``Sun,'' that's
a far cry from there being a groundswell of interest about the
whole Chris Gaines project.
</P>
<P>
   And that groundswell, several say, just isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Over at country radio, the entire project is taking a back seat
to the incredible out-of-the-box success of the Dixie Chicks'
``Fly'' and the controversy surrounding one of the most popular
cuts, ``Goodbye Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't the passion one usually sees for a new Garth
Brooks record,'' says Paul Williams, promotions director for
KPLX/99.5 FM. ``It's been, `OK, that's the new Garth Brooks _ can
you play the new Dixie Chicks now?' With all the other product,
there's a lot in line ahead of it. We'll look at ``Sun'' sales, but
there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in the Garth project
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's the same story for ``Lost'' at pop radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do this now, when the movie's not coming out until 2000?''
asks Thomas. ``I think they (the record company) did it too early.
You can only be teased for so long. People like the song, but they
don't sound intrigued by the whole Chris Gaines thing _ not right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Also finding a general lack of interest is Mac Daniels, program
director for Washington, D.C.'s WMZQ/98.7 FM. Although Daniels, an
avowed Brooks fan, says Brooks is brave for trying something
totally new, he says that people are already being hyped to death
on new releases and current stars, and that Garth-as-Chris doesn't
give people ``very much to latch onto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, `Garth is pretending to be someone else _ OK,
``why?'' ' '' Daniels says. ``To a lot of people, it's just another
publicity stunt. I don't hear a lot of, `What about the movie?' or
`What's this going to be like?' Your everyday fan isn't waiting
with anticipation to see what's coming next from the CD. This is a
little far out there for fans as a whole to grasp _ it's hard to
explain. But I think we know what Garth wants us to know _ he's a
master at this sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And we will soon know more. The 13-song CD, ``Garth Brooks In
... The Life of Chris Gaines'' hits stores Sept. 28, and that week,
Brooks will blitz TV: An NBC special of the same name airs the next
night, and Brooks will appear on ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno,'' ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' ``Late Night With Conan
O'Brien'' and ``The Today Show,'' all between Sept. 27 and 29.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson saw Brooks-as-Gaines industry showcase performances in
Los Angeles and Chicago, and says that the presentation is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blown away by those shows,'' he says. ``He just did
Chris Gaines songs, and he had dance songs like Prince, some rock,
some softer songs. The CD is going to be incredible. It's top-notch
music _ Garth Brooks is not going to embarrass himself.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The back seat of a 1991 Nissan Sentra speeding
through New Jersey is no place to be getting in touch with your
ethnic identity. But there I was, yanking off my tie and struggling
into a blue guayabera shirt, on a pilgrimage from the Hoboken PATH
station to Bergenline Avenue in Union City, East Harlem across the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   I was drawn here by my newfound obsession with the guayabera
shirt, the casually dressy tropical classic with four pockets and a
pair of pleats up the front. A favorite on the domino circuit
forever, it has now been appropriated by young lovers of things
Latin, styling themselves for ``la vida loca,'' the crazy life
promised by Ricky Martin on MTV. ``If you're thinking of borrowing
one of your father's guayaberas ... You're Generation N,'' declared
a July 12 Newsweek cover celebrating Latin youth culture. Next
month, Barneys will carry a muscle version designed by John
Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   I may be the last guy on the guayabera bandwagon, but I come by
the trend honestly. My father was a Spaniard, and he used to wear
one in the summertime. Despite that cultural inheritance, or more
likely because of it, I'd avoided the look. Now, I was worried I
might not be able to pull it off. When I tried mine on last winter,
at a discount store in San Juan, Puerto Rico, I thought I looked
like a dentist. It stayed in the closet for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   For the New Jersey excursion, I'd recruited one authentic
Cuban-American, Diego, as a guide. A friend of a friend, he grew up
in the neighborhood. A generation ago, he recalled, Union City had
the largest Cuban population in the country outside Miami. Most of
the Cubans have left. The new immigrants are from Central and South
America. One shop selling religious statues had a sign in the
window with a touch of magic realism: ``Se reparan santos.'' (We
repair saints.) But this strip, where Diego hung out as a
teen-ager, has lost its old flavor. Movie theaters closed, fast
food chains sprang up and nobody was wearing a guayabera. I wasn't
exactly blending in.
</P>
<P>
   At the counter of a small diner, we ordered guarapos, sweet icy
drinks made on the spot by liquefying stalks of sugar cane in a
giant juicer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be getting back to the bus now,'' one of my non-Latin
amigos, Anthony, said, as we took the drinks to go. I felt as much
like a tourist among ``my people'' as he did, as if I were wearing
a T-shirt stamped ``Gringo.''
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop was a store called El Waterloo, locally famous for
its guayaberas, at Bergenline and 45th Street. Closed. In the
window, colored, striped and elaborately embroidered shirts (for
men and women) were unattainably displayed.
</P>
<P>
   So we made for Jersey City, home to a Cuban diner called the
Hard Grove Cafe. This was more like it. Fake gold-leafed palm trees
shaded heaping platters of beans and rice. Each table is decorated
with a different Cuban theme, designated by collages of magazine
covers and newspaper articles. We were offered the ``Missile
Crisis'' table. A somber John F. Kennedy stared up at me from a
1962 Newsweek cover as we were offered lethal Cuban cocktails by
the cafe's owner, Dominic Santana, who wore an impressively ornate
beige guayabera. His staff, Cuban or not, was similarly attired. My
ethnic self-image lifted a couple of points. Now, maybe I could
pass for a Cuban waiter.
</P>
<P>
   After that evening, I vowed to steep myself in the history of
the guayabera, which I hadn't even been pronouncing right (it's
gwy-ah-BEAR-ah). Rene La Villa, a Cuban who came to Miami in the
early 1960s, proved an invaluable source. La Villa's company, Miami
Cool Wear, has been selling the shirts wholesale for 21 years. They
were, he said, the uniform of the well-dressed man in the Cuba of
Fulgencio Batista, in linen, cotton, or poly-cotton, depending on
his affluence. A true guayabera has four pockets, two pleats in
front, three in the back and 27 buttons, which in the old days were
mother-of-pearl. The buttons on the side vents must always be left
undone, for ease of movement. The shirt's exact origin is unknown,
but La Villa offered these theories:
</P>
<P>
   _ After 300 years of colonization, Cubans wore them to
distinguish themselves from the Spaniards in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   _ They were worn by ``guayaba'' (or guava) pickers, because
their large pockets were good for carrying the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to legend, a Spanish man living in the Cuban town of
Sancti-Spiritus asked his wife to make him a comfortable white
shirt in which he could withstand the heat and humidity. She sent
to Spain for the finest linen and created for her husband the first
guayabera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very romantic shirt,'' La Villa said.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion spread through Spain's empire. Mexicans dropped the
bottom pockets and replaced pleats with embroidery. In the
Philippines, it became the barong tagalog, long-sleeved, sometimes
French-cuffed. When Ronald Reagan visited Ferdinand Marcos, he put
one on.
</P>
<P>
   I tried mine again in the Hamptons. If there was ever a place to
come off like a fashion idiot, this was it. At first, I restricted
the guayabera to the backyard. My mother came to visit on her
birthday, and as we sat around the deck having drinks, she stared
at me and my shirt and the way I was sitting and said the color was
exactly the same as one ``your father'' used to wear.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling a little less dentist-like now. The shirt's
flawlessly designed air-conditioning provided a protective layer of
coolness against the oppressive heat and the once-over appraisals
of the sartorial constabulary. I wore it to a cocktail party, then
a dinner, where it elicited no reaction, positive or negative. This
could have meant that people were too polite to say I looked like a
Cuban waiter or that the shirts are ubiquitous enough not to merit
comment. Whatever. By now, I'd stopped worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a kid, the last thing you want is to be different. I
hated going to Spanish classes on Saturdays as much as my Jewish
friends told me they hated Hebrew school. I didn't want anyone to
know my dad had a foreign name (Diego, like my Bergenline Avenue
guide). But by the time I hit high school, I had come around. I
craved family trips to the old country, wanted to speak the
language. The guayabera put me through that whole cycle again, from
dumb embarrassment to what therapy-speak would call ``owning'' my
Spanish side. Now that my father's not around, the least I can do
is wear his shirt.

RUGGED RIDE TO GLACIER NATIONAL PARK LAKES IS RICHLY REWARDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF LARSEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speed limit signs read 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   The signs should read: ``You'll be lucky if you can hit 10 mph
on these roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the primitive condition of the dirt roads to Bowman and
Kintla lakes in Montana's Glacier National Park, both drives are
worth it. The end result is spectacular scenery and wildlife
viewing, plus a certain sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   You just need plenty of patience, time and a good set of tires.
</P>
<P>
   Both lakes lie just west of the Livingston Range of mountains in
Montana and just south of the Canadian border in what is officially
called the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park _ the
combination of Glacier and Waterton national parks in the United
States and Canada, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, the Canadian Parliament and the U.S. Congress made the
park the first of its kind in the world, and well over a million
Americans and Canadians visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman Lake campground has 48 well-maintained sites, pit
toilets, and fresh water. Resident deer and prairie dogs are
common. Park officials don't recommend you try to drive a
recreational vehicle or tow a travel trailer up the road. Tenting
or small campers work best.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making it a camping destination, hikers can access a
number of backcountry trails from the lake shore.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the time of year, rangers warn hikers not to hike alone
because of the bear and cougar danger. Last month three hikers _
one hiking alone _ were mauled by a sow grizzly bear on the
Scalplock Lookout Trail near the southeast border of the park.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to backcountry hike, you need a permit and be sure
to ask rangers about bear sightings. Then read up on bear etiquette
for your safety and that of the bears as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kintla Lake is a bit more remote and less visited because of the
length of bad access road, but again the spectacular scenery makes
the drive worth it. The road winds through meadow after meadow
flanked by high mountain peaks and the clear waters of the north
fork of the Flathead River.
</P>
<P>
   The campground has 13 sites with pit toilets and fresh water,
and like Bowman is well maintained and serves as a trailhead for
backcountry hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Campsites cost $10 per night and are self-register and self-pay.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to fish and want to try your luck on Bowman or
Kintla creeks or the lakes themselves, bring the same amount of
patience you needed to drive the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Streams and lakes in the park are not stocked anymore, to avoid
destruction of fishes native to park waters.
</P>
<P>
   Currently an active fish rehabilitation program is attempting to
revive the depleted stocks of native fish. But for now the fishing
generally is not very good in the easily accessible areas around
the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool nights are common, even during August when daytime
temperatures can reach 90, so bring warm clothes and a warm
sleeping bag. In 1992 a foot of snow fell in the northeast part of
the park in August.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes the size of Rhode Island and pesky black flies are
plentiful during the summer months, so travel with a generous
supply of bug repellant. (Count on a number of bites, even if
you're lathered up.)
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected storms blow in and out of the park, so water safety
on Bowman and Kintla lakes is a major concern of park rangers.
Since 1913 the most common cause of death in the park is by
drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier National Park is truly a national treasure and one
Americans can take pride in. The primitive roads only add to the
park's grandeur. Because they are so difficult to drive, you might
say only the strong survive, which in turn helps keep the park
healthy for generations to come.

PAUL ALLEN'S HIGH-TECH ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSUEM TAKING SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Say, fella, what's that thing they're building at the
Seattle Center? You know, that big thing that looks like a set of
multicolored domes kinda mushed into each other?
</P>
<P>
   Why, that's the Experience Music Project _ a $100 million,
multiplatform, high-tech music museum funded by Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   If Allen were Shah Jahan, rock 'n' roll would be his favorite
wife and the EMP building would be the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the EMP began in June 1997, and the last of the
more than 4,000 colorful steel panels will be put in place over the
next month. Satellite dish supporters are installed and crews are
still working on what they call the monorail ``valley'' _ the part
of the EMP that goes over the monorail track.
</P>
<P>
   Upon first drive-by glance, the building seems less a building
in the conventional sense and more an amorphous technicolor vision.
</P>
<P>
   Before you say anything else, take note that the EMP building is
designed by big-shot architect Frank O. Gehry, so maybe you should
save your ``Blob'' jokes and wait until the building is finished _
which will be before next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Gehry is considered one of the most important
and innovative architects of this century. He is known for treating
his buildings like sculptures, tilting angles and bending lines.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous design coup is the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain _ loads of titanium, even more acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   He is working on a new building for the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's computer and information science departments and
the Millennium Park _ a massive pavilion _ in downtown Chicago.
Gehry also recently won the competition to design a new wing for
the Corcoran Gallery's Beaux-Arts building, a block from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The EMP staff is reluctant to comment on the building beyond
vague references to Gehry's source of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gehry worked with guitar designs _ people think that the
building is supposed to be shaped like a smashed up guitar, but
that's not true. ... Gehry worked on the design on his own and with
Paul (Allen). It's inspired by music and movement,'' says Chris
Bruce, director of curatorial for the EMP.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, quite keen on discussing the museum's exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything _ from blues, to rock to rap. ... It'll all
be represented here. We have 80,000 pieces,'' says Bruce, sounding
a little excited at the sheer number of items he and his staff will
get to sort through and arrange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Northwest Passage exhibit (dedicated to our
region's rich rock 'n' roll culture), Bruce talks about other main
exhibits and drops big names: Hendrix, Presley, Grandmaster Flash.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. If you think one of those three names seems to stand apart
from the others (hint: rapper Grandmaster Flash), you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the museum, which is essentially dedicated
to rock music, has taken hip-hop into its fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're including them (hip-hop artists) with do-it-yourself
people like Elvis and other '50s rockers,'' Bruce says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have Grandmaster Flash's original turntables set up,''
notes Bruce, pointing to the area that will house the hip-hop
exhibits. But don't hold your breath for an exhibit on the history
of electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything sort of new, totally artificial
electronic music, no. Up through hip-hop is pretty much as far as
we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce says the genre will likely be addressed down the
line through a temporary exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   He says there will be a space for such temporary exhibits that
will change every three or four months, but they're just starting
to plan them.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still work to be done before the specifics of all
the exhibits are ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're still putting up boards and panels _ all
on schedule _ and trying to figure out the hundreds of feet worth
of wiring that's required to make the EMP a fully wired building.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the high-tech features that are meant to help you
experience the music include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Artist's Journey: A multimedia ride/walk through artists'
biographies. Short films (about 15 minutes long) .
</P>
<P>
   _ Sound Lab: A studio-type setting where visitors can play
instruments, tinker with mixing boards and samplers. For that real
rock-star feeling, check out the on-stage simulator that lets
visitors sample what it's like to perform on stage. This is an area
of the museum that is likely to expand.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Theatre: A 200-seater, this space will accommodate
performances, talks and film showings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Electric Library: An area where visitors can use computers and
CD-ROMs to look up music-related info.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in contrast to all these digital goods is the look of
the building's interior. Spacey and curved, the walls move along,
one surface curving into the next, covered with shotcrete (blown
concrete). It definitely has that unfinished finished look.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a restaurant in the works, but the EMP folks
haven't settled on what sort of food will be featured or who the
food supplier will be. The restaurant likely will be open after
hours, and may be used as a venue for live music.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce says the case work for the exhibits will start
materializing sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then it won't be until January or February that we'll
start to move things in,'' he adds. He says the building should be
completed by around that time, and the EMP will probably open on
the first or second week of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shooting for the 8th, and that has to do with
performance venues and what we can get on the Seattle Center
grounds for some of those opening events.''

THE FOOTNOTE: PUNCTUATION TO PUNCTURE PEDANTRY WITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If footnotes, quotations and marginalia, beloved by pedants and
bores, were suddenly to vanish from the planet, you might say:
``Yippee! Good riddance to all that received wisdom and tiny
typeface. Farewell to the dutiful handmaidens of authority.'' But
not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Three scholars from three different fields have independently
given these tools of scholarly oppression a revolutionary edge.
Quotation marks, footnotes and marginalia aren't just the voice of
authority: they are actually the apparatus of subversion, sarcasm,
irony and nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the quotation mark. In the current issue of the journal
``Critical Inquiry,'' Marjorie Garber, the William R. Kenan Jr.
Professor of English and the director of the Center for Literary
and Cultural Studies at Harvard University, has an article called
`` '' (Quotation Marks).
</P>
<P>
   One of the ``curious properties of these typographical
signifiers,'' she writes, is that ``they may indicate either
authenticity or doubt.'' Sometimes quotations are meant to lend
authority, Ms. Garber suggests, but the most general thing you can
say is that they are reminders that words are borrowed things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways quotation is a kind of cultural ventriloquism, a
throwing of the voice,'' she writes. Because ``every quotation is a
quotation out of context,'' it can be a true copy and a false
representation at the same time. It is ``inevitably both a
duplication and a duplicity.'' A quotation mark can mean either ``
`This is exactly what was said,' or `Can you imagine saying or
believing this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the sarcastic use of the phrase ``quote-unquote'':
```The mayor's quote-unquote dedication to duty' means the speaker
doesn't think the mayor is very dedicated,'' Ms. Garber writes. Or
think of its gestural equivalent, the ``air quote,'' or, in Ms.
Garber's words, the ``Happy Talk finger-dance.'' These gestures
often suggest ``a certain attitude _ often of wry skepticism _
about the authority of both the quotation and the quotee,'' she
writes. Some users call them ``scare quotes,'' she says, suggesting
Jacques Derrida's idea that the words quoted are ``under erasure''
or somehow deficient.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds very post-modern, doesn't it? But irony was lurking in
the quotation mark long before Derrida was in diapers. Ms. Garber
quotes R.B. McKerrow's 1927 book ``An Introduction to Bibliography
for Literary Students,'' (with respect, not sarcasm): ``Inverted
commas were, until late in the 17th century, frequently used at the
beginnings of lines to call attention to sententious remarks.''
Early quotations were not even part of the main text, Ms. Garber
writes. They were left ``in the margins, as glosses or evidence of
what was being claimed; sometimes they looked more like modern
footnotes than like quotations.''
</P>
<P>
   So quotations have their roots firmly planted in the soil of
doubt. And that means they can take their place next to footnotes,
which recently have come to be seen as tools of subversion, too. In
``The Footnote: A Curious History'' (Harvard University Press,
1997), Anthony Grafton, Dodge Professor of History at Princeton
University, calls footnotes ``anthills, swarming with constructive
and combative activity.'' Sure, he concedes, they are generally
regarded as marks of authority, like ``the shabby podium, carafe of
water, and rambling, inaccurate introduction which assert that a
particular person deserves to be listened to.'' But still, Grafton
insists, footnotes are where all the fun is.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Gibbon used one of his 383 footnotes in ``The Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire'' to make fun of the too-literal
theologian who castrated himself after reading the injunction to
``disarm the tempter.''
</P>
<P>
   And the footnotes in Pierre Bayle's 1696 sleeper, the
``Historical and Critical Dictionary,'' Grafton writes, are filled
with pornographic biblical interpretations and salacious stories,
including ``Caspar Scioppius' description of the sparrow he
watched, from his student lodgings at Ingolstadt, having
intercourse 20 times and then dying'' _ as well as Scioppius'
reflection: `O unfair lot. Is this to be granted to sparrows and
denied to men?'''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Grafton suggests, footnotes are the ``toilets and
sewers'' of historical writing, where all the rich waste materials
are dumped. They don't just back up the narrative, they also argue
with it, destroying the idea that there is one true story. They
``buttress and undermine at one and the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you might conclude, footnotes are the height of subversion.
Wrong again. Long before footnotes had their vogue in the 18th
century, medieval artists invented a far more radical kind of
marginalia.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Image on the Edge: The Margins of Medieval Art'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992) Michael Camille, an art historian at the
University of Chicago, tells the story of the ``lascivious apes,
autophagic dragons, pot-bellied heads, harp-playing asses'' and
copulating animals, populating the edges of illuminated
manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, the illuminator would do his work after the
scribe was finished, Camille writes, and ``that gave him a chance
of undermining ... the written word.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Rutland Psalter of 1260, the illuminator
colored the manuscript so that ``the letter `p' of the Latin word
conspectu (meaning to see or penetrate visually)'' turns into an
arrow that flies into the posterior of a prostrate fish-man,
Camille writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medieval image-word was, like medieval life itself,
rigidly structured and hierarchical,'' Camille writes. ``For this
reason, resisting, ridiculing, overturning and inverting it was not
only possible, it was limitless.'' The margins of illuminated
manuscripts were a playground. By the close of the 13th century
``no text was spared the irreverent explosion of marginal mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   From the look of the illuminated manuscripts, with their
monkey-suckling nuns and bird-headed Jesuses, you can guess where
footnotes and quotations get their subversive edge. The margins,
Camille writes, were the place ``not only for supplementation and
annotation but also for disagreement and juxtaposition _ what the
scholastics called disputatio'' and what we might call talking
back.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson here: the marginal has always been marginal.

SLOW JOB GROWTH TAKES EDGE OFF INFLATION FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A summer of sizzling economic growth ended with a mild expansion
in employment in August, dampening inflation fears and sending the
stock market soaring more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Labor reported Friday that job growth
slowed sharply in August from levels of 281,000 for the month of
June and 338,000 in July, an upward revision of earlier estimates.
Economists said that August job growth of 124,000 jobs was only
half the level they had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in August, an
insignificant change from 4.3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly jobs report was welcomed on Wall Street in the wake
of two separate quarter-point increases in interest rates by the
Federal reserve during the last three months. Although there is
little evidence now of an inflation surge, the Fed raised rates out
of concerns an unrelenting job market and rising wages would feed
inflation in the economy overall.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation fears were heightened during a week filled with
reports indicating August was a strong month: auto sales rose,
consumer confidence remained high, and manufacturing activity
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   The August jobs report ``is a little bit of a sigh of relief,''
said Leila Heckman, head of global asset allocation for Salomon
Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 185 points in
the first minutes of stock trading Friday in reaction to the
report. The market added a few more points and then held at that
higher level as traders and investors left early for the Labor Day
holiday. The Dow rose 235.24 to close at 11,078.45. The Dow ended
an extremely volatile week with a loss of 11.72, or just 0.1
percent. The Nasdaq Friday rose 108.87 to 2843.11, surpassing the
previous one-day record jump.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists had been worried that another strong
month of job creation might spur the Federal Reserve to again raise
interest rates at its Oct. 5 meeting. The Fed, led by its chairman,
Alan Greenspan, has kept a sharp eye on an extremely tight job
market, boosting rates by a quarter percentage point _ the second
such move this year _ at its late-August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news in the jobs report for the financial
markets was a mere 2-cent rise in average hourly earnings, to
$13.30 an hour, last month.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has produced some 227,000 jobs, on average, each
month over the last year. During the first six months of this
period, starting in September 1998, payrolls expanded 260,000 jobs
a month, on average, but slowed to 195,800 monthly during the most
recent six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth continues in employment but at a slightly slower
rate,'' said Robert D'Alessandro, assistant regional commissioner
for the Boston office of the Bureau of Labor Statitics, a division
of the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market seems to have stopped expanding, an indication
that a booming economy may have driven all available workers into
the labor market _ at least at current wages being offered by
employers.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market has held at about 139 million all summer, while
the unemployment rate has not budged from 4.2 percent or 4.3
percent for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``job openings are more widespread and perceptions
of job availability are sky high, participation in the labor market
is not increasing,'' said John Youngdahl, senior money market
economist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If labor demand remains this strong, there will be pressure to
increase the scale of compensation in order to attract'' more
people to enter the job market, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Youngdahl and other economists maintained that the report
takes some pressure off the Fed to boost rates.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report ``shows there's still healthy growth but we're
not overheating,'' said William Cheney, John Hancock's economist.
``People were saying the Fed's going to tighten for sure, but now
it's back to being a toss up.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprise in the payroll data was a sizable 63,000 loss in
manufacturing jobs, after the sector added 51,000 jobs in July.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, which had struggled over the past year amid a
slump in world demand, has resurged though that has failed to
translate into a big rebound in hiring. Economists also attributed
the August decline to seasonal variations in the government's data.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the trend lately, the nation's service sector picked
up the slack for weak factory growth. Jobs in service-producing
industries added 132,000 in August, well above the 78,000 rise in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies shed 29,000 jobs after adding 14,000 in
the prior month, but economists said that may be due to an extreme
shortage of contractors for hire to do summer renovations or
house-buying fix-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction is related to capacity issues: the shortages of
qualified people,'' said Goldman's Youngdahl. ``I have heard so
many reports from people that you can't find contractors.''

   It was one of the first and biggest of the ``category killers,''
and in the early 1990s it expanded as rapidly as a 10-year-old in a
growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us conquered the toy retailing world with
warehouse-style stores, heavy promotion and lower prices than its
mom-and-pop or department-store competitors. The doors were barely
open on new stores before they were packed with minivan-driving
moms clutching Christmas lists and youngsters with allowance money.
</P>
<P>
   But Toys ``R'' Us has hit an awkward stage. Parents have grown
weary of dragging children through its 1,400 huge, often chaotic
stores. Wal-Mart has taken aim at it with cut-rate pricing. And the
Internet has emerged as a way to buy dolls and toy trucks from home
with fewer aggravations.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends have thrown Toys ``R'' Us into disarray. Last week,
the company abruptly announced that its chief executive, Robert C.
Nakasone, had resigned. He was the fourth senior manager to depart
this year, as the company's profits declined and its foray into
Internet retailing fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   How can the company get back on track? A spectrum of business
experts and everyday consumers offered their suggestions last week.

   JOHN OSHER, founder and former owner of Cap Toys, a $100 million
company in Napa, Calif., that makes Stretch Armstrong toys and Spin
Pops; the company is now part of Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they have to do is get the management picture
correct. In toys, you effectively need co-management: a very strong
toy merchandiser and a very strong business manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just hire someone from General Electric and put them
in charge of toys, because they don't know the toy business. But
you can't just take someone who is a super merchandiser and tell
them to turn the company around.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, he said, ``has really been jumping back and forth
between running it with an operations guy or a merchandising guy,
and going to extremes that don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Osher would also urge Toys ``R'' Us to commit to hiring better
workers. ``Toys `R' Us now is going to have to go from being pretty
much a nonservice business and having people work the floor for
about two weeks, to a family-trained service business where people
take pride in taking you through the Toys `R' Us experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Osher thought the company needed to rethink its use of real
estate. ``They are going to have to expand their electronics
department,'' he said. ``They are going to have to really combine
the Babies `R' Us and Toys `R' Us locations to get more from the
real estate, and make it more of a happening. Be the Starbucks for
kids.''

<P>
   CARREEN WINTERS, 30, married mother of Emily, 4, and expecting a
second child in December. She lives in Bergenfield, N.J., a
10-minute drive from the company's headquarters in Paramus, and
says she is a former Toys ``R'' Us shopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always sort of amazed that the stores that senior
executives are most likely to pop into unannounced, because they
are so close to their headquarters, could be so unpleasant to shop
in. The aisles are cluttered, the service is mediocre at best and I
find the stores to be rather dirty. I have to imagine if the stores
near the headquarters are like that, it's somewhat
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   If she were in charge, she said, ``I would clean up the stores
and make them more user-friendly.'' Checkout lanes should move
faster, she said, and ``it would be nice if somebody smiles and
says `thank you' after I pay them. I don't even get a grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Big improvements in customer service are needed to bring
shoppers like her back to the store, she said. Instead of the blank
stare she once received when she asked for help finding a Potato
Head and a Barbie item, she said, ``it would be really helpful if
someone came to the aisle to show me where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have to imagine they can check the computer and tell me
if it's in stock, or call another store to see if they had it,''
she added. ``If they really wanted to be great they would take my
phone number.''
</P>
<P>
   DAVID COSCARELLI, a 10-year-old in fifth grade in Shaker
Heights, Ohio, and a frequent Toys ``R'' Us shopper whose most
recent purchase was a Nintendo Game Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do to make the store more appealing for
parents and children, David said: ``Have a computer somewhere, so
you can type in what you're looking for. And, probably, make it
bigger, and have lots of toys from the year 1991 or, like, old toys
from the '80s and early '90s. Usually you can't find those kinds of
things anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should probably put in a lot of toys where you can look
at what they can do, and test them out to see if you like them,''
he added. Children would buy more toys that way, he said, ``because
they would know what they're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   David said the store had lost more ground with adults than with
children. His mother avoids the place, David said, and his father
takes him ``mostly because I'm the one who mainly likes to go.''
</P>
<P>
   DAVID STEWART, professor of marketing at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Toys `R' Us, I would try to be sure that toys I was
selling did not also go through the likes of Wal-Mart. I would want
certain exclusives and tie-ins with popular movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for a store with a limited line of
merchandise to make it when it has to be a special shopping trip to
get there. It would certainly be possible for them to extend beyond
the toys they now carry; perhaps items for adults, the kinds of
things that are sold at Sharper Image, or computers and
electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   ERYK CASEMIRO, co-producer of ``The Rugrats Movie'' and senior
vice president for creative of Klasky-Csupo Inc., creators of
``Rugrats'' and other animated TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about our culture is experiential now. It's
fascinating when you see stores that create an environment that
draws you in, like a thrill ride. That's what we do with our shows,
and shopping has to be similar. I love it when you go into a store
and there's something going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has figured this out: In their parks and their stores,
you are having an experience even when you are waiting in line.
Always there's a narrative. Viacom has a store in Chicago that's
really great; it's fun walking through each of their cable
channels. If you are going into a Toys `R' Us store, it ought to be
worth your while.'' &QL;

THE REAL STORY: HOW A LAWYER AND A FILMMAKER FOUND HOLES IN FBI'S
OFFICIAL VERSION OF WACO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
(Attn: Ariz. and Colo.) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The big cannons of Congress had their shot at
uncovering the truth about Waco and the Branch Davidians, and they
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice and Treasury departments had their own crack at the
truth and fared no better. Neither did the dozens of lawyers and
scores of journalists who chased hundreds of leads and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The official story remained undented: David Koresh and his cult
followers at Mount Carmel instigated the gunbattle with federal
agents in the spring of 1993 and, 51 days later, committed mass
suicide by setting fire to their Texas compound. Koresh and some 80
followers died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, fragments of the official version began to crumble,
but it took an unlikely pair of outsiders _ a lone-wolf lawyer from
Tucson, Ariz., and a low-budget documentary film researcher from
Fort Collins, Colo. _ to force the revelations that FBI agents
withheld evidence about the siege and possibly committed perjury to
keep that evidence secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall of silence, the stonewalling, finally is starting to
come apart,'' said Joe Phillips, an associate of the Houston law
firm Caddell &AMP; Chapman that has filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against the government.
</P>
<P>
   What finally cracked the wall was the perseverance of David
Hardy, a former Interior Department attorney who set out five years
ago to write a book about the ``militarization of law
enforcement,'' and Mike McNulty, a down-sized insurance
salesman-turned-filmmaker whose first effort, ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement,'' was nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was drawn to Waco because it was an illustration, he says,
of the dangers of turning soldiers into cops. McNulty, a Mormon,
has said he became interested in the story because of its
similarities to the massacre of church members at Haun's Mill in
Missouri in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty did not return phone calls for comment on his role in
forcing the FBI to amend its previous version of events, but Hardy
said that while they had different interests in the Branch Davidian
siege, they have worked closely together and shared information.
</P>
<P>
   What their labors led to may not alter the verdict on Waco.
However, it has dented the credibility of the Justice Department
and could have an important impact on wrongful death lawsuits filed
by the families of Davidians who died in the Mount Carmel fire. A
trial is set for Oct. 18 in federal court in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major disclosures of the past 10 days:
</P>
<P>
   _ The FBI withheld from Attorney General Janet Reno and Congress
the fact that pyrotechnic devices were used on the last day of the
siege of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   _ FBI officials lied in sworn statements when they said they had
no infrared video of the first four hours of the assault _ videos
that possibly would show the use of pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possible perjury by FBI officials, who, in response to Hardy's
Freedom of Information lawsuit, told a federal judge they had no
recording of the radio traffic during the entire six-hour assault.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's hostage rescue team had a tape that revealed that
Reno's order not to use pyrotechnic devices was violated; that the
first two hours of the assault were recorded on infrared videotape;
and that there was an audio recording of the use of pyrotechnic
devices being ordered by Richard Rogers, commander of the hostage
rescue team. For six years, that tape had been in the custody of
the hostage rescue team in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In his years as an Interior Department lawyer, Hardy said, he
became familiar with the federal Freedom of Information Act. After
he left government and returned to Tucson in 1988, he began to use
that law to gather material for his book.
</P>
<P>
   While his mostly civil law practice often had civil liberties
overtones _ he prosecuted one lawsuit that challenged gun control
and another that ultimately restricted government spying on
churches _ he disputes the suggestion that he is part of the
anti-government, militia, conspiracy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want information I'm entitled to have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for documents pertaining to the Davidian incident,
Hardy first sued the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which
conducted the botched raid that led to the 51-day siege and
subsequent fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ATF lawyers responded that certain materials it once had were
turned over to the Texas Rangers, which had gathered evidence from
the scene after the siege ended.
</P>
<P>
   He then filed a state open records request with the Rangers, who
told him they only had custody of the evidence and were not
authorized to release it without approval from the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circle was closed,'' Hardy said. ``The Justice Department
controlled it but didn't have it. The Rangers had it but didn't
control it. They could bat you back and forth forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they almost did.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1997 and 1998, he was passed from one agency to another:
the U.S. attorney's office, the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys,
the FBI, the ATF, the Rangers again.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, McNulty was pursuing material for a sequel to his
first Waco film, this one titled ``Waco: A New Revelation.'' He was
encountering the same run-around.
</P>
<P>
   More vocally anti-government than Hardy, McNulty once hosted a
talk radio show and billed himself as chairman of the Citizens
Organization for Public Safety of Fort Collins, Colo. But Waco was
his passion and his research was dogged enough that lawyers in the
wrongful death lawsuits paid him for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what he considered stonewalling by the government,
McNulty began calling on Bill Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney
in Waco, who would play a peculiar role in the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Once accused of covering up, Johnston would suddenly turn
whistle-blower. During congressional hearings in 1995, Fort Worth
attorney Tim Evans, who represented one of the Davidians charged
with murder in the death of four ATF agents, gave the committee an
internal ATF memo which alleged that Johnston ordered the agents to
stop their internal investigation into the assault on the Davidian
compound. Johnston, the memo said, did not want the ATF to develop
evidence that defense lawyers could use in the criminal trial of
the accused Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnston, according to one lawyer, ``had a change of
heart'' late last year and agreed to give McNulty limited access to
the evidence being held by the Rangers in Austin, Texas. Between
November and March, McNulty made four visits to the evidence room
and on one occasion he was accompanied by Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnston would not agree to an interview, but one source close
to him said the prosecutor initially thought McNulty was ``some
weirdo, conspiracy nut'' and that there was nothing in the evidence
that would contradict the official version of the Davidian events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought there was no reason not to let him look at the
material,'' the source said. ``Back then (last November), there was
no controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said that although McNulty was not allowed to make copies
of documents, he observed things, including projectiles he believed
were pyrotechnic, that had not been previously revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He faxed me a list of evidence and asked if I would file an
FOI request for them,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, 1999, Hardy sent another open records request to the
Rangers and an identical FOI request to Johnston. On March 17, he
received a reply from Austin: All evidence ``remains in control of
the U.S. Marshals'' and ``is not under the control of the Texas
Department of Public Safety.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made the same request to the U.S. Marshals Service, he
was told that a search ``failed to locate any record which
indicates the (Marshals Service) has control over the documents,
videotapes and audio tapes which are in possession of (the
Rangers).''
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the Rangers in May, Hardy was told the U.S.
Attorney's office had ordered them not to release evidence without
federal permission, but the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys said
none of the material was under its control.
</P>
<P>
   In short, everyone disavowed control of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a final letter to the Rangers, Hardy wrote, ``I may be
stating the obvious, but it appears the federal agencies may be
setting you up. DPS takes the flak for withholding the records _
they benefit _ but the moment the withholding is challenged, they
disavow any responsibility and pin the blame on you. In fact, the
Marshal's answer hints that they don't have the foggiest idea what
you are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the legal channels were sealed off, Hardy turned
to a political course.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of the Tucson Rod &AMP; Gun Club and attorney for
an Arizona sheriff who challenged the Brady law, Hardy had friends
in the gun lobby. Some of those friends in Texas steered him to
Jerry Patterson, the former state senator from the Houston area who
sponsored the legislation that gave Texans the right to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was out of office and lobbying for the health
insurance industry, Patterson said, ``I guess I'm the gun guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy faxed him the file of his correspondence with various
government agencies, which led Patterson also to believe that the
Rangers were being used by the feds to conceal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Clay Johnson, Gov. (George W.) Bush's chief of staff,
just to give him a heads-up in case Bush had to answer questions
about it,'' Patterson said. ``He told me to call Jim Francis.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, chairman of the Department of Public Safety, was a
veteran political operative who had run campaigns for Texas Sens.
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, as well as Govs. Bush and
Clements. He is presently raising funds to elect Bush president.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on the U.S. Justice Department may not have been
politically motivated, but it promised political reward. Bush, the
GOP front-runner, was not in office during the fires of Waco. Vice
President Al Gore, seeking nomination by the Democrats, was. Any
unfavorable light shed on the Justice Department could reflect onto
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Francis ordered the Rangers to begin sifting through the
evidence that was in their possession and asked U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith in Waco to impound all evidence in the Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith agreed and ordered all federal agents to turn over to the
court all material they had.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, the FBI and the ATF were facing the possibility
that the evidence, once in the hands of the court, could become
public.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty's film, containing information from his visits to the
evidence rooms, was about to be released. And, Francis had received
reports from the Rangers about the use of pyrotechnic tear gas
grenades by the FBI as well as intriguing questions about the role
of the Army's elite Delta Force, which officials had said was there
only to observe.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the spin scramble was on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Danny Coulson of Dallas, former deputy director of the FBI,
told the Dallas Morning News that two pyrotechnic devices had,
indeed, been fired the day the Davidian compound went up in flames.
But, he said, they were fired several hours before the blaze and
were fired at a bunker 40 yards from the house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnston, taking a stand against the agency for which he
works, went public with a memo advising Reno that she had been
duped by her own agents. Johnston was criticized by his boss, U.S.
Atty. Bill Blagg in San Antonio, but praised by others for his
change of heart. ``I don't know how he plans on keeping his job,''
Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston and Blagg would not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reno ordered a new investigation into the Waco case and the
FBI's hostage rescue team came up with a long concealed videotape
on which the head of the team is heard authorizing the use of
``military devices'' _ pyrotechnic grenades _ on the day of the
final assault at Mount Carmel. U.S. Marshals were dispatched to
confiscate that tape, which the FBI had previously denied existed.
</P>
<P>
   _ While it was being accused of a six-year cover-up, the Justice
Department went to federal court to fight Judge Smith's order that
it relinquish all Davidian evidence. While Johnston was airing the
FBI's secrets, his boss, Blagg, was being ordered into Smith's
court ``to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court''
if the government does not comply with the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, however, lawyers in the wrongful death lawsuits
filed by the more than 70 survivors of Davidians who died in the
fire were still trying to get Smith to delay the Oct. 18 trial
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been given 30 days for discovery,'' said Houston
attorney Jim Brannon, who represents three dead children of David
Koresh. ``It could take months to go through that evidence, if we
ever see it, and to depose everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the lawyer who pushed Waco back into the headlines
and back into Congress is a little amused by the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem strange that a couple of unknown characters could
finally get this out in the open,'' Hardy said.

   Jane Jacobs first visited Boston's North End at the end of the
Great Depression. Like most of Boston, the old hill was looking
pretty beat-up. It had been point of entry for many generations of
immigrants _ first the Yankees, then the Irish, Eastern Europeans,
and Sicilians. It was badly overcrowded. ``The general effect wsas
of a district taking a physical beating and certainly desperately
poor.''

were strewn among the townhouses and apartmentment buildings:
upholstery and carpentry shops, food stores, small factories,
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets were alive with children playing, people shopping,
people strolling, people talking. Had it not been a cold January
day, there surely would have been people sitting. The general
street atmosphere of buoyancy, friendliness and good health was so
infectious that I began asking directions just for the fun of
getting in on some talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' descriptions of city life in her seminal 1961 book ``The
Death and Life of Great American Cities'' have become the customary
starting point for descriptions of ``social capital,'' a somewhat
elusive concept that is intuitively understood to be connected in
important ways with economic growth and psychological well-being.
</P>
<P>
   For Jacobs, social capital consisted of ``neighborhood
networks,'' favor-banks and webs of expectation capable of
accelerating the transformation of whole groups to rich from poor.
The social capital in those crowded tenements in 1939 presumably
paved the way for the renaissance 20 years later and the prosperity
and general well-being that has continued to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   Social capital was introduced more formally by Harvard
government professor Robert Putnam in 1995 to mean those various
``features of social life _ networks, norms and trust _ that enable
participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's preferred illustration was a region of central Italy
where civic life was unusually rich in everything from newspapers
to choral groups. In contrast, he argued, Americans had dissipated
much of their inherited social capital and had begun ``bowling
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Social capital ordinarily is seen as being an attribute of the
community, not the citizen embedded in it. Lexington and Newton,
being organized around children and schools, have a lot of social
capital, in the form of soccer teams and science clubs. They have a
lot of conventional capital, too. Stoughton and Lynn presumably
have less. Yet the Brazilian community of Somerville and Cambridge,
with its nightly capuero dance/martial arts sessions, may have
more.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of economists working with a psychologist have set
out to tranform the conventional view of social capital by offering
a definition of the concept based on decisons of individuals.
(Glenn Loury of Boston Univerity was the earliest exponent of this
approach.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Networks are not merely the result of historical accident,''
write Edward Glaeser, David Laibson, Jose Scheinkman and Christine
Soutter. ``They come about as individuals spend time and energy to
connect with others.''
</P>
<P>
   So who invests in social capital and why? In ``What Is Social
Capital? The Determinants of Trust and Trustworthiness,'' available
from the National Bureau of Economic Research (working paper 7216
at www.nber.org) the authors set out an economic framework for
dealing individually with a phenomenon that previously has been
viewed only in terms of groups.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the economists do the usual: They simplify and
abtract? in an effort to cut through the dense thickets of
complexity surrounding these issues in the field. Instead of trying
to capture individual social capital in all its subtle grandeur _
meaning those characteristics including charisma, status, and
access to networks that permit an individual to gain from trade
with others _ they set out to measure trust and trustworthiness.
(Simple enough, until you consider that no strong behavioral
measures of trust or misanthropy are considered to exist.) Instead
of the ethnic diversity of the North End, they confined their
investigations to their own neighborhood _ Harvard College.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a combination of surveys and experiments performed on a
couple of hundred undergraduates, Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and
Soutter manage to demonstrate the ability of their approach to shed
light on some otherwise baffling questions.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments consisted of a pair of ``trust games'' of a sort
newly popular among social scientists. In the first, a two-person
game, the subjects were paired. They filled out a questionaire to
determine how they were socially linked (what friends in common,
what religious services, and so on). They were designated sender
and recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The sender was then given $15. The recipient made a pledge about
how he could be expected to behave in the game. The sender was
asked to send all, some, or none of the $15 to the recipient. The
experimenters then doubled whatever the sender chose to send. And
the recipient chose to send all, some, or none of the money back.
So in the case of extreme cooperation, both parties get $15. In
exteme beggar-they-neigbor, the results are $14 and $2, $1 or even
zero.
</P>
<P>
   The ``envelope drop'' was more complicated. Subjects
self-addressed an envelope; the experimenters put $10 into it and
announced they would drop it at one of several locations around
Harvard Square, sealed or open, stamped or unstamped. Subjects were
asked to evaluate the likelihood that they actually would receive
the money in the mail _ the valuation presumably representing the
subject's unvarnished confidence that a random passer-by would
return the money instead of pocketing it.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the subjects honest, the experimenters established a
certain benchmark of the liklihood that the money would be returned
in various circumstances; they promised to subtract pay the
difference if the subject offered less than the standard, or to
actually mail the envelope if the subject's valuation was more.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the information from these relatively simple
experients, sometimes in quite ingenious ways, the authors asserted
that they had demonstated three crucial propositions.
</P>
<P>
   _ People vary widely with respect to their ability to trust and
be trusted (meaning to commit resources to an activity where the
outcome depends on the cooperative behavior of others).
</P>
<P>
   _ Simple microeconomic models work pretty well in predicting
outcomes of simple experiments. Individuals with greater social
connection trusted each other more. People from different races and
nationalities behaved in a less trustworthy manner towards one
another. High-status individuals earned more in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Private returns to social capital may be quite different from
social returns, because there can be negative spillovers as well as
positive ones. A slick car salesman may have plenty of individual
capital, for example _ but he is likely to reduce the social
capital of any group that he joins.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of ``What Is Social Capital?'' lies mainly in
the identity of the authors. They are all possessors of heavy
social capital themselves. Glaeser and Laibson are professors at
Harvard University, members of the MacArthur Foundation Network on
Norms and Preferences and leaders of the new generation of
economists. Scheinkman for nearly 30 years was one of the high
priests of the economics department at the University of Chicago,
though he moved to Princeton University this year. Soutter, a
doctoral student in psychology, is proof of the increasing
relevance of that discipline to experimental economics.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that economics is coming to social issues where
previously it has had little or nothing to say. Doubtless it will
have many useful lessons about the nature of neighborliness to
convey.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time, however, before price theory offers
insights as deep as those routinely available in literary form from
the inimitable Jane Jacobs. Her new book, ``The Nature of
Economies,'' will be published by Random House next spring. With
her emphasis on natural selection and co-development, she is still
way ahead of the pack.

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ziad Doueiri stood in front of Kush, a Moroccan bar
on Orchard Street, under a blue banner with Arabic script, which he
said does not say Kush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't say one single thing _ it's hieroglyphics,''
Doueiri said with a laugh on Wednesday evening around 9:40. Another
chuckle, a little less sure. ``When Moroccans start to talk, I feel
like no wonder Arabs are fighting each other: I don't understand
what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Doueiri (pronounced DWER-ee) is a Lebanese-born filmmaker whose
first feature, ``West Beirut,'' is a coming-of-age story set in
Beirut at war, circa 1975. It opened on Friday in New York and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the bar, he took a credit-card-size tape recorder from
his pocket and played back a phone number he had recorded for
himself. ``I forget everything,'' he explained, playing the number
a second and a third time. Dialing a cell phone, he gave directions
to the bar to his friend Rachid Bouchareb, one of his movie's
producers, speaking French.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the same French that Tarek, the teen-age hero of
``West Beirut,'' played by Rami Doueiri, the filmmaker's younger
brother, makes merciless fun of in the opening scenes. The movie is
about young friends suddenly liberated from school by the outbreak
of civil war between Christians and Muslims. It pulses with the
flavor of the Middle East, garnished with references to American
pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Doueiri explained at Kush, even as Beirut was divided by
religious hatred in the 1970s, his own memories are as much about
the excitement with which he and other teen-agers welcomed the
latest from American pop culture. ``Mars chocolate bars arrived in
Lebanon _ it was a hit,'' he said. ``You want to go out on a date,
you show up with a Mars bar.'' A little later, Bubblicious bubble
gum, became available. ``Every chick in town came with a balloon,''
Doueiri recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Doueiri, a son of well-off Muslim Lebanese, came to the United
States when he was 20 to study filmmaking in California, where he
now lives, in Santa Monica. Although he has worked on the crew of
all of Quentin Tarrantino's films, his own feature has more of the
bemused tone of the recent ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kush, he greeted the women who arrived at his table with
five, six, seven audible cheek smooches. One was Rachel Marcus,
whom Doueiri introduced as ``mon amie.'' Tarek in the movie might
have admiringly described her as ``a piece of lamb.'' They held
hands under the table, and she rubbed his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, Hollywood, Morocco, the Lower East Side _ the swirl of
cultures gave the evening an exotic spin. Doueiri told about
getting swindled in Paris by a black-market money-changer and, a
week later, beating the guy up and getting his money back, plus
$100. Toward midnight, he was leaning back in his wrinkled white
cotton shirt, letting the film's producer and its distributor talk
in French.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking another smoke, he hunted unsuccessfully for rolling
papers in his bag. ``Rachel, do you have paper?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pen,'' she said. ``I can pull a piece out of my
book.'' Instead, he took one of the ready-made American Spirits
sitting on the table, fat and filtered. ``Look how thick they
are,'' he marveled, taking a puff. And another one. ``That's not
bad.''

SAN ANTONIO CHARITY TO SPEND $100 MILLION ON AREA CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a far-reaching effort to improve the plight
of children, a San Antonio charity has announced it will spend $100
million over 20 years to work with children from infancy to age 3
in four counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Kronkosky Charitable Foundation, founded just last year,
will choose nonprofit groups to develop programs for children in
Bexar, Bandera, Comal and Kendall counties.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Perry, chief of psychiatry at Texas Children's
Hospital in Houston, called the foundation's commitment to spend
$100 million on early childhood development over the next two
decades ``pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is unaware of any other single foundation that has
made such a large ``focused, commitment in a community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very, very wise choice of how to use limited
resources. ... If you took $100 million and you had a choice of how
you're really going to influence society over the next couple of
generations, then I think it's very smart to focus on children,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, an authority on the deleterious effects of neglect on the
brain, is one of several national experts who will gather for a
conference Sept. 24-25 in San Antonio to discuss a variety of early
childhood development issues. Topics include the impact of violent
video games on the brain, the effects of using television as a
baby-sitter, and cultural concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose is to raise children to a higher level of
priority,'' said Palmer Moe, executive director of the Kronkosky
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Moe hopes that eventually the foundation's efforts will lead to
better understanding by parents and child-care workers of the
crucial developmental stages of children from birth to age 3.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge, in turn, should lead to children ``entering
school a little better prepared to learn,'' he said. ``The research
has shown the first three years of the development of a child is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a foundation we're fairly new, but we had done a number of
round-table discussions with the groups our foundation funds,'' Moe
said. ``And in many of those discussions, the importance of early
childhood (development) has been very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said his presentation will focus on the importance good
parenting and nurturing of young children.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has invited a number of groups involved in early
childhood development to the seminar to discuss research and
innovative programs in that field.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas gleaned from the conference will be combined with results
of a survey of childhood needs the foundation has commissioned and
follow-up focus groups as a basis for soliciting and selecting
projects to fund over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the foundation's efforts could lead to improvements
in child-care programs and school curricula, Moe said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the impact the Kronkosky Foundation may
have over the plight of children will not be known for some time.
``We're not going to know whether this program is effective for 10,
15 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kronkosky Foundation was endowed in 1997 by a $295 million
grant from the estate of the late Albert Kronkosky, whose business
enterprises included the Gebhardt Chili Powder Co. and the San
Antonio Drug Co.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation funds programs aimed at eliminating childhood
abuse and neglect as well as a number of other human services and
cultural programs.

FRANCOPHONIE SUMMIT SPLITS FRENCH- AND ENGLISH-SPEAKING CANADIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONCTON, New Brunswick _ In the cultural odd couple that is
Canada, the English were carping Friday as the French welcomed
their linguistic in-laws from around the world for a summit called
the Francophonie.
</P>
<P>
   As Acadian residents here fairly burst with pride to receive
leaders from 52 countries with French-speaking populations,
Canada's English press turned a deaf ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francophonie, or is that francophoney?'' headlined an
editorial Friday in The Chronicle-Herald of Halifax. Another
Halifax newspaper headlined its editorial this week: ``Canada
hosting a squalid summit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the hostility revolved around the ``Pinochet
syndrome.'' Canadian newspapers, both French and English,
questioned why their country should roll out red carpets for
leaders of Burundi, Burkina Faso, Congo and Rwanda, African
governments that rank high on Amnesty International's list of human
rights violators.
</P>
<P>
   After an internal debate last month, Canada's government decided
to admit all the country delegations. But Canada's prime minister,
Jean Chretien, said this week that the 13-year-old linguistic
organization should give itself the power to purge human rights
violators. Friday, he urged the gathering: ``Let us all work to
ensure that the legacy we leave to future generations is a
Francophonie made up of countries where democratic values are
embraced.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where the ``two solitudes'' _ the English and
French _ often talk past the other, the English press has used the
rights debate as a green light for a festival of French-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Globe and Mail, usually a pillar of Canadian political
correctness, ran a cartoon Wednesday showing a uniformed African
dictator seated on a pile of skulls. A nattily dressed Frenchman is
shown sipping Champagne and saying, ``Still, his accent is
flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   A news analysis article in the paper described the language club
as having ``a dubious membership'' including ``odd ducks.'' It
concluded that the group ``remains the Seymour Milquetoast of
international organizations: little known, and even less
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Post, Canada's other national newspaper, published
its own cartoon of an African dictator, this one embraced by a
pot-bellied man in a beret, saying with a grin, ``You can choose
your friends, but not your family, no?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Moncton, which boasts Canada's highest per capita
concentration,'' of ``bloodthirsty human rights violators,'' Paul
Wells wrote Friday in a front page article in the Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazette, Montreal's last surviving major English daily
newspaper, headlined its Francophonie editorial: ``Invited, but not
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, coverage in Canada's French language press seems to
be from a different planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Francophonie wants to save youth from misery,'' La Presse,
Montreal's largest selling newspaper headlined recently, focussing
on the youth theme of the summit, which meets in a French-speaking
location every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Le Devoir, Quebec's intellectual daily, headlined the interest
of the French president, Jacques Chirac, for New Brunswick's
250,000 French-speaking Acadians: ``Chirac wants international
recognition for the Acadians.'' Acadia was a French colony
encompassing much of eastern Canada until the mid-18th century,
when the British expelled French inhabitants, many of whom later
found their way back.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Moncton, the traditional capital of the Acadian
community, was gaily bedecked with the community's flag _ a French
tricolor with a gold star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moncton, center of the universe Francophone!'' proudly
headlined ``L'Acadie Nouvelle,'' the French daily in New Brunswick,
Canada's only officially bilingual province.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the cuts and slights in the English language press,
Carol Doucet, the press coordinator for the summit and an Acadian,
said, ``This is the most exciting event we have ever seen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 1,100 journalists had gathered here, double the
expected number, she stressed, ``This is reviving our pride in
being francophone.''
</P>
<P>
   With a multi-national fair and a string of parties and street
celebrations, Acadians here are sounding like their Lousiana
cousins, the Cajuns, who often proclaim, ``Let the good times
roll!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an invitation apparently missed by Canada's English
press, L'Etoile newspaper commanded on the eve of the three-day
gathering here: ``Que la fete commence!'' _ Let the party start!

PONTIAC BONNEVILLE IS ALL NEW FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it still looks much like it did last year, the Pontiac
Bonneville is all new for 2000. And it is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   No, Pontiac's flagship sedan is not anything like the big,
boatlike Bonnevilles of the 1960s and '70s. Those cars are gone
forever. This new one follows in the footsteps of its immediate
predecessor, a model that stuck around basically unchanged for
seven years. But in the new model, the body panels have been
changed, and the windshield now is raked back at a steeper angle
than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   This newest generation of Pontiac's full-size car is built on
the same General Motors chassis, called the G-platform, as the new
Buick Le Sabre, Cadillac Seville and soon-to-be-introduced 2001
Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac introduced the Bonneville name on a convertible in 1957,
and later applied the name to its top full-size car. The 2000 model
continues the tradition Bonneville has set as the biggest and best
Pontiac, but this one is aimed more at baby boomers than its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other GM luxury-car divisions _ Buick, Oldsmobile and
Cadillac _ Pontiac has not had problems getting baby-boomers and
those younger into its showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the 70s, Pontiac wisely repositioned itself as a
performance-brand alternative to the lesser-priced Chevrolets. Cars
such as the Firebird (and its Trans Am version) and the Sunfire
compact convertible have given Pontiac a youthful look and feel,
and the brand's participation in NASCAR racing has kept it young
and fresh in many consumers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   But just like other upscale U.S. car brands, Pontiac is battling
the popularity of Japanese and European luxury sedans. The new
Bonneville, while not exactly a direct competitor to the Lexus ES
300, offers those who can afford a car in this price class an
alternative to an import.
</P>
<P>
   With prices starting at $25,700 for a popularly equipped base SE
model, and ranging up to $33,825 for a well-equipped
top-of-the-line SSEi version, the Bonneville should be able to
compete against Toyota's full-size Avalon, the Lexus ES 300,
Infiniti's I30, Acura's TL, Audi's A6, BMW's 3-series, Volvo's S70,
Saab's 9-5, and Chrysler's Concorde and 300M.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'm going out on a limb, because many import buyers never
consider a domestic model, particularly in the luxury or
near-luxury segments. But Oldsmobile has been able to win over some
of those consumers with the excellent Aurora _ one of the best
sedans ever built. I believe Pontiac will do the same with the new
Bonneville if it gets the message out.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that Americans want to buy American cars. But they
want to be sure that they are getting value, style and substance
when they hand over the big bucks for a car that costs the same as
a Japanese or European luxury car. We want to believe that our
automakers can build cars that are just as good as the offshore
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac hopes to sell 60,000 Bonnevilles to individuals this
model year, along with another 20,000 to corporate and rental-car
fleets. That's up more than 20,000 from last year's total sales of
59,638 for the Bonneville, but still below the Bonneville's 92,672
sales record for the '90s set in the '94 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The base SE and the midlevel SLE models come with a 3.8-liter,
pushrod V-6 engine rated at 205 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of
torque. SE buyers are expected to have an average age of 50, with
an average household income of $70,000. Demographics for the SLE
and SSEi models are a bit different: average age 45 and household
income $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   The SLE (priced $30,300 well-equipped) has the slightly
different and more aggressive exterior of the SSEi, including
deletion of the chrome found on the less-expensive SE. But it
carries the same engine as the SE model.
</P>
<P>
   To get the best engine, consumers must choose the SSEi, which is
the Bonneville's truly fun model. It comes with a supercharged
version of the 3.8-liter V-6, rated at 240 horsepower and 280
foot-pounds of torque. Other performance features of the SSEi not
found on the lesser models include the StabiliTrak
computer-controlled suspension system.
</P>
<P>
   All Bonnevilles come with a smooth-shifting, electronically
controlled four-speed automatic transmission, but there are two
versions: one for the base engine and a heavy-duty gearbox for the
SSEi's supercharged engine.
</P>
<P>
   Even the base model has excellent handling characteristics and
great pickup. But the SSEi is the embodiment of Pontiac's theme:
``We drive excitement.'' The SSEi will accelerate from zero to 60
mph in an impressive seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   All Bonnevilles come standard with seating for five passengers _
two bucket seats up front and a roomy bench seat in the rear. But
the SE and SLE models can be ordered with a bench seat up front so
the vehicle can seat up to six people.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on all Bonnevilles includes front and side
air bags for the front seats, four-wheel disc brakes with antilock
system, power rack-and-pinion steering, air conditioning, automatic
power door locks, power windows with one-touch express-down feature
for driver and passenger windows up front, remote power outside
mirrors, integrated front fog lights, tilt steering wheel and
cruise control. The high-tech radio reads programming information
from participating radio stations, displaying the station's format
and sometimes listing the title and artist of the song being
played.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous trunk holds 18 cubic feet of stuff, and there is
plenty of head, knee and leg room for three adults in the rear
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The SSEi offers more technological gizmos than the SE and SLE
models, including 83 user-programmable functions that allow two
people to set up the car differently. The car comes with two
separate remote controls that are programmed individually to
remember the settings preferred by the person carrying the
particular remote.
</P>
<P>
   Features include seat positions, radio channel buttons and tone
settings, the way the automatic door locks work, the interior
lighting that comes on automatically when entering or exiting,
heating and air-conditioning temperature settings. This is truly
innovative, and is a huge step beyond the simple programmable
memory seats that most luxury cars offer.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-way power driver and passenger leather bucket seats are
standard on the SSEi. A driver information system displays 15
functions, and a heads-up display projects the car's speed and
other information (including a warning to check gauges if there is
a problem) on the lower part of the windshield in front of the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowed from Saab are the Bonneville's new self-adjusting
headrests, which are built into the front seatbacks. Catcher's
mitt-style bucket seats automatically surround the driver and
passenger like a ball in a catcher's mitt in the event of a
rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
   Front-seat safety belts are attached to the seats rather than
the car's frame so they are more comfortable and move with the
seats when the seats are repositioned.
</P>
<P>
   Among other safety and security features are the limp-home
coolant system, which allows the car to be driven to safety after
losing its coolant, and a battery rundown-protection system that
turns off all lights 10 minutes after occupants have exited the
vehicle (even lights inadvertently left on).
</P>
<P>
   Standard wheels are 16-inch on the SE, but 17-inch on the SLE
and SSEi.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 19 miles per gallon in the city and
30 on the highway for the base engine, and 17 mpg city/28 highway
for the supercharged engine. The tank holds 18.5 gallons of fuel;
regular unleaded is recommended for the base engine, while premium
fuel is preferred for the SSEi.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bonnevilles are now beginning to arrive at Pontiac
dealerships nationwide.

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ If you had not visited this city of
dreamy minarets and dazzling skyscrapers before last week, you
might wonder whether the Asian crisis ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Malaysia's leaders dedicated the Petronas Twin
Towers, a futuristic colossus that is the world's tallest building.
As fireworks blazed and laser beams pierced the night skies, the
prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, declared, ``We need something to
express our towering ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia did suffer a humbling economic collapse, of course, as
the half-empty towers attest. But with the country now showing
signs of a robust recovery, Mahathir is exuding victory and
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its neighbors, Malaysia chose to fend off the Asian
typhoon by boarding up its windows. Drawing the wrath of the
free-market West, it imposed sweeping controls on its capital
markets _ suspending off-shore trading in its currency and locking
foreign capital in the country for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir says the moves protected Malaysia from the predations
of foreign currency traders. Without controls, he says, the traders
would have caused wild swings in the currency, which could have
decimated the economy and ignited social unrest in this multiracial
society. Business people here initially balked, but most now rally
around the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not implode as a society. There were no mass riots on
the streets, as in Indonesia,'' said Francis Yeoh, an
ethnic-Chinese tycoon who is one of Malaysia's richest men. ``It is
not half-vindication, it is full vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Malaysia relaxed its rules on the repatriation of
capital. Now, as foreign investors weigh whether to pour money back
into Malaysia, Mahathir's policy is getting another hearing.
Economists, fund managers, business people and even officials at
the International Monetary Fund acknowledge that Mahathir appears
to have won his risky gamble.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most economists and policy-makers still view capital
controls with deep skepticism. They say that shutting off markets
and freezing currencies can strangle investment and cause damaging
distortions.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Neiss, director of Asia-Pacific operations at the IMF,
said at a seminar in Tokyo this week that Malaysia's recovery had
little to do with the controls. But he also said Malaysia should
not be condemned for the move.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists say Mahathir has proved that controls can be
useful in dire situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a case for capital controls in principle
during a crisis,'' said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wrote an influential
article defending controls in Fortune magazine on the eve of
Malaysia's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument was that they were impractical _ that they would
inevitably screw up the real economy,'' he said. ``What Malaysia
has shown is that they are actually more workable than everyone
claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Malaysia's performance has confounded skeptics, who
predicted the controls would deplete reserves and stop the economy
in its tracks. After contracting 6.7 percent last year, Malaysia's
gross domestic product rose 4.1 percent in the second quarter. The
country's reserves, far from diminishing, have shot up 60 percent,
to $32 billion, since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not like or trust statistics, just visit the shops
and restaurants,'' said a defiant Mahathir in a speech here this
week. ``Only, give yourself a little extra time _ because I am
afraid the traffic jams have come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister also noted that relatively little capital has
flowed out of the country since the controls were relaxed _ defying
those who had said that Malaysia would be hit by wholesale capital
flight on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say, however, that his arguments have a few holes.
Thailand and Korea are rebounding even more quickly than Malaysia,
despite leaving their markets open and allowing their currencies to
fluctuate. And while billions of dollars of foreign capital have
not stampeded out of the country, that is partly because most of it
had fled before Malaysia imposed the controls.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains: Was Malaysia smart or lucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got lucky because they put the controls on just as
pressure lifted off the other regional currencies,'' said David
Devine, a director at Overlook, an investment fund based in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   If the currencies in Thailand, Korea and Indonesia had continued
to fall after Malaysia had imposed its controls, Devine said,
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, would have been overvalued. That
would have undercut the country's exports and created a black
market in ringgit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the opposite happened. Because the Thai baht and the
Indonesian rupiah rose while the ringgit was fixed to the U.S.
dollar at 3.8 to the dollar, Malaysia's currency became relatively
cheap. That made Malaysia's exports _ led by computers and
peripherals _ extremely competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's exports were plummeting until August 1998,''
said P.K. Basu, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in
Singapore. ``They stabilized in August and started roaring in
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Malaysia had permanently alienated foreign funds _
the same people who bankrolled its economic development by pouring
money into the country for much of the 1990s. And there are some
investors who say they plan to steer clear of Malaysia, regardless
of its newly relaxed rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, you've got a government that makes its own
rules,'' said Henry Lee, the managing director of Hendale Asia, an
investment fund in Hong Kong. ``We've exited because we see a lot
of problems there.''
</P>
<P>
   But an informal survey of regional money managers in Asia
indicates that more people may think like Devine of Overlook. He
said he would put money back in Malaysia, provided he could earn a
decent return. ``My view is that the investment community has a
short memory,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is not clear that Malaysia even wants
short-term capital to return. As part of its new rules, it
instituted a tax on investment profits that heavily favors
foreigners who leave their money in the country for at least a
year. And Mahathir is hardly putting out the welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some foreign fund managers are pessimistic, but to me,
it doesn't matter very much,'' he said after his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies with operations in Malaysia, like Intel and
Dell Computer, have not been harmed by the controls. They were
exempt from the bans on moving money in and out of the country. In
fact, some executives say the ringgit's fixed-exchange rate made it
a bit easier to do planning.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahathir imposed the controls, he said they would give the
country desperately needed breathing space to repair its economy.
There was, and is, plenty to do: Many of Malaysia's banks are
insolvent. And its corporations are a catalog of dubious business
practices, prospering on their connections to politicians and
plowing billions of dollars into reckless projects.
</P>
<P>
   The state oil company, Petronas, spent $800 million to build the
Petronas Twin Towers. Although they were completed in 1996, they
are only now attracting tenants. Petronas is also the lead investor
in Putrajaya, Malaysia's new capital city. A pet project of
Mahathir, the city is being built from scratch for $5.2 billion in
a palm plantation south of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   While Malaysia has made a few strides _ whittling down the
number of bad loans in its banks to a creditable 12.8 percent of
the total loan portfolio _ analysts here said Mahathir's record as
a reformer is paltry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has abused this window of opportunity to save his cronies,
rather than undertaking the reforms that are necessary,'' said K.S.
Jomo, a political economist at the University of Malaya.
</P>
<P>
   Jomo is particularly critical of a recently announced plan to
consolidate Malaysia's 21 commercial banks, 25 finance companies
and 12 merchant banks into six large banking groups. The mergers
favor bankers allied with Daim Zainuddin, the powerful finance
minister, while punishing those friendly with the ousted deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's economic policy has been accompanied by Draconian
political moves from the beginning. Mahathir dismissed Anwar, his
heir apparent, the day after he announced the controls. Anwar, who
had opposed the measures, was subsequently sentenced to six years
in jail on corruption charges that his defenders say were trumped
up. He is now standing trial on a charge of sodomy, which he
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's heavy-handed treatment of his former protege
unleashed a storm of protest in this normally placid country. While
the street protests were not deadly as in Indonesia, they gave
birth to the most serious opposition movement the prime minister
has faced in his 18 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The protests also echoed abroad. In a report issued this week,
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said, ``Step by
step, the Malaysian government has undermined constitutional
protection, weakened key institutions and put in place an array of
restrictive laws that stifle public debate and dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir responded by asking why Amnesty International did not
investigate the behavior of currency traders. Such sarcasm is
typical of the 73-year-old prime minister, who seems to delight in
thumbing his nose at the global political and financial
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mahathir reserved his most acerbic lines for the
IMF. He said the fund had worsened the crisis in Thailand, Korea
and Indonesia by insisting on high interest rates and deep cuts in
government spending. By shunning the IMF, he said Malaysia had
avoided impoverishing its people and handing over its corporate
crown jewels to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to achieve what others have achieved,''
Mahathir said, ``without having to sell our family silver and
precious heirlooms, without having to auction off our precious
corporations to foreigners at fire-sale prices, and without having
to bend or bow to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Mahathir's claims, he has not swayed his neighbors.
Thailand, Korea and Indonesia have left their markets open. Few
Asian leaders even seem in the mood to debate the issue. The
Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research group
here, had hoped to draw top officials from around the region to a
symposium this week on capital controls. Most declined the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   If Mahathir was trying to be the pied piper of the emerging
markets, however, it was scarcely evident in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were and are fortunate that no one has followed or said
they intend to follow Malaysia's example,'' he declared. ``A
heretic can be tolerated. But a heresy cannot.''

at home for a great first year in power. While North Koreans have
been reduced to dining on concoctions of roots and leaves, the

airport terminal, under construction round the clock to be finished
in time for the Oct. 1 festivities. But among the more than $13

   RUSSIA-CAUCASUS _ TBILISI, Georgia _ It may seem like a small
war. But looks are deceiving. Russia's latest military action in
its southern republic of Dagestan has far-reaching implications for
the stability of the former superpower and the well-being of the
oil-rich Caspian Sea region. Russia declared victory two weeks ago
when Russian forces managed to re-take several villages and push
many of the guerrillas out of Dagestan, back across the border into
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. But the Chechen warlords, now
back in Chechnya, vow they will regroup and return to challenge
Russian forces in Dagestan. It was a clear sign that Russia may
have won some battles, but it has not won the war. (Cox News

 &HT;    WITH ALBRIGHT WATCHING, ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS REACH BELATED
AGREEMENT
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Though long-delayed and requiring the watchful eye
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, negotiators
completed an agreement late Friday on the next step in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reworks the Wye River land-for-security accord
signed last October at the White House, which was months behind
schedule and had left the Middle East peace process in a perilous
drift.
</P>
<P>
   When it is signed at an expected ceremony in the Egyptian resort
town of Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday, hosted by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, it will be the first agreement penned by new Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barak who insisted, with occasional ultimatums, on
renegotiating the Wye Memorandum peace agreement. He sought to slow
down the transfers of land to Palestinians and wanted more
assurances about where the process was ultimately headed. The Wye
plan is a phase in the Oslo peace process, which outlines Israeli
withdrawals from Arab lands captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement on revisions to the Wye plan was originally
supposed to be complete for Albright's arrival in the region
Thursday. Instead she had to become involved in what she called a
``handmaiden'' role for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Now, completion of the agreement frees Albright to spend the
remaining two days of her regional tour on the issues she came for
originally: long-range plans for a comprehensive peace between the
Palestinians, Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to visit Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus before the signing ceremony on Saturday, and will go to
Jordan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to announce that the Israelis and Palestinians
have an agreement to implement the Wye agreement,'' Albright said,
emerging from a late-night meeting with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat spoke by phone with President Bill Clinton and Barak,
informing them he approved of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked hand-in-hand in order to achieve the peace of
the brave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton congratulated both Arafat and Barak, as well
as Albright, ``for . . . seizing this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that when both sides are willing to work together,
their fundamental requirements can be met, confidence can be built
and the process can move forward,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian Planning Minister and negotiator Nabil Shaath
noted that this was an incremental step in a tough process.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say this is an entirely new agreement, since it is
part of a timeline and a succession of agreements,'' he said.
``But, we can say it is a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A step forward was needed. The peace process had been frozen,
over U.S. objections, by Barak's predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu
since January. Now, according to the new agreement, the next
Israeli troop withdrawals are scheduled to take place within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   By continuing the freeze on Wye and insisting on renegotiating,
Barak gained on several points.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement requires troop withdrawals to begin within
days, but stretches them out through mid-January. It requires that
a framework for the largest issues looming between the two sides,
including whether Israel will share Jerusalem or allow Palestinian
refugees to return to land in Israel, be drawn up as the
withdrawals are ending _ with the goal of an overall settlement by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians, the new agreement makes it harder for
Israel to freeze the process, allows the immediate commencement of
construction of a port in The Gaza Strip worth $80 million and
requires the release of 350 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli
jails _ though the Palestinians had wanted 650 released.
</P>
<P>
   After the withdrawals, the Palestinians would have full or
partial control of 42 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner agreement was one of the last major snags resolved
Friday and one of the most politically sensitive for Barak and
Arafat. Israelis fear the release of terrorists and Palestinians
yearn to see the family members they consider freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were being followed closely Friday in the Abu
Radaha family in a refugee camp in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
There, two sons are on a two-week old hunger strike in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
   Amir, 24, was sentenced to life in 1991 for killing Palestinians
who collaborated with Israel and Sahdi, 37(CQ), got 15 years for
anti-Israel activities, including hitting a Jewish woman with a
bar. Their family considers both heroes of a war that is now
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Israelis want to make peace, they can only make it with
families and people themselves, not with governments,'' said
brother Samiya Hassan Abu Radaha. ``To do that, you must release
the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in jail for
political crimes, but Shaath told CNN that Israel had promised to
do two more releases within a year.

BUSH CALLS FOR BETTER TIES WITH MEXICO

   EAGLE PASS, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday that
the United States should embrace Mexico as an ally on par with
Canada and Britain, and faulted the Clinton administration for not
extending the North American free trade zone into Central and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, using a campaign tone in a bridge dedication ceremony
attended by President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, said whoever wins
the presidential elections in each country next year must elevate
U.S.-Mexico relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the United States and Mexico to be
joined by the same common bonds of trust to establish a special
relationship more solid and more stable than ever before,'' said
Bush, the apparent front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``History for many years divided our nations. It is a story
filled with differences, slights and wrongs,'' Bush said. ``Now it
falls on us, in friendship and respect, to make new (chapters) of
history on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo used the occasion to stress that free trade and new
bridges would translate into better jobs and lives for poor
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good example of the new understanding we are
building between our countries,'' Zedillo said from a podium set up
in the middle of the bridge over the Rio Grande, the boundary
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, this constructive spirit extends to state and
city governments on both sides of the border,'' said Zedillo, who
first met Bush about five years ago when they were newly elected to
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized the Clinton administration for failing to extend
free trade to all of Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen firsthand the benefits of free trade,'' Bush said.
``The current administration missed the opportunity to extend the
promise of free trade beyond Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade between the United States and Mexico is now $200 billion a
year, and U.S. exports to Mexico have doubled since 1993, Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for adding Mexico to the list of what he called ``special
allies,'' Bush pointed to what he said were historical, linguistic
and cultural ties with Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the United States and Mexico to be
joined by the same common bonds of trust, to establish a special
relationship (that is) more solid and more stable than ever
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people packed the Camino Real International
Bridge linking Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The six-lane span, which cost the United States approximately
$30 million, is expected to divert commercial traffic from the
downtown area and result in safer and shorter lines for cars.
Mexico contributed about $15 million for the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo praised Bush and Clinton as friends of Mexico and called
for the two countries to continue to pursue a relationship of
dignity, respect and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship has been a tense one because of the flow of
drugs and illegal immigrants across the border. Some members of
Congress have accused the Mexican government of failing to crack
down on corruption in the military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Zedillo shared a few private comments during the
ceremony and met for approximately 30 minutes in Mexico at a new
Customs inspection facility there.

<P>
   From the start of Friday's gathering, Bush was stuck with a
presidential theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, all right!'' came a deep and distinct yell from
the crowd as Bush stepped to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Callate!'' replied a smiling and laughing Bush, enlisting the
Spanish for ``shut up.'' The crowd laughed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the celebration, which included renditions of the
respective national anthems by the Eagle Pass High School band and
the official band for the state of Coahuila, the bridge isn't
expected to open until final touches are completed the last week of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Reba, head of the U.S. Customs Service for the region from
Brownsville to Del Rio, said the new bridge would funnel all
tractor-trailer rigs from downtown Eagle Pass, making life easier
for tourists and commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see a tremendous increase in passenger traffic,''
Reba said. ``We should see a much prettier downtown.''

RENO TO NAME OUTSIDE NVESTIGATOR TO HEAD WACO INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday she will
name an outside investigator to head an inquiry into the
government's 1993 standoff near Waco, Texas, with the Branch
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who for six years had denied FBI involvement in the blaze
that ended the siege, said only an independent inquiry could
``ensure that the American public has confidence and faith in
whatever that investigation reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the person she selects will have no conflicts of
interest in investigating the Justice Department, be ``well
received'' by the public and have time to conduct the inquiry
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation focused on former Republican Senator John Danforth
of Missouri and former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, according
to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the attorney general's planned
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has confidence in the Department of Justice,''
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said. ``We certainly support the
attorney general's decision to get to the bottom of this through an
independent inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments came as the Justice Department released a second
videotape indicating that FBI agents might have used pyrotechnic
gas canisters before storming the Branch Davidian compound. The
tapes showed up long after Reno had testified to Congress that no
tear gas canisters with the potential to start a fire had been used
in the final FBI action against the cult group. At least 80 people,
including leader David Koresh, were killed by gunfire or the blaze
that erupted during the April 19 raid on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her call for an investigation, Reno said she continues
to accept the earlier federal report on the siege, which concluded
that Branch Davidians shot fellow cult members and ignited the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts that we know now indicate that the FBI did not set
that fire,'' Reno said. ``That fire was set by David Koresh and the
people in that building.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general called it ``vitally, critically
important that we pursue every aspect of the investigation to
ensure that the truth will come out.'' Reno did not set a deadline
for the investigation and said the investigator would have free
reign in structuring his or her inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   She also rejected recent Republican calls for her resignation
over the FBI revelations, saying that she would be willing to
``take the consequences'' if the outside investigation concludes
that she bears culpability in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should be accountable for what I do,'' Reno said.
``If I've done nothing wrong, but something went awry, I should
figure out what it was and try to take steps to see that it doesn't
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who was attorney general for just a few weeks when the
FBI's 51-day standoff with the cult ended, received public acclaim
for accepting responsibility for the raid and its deadly aftermath.
Reminded of that praise, the attorney general reiterated that ``the
buck ultimately stops with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno on Wednesday ordered U.S. marshals to seize from the FBI
previously undisclosed videotapes of the final day of the standoff.
The tapes, taken by an FBI surveillance airplane, seem to show an
FBI agent firing a pyrotechnic gas canister in an unsuccessful
attempt to penetrate a concrete bunker some distance from the
Branch Davidians' main facility about four hours before the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Friday that she ordered the tapes to be seized in
order to comply with a Waco federal judge's mandate. U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith has requested all relevant evidence from the
Justice Department as he prepares to hear next month a
wrongful-death lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by
family members of Branch Davidians killed during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Reno disputed reports that her decision to have marshals seize
the FBI recordings, rather than have the bureau surrender them
peacefully, was meant to insult the FBI in retaliation for not
having told her earlier of the tapes' existence. Rather, the use of
federal marshals is a routine measure in gathering court-requested
evidence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do here is to make sure that we've got
the evidence, that we follow the court order, that we do everything
by the book,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general added that she is not angry with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes anger obscures the truth,'' she said. ``So I try to
(seek the truth) as calmly and as clearly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also refuted widespread reports that her relationship with
FBI director Louis Freeh had been frayed by the FBI's belated
revelation about the possible use of pyrotechnic munitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Freeh and I have what I think is one of the best
relationships people could have in law enforcement,'' she
said.``The one thing I know is that when I call Louis Freeh and say
`I need to talk to you,' I'm getting a straight answer.''

IN AN ISOLATED POCKET OF SYRIA, THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY JESUS
SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALULA, Syria _ These days, Damascus lies just 45 minutes away,
on improved roads that mean that the journey between this isolated
village and the capital no longer strikes anyone as forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   But linguistically, Malula is still a place unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the barren Qalamun Mountains the people do not speak
Arabic, at least among themselves. That language has been the
lingua franca in this part of the world for more than 1,000 years,
but theirs is even older, going back nearly 3,000 years to around
900 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The language is Aramaic, the one spoken by Jesus Christ.
Everywhere else, it died out centuries ago, but here, somehow, it
has endured, insulated by isolation and nurtured by pride. Only in
Malula, with a population of about 5,000, and in two nearby
villages does Aramaic survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Damascus, people look at us funny, and they ask what
language are you speaking,'' said Assad Barkeel, 24. Like nearly
everyone else here, Barkeel learned Aramaic from the cradle, and
also like nearly everyone else, he says he is determined to pass on
the gift to another generation.
</P>
<P>
   As home to several Christian holy sites, including the
fourth-century St. Sergius' Church, which was built to honor
soldiers slain by a Roman emperor because of their beliefs, Malula
has long been a haven for Christians. They make up about half the
population, a far larger proportion than the 13 percent in Syria as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the link to Jesus Christ makes some Christians more
passionate about preserving the language, there is no divide when
it comes to Aramaic in Malula. Muslims and Christians alike chatter
in a language that is incomprehensible to most other Syrians and to
almost everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In what are now Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian
territories, Aramaic was for centuries the language of daily life,
and it was thriving at the time of Jesus. (Hebrew was reserved for
religious worship.) Parts of the Bible were written in Aramaic,
scholars say, as were parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as a spoken language, it was overtaken in the seventh
century, giving way to others, including Syriac and Arabic. It has
disappeared entirely as a written language, with parts of its
alphabet utterly lost to memory.
</P>
<P>
   But although it no longer survives as a written language,
scholars and clerics sometimes adopt a rough system of
transcription to render the spoken sounds in a recognizable script,
usually Hebrew or Arabic. This allows an Aramaic liturgy to be used
in some Syrian churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Malula, spoken Aramaic has lived on, unmolested by successive
conquerors who never bothered to force conformity on such a remote
place, a redoubt that lies at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, its residents have lived simply, and mostly in
isolation, perched in houses dug into the steep hillside and
drawing their livelihoods from the spring-fed land below. To
venture to Damascus was long an arduous journey, across land that
was scorched in the summer and covered by snow in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century has brought the capital closer, and with it,
Arabic in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   But not even new jobs in Damascus and the demands of modern life
have quenched the habit of speaking Aramaic at home. People say
they have become ever more determined to keep the language alive.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw outsiders come and pay so much attention to our
language, we thought it was our responsibility to learn more,''
said Suleiman Wakim, 51, the owner of a tiny sandwich shop that
specializes in neatly browned falafel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a local legend dating from World War II, when Syria
was still a French protectorate, some people here still look with
suspicion at those who turn up in Malula and claim to marvel at
what has endured. As the story has it, a visiting scholar who
proclaimed his passion for Aramaic turned out instead to be a
German spy.
</P>
<P>
   But recent years have brought not only a fresh batch of
scholars, but also the early taste of tourist dollars, in a tide
that sometimes makes for an eclectic mix.
</P>
<P>
   One recent resident widely described with much affection was
Werner Arnold, a German linguist who asked to be known as Abu
Ibrahim during the several years he spent trying to master the
region's most obscure tongue. Some of his students have taken up
residence in his place, and old men like Mikhal Halal, 75, say they
still cannot believe that the foreigners have learned to speak
better Aramaic than he does.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the hilltop St. Sergius' Church, which attracts
many Christian pilgrims, the Rev. Fayez Frejat, a ruddy-faced
58-year-old Greek Catholic priest, delights visitors by reciting
the Lord's Prayer in Aramaic even though he cannot speak the
language, having been assigned to Malula just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, experts say, some 18,000 Syrians speak Aramaic,
including those who live in the nearby villages, Bakha and Jubadin.
</P>
<P>
   Of that total, though, perhaps half have left the villages for
better opportunities in the capital. Most return to the mountains
in the summer, and most still speak Aramaic at home to their
children, but it is that exodus that worries some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the interior minister, I'd pass a law that said no
one from Malula could marry outside these villages,'' Frejat said.
``Unless they hear the language at home, the children will grow up
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, extraordinary measures are being taken.
Orphans, in many cases, are brought up by Aramaic-speaking nuns.
With the picturesque heart of the village and its narrow, steep
alleyways already chockablock with houses, permission from the
government has been sought and won to allow new construction on the
outskirts, to make room for newlyweds and their growing families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is becoming more interested in preserving Aramaic,''
said Ali Muqdah, 31. ``It's our language, after all.''

RENO SAYS WACO INVESTIGATOR NEEDED TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday that in
looking for an outside investigator of the government's handling of
the 1993 Branch Davidian siege, she wants to find someone the
public trusts.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of disclosures that the FBI, after six years of
denials, fired incendiary tear-gas canisters onto the cult's
property near Waco, Texas, on the final day of the siege, Reno said
the leader of the outside probe must be free of ``conflicts of
interest and be well-received'' by the public.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would appoint the independent investigator to
``review the events at Waco to ensure that the American public has
confidence and faith in whatever the investigation reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and its parent agency, the Justice Department, have been
under attack by critics who have asked why it took so long for the
bureau to acknowledge its use of the pyrotechnic canisters on the
last day of the siege, April 19, 1993. Reno has said she learned
about the canisters only last week when the FBI's admission came in
response to a news story.
</P>
<P>
   The siege started when the FBI surrounded the compound shortly
after four Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents were
killed in a shootout with the Davidians on Feb. 28, 1993. The BATF
officials had been trying to arrest the cult's leader, David
Koresh, on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said, ``The head of the investigation will have
responsibility for finding the truth and then recommending what
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes to name the outside investigator ``soon'' but
added that she did not want to rush the decision. ``It has taken
some time because I want to do it the right way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The April 19 assault by FBI agents on the Davidian complex ended
in an inferno with Koresh and some 80 followers dead _ some by
fire, others by gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Reno wants the new probe to be
led by someone who would have ``immediate credibility'' on Capitol
Hill, where criticism of the department's handling of the Waco
incident and its aftermath will intensify when Congress returns to
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Already, congressional hearings on Waco have been scheduled this
fall, and House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill, is pushing for a separate congressional commission to look
into what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials said Reno likely will decide early next week
on the outside investigator. Among the names being considered,
according to department sources, are former Republican senators
John C. Danforth of Missouri and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Soloman Wisenberg, a former investigator
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, questioned Reno's
consideration of the former senators, who have no recent
prosecutorial experience.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg said Reno should appoint a state prosecutor or
district attorney from a large city as the investigator. ``You need
somebody who has dealt with law enforcement people and has a good
nonsense detector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Noble, former undersecretary of the Treasury Department
and author of a report on the role of the BATF at Waco, also noted
that either Danforth or Rudman, if appointed, ``would have to learn
on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobel, now a professor at New York University Law School, wrote
in a New York Times column Friday that whoever is appointed should
have full prosecutorial power, that is, the power to convene a
grand jury, to subpoena witnesses, to compel testimony and to
immunize witnesses to get the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At her news conference, Reno also denied reports that she no
longer trusts the FBI or its director, Louis Freeh, because of the
recent revelations about the bureau's use of tear gas during the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she and Freeh had been in ``almost daily contact'' and
that he is ``dedicated to finding the truth'' about what caused the
fire that consumed the Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that people don't try to play us off of
each other,'' Reno said. ``I have a relationship with Louis Freeh
and with the people around him that I think is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the FBI released a second infrared videotape from the
morning of the final day of the 51-day siege of the Davidian
compound. The tape, running from 7:57 a.m. to just before 9:30
a.m., showed two incendiary tear-gas canisters being shot at a
cement bunker about 50 yards from the main living quarters of the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   A second tape, released Friday, runs from 7:57 a.m. to just
before 9:30 a.m. and includes transmissions of agents saying the
incendiary military canisters didn't penetrate. ``The military gas
did not penetrate that bunker. ... It bounced off,'' a male voice
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau had released on Thursday the first infrared videotape
covering the time between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. that day and containing
a recorded conversation between two FBI agents. The conversation
includes a hurried decision to use potentially incendiary military
tear-gas cartridges in an attempt to penetrate the underground
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials had previously insisted in sworn affidavits that
they did not have any infrared video footage taken before 10:42
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, repeating an earlier statement that she had ordered agents
not to use incendiary devices during the operation, said all
evidence she has seen supports the view that federal agents did not
start the fire, which began at 12:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger issue here is: The facts that we know now indicate
that the FBI did not set that fire,'' Reno said. ``That fire was
set by David Koresh and the people in that building.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, which FBI officials said were discovered last
Saturday at the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's offices in Quantico, Va.,
were taken into custody Wednesday by federal marshals at Reno's
insistence. The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations
during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   During her news conference, Reno also responded to calls by some
Republicans for her resignation, saying, ``If the truth shows I've
done something wrong, then I will accept the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on Thursday, the White House voiced its support for
Reno and her decision to order an outside investigator. ``The
president is deeply concerned that the attorney general appears to
have been misled and may have been lied to,'' White House spokesman
Jake Siewert said. ``She has vowed to get to the bottom of that. We
fully support her effort to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Waco on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith
ordered the government to surrender all evidence on the siege or be
cited for contempt of court. Next month Smith will begin hearing
evidence in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by surviving members of
the Davidian sect, which was largely wiped out in the April 19
siege.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany _ This gritty town is the home of Oskar
Lafontaine, Germany's former finance minister, and of a slogan he
coined that has proved less ephemeral than his brief tenure in the
government: ``The heart beats on the left, and it's not yet listed
on the stock exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine has gone, from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government and from German politics. But in this coal and steel
producing area with a strong labor union tradition, the conviction
that Social Democracy must stand for solidarity, for workers'
rights, for the downtrodden and for a comprehensive welfare state
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   So strongly, in fact, that the small Saarland region, which
holds a critical state election Sunday, has become an unlikely
focus of the identity crisis of Schroeder's 136-year-old Social
Democratic Party and of the ideological battles of the European
left as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the left in Europe has been casting around for a new
identity that draws a distinction between a ``market economy,'' now
generally endorsed, and a ``market society,'' an expression widely
used to denote an unacceptable European surrender to what is
perceived as American capitalist excess. But how business-friendly
the left should be remains in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has a different culture, with less solidarity, and we
do not want such social Darwinism in Germany,'' said Reinhard
Klimmt, Lafontaine's Social Democratic successor as state premier
of the region. ``My heart, like my predecessor's, beats on the
left, but I am afraid that Mr. Schroeder's beats everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's policies have certainly veered this way and
that since he took office almost a year ago. But lately he has
appeared determined to steer the Social Democrats away from their
proud roots in the German labor movement toward the entrepreneurial
enthusiasms of Britain's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Schroeder has rejected calls for a wealth
tax, clamped down on pensions, said the state's 49 percent share of
the German economy must be slashed, and proclaimed that the
40-year-old program defining Social Democracy's aims must be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the new politics to succeed, it must promote a go-ahead
mentality and a new entrepreneurial spirit at all levels of
society,'' Schroeder wrote recently in a paper on the so-called
``Third Way'' of a revamped Left that he co-signed with Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is to this sort of language, with its whiff of a business
consultant's jargon and its remoteness from the factory floor, that
Klimmt, aged 57, has objected. He has focused his election campaign
here on the themes of social justice still dear to the French
Socialist party and praising old ideals of Social Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk of high-tech,'' Klimmt declared to a meeting of
labor union leaders this week. ``Well, there is high-tech in coal
and steel production, too. What is forgotten today is that behind
all the computers, there are people, and we are here to defend the
rights of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The applause was enthusiastic. But Klimmt is in a fierce
struggle for his political life, running neck-and-neck with a
dynamic Christian Democratic candidate, Peter Mueller, 43, who has
declared roundly that the Saarland coal industry, which employs
about 11,000 people, must be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to confront the truth _ the German coal industry is
uncompetitive and will die,'' said Udo Recktenwald, Mueller's
spokesman. ``What we should be worrying about is insuring that the
children of these miners have jobs in telecommunications and
service industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats won comfortably here in the last election,
in 1994, taking 49.4 percent of the vote to the Christian
Democrats' 38.5 percent. Klimmt's difficulties reflect several
factors: the poor start of Schroeder's government, anger at
Lafontaine for abandoning politics, and the frustrations of a
region that is uncertain of its economic future.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Saarland is a microcosm of Germany's dilemmas.
It has deep-rooted coal and steel industries where employment has
already fallen to a combined total of about 20,000 from 120,000 a
decade ago, an unemployment rate of 17 percent in the city of
Saarbruecken, and nascent software and technology industries whose
outlook could not be further removed from the hulking factories of
old.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, it was precisely the workers in those heavy
industries who long provided a bedrock of the Social Democratic
party. How the party can modernize while not alienating this core
support remains its central dilemma _ to which Schroeder and Klimmt
now offer sharply differing answers.
</P>

   ``I don't like Schroeder's slogan of `The New Middle,''' Klimmt
said. ``I like innovation with social justice. Of course, we must
encourage new businesses. But we must also raise wages in line with
productivity, maintain pensions and not cut the budget too hard.
It's fine to say `Let the Best Man Win,' but we must also help the
loser.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The specter of people stripped of their dignity by an
uncontrolled global market seems to lie close to the heart of
Saarland Social Democracy. But in fact, the Saarland has adapted
considerably over the last decade, rapidly developing a car and
auto-parts industry to replace some of the jobs lost in steel and
coal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a highly successful software company called
IDS Scheer, which now employs more than 800 people, has led a push
into high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   Drive westward out of Saarbruecken and the difficulty of this
transformation _ still far from complete and uncertain of success _
becomes clear. The rusted pipes and brick chimneys of abandoned
steelworks and mines seem to stand in massive rebuke to the brisk,
silent activity of the offices at the Saarbruecken Innovation and
Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   Here, IDS has its headquarters. ``Germany's problem is that we
are too deep in the old industries and not good enough in finance,
computers, services,'' said August-Wilhelm Scheer, the company's
chief executive and a member of the so-called ``Future Team'' of
Mueller, the Christian Democratic candidate. ``Here, we have great
technology thousands of meters beneath the earth mining an outdated
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The German coal industry is destined to consume over $2 billion
in subsidies by the year 2005. But Klimmt insisted it has a future,
saying contracts already signed with power stations would cover all
production until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, of course, is far wider than coal. It is the
pace of change, the place of traditional industries and the
viability of the social-market model of consensus and mediation
with unions that served Germany so well for most of the post-war
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Saarland election will hinge on these questions.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues on which Schroeder and Klimmt differ. Where the
Saarland candidate sees the death of old socialist values, the
chancellor sees the possible birth of a more deregulated Germany
that alone will create the jobs that must be found if Schroeder is
to stand a chance of re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the chancellor has given guarded
support to the Social Democratic candidate because the loss of the
state would severely weaken the party in the Upper House, or
Bundesrat. But if Klimmt wins, the tensions within the party may
worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are desperately stretched as a party, and our identity is
unclear,'' said Hajo Hoffmann, the Social Democratic mayor of
Saarbruecken. ``A basic problem is that Tony Blair has managed to
combine new technology with emotion and so make it seem exciting,
while we have not found a personality big enough to bind the
modernizing center and the old guard beneath a single reformist
banner.''

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the sky the limit?
</P>
<P>
   The answer from James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett, the
authors of the new book ``Dow 36,000,'' is an unqualified yes. And
many investors may be too ready to agree, with the Dow Jones
industrial average seemingly heading for an unprecedented fifth
consecutive year of double-digit returns.
</P>
<P>
   In their analysis of why the stock market's bull run should only
get faster, they sweep aside the naysayers and assert that 36,000
is a perfectly reasonable level right now for the Dow, which closed
on Friday at 11,078.45. And, they say, the rest of the stock market
could join it in such a takeoff. ``Stock prices could double,
triple, or even quadruple tomorrow and still not be too high,'' the
two write in excerpts of their book in the current issue of The
Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention raises a question that has troubled market
strategists and investors since the bull market hit high gear in
1995: Is the stock market overvalued and, if it is, will it fall?
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of immense importance. The valuation of the stock
market is a guidepost on which the market's best strategists depend
to decide if stocks can climb higher. But valuations are hotly
debated, and many of the traditional measures have been dismissed _
rightly _ as flawed during this bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, fear that the market was overvalued
led many analysts to pare back their exposure to stocks. One who
did was Charles I. Clough Jr., Merrill Lynch's chief investment
strategist, who just announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company, has employed her own valuation methods to
conclude the opposite _ that stocks are fairly valued and still
have room to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Dow Duo _ Glassman is a financial columnist and
Hassett is an economist _ have decided to go boldly where no man
has gone before. Their assertion that the Dow could be beamed up to
36,000 makes another new book, ``Dow 40,000'' by David Elias, look
downright stick-in-the-mud.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, the president of Elias Asset Management, expects to get
to 40,000, but figures that it will take until 2016. ``It will take
time, patience, and wise money management by investors,
corporations, and government entities before the economy and the
market can support price levels of that nature,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   What is especially provocative is Glassman's and Hassett's view
of how to value the stock market _ and how that affects the outlook
for stocks. They reject the generally held Wall Street belief that
the sharp swings that characterize the stock market make equities
more risky. The authors contend that over the long term, stocks are
no more risky than bonds, because the returns from stocks match or
outdo bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Using the research of professor Jeremy J. Siegel of the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Dow Duo point out
that over the worst 20-year periods, the inflation-adjusted return
for stocks was an increase of 1 percent while the worst for
Treasury bonds was a decline of 3.1 percent. Looking at a wide
range of returns over many years, Siegel's data indicate that the
risk of owning a portfolio of stocks falls to that of bonds at
around 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because investors are willing to pay more for less risk,
Glassman and Hassett say stocks can go much higher than previously
assumed before they become too pricey or overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, they contend, could be comfortable even if
price-to-earnings ratios, the traditional valuation barometer for
the stock market, were now nearing 100. The P/E ratios for the Dow
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index are currently around 30,
well over the historical average of 14 to 15..
</P>
<P>
   And while they know that the Dow really can't get to 36,000 tout
de suite, they think it will be there pdq. In an interview,
Glassman said he and Hassett saw Dow 36,000 in three to five years,
which assumes annual returns even greater than the unmatched
performance of the last four and a half years. They did not inform
their readers of this caution, however, in the Atlantic excerpts,
leaving them to think that warp-speed gains are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Wow! Three to five is still fast. If true, it means that
millions of investors who missed some of the stock bonanza since
1995 still have a chance to strike it rich.
</P>
<P>
   So what should investors think?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is a need to look at stock market valuations in
new ways. But it's not likely that even those who favor some sort
of adjustment to the usual methodologies are as exuberant as
Glassman and Hassett.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech late last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, endorsed a new way to account for software
investments in figuring P/E ratios. That change makes the stock
market look only slightly overvalued compared with history, rather
than extremely overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same speech, Greenspan sounded what could be taken as
a warning about assuming that investors will always be focused
enough on long-term returns to believe that stocks are no more
risky than bonds, the key to the ``Dow 36,000'' theory. ``History
tells us that sharp reversals in confidence happen abruptly, most
often with little advance notice,'' the chairman said. ``Panic
market reactions are characterized by dramatic shifts in behavior
to minimize short-term losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen of Goldman has adjusted her valuation methods to bring
them in line, in her view, with the way the economy works today.
Lower inflation, she has argued, both improves the quality of
corporate earnings and makes higher valuations less threatening.
``You have to make sure the valuation approach is meaningful,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Cohen has lowered the risk premium for stocks
compared with bonds in her computer model, she has not eliminated
it, as Glassman and Hassett have. And her analysis shows that the
stock market is ``fairly valued'' now _ not undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel of the Wharton School applauds the Duo's work but
disputes the conclusions; the authors, he says, assume that all
stocks can be given P/E ratios that should be reserved for Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But leave this debate over P/E ratios of 100 to the experts, who
will clearly disagree; that is what makes a market. There are still
good _ if not new _ lessons to learn from ``Dow 36,000,'' published
by Times Books.
</P>
<P>
   What Glassman and Hassett tell you _ especially in the rest of
the book _ is that being a long-term investor in stocks is smart,
because it reduces the negative impact of the short-term volatility
of the equity market. This is an argument Siegal has been making
since 1994, when the first edition of his book, ``Stocks for the
Long Run,'' came out. Glassman has done the same in his columns for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the converse is also true _ and that is another lesson not
to forget. If an investor has a shorter-term view, the risk of
stocks rises, compared with bonds. That means that high P/E ratios
become a problem much sooner. In other words, ``Dow 36,000'' and
P/E ratios of 100 are not for short-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons _ even if they are not the ones the book
spends the most time on _ to think that the stock market can go
higher. If the Fed can keep inflation in check and the economy
growing, the market can move higher over time, even if Fed
interest-rate increases cause temporary downswings. But don't bet
on the Dow hitting 36,000 soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry,'' Glassman said in an interview, ``that people will
get carried away with the notion that the Dow will be 36,000
tomorrow and assume they need to be in the market only six months
to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of the book,'' he said, ``is be a long-term
investor _ and that the stock market is undervalued, so you can be
comfortable being a long-term investor.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good message. And just the kind of cautionary tone the
Atlantic excerpts needed.

CONNECTICUT OPPOSES FLEET-BANKBOSTON DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connecticut's attorney general, trying to throw a
wrench into Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s merger with BankBoston
Corp., says he opposes the plan and has asked federal regulators to
delay a meeting planned for Tuesday to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal criticized the biggest bank merger in New
England history as having a ``severe anti-competitive impact'' on
consumers and small business in his state.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged ``favoritism'' was shown Massachusetts under
terms of an agreement, approved Thursday by the US Justice
Department, to carve out some Fleet branches for sale to community
banks in the Bay State. No such deal was struck with Connecticut
community banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposed to the merger as it's currently structured,
because it provides inadequate divestiture, and does not involve
community banks and regional institutions as buyers of the divested
Connecticut assets,'' Blumenthal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings in Connecticut emerged on a quiet Friday before Labor
Day after the Federal Reserve had placed on its agenda Tuesday
consideration of Fleet's request to merge with BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition is still scheduled for consideration at the
board meeting on Tuesday,'' a Fed official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal criticized the Justice-approved plan, which required
Fleet to sell 306 branches in New England to other financial
institutions as a way to ensure a bigger Fleet would have
competitors in the region. After Fleet and BankBoston combine, they
will become a $160 billion banking company with no single lender
near their size based in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Justice Department agreement,
Philadelphia-based Sovereign Bancorp Inc. would purchase the bulk
of the branches for sale, including all Connecticut branches on the
block. Fleet Friday defended its merger plan.
</P>
<P>
   A ``cadre of experts'' at Justice ``who do nothing but examine
antitrust issues has examined this rigorously and concluded that
competition will be maintained,'' Fleet's spokesman, James Mahoney,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with Justice, Fleet agreed to sell 39
Connecticut branches _ most are BankBoston branches _ and divest
$1.8 billion in deposits and consumer and business loans attached
to those branches.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, bowing to political pressure, added six Connecticut
branches to the divestiture plan, Blumenthal said. ``But, we still
don't think that number of branches is adequate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal in a letter dated Sept. 2 asked the Fed to delay its
vote Tuesday to allow federal regulators to consider objections
raised by Connecticut residents at a hearing in Hartford. At that
Aug. 26 hearing, Fleet was criticized for inadequate lending in
urban areas in Connecticut, particularly to minorities. Others
testifying about the merger were concerned that Fleet's sales of
branches would ensure healthy competition in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public comments focused on the merger's severe
anti-competitive impact,'' which has given consumers and business
fewer avenues for obtaining loans, while raising bank fees and
limiting services, said a letter signed by Blumenthal and
Connecticut's treasurer, Denise Nappier.

STOCKS AND BONDS RALLY ON JOBS NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financial markets made a volatile about face Friday,
as stocks and bonds rallied on the news that the economy generated
fewer new jobs than expected last month.
</P>
<P>
   The news that only 124,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in
August, well below the 215,000 Wall Street had forecast, allowed
many investors to think that the Federal Reserve may not have to
raise interest again this year in an effort to slow down the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has already raised its target by a quarter of a
percentage point twice. The second move, on Aug. 24, helped push
long-term interest rates back over 6 percent, as investors suddenly
began to worry that more Fed rate increases were in the offing
because the economy was not slowing down enough.
</P>
<P>
   But with such broad uncertainty about the outlook for the
economy and inflation, it is impossible to tell whether this new
mood won't change just as quickly again, especially if other
economic data for August are stronger. Since Federal Reserve
officials indicated in May that they were going to raise their
short-term interest rate target, the Dow Jones industrial average
has gone through five distinct selloffs and rallies and may now be
entering its sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this another in the series of relief rallies after some
ugly days over the summer or is there some new fundamental news in
the jobs report?'' asked Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist
at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``I think it is a relief rally,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market followed the bond market higher Friday. And the
rally in both helped to lift the dollar, which has been sliding
recently, against the euro and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   In below average trading volume of 663 million shares, the Dow
Jones industrial average surged 235.24 points, or 2.17 percent, to
11,078.45. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 38.13
points, or 2.89 percent, to 1,357.24. The NASDAQ composite index
climbed 108.87 points, or 3.98 percent, to 2,843.11. It was the
largest one-day point gain for the NASDAQ ever.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond leapt immediately after
the release of the jobs report at 8:30 a.m. and finished a
pre-holiday, half-day of trading up 1 17/32, to 101 17/32. The
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.01
percent, down from 6.13 percent Thursday. The yield on the 30-year
bond has crossed the 6 percent level more than a dozen times since
June.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed
interest rate moves, rose 6/32, and the yield dropped to 5.62
percent, from 5.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar, which was helped by the rush of foreign investors
back into the bond and stock market, rose to 110.05 against the
Japanese yen, from 109.11 Thursday. The euro, the new 11 country
European currency, fell against the dollar, finishing at $1.0612
from $1.0686.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, helped by the sharp decline in interest rates,
and computer companies led the stock market higher, with J.P.
Morgan up 7 7/8, to 133 13/16; American Express rising 6 1/8, to
142; Microsoft increasing 4 1/16, to 95 7/8, and Intel jumping 4,
to 89 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   While the fear of higher interest rates is making investors wary
about the outlook for the stock market, the improved prospects for
corporate earnings is keeping the major indexes near the top of
their recent trading ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of the market is exhibited in the fact that the
Dow Jones industrial average is now just 247 points below its
all-time high, while the NASDAQ index, with Friday's surge, is just
21 points from matching its record, set July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coca-Cola Co. said Friday that its earnings in the
third quarter will fall below expectations, it looks as if growth
in earnings for all companies in the last two quarters of the year
will be quite strong. Coke's stock dropped 2 1/8 on the news to 57
3/8.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the key reasons for the strong corporate earnings is that
the growth comparisons are to the last two quarters of 1998, when
the global financial turmoil set off by the devaluation of the
Russian ruble devastated the profits of many companies, including
banks and brokerage houses. According to First Call/Thomson
Financial, operating earnings of the 500 companies in the Standard
&AMP; Poor's index are forecast to rise 21.2 percent in the third
quarter, which ends Sept. 30, and 21.3 percent in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the investor relief apparent Friday might not
last is that the August jobs data, according to some analysts, was
not as weak as it looks. While the job growth was lower than
expected, combined with the 338,000 new jobs created in July, the
pace for job growth is still strong. For the year the average is
just under 230,000 a month, barely below the average of 249,000 a
month for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   While there are economists who think that the economy is showing
signs of slowing, Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, thinks the economy is growing at a 4
percent pace in the third quarter, up from the 1.8 percent growth
in the second. If this is the case, the economy has probably not
slowed enough from the 5 percent pace for the six months through
March to satisfy the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to think the economy is very strong and inflation
pressures are rising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Berner acknowledges that some of his competitors think the
economy is slowing down. `'There is a real vigorous debate going on
about the growth and inflation outlook,'' he said. The August jobs
data, he said, ``will fuel the slowdown school'' and ``will give
the Fed some breathing room and the market some breathing room.''
This is the last jobs report Fed policy-makers get before their
next meeting, which is scheduled for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   One major question is whether this uncertainty about the outlook
for the economy might keep the stock market contained in its
current trading range during the near future even though the major
indexes are so near their highs. Since the Dow breeched 11,000 on
May 3, it has set five new highs. But reaching the latest record,
11,326.04 on Aug. 25, added only 2.8 percent to the Dow.

 &HT;    To some, fall color means green
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGGIE VALLEY, N.C. _ Maggie Mountaineer Crafts shop owner Sue
Pendley tracks the color of the fall leaves the way a Wall Street
trader keeps up with the Dow Jones averages.
</P>
<P>
   Here, money really does grow on trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a hurricane here like Dennis and it stayed for a
week in the middle of October and knocked off the leaves, you would
see some businesses close up permanently,'' said Pendley, who's
owned her shop for 23 years. ``October is your money month. That's
when you pay all your bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall leaves make money. In October, people and their cars clog
the Blue Ridge Parkway as if it were Ga. 400 just to get a look at
a red maple leaf.
</P>
<P>
   So when Western Carolina University biology Professor J. Dan
Pittillo _ the Alan Greenspan of Appalachian leaf forecasting _
predicted North Carolina's leaves would display at least average
October brilliance, it gave mountain accountants cause to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midsummer drought should lead to a brilliant fall color season
in the central Piedmont and good color in the mountains,'' Pittillo
said. ``Moisture stress has historically been associated with good
fall color, and the year will be at least average over the entire
state, and above average in the more drought-stricken regions.''
</P>
<P>
   He bases his prediction on years of observation. This year,
market strategy incited by the North Carolina tourism department
triggered the timing of his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, The New York Times ran a front-page story bemoaning
the drought that threatens to dry up the $8 billion New England
fall foliage industry. Under the headline ``Leaf-proud New England
braces for a brownish fall,'' the paper's story intoned that ``a
menacing brown is enveloping New England roadsides, as thirsty red
oaks and sugar maples shed their shriveled leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that tourists would take leave of their senses and
decide that a potential color drain in the Northeast could
similarly zap the South, state tourism officials in Raleigh, N.C.,
called Pittillo for his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it automatically. We did it immediately,'' said Chris
Mackey, spokeswoman for the North Carolina tourism department.
``The fall season is such a big part of the economy for mountain
towns. If they have a bad October, they have a bad year. So we did
it in response to that article. We wanted to say don't associate us
with New England fall color.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel and tourism is a $10 billion industry in North Carolina.
In Buncombe County in the western part of the state, where
travelers visit Asheville, the Biltmore Estate and the Blue Ridge
Parkway, tourists spend about $379 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not keeping records on the economics of fall leaves and
tourism,'' Pittillo said, ``just casual observations of the nature
of the processes with regard to my knowledge of botanical
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittillo said brilliant foliage should cover Virginia, West
Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia and North and South Carolina and _ in
his opinion _ New England.
</P>
<P>
   An early, light frost can bring out strong colors by the first
week in October, Pittillo said. Color will start popping out above
5,000 feet then spread down the mountains like syrup on pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in parts of western North Carolina, colors peaked Oct.
20. In lower elevations, color can linger as late as Thanksgiving.
Birches are among the first to change followed by mountain ash,
serviceberry, mountain maples, sugar maples, red maples, beeches
and northern red oaks.
</P>
<P>
   In tourist-dependent areas like Maggie Valley, businesses are
staying open for longer stretches of the year. Once, they opened in
May and closed after the October rush. Now, it's more likely they
would close from January to March. They cater to Midwesterners in
the spring, Southerners in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the potential customer base transforms from
families on budgets to Florida vacationers with disposable income
who are often Christmas shopping _ not for trinkets but for upscale
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In October, we get an older, more mature crowd that can spend
more money,'' said Donna Diller, manager at Cabbage Rose, a shop of
collectibles and Christmas ornaments. ``In the summer, you have a
husband and wife and their 2.2 children who have saved all year to
come that week.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaf forecast doesn't have an immediate business impact
since most motel rooms and rental cabins are booked a year in
advance, said Pendley, the Maggie Valley shop owner. However, word
of poor color can erode future business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a good color season, they still come,''
Pendley said. ``But they don't tell their friends to come. If we
have a spectacular season, they'll tell everyone and then everyone
will be back.

   PARIS _ French judges dismissed on Friday all charges against
nine photographers and a press motorcyclist who were being
investigated for their role in the Paris car crash that killed
Diana, Princess of Wales, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two investigating magistrates concluded that the accident on
Aug. 31, 1997, was caused not by the photographers' pursuit, but
rather was the fault of the car's drunken driver, Henri Paul, who
also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver was in a state of drunkenness and under the
influence of medicines incompatible with alcohol, a state which
prevented him from keeping control of his vehicle while he was
driving at high speed on a difficult section of road,'' they said
in a 32-page report.
</P>
<P>
   A third person killed was Diana's companion, Dodi Fayed. Lawyers
for the families of Fayed and Paul said on Friday that they would
appeal the judges' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mohammed Fayed, Dodi's father, have argued that
tests of Paul's blood, showing a alcohol level more than three
times the legal limit and traces of anti-depressants, were
improperly taken and stored.
</P>
<P>
   Fayed himself has repeatedly put forth the theory that the crash
was caused deliberately to prevent a marriage between a member of
the British royal family and his son, a Muslim from an Egyptian
family.
</P>
<P>
   George Kiejman, Fayed's lawyer, said on Friday that he had no
evidence of foul play but that the decision would be appealed
because ``harassment by the photographers'' caused Paul to speed
and to change his route, taking the car into the narrow underpass
where it hit a pillar.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth person in the car, Trevor Rees-Jones, a bodyguard,
survived the crash with severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the mysterious white Fiat Uno that may have
brushed against the Mercedes, but that was never found despite an
extensive police search, the report concluded that the white car
was going in the same direction, at a slower speed, but bore no
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers and motorcyclist who were believed to have
been chasing the Mercedes-Benz were detained at the scene of the
accident on suspicion of manslaughter and held for almost three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Their supposed involvement produced an outpouring of public
anger at the behavior of paparazzi as well as much media
soul-searching about harassment of celebrities. Graffiti appeared
in Paris saying: ``paparazzi (EQ) murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's judgment had been expected since Aug. 17, when the
Paris prosecutor's office recommended that all charges against the
10 men be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The judges, Herve Stephan and Marie-Christine Devidal, said in
their ruling that no deliberate action by the photographers or the
motorcyclist had led to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigations have not definitively established any fault
that could be linked for certain with the accident,'' they wrote,
adding that the photographers ``did not resort to ruse or
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   While their behavior raised ethical and moral questions, the
judges said, it did not ``constitute in this case a violation of
the penal code.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the photographers greeted Friday's ruling with
relief. ``This decision to dismiss all the charges is an immense
relief and puts an end to two nerve-wracking years,'' said Romuald
Rat, one of the first to arrive at the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the judges cleared the photographers of criminal
responsibility, their extensive examination of the photographers'
activities suggests that their role was taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of the photographers imposed upon the couple a
continuous and insistent presence from the time they arrived'' in
Paris, the report said. ``Various testimonies establish that Diana
Spencer and her companion found it difficult to put up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   This, the report went on, led Dodi Fayed to take decisions that,
however imprudent, were a response to being hounded.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also criticized the photographers for their beh!vior
at the crash scene, where witnesses said they jostled for good
angles to record the wrecked car and its dying passengers before
the emergency services arrived. Three of the 10 photographers _
Rat, Serge Arnal and Christian Martinez _ took pictures, sometimes
from as close as 3 to 5 feet away, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of several photographers at the scene of the
accident was unanimously and severely criticized by the different
eyewitnesses, and moreover, this accident took place in a context
from which they were not disconnected,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also said that, despite some earlier charges, the
photographers were not guilty of ``failure to assist victims.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Arnal, tried to call rescuers with his cell phone.
Other photographers had been told by onlookers that ambulances had
already been called.

WOLVERINES COACH KEEPING THE IRISH GUESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Let's see. Lloyd Carr doesn't like that Notre
Dame squeezed in a game against Kansas a week before Saturday's
contest against his Michigan team.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines coach has also tried his best to keep the Irish
guessing about the identity of Michigan's starting quarterback,
though it almost certainly will be Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
   And Carr is worried about avoiding a repeat of the 0-2 start
that ended Michigan's 1998 national title hopes before the end of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like things are just about normal around Michigan
Stadium, where Wolverines football has been a soap opera for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Take this business of Notre Dame supposedly sneaking in a warmup
against Kansas, a game that ended up a 48-13 Irish romp and
prompted Carr to accuse the Irish of breaking a ``gentlemen's
agreement'' made years ago with Michigan that neither school would
add a game before their scheduled ``opener.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr's displeasure was news to the Irish. ``I haven't heard from
Lloyd,'' Notre Dame coach Bob Davie said earlier this week. ``I
asked (Notre Dame athletic director) Mike Wadsworth if anyone in
our athletic department had heard anything from Michigan on the
so-called verbal agreement, and no one had. It seems a little
strange to me, but I don't want to comment on something that I
haven't heard directly from someone at Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Next we move to the Michigan quarterback derby, which is more
serious business for Carr. Throughout the spring and summer, Brady
and Drew Henson have battled for the job. Brady is the incumbent,
having lifted the Wolverines from the 0-2 abyss of last season to a
respectable 10-3 record. He completed 61 percent of his passes,
throwing for 2,636 yards and 15 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, there would be no question about Brady's status. But
Henson is a star in the making _ in two sports. He plays baseball
so well that the New York Yankees have made him a millionaire as a
third baseman of the future, but he also has the foolish idea that
he can play quarterback for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, he can. Probably better than Brady over the long
run. And Henson has made it clear that he didn't cut his minor
league baseball season short to become the Wolverines' backup
punter and backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, following a developing trend among coaches, has hinted
that both will play Saturday, and throughout the season. That is a
dangerous situation if you don't handle it right.
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks have worked with the first-team offense in
preseason drills. ``They have competed as hard as any two guys I've
seen,'' said Carr, who likely will start Brady and bring Henson in
during the second quarter. ``And both have performed extremely
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, ranked No. 7, might need both. Even though the Kansas
game was hardly an indicator of how good Notre Dame is, early
reports from South Bend are that this Irish team is quicker, more
athletic, and hungrier than any Davie has had in his three seasons.
After some struggles early in the game, with the Irish players
seemingly just trying to get acquainted with one another, the
18th-ranked Irish pulled away to an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jarious Jackson had a rough time throwing the ball
(9 of 17 for 89 yards, 3 interceptions) but was a force on the
ground, rushing for 85 yards. He poses a threat to a Michigan
defense that seems most vulnerable in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   For either team, a loss will slow down the national championship
bandwagon, a presence on both campuses each fall. And with both the
Wolverines and Irish facing a tough early schedule _ Michigan plays
Syracuse and Wisconsin, Notre Dame has Purdue and Michigan State _
neither wants to begin the season from an 0-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   All of which should make this one of the spicier games on the
first full weekend of the 1999 college football season.

`BUBBLE' WILL BURST THIS WEEKEND FOR HUNDREDS IN NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trendy term is ``on the bubble.'' This is the weekend
throughout the National Football League when hundreds of players,
rookies, free agents, veterans, and scrubs are ``on the bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, coaches aren't sure if these players ``on the
bubble'' can help their teams. By Sunday coaches will have no more
time to dilly-dally and must make up their minds on whom to cut and
whom to keep. In 95 percent (or more) cases, their decisions will
have little impact on their football fortunes this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have players on the bubble, too. And while the
thrill for fans of ``bubble'' players such as wide receiver Sean
Morey is first the debate (``Morey's too smart a receiver to just
let go'') and then in following the development of these players,
the truth is Sean Morey _ if he is kept _ won't be catching many
passes this season for New England unless catastrophe strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the focus on ``on the bubble'' players is misdirected.
It is coaching staffs that are ``on the bubble'' this final week
before the regular season begins. Fans should be much more
concerned if their coaching staffs, and not Player A or Player B,
will produce this season.
</P>
<P>
   This is so true with the Patriots. It is what the New England
coaching staff does, or doesn't do, the next few days, weeks, and
months that will determine the team's fortune. Much, much, much
more than the 42d or 43d player on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ players, coaches, media, or fans _ knows what to make
of this Patriots team. The exhibition season wasn't impressive, but
on the other hand, Willie McGinest and Terry Glenn still are
healthy. I'll still trade the latter for the former.
</P>
<P>
   The gloom and doomers chastised Drew Bledsoe and the offense for
an inept effort Thursday night in Carolina, and inept it was. But
if Patriots fans have to worry about Bledsoe completing a pass to
Glenn this season, then we might as well be discussing the United
States's equestrian prospects in next year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect us to be successful even if we go in with a package
of only five plays,'' said Bledsoe. ``We still should be successful
because we don't put in a bunch (of plays) but they didn't put in a
bunch, either. They weren't game-planning for us just as we're not
game-planning for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, game-planning. Coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The football games played the last four weeks have as much
resemblance to real football as the regular-seasons of the NHL or
NBA resemble real hockey or real basketball. Real football starts a
week from Sunday. Real game plans arrive, too. The best coaching
staffs will produce; the others won't.
</P>
<P>
   Of much more concern Thursday night should have been Carolina's
aged Kevin Greene manhandling New England OL Max Lane deep into the
backfield on a Carolina pass rush, or Patriot linebacker Tedy
Bruschi being felled like a young twig in the first breeze of
spring on a Carolina screen pass in the first half, or OL Heath
Irwin completely fanning on a block when he pulled on a running
play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome, the same heart palpitations as last year
were felt when the Patriots' nickel and dime pass defense trotted
onto the field when Carolina had third and longs. Soon, too soon,
Carolina had first and 10. These are familiar sights in New
England, too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the special teams were much improved.
Kevin Faulk should be a real threat on kickoff returns. Tackling
and coverage were much more intense than they had been on punts and
kicks. Terry Allen ran strongly up the middle and once he
understands what has passed as the Patriot running attack the last
decade _ he seldom will see daylight in front of him and he must
always run to what is, in effect, the first crack of dawn _ he
should produce.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, McGinest produced two huge plays on
back-to-back Carolina calls at the goal line in the first half,
saving a touchdown. That is the McGinest the Patriots must have
every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best football is definitely ahead of us,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope so.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Patriots are going to struggle defensively for the
first month of the season. (As proof of the no game-planning
Thursday night, Carolina tried to run wide, and not up the middle,
against the Patriots; that was the last time Patriot fans will
enjoy watching such foolishness.) Whether that defense jells into a
cohesive unit by midseason depends not on whether Andy Katzenmoyer
finally learns where he is supposed to be but solely, totally, and
completely on the coaching staff. After all, Henry Thomas, good as
he is, is not Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a certain New England coaching staff _ which
shall remain nameless _ had one of the worst, if not the worst,
pass defenses in the NFL by late October. Opposing teams routinely
passed for 300 yards, mediocre ones chalked up 350, and the better
ones topped 400. That unnamed coaching staff juggled bodies, yes,
but also hid its many weaknesses with defensive scheming, and
somehow that defense reached the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the New England coaching staff that is ``on the
bubble'' this weekend. No one knows what to make of the Patriots,
so let's start with the assumption the team will be 8 and 8.
Whether the Patriots can win one more game, two more games, or
three more games than assumed _ and have a good season _ will
depend so much on whether the coaching staff comes through for the
players.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of teams in the NFL are very good, just as a handful
are very bad. Let's say five of each. That leaves 20 teams that are
more or less similar. Coaches will decide which of those 20
surprise and which of those 20 teams disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not even discuss coaches putting the right bodies in the
right places on the field. That's a given. But whether the Patriot
coaches can motivate this team to play intensely every week _ by
just playing hard every week, teams can sneak two or three wins
from teams on the usual NFL emotional roller coaster _ will be key.
</P>
<P>
   Just as key will be whether New England's coaches outcoach the
opposition. Alas, we are never told and seldom know how often which
side's game plan decides games. But it does happen and it does
separate the winners from the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Patriots go to 10-6 or fall to 6-10 will not depend
on Sean Morey, but on the New England coaches. It is those men who
are ``on the bubble.''

 &HT;    Political scientists bring HOPE to annual meeting
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the HOPE scholarship began in 1993, pessimists
worried that Georgia high schools might inflate their students'
grades to help them win the college tuition grant. According to
this view, since grade inflation is a fact nationally, surely it
would be rampant in Georgia with so much money at stake.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   According to data presented Friday at the American Political
Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta, a rise in grades
that accounts for swelling the numbers of HOPE scholarships has
been matched by a rise in their SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the theoretical realm of political science, Georgia's HOPE
scholarship program stands out as a marvel that is widely
recognized, but poorly imitated, throughout the United States. So
the panel, which included Georgia State University researchers and
U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Cobb County), examined the program's
amazing success at buying votes for the Democratic Party in
northeast and southeast Georgia and some of the negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
   But educationally, the impact seems to be overwhelmingly
positive, such as the evidence against grade inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT college-entrance exam turns out to be a very useful
yardstick for measuring grade inflation because, compared to the
subjective nature of a teacher's grading decisions, it is
scientifically consistent over the years. In fact, SAT data
nationally has established that, unlike with HOPE students,
American high school students in general have been getting easier
grades for less work.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatically increasing numbers of students qualifying
for HOPE in Georgia, which requires at least a B average for up to
full tuition at a public Georgia campus or $3,000 at a private one,
parallel a rise in the SAT scores of those students. In other
words, more high school graduates are getting HOPE because more
really are smarter, at least in the verbal and math reasoning
skills that the SAT measures.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the borderline HOPE students with high school grades
averaging 3.0 to 3.25, which the researchers said would be the most
likely group to have grade inflation, SAT scores rose from 916 to
943 from 1994 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   HOPE ``turned the tide'' in the national debate about college
financing by returning to scholarships based on student performance
rather than financial need, said Gary Henry, the lead GSU
researcher on the two studies presented. But the research indicated
that many of the possible negative effects have not been seen.
Minority students have not been crowded out by more white students
choosing to stay in-state for HOPE; in fact, minority student
enrollment has increased more rapidly than white enrollment since
HOPE started, said GSU researcher Ross Rubenstein. Although 75
percent of students who begin college with a HOPE scholarship lose
HOPE during their college years, the percent is decreasing and
those who do are less likely to leave college than students who
never qualified for HOPE, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The political impact of HOPE is so obvious to politicians, it
almost seemed silly to have the question examined academically.
Isakson, who was defeated for governor by Zell Miller, the father
of the HOPE program, in 1990 by a slim margin, said a candidate
would be an idiot to run against HOPE. Research showed that
counties in which voting increased for Democratic candidates rose
the most between 1994 and 1998, when Miller was no longer running;
the counties correspond closely with those receiving the most per
capita in HOPE dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The rosy picture of HOPE was darkened only when a political
science professor opened the question period by raising the ``G''
issue _ gambling. HOPE is funded by the state Lottery. ``This is
state sponsorship of an action that may encourage self-destructive
behavior and hurt families,'' said Beverly Busch, of Georgia
Southwestern State University. She also charged that ``the middle
and upper classes are benefiting disproportionately to what they're
paying into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said that question is a totally different issue that would
take another panel of political scientists to study.

SOME SCHOOL OFFICIALS SWEAT, SOME SAVOR GRADUATION-RATES REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speeches to inspire the shoulder-padded lads at Dear Old State U
no longer center on winning one for the Gipper (or the designated
legend of a particular school). These days, players are just as
likely to hear ``Please try to obtain your diploma in the preferred
six-year time frame so our graduation rates don't cause the alums
undue embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA released its current graduation-rates report last
weekend, several college-football programs winced. Their rates were
in the neighborhood of current interest rates. The start of the '99
season made the spotlight shine brighter on the schools with the
worst grad rates.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every year. But in the past, grad-rate reports came
out during the summer when the attention wasn't focused on a single
sport. These reports are mandated by Your United States Government
(the Department of Education), so it's easy to understand why the
reports aren't always regularly scheduled. The 1998 grad-rate
report came out in November.
</P>
<P>
   Timing, as comedians will tell you, is everything. Last fall,
Tennessee was in the midst of a magical season that produced a 13-0
season and national championship. Of course, when the 1998
grad-rates report showed that the Volunteers' 1991 class had a
graduation rate of 11 percent, the snipers took aim. Some of the
shots came from the direction of Nashville and Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Tennessee was able to shoot back. The Volunteers'
football grad rate was 57 percent. And that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that we rank second in the SEC to Vanderbilt in
graduation rate for our men's athletes, but we win on Saturdays,''
said Carmen Tegano, Tennessee assistant athletics director for
student life.
</P>
<P>
   Zing.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation rates are like a poker game _ the winners rake it in,
the losers cry deal. Schools with high grad rates are quick to
crank up the PR machine (Penn State followed up its 41-7
season-opening victory over Arizona with an e-mail detailing the
football program's glittering grad rates.) And schools like Texas
A&AMP;M try to explain the reasons behind an 18 percent grad rate for
its 1992 class and a four-year (1989 to 1992) graduation rate of 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation rates are like any other statistics. Play the right
tune, and they'll sing and dance any routine you want. Grad rates
can be particularly difficult to assess. Freshmen student-athletes
who start at one school but leave or transfer are counted against
that school, no matter what they eventually do academically. And,
every incoming freshman is on a six-year clock to graduate.
Student-athletes who take longer than that don't count, even if
they graduate with multiple degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If pro football comes and takes five or 10 kids a year, and
they are paying them a million dollars a year , that skews the
statistics,'' Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. Fulmer is spin
doctoring, but he's right.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and the government hope that perspective
student-athletes and their families use the graduation rates when
trying to select a college/university. That happens rarely; the
inch-thick grad-rates book is filled with pages of tiny type that
only CPAs would embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those who use this information need to understand that
the figures are going to vary quite a bit from year to year,'' said
Todd Petr, the NCAA's director of research. ``You need to look at
the big picture, particularly the four-year averages, when you're
assessing the graduation rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt will never be Tennessee on the football field, and
Houston will never be Rice in the classroom. Different schools for
different people and different needs. Some schools count their
Heisman winners and national championship trophies, others count
their GTE Academic All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke, Vandy, Stanford _ the private schools _ one reason their
graduation rates are so good is that a lot of the football players
go there for the school and to graduate from that school,'' said
Florida coach Steve Spurrier, who coached _ and won _ at Duke. ``At
the state universities, maybe football is the main priority. If
it's not working out in football, then, \Rplayers tend to say\S
`Hey, let's transfer and go somewhere we can play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.

NOTRE DAME'S `ACTION JACKSON' WINNING RAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jarious Jackson probably won't win the Heisman Trophy. Even
playing at Notre Dame, he isn't likely to be an All-American
quarterback. But it's easy to make the case that no other player in
the country is more indispensible to his team than Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's value should be apparent today when he leads the
16th-ranked Fighting Irish to Ann Arbor to face No. 7 Michigan.
Option quarterbacks give the Wolverines fits. Last year against
Michigan, Jackson rushed for 73 yards and passed for two
thrid-quarter touchowns as the Irish overcame a 13-6 halftime
deficit. Notre Dame rushed for 280 yards against the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do that we didn't do last year is get to the
quarterback,'' Michigan nose tackle Rob Renes said. ``We need to
get pressure on the quarterback. We didn't get 11 guys to the ball
as much as we needed to last year, and that's evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his first as a starter, Jackson proved that he
could win. The Irish were 9-1 before he sustained a knee injury
that sidelined him for the Southern California game. Notre Dame was
shut out, 10-0; the loss probably cost the Irish a $13 million
payday in the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie hopes Jackson will continue to
improve under the guidance of new offensive coordinator Kevin
Rogers. Rogers comes to Notre Dame from Syracuse, where he helped
McNabb become a first-round NFL draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   In last Saturday's season-opening defeat of Kansas, Jackson
rushed 12 times for 85 yards, including a 38-yard touchdown run for
Notre Dame's first points. However, he threw three interceptions;
last season, he totaled six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about it because he made such poor decisions on
those three throws,'' Davie said. ``It makes me a little bit
nervous that maybe he's worrying about other people on that offense
more than he's worried about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has taken his role as captain seriously. A driven
perfectionist, he admits that he he has been spending as much time
pushing and working with Notre Dame's inexperienced offensive
linemen as he has on his own performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like things done my way, or I don't think it's right,''
Jackson said. ``In some ways that's the wrong attitude to have
because you should be able to trust people. I try to hold people in
high regard and hope they have standards like I do. Wanting to get
better wanting to achieve, wanting to go hard every snap. I want to
make every play break free and go the distance.''
By the numbers 6: When No. 16 Notre Dame plays at No. 7 Michigan
today, the Fighting Irish will be trying to maintain their mastery
at Michigan Stadium. Notre Dame is one of only six schools
(Nebraska, North Carolina, Penn State, South Carolina and Syracuse
are the others) with a winning record (5-4) at ``The Big House.''
</P>
<P>
   28: Akron, which plays at No. 2 Penn State today, gave up 28 or
more points five times last season.
</P>
<P>
   13: Nebraska is playing Iowa for the first time since 1982. The
Cornhuskers have won their past 13 season openers while the
Hawkeyes haven't lost a season-opener since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   5: UCLA is only 5-3 in its past eight nonconference games
(including bowls).
</P>
<P>
   14: Vanderbilt hasn't beaten Alabama since 1984, a streak of 14
games. The Commodores were awarded a forfeit victory against the
Crimson Tide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   22: Purdue junior quarterback Drew Brees goes into today's game
at Central Florida with 22 touchdown passes in his past six games.
</P>
<P>
   1,717: Murray State, the Division I-AA team that is facing
Wisconsin and running back Ron Dayne today, gave up 393 yards
rushing to Indiana State in its final game last season. Dayne
enters this season needing 1,717 yards to break the career rushing
record set by Texas' Ricky Williams last season.
</P>
<P>
   Quotes Miami (Fla.) coach Butch Davis on his team's 17-play,
79-yard drive that helped preserve a 23-12 lead in the fourth
quarter against Ohio State on Sunday in the Meadowlands:
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tribute to Bill Parcells. It was the kind of NFC
East, Tuna-type drive that he was known for when he was with the
Giants. It basically helped us to have that time-consuming drive.
It was vintage NFC East football.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Kreinbrink, a junior who has thrown 28 passes, will make
his first start today when Northwestern plays host to Miami (Ohio):
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad never played football. He just told me to be the
quarterback. I was a tight end in midget football. He told me, `You
should be a quarterback.' He told me, `You should be a pitcher.' I
guess my dad, my parents, just wanted me to be the center of
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gallant is a former Vanderbilt cheerleader who made the
football team as a walk-on last season as a special teams player.
He turned down the opportunity to be photographed by ``Sports
Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to photograph me in my football uniform, jumping
up in the air waving pompons. I told them I wasn't interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who had neck surgery in
November, on his first live contact in Saturday's game with
Louisiana Tech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was concerned except me. I knew I was going
to get hit. Once I got hit, it was just one of those deals _ I got
back up and started throwing again. I'm over the injury. I've
rehabbed. I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE NATION Wyoming, which opens the season at defending
national champion Tennessee today, has returned to its traditional
logo of a bucking horse. However, this season, the horse will be
without its rider. That's in honor of receivers coach Derrick
Shepherd (a former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboys player) who died of
a heart attack last month at age 35. The Wyoming logo will appear
on the team's helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary won't be on the sideline when
the 10th-ranked Yellow Jackets open the season today at Navy. In
April, O'Leary was penalized by the NCAA for making an improper
loan to a former player. The penalty prevents him from being on the
sideline, so he'll coach from the press box. Offensive coordinator
Ralph Friedgen will be on the sideline for the Yellow Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Before practice started, Boston College coach Tom O'Brien hoped
he would not have to use many incoming freshmen this season. But
when the Eagles open the season today by playing host to Baylor,
O'Brien figures that freshmen will see significant reserve roles at
running back, defensive back and offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to give in Monday's Conference USA game between
Tulane and Southern Mississippi. The Green Wave, under first-year
coach Chris Scelfo, enters the game with a 13-game winning streak.
Tulane is opening with a conference game for the fourth consecutive
season and has won its three previous openers. Southern Miss,
meanwhile, is 8-0 in C-USA home games.
</P>

   Travis Carroll, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., caused quite a
stir in August when he left Alabama, where he had been a starter at
middle linebacker. He plans to transfer to Florida. ``Let's just
say there are some people there that aren't looking out for your
best interest,'' Carroll said of Alabama's coaching and training
staff.
SHORT SHOTS Short: Virginia Tech has blocked 61 kicks (placements
and punts) this decade, including a school-record 12 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Relax, Teasippers. Virginia Tech isn't on the Longhorns'
future schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Casey Clausen of Mission Hills, Calif., is regarded as
one of the nation's top high school quarterbacks. Recently, he made
an oral commitment to attend Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Guess about a week before next February's signing day,
Clausen will announce he's attending Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Short: With its victory at Texas last Saturday, North Carolina
State has upsets over ranked teams each of the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: The Wolfpack is now perfectly positioned for another
disappointing, barely-break-even season.
</P>
<P>
   Short: Penn State 41, Arizona 7.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: To paraphrase the youngster in ``Sixth Sense'': ``I see
dead national championship hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Short: UCLA, which recently had to deal with a scandal involving
players using illegally obtained handicapped parking permits, opens
its season by playing host to Boise State of the Big West
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shot: Bruins coach Bob Toledo should start a tradition similar
to the ones at Southeastern Conference schools and make his players
walk to the stadium _ especially because it's the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena.
QUICK HITS Walter's boy Miami's victory against Ohio State in the
Kickoff Classic was dampened by the season-ending injuries to
safety Al Blades and reserve running back Najeh Davenport.
Davenport's loss means there will soon be even more attention
heaped on a Hurricanes freshman running back named Jarrett Payton.
</P>
<P>
   If that name rings a bell, it should. Payton is the son of
Walter Payton, the former Chicago Bears Hall of Famer and the
leading rusher in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will need a running back to give starter James Jackson a
rest. Payton could be a candidate, along with Clinton Portis,
another incoming freshman. Payton had hoped to spend this season as
a redshirt because his father's battle with a rare liver disease
has made it difficult to focus. Plus, Jarrett has spent most of his
youth as a soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can really do about it now,'' Payton said.
``It was in my mind to do it, but I've got to play. I hope
everybody understands this is new to me. I've only been playing
football for two seasons.'' Getting pass happy Fans in Auburn are
learning what the fans at TCU and Minnesota discovered. Noel
Mazzone likes to see the ball in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone is Auburn's first-year offensive coordinator. As
quarterbacks coach at TCU and Minnesota under Jim Wacker, the
football flew.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone, basically, has the reputation of being pass-happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say that about me,'' he said. ``When we were at
TCU, we threw it about every down. When we were at Minnesota, we
threw it a ton. We were always a top-10, top-15 passing team in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up playing and coaching in the WAC, and everyone knows
how wacky that conference is. But half the teams in this league are
more pass-happy than we are. It's not unusual in college football.
The trend now is to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone was TCU's quarterback coach from 1987-91 and held the
same job at Minnesota from 1992-94. He was Mississippi's offensive
coordinator from 1994-98. When Tommy Tuberville left Ole Miss for
Auburn, Mazzone followed.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn opens against Appalachian State, a tough Division I-AA
team, tonight. Mazzone is eager to see how his system works with a
new team and says he's like an expectant father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like standing outside the maternity ward to see what they
look like,'' Mazzone said. ``If they've got 10 fingers and 10 toes,
then I think we'll be all right.''

FRENCH SUMMIT IN MONCTON? IT'S A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONCTON, New Brunswick _ For the record, this is a nice, small
city inhabited by 100,000 or so very nice people. What gritty
Moncton lacks in urbanity, beauty, or _ rather critically for this
occasion _ French ambiance, is counterbalanced by the friendliness
of local folk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question is unavoidable: What on earth was Canada
thinking when it decided to host a summit, beginning Saturday, of
French-speaking nations in this barely-a-city where not quite a
third of those friendly folk speak a word of French?
</P>
<P>
   A place, for that matter, named after an 18th-century English
military commander, Richard Monckton, infamous for his role in a
brutal 1755 campaign to drive French settlers, called Acadians,
from their homes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But that unfortunate bit of history ranks only about midway on
the list of gripes and controversies swirling around the Moncton
summit _ somewhere between the complaints about brown tap water and
the uproar over modern-day war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, prime ministers, and other delegates from 52
ostensibly French-speaking countries arrived Friday for the eighth
biannual summit of l'Agence de la Francophonie, a sort of French
league allied by language, which the Globe and Mail newspaper
described this week as ``of short history, vague goals, and a
dubious membership.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monctonians are fretting that protests by human rights
groups might turn the summit into a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   For along with an array of perfectly upright nations, la
Francophonie embraces a fair number of member states with appalling
human rights records, such as Burundi and Rwanda _ scene of some of
this decade's bloodiest massacres _ along with the thuggish regimes
of Togo, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 28 members of the French league have been censured by
Amnesty International for abuses ranging from the muzzling of
dissidents to murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights watchdogs have blasted Canada for rolling out the
red carpet for some of the visitors. But Ottawa says there's
nothing to be done, since none of the delegates attending the
summit are officially indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these countries are here does not mean we agree
personally with every head of state or government,'' said Don
Boudria, Canada's political representative at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Summit organizers, meanwhile, say they are getting fed up with
all the carping about human rights; not to mention the complaints
about Moncton itself, which critics have described as too small and
too English for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Moncton's defenders note that the town boasts the Universite de
Moncton, Canada's largest French-language university outside
Quebec. And 30,000 or so of Moncton's inhabitants do speak French.
Anyway, English-flavored or not, the town is the only big center in
the vicinity of New Brunswick's Acadian region, where French is the
first tongue for about 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this accenting of the negative,'' said
Fernand Landry, the Canadian director-general of the summit. ``This
is all very marginal compared to the significance of the summit.
This is a historic event. Very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, nobody seems able to explain exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   La Francophonie was founded in 1986 as a sort of French answer
to the Commonwealth, the economic alliance of Britain and its
former colonies. in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   So far, la Francophonie seems an unwieldy and costly exercise
that has done little to accomplish its stated goals of ``building
democracy'' and ``guarding French language and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those messy dictatorships, some Francophonie members
have no significant French-speaking communities or historic
connection to France: Bulgaria is a member in good standing, as are
Romania, the former Soviet republic of Moldova, Egypt, and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The last is at least a former French colony, although English
ranks as the ``second language,'' after Vietnamese, and French has
scarcely been heard for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Albania, Macedonia, and Poland are waiting in the
wings for membership. A cynic might suggest that poorer countries
are only too aware that wealthy France is most likely to loosen its
foreign-aid purse strings to countries showing enthusiasm for
things French.
</P>
<P>
   Another unlikely member is the tiny African archipelago nation
of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony inhabited by 400,000
people, of whom perhaps 500 speak French.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the French teachers, of course, and maybe some
French people who came for our beaches and stayed,'' said a Cape
Verdean official. ``But we admire France very much. And every human
must be loving French wine . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The champagne, chardonnay, and cabernet sauvignon will surely be
flowing like water in Moncton. Which is more than can be said for
the water itself; the stufffrom town taps recently turned an
ominous brown. Rust, maybe. Maybe worse. There is debate about
whether it's safe to drink. On the bright side, local sellers of
bottled water seem destined for a boom _ if supplies last.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4,000 delegates and 450 journalists are expected to
turn out. The Canadian government is popping for most of the bill _
$8.2 million for hotel rooms, booze, limos, and the like, plus
another $8 million for security.
</P>
<P>
   That security will be some of the tightest ever seen in Canada,
with at least 1,500 officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
bracing with Moncton police for any eventuality. ``Whenever there's
this many heads of state, there is a risk that terrorists might
grab the opportunity to put their plight on the world stage,'' said
Mounted Police Sergeant Andre Guertin.
</P>
<P>
   Down on Main Street, whose freshly-painted corner signs read
``Rue Main,'' Moncton's inhabitants are savoring their moment in
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tourists, sure, but not many presidents and prime
ministers stop by, especially not from Africa,'' said Veronica
MacDonald, a telephone sales manager. ``People are just thrilled
Moncton is finally getting recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of New Brunswick isn't too hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec, whose official language is French, hosted an earlier
summit of la Francophonie, and New Brunswick is the only other
Canadian province with a substantial population of French speakers.
It is the only officially bilingual province in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Moncton was a tougher call.
</P>
<P>
   Although the former railroad center lies on the edge of New
Brunswick's French-Acadian region, it doesn't boast much French
character, with the notable exception of the Universite de Moncton,
a prominent French-language university.
</P>
<P>
   The main local landmark is a 413-foot, steel-and-concrete
telecommunications tower. And Moncton's only real tourist
attraction is the tidal bore _ a twice-daily surge of water up the
Petitcodiac River from the Bay of Fundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Moncton won't remind anyone of Paris or Quebec City, but
the university does make us a French center, and the summit should
help our image as a place of French culture,'' said George Wybouw,
dean of the faculty of administration at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real reaching out between the two communities,
French and English, in New Brunswick. And that is a positive thing
in a country where the two sides seldom meet.''

ADVENTUROUS TRAVELERS GETTING MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE AND BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so many well-educated and well-heeled travelers, physician
Steven L. Putterman wanted to see the more exotic and adventurous
side of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Putterman's co-workers, who mourned him at a memorial service
Friday in Worcester, Mass., said his curiosity about other cultures
was fueled in part by a desire to find out where his many immigrant
patients came from.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the 36-year-old toured Vietnam. And for the past
four years, Putterman and his father, William, took off on annual
African safaris, returning home each time with enchanted memories
and the promise to return.
</P>
<P>
   But when the small charter plane they were riding in last
Wednesday crashed into the slope of a volcano in Tanzania, killing
them and eight other American tourists during a luxury 15-day
safari, it spotlighted the dangers of the popular and growing
pursuit of ``adventure travel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with seeing new and different cultures, there is an
inherent amount of risk in any foreign travel, especially if you
are going into undeveloped places where the infrastructure is not
as sophisticated as your own hometown,'' said Nancy Zimmerman,
executive editor of Outside magazine's annual travel guide,
published in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people shouldn't believe that simply because they are
paying a lot of money for a high-end tour, they are buying ways out
of the risks involved in flying in undeveloped places,'' she said.
``These risks, though, can be part of the danger and part of the
allure.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing segments of the
tourism industry, increasing about six to eight percent each year,
according to the Adventure Travel Society in Colorado. In the
United States alone, it has become a $240 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stereotypical profile of an adventure traveler as a
20-something wanting to surf in Sri Lanka's war-torn shores,
today's adventure traveler is more likely a 47-year-old woman who
wants to explore the exotica of Sumatra or Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists say the allure of adventure travel has been
fueled in part by the media and technology. Images of faraway lands
-- once just the dreamy stuff of National Geographic Magazine --
now jump to life on computer screens in living rooms across
America, making the world seem more accessible than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, too, who have benefitted the most from the robust
economy have the disposable incomes to afford much more than one
trip of a lifetime, and to the farthest reaches of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has become a smaller place and the more you see, the
more you are interested and the more you are willing to go
anywhere,'' said Jane Monahan, 54, an attorney from East Hartford,
Conn., who took her son, Jack, 11, on a two-week, guided African
safari last month. She's now planning a similar trip to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't consider myself an adventure traveler. People
who trek across the Serengetti are adventure travelers,'' Monahan
said. ``We had luxury accommodations, much like Europe, and I think
that's a draw for a lot of people too. You have the amenities but
with much more exciting scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Many like Monahan are willing to pay top dollar for these types
of tours, as long as they can be guaranteed a unique experience --
which often includes the security of four-star hotels, interpreters
and experienced guides -- and a safe return home.
</P>
<P>
   But strict safety regulations that govern everything from
airline to canoe travel in the United States, often don't apply
overseas, even if an American tour company is organizing a trip.
Safety rules in developing countries are likely to be much more lax
than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes political unrest can exact a horrific toll on
luxury travelers. In late 1998, eight tourists on a mountain
gorilla trek were abducted and killed by Hutu rebels in Uganda.
Abercrombie and Kent -- the same Chicago travel company the
Puttermans used -- were among several tour operators who led
tourists on the Uganda expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury tour guides often stress safety, be it helmets for white
water rafting trips down the Zambezi River in Zimbabwe, or a
doctor's permission to hike Fish River Canyon in Namibia. And
wealthy American clients expect impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some adventure travel tours offer ``extreme''
experiences that can end in tragedy. In July, 19 people --
including several tourists -- perished in Switzerland while
``canyoning,'' a sport in which participants slide, jump or rappel
down waterfalls and streams into gorges without rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, dozens of adventurers trek to Katmandu and pay as
much as $65,000 each to take guided hikes to the top of Mount
Everest. In May 1996 eight climbers from one expedition were
trapped in a furious blizzard and died before reaching the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury safari operators in South Africa may even indulge in a
little overkill: Knowing that clients may be worried about wild
animals, some tours advertise armed guides when, in fact, there is
little danger of an animal attack, those in the industry say.
</P>
<P>
   While frightening, those precautions and assurances of safety
may lull some less-seasoned travelers into a false feeling of
security. The opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have the cash to spend on up-scale `adventure'
travel have much different expectations that someone who is in
their 20s, backpacking and just see what happens,'' said Kristina
Rundquist, spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Agents.
``They may not know the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and others in the tourism industry say that by the time
most travelers get to Africa -- like Putterman -- they are often
sophisticated enough to know the risks of traveling in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go hiking or diving in the United States and then you
might go to Europe, Australia and then start into Asia and southern
Africa,'' said Jerry Mallett, president of the Adventure Travel
Society. ``It's not usually a first trip. These people understand
they are risk takers. And a lot of the clients don't think they are
in a ``911'' society where they can call up and get help.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Rundquist, an airplane crash -- while tragic and
suspicious when it happens overseas -- can be just what it is, an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what country you are in, you can't have control over
weather or plane issues,'' she said.

   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany _ This gritty town is the home of Oskar
Lafontaine, Germany's former finance minister, and of a slogan he
coined that has proved less ephemeral than his brief tenure in the
government: ``The heart beats on the left, and it's not yet listed
on the stock exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine has gone, from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government and from German politics. But in this coal and steel
producing area with a strong labor union tradition, the conviction
that Social Democracy must stand for solidarity, for workers'
rights, for the downtrodden and for a comprehensive welfare state
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   So strongly, in fact, that the small Saarland region, which
holds a critical state election Sunday, has become an unlikely
focus of the identity crisis of Schroeder's 136-year-old Social
Democratic Party and of the ideological battles of the European
left as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the left in Europe has been casting around for a new
identity that draws a distinction between a ``market economy,'' now
generally endorsed, and a ``market society,'' an expression widely
used to denote an unacceptable European surrender to what is
perceived as American capitalist excess. But how business-friendly
the left should be remains in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has a different culture, with less solidarity, and we
do not want such social Darwinism in Germany,'' said Reinhard
Klimmt, Lafontaine's Social Democratic successor as state premier
of the region. ``My heart, like my predecessor's, beats on the
left, but I am afraid that Mr. Schroeder's beats everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's policies have certainly veered this way and
that since he took office almost a year ago. But lately he has
appeared determined to steer the Social Democrats away from their
proud roots in the German labor movement toward the entrepreneurial
enthusiasms of Britain's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Schroeder has rejected calls for a wealth
tax, clamped down on pensions, said the state's 49 percent share of
the German economy must be slashed, and proclaimed that the
40-year-old program defining Social Democracy's aims must be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the new politics to succeed, it must promote a go-ahead
mentality and a new entrepreneurial spirit at all levels of
society,'' Schroeder wrote recently in a paper on the so-called
``Third Way'' of a revamped Left that he co-signed with Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is to this sort of language, with its whiff of a business
consultant's jargon and its remoteness from the factory floor, that
Klimmt, aged 57, has objected. He has focused his election campaign
here on the themes of social justice still dear to the French
Socialist party and praising old ideals of Social Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk of high-tech,'' Klimmt declared to a meeting of
labor union leaders this week. ``Well, there is high-tech in coal
and steel production, too. What is forgotten today is that behind
all the computers, there are people, and we are here to defend the
rights of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The applause was enthusiastic. But Klimmt is in a fierce
struggle for his political life, running neck-and-neck with a
dynamic Christian Democratic candidate, Peter Mueller, 43, who has
declared roundly that the Saarland coal industry, which employs
about 11,000 people, must be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to confront the truth _ the German coal industry is
uncompetitive and will die,'' said Udo Recktenwald, Mueller's
spokesman. ``What we should be worrying about is insuring that the
children of these miners have jobs in telecommunications and
service industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats won comfortably here in the last election,
in 1994, taking 49.4 percent of the vote to the Christian
Democrats' 38.5 percent. Klimmt's difficulties reflect several
factors: the poor start of Schroeder's government, anger at
Lafontaine for abandoning politics, and the frustrations of a
region that is uncertain of its economic future.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Saarland is a microcosm of Germany's dilemmas.
It has deep-rooted coal and steel industries where employment has
already fallen to a combined total of about 20,000 from 120,000 a
decade ago, an unemployment rate of 17 percent in the city of
Saarbruecken, and nascent software and technology industries whose
outlook could not be further removed from the hulking factories of
old.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, it was precisely the workers in those heavy
industries who long provided a bedrock of the Social Democratic
party. How the party can modernize while not alienating this core
support remains its central dilemma _ to which Schroeder and Klimmt
now offer sharply differing answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Schroeder's slogan of `The New Middle,''' Klimmt
said. ``I like innovation with social justice. Of course, we must
encourage new businesses. But we must also raise wages in line with
productivity, maintain pensions and not cut the budget too hard.
It's fine to say `Let the Best Man Win,' but we must also help the
loser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The specter of people stripped of their dignity by an
uncontrolled global market seems to lie close to the heart of
Saarland Social Democracy. But in fact, the Saarland has adapted
considerably over the last decade, rapidly developing a car and
auto-parts industry to replace some of the jobs lost in steel and
coal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a highly successful software company called
IDS Scheer, which now employs more than 800 people, has led a push
into high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   Drive westward out of Saarbruecken and the difficulty of this
transformation _ still far from complete and uncertain of success _
becomes clear. The rusted pipes and brick chimneys of abandoned
steelworks and mines seem to stand in massive rebuke to the brisk,
silent activity of the offices at the Saarbruecken Innovation and
Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   Here, IDS has its headquarters. ``Germany's problem is that we
are too deep in the old industries and not good enough in finance,
computers, services,'' said August-Wilhelm Scheer, the company's
chief executive and a member of the so-called ``Future Team'' of
Mueller, the Christian Democratic candidate. ``Here, we have great
technology thousands of meters beneath the earth mining an outdated
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The German coal industry is destined to consume over $2 billion
in subsidies by the year 2005. But Klimmt insisted it has a future,
saying contracts already signed with power stations would cover all
production until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, of course, is far wider than coal. It is the
pace of change, the place of traditional industries and the
viability of the social-market model of consensus and mediation
with unions that served Germany so well for most of the post-war
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Saarland election will hinge on these questions.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues on which Schroeder and Klimmt differ. Where the
Saarland candidate sees the death of old socialist values, the
chancellor sees the possible birth of a more deregulated Germany
that alone will create the jobs that must be found if Schroeder is
to stand a chance of re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the chancellor has given guarded
support to the Social Democratic candidate because the loss of the
state would severely weaken the party in the Upper House, or
Bundesrat. But if Klimmt wins, the tensions within the party may
worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are desperately stretched as a party, and our identity is
unclear,'' said Hajo Hoffmann, the Social Democratic mayor of
Saarbruecken. ``A basic problem is that Tony Blair has managed to
combine new technology with emotion and so make it seem exciting,
while we have not found a personality big enough to bind the
modernizing center and the old guard beneath a single reformist
banner.''

   MALULA, Syria _ These days, Damascus lies just 45 minutes away,
on improved roads that mean that the journey between this isolated
village and the capital no longer strikes anyone as forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   But linguistically, Malula is still a place unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the barren Qalamun Mountains the people do not speak
Arabic, at least among themselves. That language has been the
lingua franca in this part of the world for more than 1,000 years,
but theirs is even older, going back nearly 3,000 years to around
900 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The language is Aramaic, the one spoken by Jesus Christ.
Everywhere else, it died out centuries ago, but here, somehow, it
has endured, insulated by isolation and nurtured by pride. Only in
Malula, with a population of about 5,000, and in two nearby
villages does Aramaic survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Damascus, people look at us funny, and they ask what
language are you speaking,'' said Assad Barkeel, 24. Like nearly
everyone else here, Barkeel learned Aramaic from the cradle, and
also like nearly everyone else, he says he is determined to pass on
the gift to another generation.
</P>
<P>
   As home to several Christian holy sites, including the
fourth-century St. Sergius' Church, which was built to honor
soldiers slain by a Roman emperor because of their beliefs, Malula
has long been a haven for Christians. They make up about half the
population, a far larger proportion than the 13 percent in Syria as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the link to Jesus Christ makes some Christians more
passionate about preserving the language, there is no divide when
it comes to Aramaic in Malula. Muslims and Christians alike chatter
in a language that is incomprehensible to most other Syrians and to
almost everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In what are now Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian
territories, Aramaic was for centuries the language of daily life,
and it was thriving at the time of Jesus. (Hebrew was reserved for
religious worship.) Parts of the Bible were written in Aramaic,
scholars say, as were parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as a spoken language, it was overtaken in the seventh
century, giving way to others, including Syriac and Arabic. It has
disappeared entirely as a written language, with parts of its
alphabet utterly lost to memory.
</P>
<P>
   But although it no longer survives as a written language,
scholars and clerics sometimes adopt a rough system of
transcription to render the spoken sounds in a recognizable script,
usually Hebrew or Arabic. This allows an Aramaic liturgy to be used
in some Syrian churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Malula, spoken Aramaic has lived on, unmolested by successive
conquerors who never bothered to force conformity on such a remote
place, a redoubt that lies at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, its residents have lived simply, and mostly in
isolation, perched in houses dug into the steep hillside and
drawing their livelihoods from the spring-fed land below. To
venture to Damascus was long an arduous journey, across land that
was scorched in the summer and covered by snow in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century has brought the capital closer, and with it,
Arabic in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   But not even new jobs in Damascus and the demands of modern life
have quenched the habit of speaking Aramaic at home. People say
they have become ever more determined to keep the language alive.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw outsiders come and pay so much attention to our
language, we thought it was our responsibility to learn more,''
said Suleiman Wakim, 51, the owner of a tiny sandwich shop that
specializes in neatly browned falafel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a local legend dating from World War II, when Syria
was still a French protectorate, some people here still look with
suspicion at those who turn up in Malula and claim to marvel at
what has endured. As the story has it, a visiting scholar who
proclaimed his passion for Aramaic turned out instead to be a
German spy.
</P>
<P>
   But recent years have brought not only a fresh batch of
scholars, but also the early taste of tourist dollars, in a tide
that sometimes makes for an eclectic mix.
</P>
<P>
   One recent resident widely described with much affection was
Werner Arnold, a German linguist who asked to be known as Abu
Ibrahim during the several years he spent trying to master the
region's most obscure tongue. Some of his students have taken up
residence in his place, and old men like Mikhal Halal, 75, say they
still cannot believe that the foreigners have learned to speak
better Aramaic than he does.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the hilltop St. Sergius' Church, which attracts
many Christian pilgrims, the Rev. Fayez Frejat, a ruddy-faced
58-year-old Greek Catholic priest, delights visitors by reciting
the Lord's Prayer in Aramaic even though he cannot speak the
language, having been assigned to Malula just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, experts say, some 18,000 Syrians speak Aramaic,
including those who live in the nearby villages, Bakha and Jubadin.
</P>
<P>
   Of that total, though, perhaps half have left the villages for
better opportunities in the capital. Most return to the mountains
in the summer, and most still speak Aramaic at home to their
children, but it is that exodus that worries some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the interior minister, I'd pass a law that said no
one from Malula could marry outside these villages,'' Frejat said.
``Unless they hear the language at home, the children will grow up
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, extraordinary measures are being taken.
Orphans, in many cases, are brought up by Aramaic-speaking nuns.
With the piaturesque heart of the village and its narrow, steep
alleyways already chockablock with houses, permission from the
government has been sought and won to allow new construction on the
outskirts, to make room for newlyweds and their growing families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is becoming more interested in preserving Aramaic,''
said Ali Muqdah, 31. ``It's our language, after all.''

 &HT;    WACO: WHAT HAS HAPPENED
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a 10-day frenzy of press releases,
disclosures, and announcements of congressional hearings and
special Justice Department investigations into the 1993 shootout
and siege at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, here's
the news:
</P>
<P>
   1. FBI agents acknowledged they fired what the bureau says was
``a very limited number'' of exploding tear gas canisters at a
concrete bunker near the wooden building occupied by members of the
religious sect on April 19, the day the building erupted in flames
_ something the bureau had previously denied.
</P>
<P>
   2. Attorney General Janet Reno, who had approved the use of tear
gas to drive David Koresh and his followers out of the building
where they had been holed up for 51 days, said she had been assured
by FBI officials that no pyrotechnic devices had been used on the
day of the fire in which 76 Branch Davidians died.
</P>
<P>
   3. Two recordings, one a videotape and the other an audiotape,
carrying the voices of FBI officials at Waco discussing the use of
the pyrotechnic rounds were released.
</P>
<P>
   Period.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of these three facts, Reno has sent deputy U.S.
marshals on a nearly unprecedented mission to FBI offices to take
possession of one of the tapes and has announced that she will
appoint an outside investigator to review the use of the exploding
tear gas canisters and the handling of information about them.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government
Reform Committee, has announced he will hold further hearings on
the Waco affair to find out if Reno and the Justice Department
``misled Congress and the American people about what happened at
Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   While what happened in the past 10 days has shed very little new
light on the Branch Davidian affair, the fact that new questions
are now being asked seems more important than the questions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, facing the worst damage to its credibility in several
years, has been forced to acknowledge that its six years of
insistence that flammable, pyrotechnic rounds were not used at Waco
was false.
</P>
<P>
   It also says its officials misled Reno on this point when she
approved the use of CS tear gas at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional testimony, the recently released tape recordings
and newly available government documents show that events leading
to the end of the Waco siege began falling into place on April 12,
1993, one week before the final conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the standoff between FBI agents and Davidians had
dragged on for 44 days. Koresh had spent hours on the telephone
with negotiators, preaching about his religious views on the New
Testament's Book of Revelations and reneging on promises to give
up.
</P>
<P>
   Webster Hubbell, the longtime friend of President and Mrs.
Clinton who served briefly as associate attorney general before
being charged by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr with tax
evasion, testified before Burton's committee in 1995 that the FBI
had sought permission to use tear gas on Koresh and his followers
and was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell indicated it was he who initially denied the request. He
said William Sessions, then director of the FBI, and agents
involved in the Waco standoff asked to take the request directly to
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, Reno, Hubbell and two other unidentified Justice
Department officials met with Sessions, other FBI officials and two
officers from the Army's elite ``Delta Force'' antiterrorism unit
in a conference room adjacent to Sessions' office at FBI
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Also present was Harry Salem, a CS gas expert from the Army's
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   According to written accounts and testimony about the meeting,
Sessions, his deputy and three agents who had been actively
involved in the Waco siege urged Reno to approve use of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reportedly questioned Salem about the effects of the gas
and was told that while extremely unpleasant, it was safe, even
when used on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that the attorney general had already been
briefed on the concept of the operation,'' one of the two Delta
Force officers wrote later. ``Special Agent Dick Rogers gave a
brief summary of his plan, using a series of enlarged photographs
of the compound and a model made of cardboard and wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI saw this as an arrest situation and not a hostage
barricade. Their goal was to force the compound inhabitants out of
the building so they could be arrested. Dick Rogers stated to
Attorney General Janet Reno that his primary concern was for the
safety of the FBI agents and other law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their view was that this was not an assault. The stated intent
was to incrementally 'gas' the compound for up to 48 hours. After
48 hours, the next step would be to use an armored platform with a
blade to start removing the front of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell later testified that the Delta Force officers assured
him and the attorney general that if the gas were blown into the
Davidian compound the occupants would be forced to come out. After
this meeting, Reno approved use of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Within three weeks, she would find herself testifying before the
House Judiciary Committee, taking ``full responsibility'' for the
tragic ending of the Waco standoff.
</P>
<P>
   She would also testify that she had sought and obtained the
FBI's assurance that no ``pyrotechnic'' tear gas rounds would be
used at the Waco standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions testified that the bureau had carefully chosen tear gas
that would not ``start or contribute to a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next six years, the FBI has stuck to the position that
no exploding or pyrotechnic devices were used at Waco. This
position began to unravel week before last.
</P>
<P>
   First, a former agent revealed that a few tear gas canisters
equipped with explosives to spread the gas were fired at a concrete
bunker about 40 yards from the Davidians' compound on April 19,
1993, the day the siege ended.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Reno denied that this was true.
</P>
<P>
   Then the FBI reversed itself, revealing that in 1996 bureau
lawyers preparing for wrongful death lawsuits brought against the
FBI by survivors of some of the Davidians who died in the fire
interviewed agents on the scene and learned of the exploding
canisters. A memorandum outlining these interviews lay in the files
of the bureau's office of general counsel for the next three years,
according to spokesman Tron(cq) Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   Brekke said the canisters, which are manufactured for military
use, were used at Waco because agents were concerned that the
concrete bunker, connected by a tunnel to the wooden Davidian
compound, could be used as a refuge from the gas by Koresh and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   He said non-exploding ``ferret'' tear gas rounds had failed to
penetrate the bunker and that the exploding rounds were used in a
manner that involved firing them away from the Branch Davidian
building hours before the compound burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   When the exploding canisters were fired, armored military
vehicles had been used to ``puncture'' the walls of the wooden
building and start blowing the tear gas _ which is actually a fine
crystalline powder _ inside.
</P>
<P>
   After denying again that it ever used pyrotechnic rounds, the
bureau says it found the 1996 memo the week before last. It
promptly reversed itself and revealed that six years of denials had
been untrue _ at least as far as two or three tear gas canisters
were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was furious. She said on Aug. 26, that she was ``very, very
upset'' at being misled by the FBI and would order a new
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility,'' she
admitted. ``That's the reason I am going to pursue it until I get
to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's legendary temper reportedly went up
several more notches last week when FBI Director Louis Freeh said
he would welcome an investigation by someone outside the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the FBI announced that it had found an audiotape of a
conversation about using the exploding canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had the marshals seize them.
</P>
<P>
   While these events were playing out, Burton and others were
calling for investigations by congressional committees and
``special commissions.'' Referring to the presence of Delta Force
troops _ reportedly as observers _ at Waco, Burton also said he
wants to find out if a federal law prohibiting the use of military
force against American civilians without a special presidential
order was violated.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the FBI released a videotape, made from a helicopter
equipped with an infrared camera, that also recorded the
conversation about the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. McGavin, a supervisor on the hostage rescue team, can
be heard on the tape, asking Rogers _ who a week earlier had used
the cardboard model to show Reno how he planned to use the CS gas _
for permission to fire exploding canisters at the concrete bunker,
which had resisted non-exploding rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 8 a.m. _ not 6 a.m., as the FBI has said _ Rogers
asked McGavin if an agent could get safely get into position to
fire the exploding rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten-four. He thinks he can get into position with relative
safety utilizing the track for cover and attempt to penetrate it
with military rounds,'' McGavin answered, referring to the
pyrotechnic tear gas devices. The ``track'' was one of the armored
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger. Of course, if there's water underneath, that's just
going to extinguish the tear gas canisters , but you can try it,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten-four. Copy. He can try it?'' McGavin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' Rogers answered.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have said the exploding canisters failed to
explode and bounced off the bunker and into the water.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the tear-gassing of the main building had started.
</P>
<P>
   And about four hours later, the compound would burst into
flames.

   With summer unofficially over come Tuesday, many investors may
be hoping that the return to work will also mean a return to the
bull market in stocks. Even though August brought a new high for
the Dow Jones industrial average, most stocks are still trading
well below their highs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's spectacular leaps in both the Dow and Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 could indicate that the back-to-work effect will indeed be good
for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But such a view makes light of several factors weighing heavily
on the markets. Most significant are rising interest rates and a
falling dollar. Early signs of increased labor costs and declining
productivity at American companies are also concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee
twice raised interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point.
Each time, investors initially shrugged off the increases, choosing
to see them as isolated moves, not part of a longer-term trend.
Then economic data would come out showing that economic growth was
as strong as ever _ and investors would get jittery again, pushing
down stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many bond traders are expecting another increase in rates
at the Fed's Oct. 5 meeting. And while most investors have assumed
that the Fed will not raise rates after October, for fear of
colliding with Year 2000 problems that may arise, a fourth increase
is no longer being ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best circumstances, rising rates create uncertainty in
the stock market; at worst, they pummel share prices. Of course,
nobody knows which will be the case this fall. But investors who
feel certain that the Fed is finished raising interest rates for
the year may want to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co.,
believes that the Fed will raise rates twice more before the year
is out, largely because economic growth in the United States will
be so powerful. Jones expects the gross domestic product to be up
about 4 percent in the second half, compared with the period last
year. ``Greenspan has to engage in a series of moves, and he has to
leave them open-ended,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the stock market is the drift in the dollar,
the linchpin of the bull market in stocks since 1995. ``When the
dollar is rising, we get rising equities and higher valuations,''
explained Steven C. Wieting, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
``When the dollar is collapsing we get higher import prices and
higher inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wieting does not foresee a disorderly collapse in the dollar. So
far, the dollar has been weakest against the Japanese yen, down 11
percent since May.
</P>
<P>
   But any broader weakness in the currency could have a big impact
on domestic stock prices, because foreign investors holding
American financial assets would likely sell them rather than face
further losses resulting from a lower dollar. These investors have
been huge participants in our stock and bond markets as global
economic crises turned the United States into the world's haven.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's productivity numbers also gave some traders pause.
The Labor Department reported that workers' output rose at an
annual rate of only 0.6 percent in the second quarter, the smallest
gain since the corresponding period in 1998. Unit labor costs, the
amount that employers pay in wages and benefits for every item
made, rose 4.5 percent in the quarter, the largest increase since
early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, rebounding economies overseas will bolster
earnings at American corporations. So will a weaker dollar, which
makes American goods cheaper for foreigners to buy. But until
investors fully understand that rates may go higher this fall, they
won't see the risks in the current valuations of stocks.

   Anything You Can Do ... But United They Profit
</P>
<P>
   There is bad news for partisans on either side of the battle of
the sexes: A new study suggests that when it comes to investment
clubs, those that include members of both sexes outperform those of
the single-gender variety.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by E. Brooke Harrington, an assistant professor of
sociology and public policy at Brown University, used two
methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   First, Ms. Harrington looked at the annualized lifetime returns
of 600 to 800 investment clubs for periods ending on or near April
30 each year from 1986 through 1997.. Those were compared with the
returns over identical periods for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, which had been adjusted to reflect hypothetical costs of
brokerage commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The research showed that the mean return of all-male investment
clubs lagged behind the adjusted returns of the S&AMP;P 500 by 0.56
percentage point, annualized, while the mean return of the
all-female investment clubs beat the index by 0.28 percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was that the mean return of the mixed-sex
investment clubs beat the adjusted S&AMP;P 500 by an impressive 1.98
percentage point, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Ms. Harrington looked at the returns of 1,279 clubs
from their inception through early 1998; those were categorized as
either single- or mixed-gender. This time, both lagged behind the
S&AMP;P 500, but those of the mixed variety trailed by a smaller
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrington, who also spent 10 months observing the behavior
of investment clubs first hand, says she may have nailed down two
key reasons for the diverging performances.
</P>
<P>
   First, Ms. Harrington said, the two sexes display different
biases in picking stocks, with men focusing on stocks related to
their work experiences and women, including professional ones,
tending to pick consumer-product stocks. So the mixed clubs tended
to pick a more diversified group of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And, Ms. Harrington said, the investment performance of
single-gender clubs suffered from a tendency for these clubs _
often formed by friends _ to be more ``socially cohesive,'' with
members afraid to hurt the feelings of others or knock down their
investing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was group think going on,'' she said referring to those
of the single-gender variety. ``In mixed clubs, there's less at
stake socially.'' Mixed clubs are more likely to be formed by
colleagues, who are used to disagreeing about work-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDS WATCH
</P>
<P>
   When Indexes Get It Wrong
</P>
<P>
   You can't go wrong buying stock index funds, many investors
think. But what if the indexes themselves are wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Frank Russell Co. mistakenly switched five
stocks to its Russell 1000 Value index that should have been in its
Russell 1000 Growth index. Among the stocks: the giant IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The error resulted in a fleeting boost in the technology
weighting of the value index, by about 40 percent. But the effect
on mutual funds was minimal. Just two small funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, use the
benchmarks for indexing purposes _ John Hancock Core Growth and
John Hancock Core Value, which are managed to reflect the risk in
those indexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, and these two portfolios, the impact was tiny,'' said
David L. Eisenberg, John Hancock's chief equity strategist. But, he
added, brushing off the mistake would have been tougher had it
occurred in a more widely followed index, as funds might have had
to buy or sell several million dollars' worth of stock to bring
their funds into alignment with the benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   New Fund for Initial Offerings
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the San Francisco securities firm that has
long specialized in underwriting the initial offerings of
technology and health care companies, is planning a fund that will
invest in new issues.
</P>
<P>
   The company, according to registration statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, plans to offer load and no-load
versions of the fund, the H&AMP;Q IPO ... and Emerging Company fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statement, the fund ``is designed to offer
individual investors the benefits of investing in a diversified
portfolio of common stocks acquired as part of, or within 18 months
of, a company's initial public offering.''
</P>
<P>
   The subadviser for the fund will be Symphony Asset Management,
using a quantitative stock-picking strategy. Ross Sakamoto, a
portfolio manager at Symphony, will manage the fund. As for dry
spells in the new-issues market, the fund will be able to invest in
broad-based indexes if it feels that new offerings are not of
sufficient quantity or quality.

THE CLOUDS OVER FREDDIE AND FANNIE

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This sounds like an outfit that should have a winning stock:
It's one of only seven companies to post double-digit earnings
growth every year since 1986; it has the power to borrow billions
at rates almost low as the Treasury's; it is excused from paying
state or local income tax, and it has posted 1998 profits that
approach $900,000 an employee.
</P>
<P>
   And though it is one of the biggest financial institutions in
the United States, it is not subject to the capital requirements
that apply to banks.
</P>
<P>
   This is Fannie Mae, the government-chartered mortgage company,
whose stock price has multiplied nearly 70-fold since it began
trading on the New York Stock Exchange 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So why are shares in this money machine down 10.3 percent this
year, while major indexes are up 10.4 percent to 29.7 percent? And
why is its younger brother, Freddie Mac, which enjoys most of
Fannie's advantages, doing even worse, down 14 percent?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see several reasons for the poor performance, which has
pushed Fannie and Freddie shares down to $66.375 and $55.4375,
respectively, or about 19 and 18 times this year's earnings. Those
are about 70 percent of the price-to-earnings multiple of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, 10 to 20 percentage points less
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious factor is the climb in interest rates that
pushed 30-year conventional mortgages from just under 7 percent at
the beginning of the year to more than 8 percent during part of
August, although they have retreated a bit since. ``They're
perceived to be the most rate-sensitive financial stocks,'' said
Thomas E. Hanley, a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read and a
financial services analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae's main business is raising money in world capital
markets and using it to buy mortgages from banks that originate
them; it often packages these loans as securities and sells them to
others, recycling the proceeds. It also earns fees from guarantees
of mortgage payments, which are viewed by markets as the equivalent
of those coming from the government. Freddie Mac operates similarly
but keeps more mortgages it buys in its own portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profit from the spread between what
they pay for money and what they charge. But higher rates generally
shrink lending volume and can nearly shut down refinancings.
Moreover, borrowers facing higher rates turn increasingly from
conventional to adjustable-rate mortgages, which originators are
more likely to keep on their own books.
</P>
<P>
   David N. Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management, a money
management firm in Jersey City, has been a longtime holder of both
stocks and calls the conventional view wrongheaded. ``They're
extremely interest-sensitive in market perception,'' he said. ``In
reality they're not,'' he added, pointing to the last round of Fed
rate increases in 1994 and 1995, when earnings held up better than
those of the S&AMP;P 500. ``They hedge their portfolios very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates are only one of the clouds hovering over
these formerly stellar stocks. Another is the notion that their
huge size has become an impediment to growth _ suggesting a
structural decline in profitability and prompting them to look at
related fields like writing mortgage insurance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they have been forced to compete more
intensely with each other and, recently, with another
government-sponsored body, the Federal Home Loan Banks, whose
shares are not traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fannie and Freddie have been so successful that people are
taking seriously the notion that they've become too big,'' said
Michael Hodes, a mortgage finance analyst at Goldman Sachs. The
crucial question, Hodes said, is this: ``Should these things
continue to be considered growth stocks, given their size?''
</P>
<P>
   Dreman countered that while there is more competition, ``they're
still growing fairly rapidly,'' and long-term growth rates are
stable. ``These are really growth stocks that the market has
hammered badly this year,'' he said. ``These are probably two of
the best stocks that a manager could hold.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there is also a counterattack
from a deep-pocketed alliance of banking and mortgage trade groups
called FM Watch. The group formed in June, specifically to head off
what it contends is an effort by the two giants to encroach on its
members' territories in search of new revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   FM Watch expresses particular concern about efforts like an
advertising campaign that seemed to critics to be aimed at
establishing a Fannie Mae consumer brand name, which would
naturally be helpful in dealing with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's actions over the past few years
have moved them beyond their unique charters in a way that is more
beneficial to their investors than home buyers and taxpayers,'' FM
Watch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's president, not only denies
interest in consumer markets but has also publicly offered to
tattoo on his forehead a statement that the company will not
originate loans. That, Fannie Mae notes, is one of the few powers
specifically precluded by its charter.
</P>
<P>
   Raines has also unleashed one of the capital's fiercest lobbying
teams to pressure companies and trade groups not to join the FM
Watch coalition. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a prime
candidate, has held off so far.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meagley, portfolio manager of the Safeco Equity fund,
which owns shares of Fannie Mae, said he did not see either
company's profits being hurt by FM Watch in the next five years.
But, he said, the group's existence ``will keep a lid somewhat on
the P/Es of both of them'' because of the risk that a political
backlash will result in attempts to alter the companies' special
status.

DRUG DEN REVEALED IN MIT LAUGHING-GAS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A drug den in one of the nation's most
prestigious universities offered an assortment of highs:
amphetamines, marijuana, mushrooms -- even laughing gas.
</P>
<P>
   But it took the death of MIT senior Richard Guy _ who was
asphyxiated after inhaling nitrous oxide in a dormitory room last
Tuesday _ to lead investigators to what they described as a
``substantive drug operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same room where Guy lay dead police found a cache of
drugs and paraphernalia that hinted at a substantial drug operation
including packaging supplies and scales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often cases of this type are hard to get at because they're so
underground,'' said MIT Police Chief Anne Glavin.
</P>
<P>
   Friday police charged an MIT student and her boyfriend, an
alumnus, with seven counts of possession with intent to sell drugs.
But Susan Mosher and Rene Ruiz, both 22, won't be charged with
Guy's death, Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   MIT President Charles M. Vest said the university won't likely
suspend or expell Mosher, at least not until her case makes its way
through the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said she did not know the whereabouts of the alleged drug
dealers. But she said she expects they will appear in District
Court Sept. 10 for arraignment. If they don't, arrest warrants will
be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no communication with them,'' Glavin said. She
declined to say if the two are cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher is a senior majoring in brain and cognitive sciences and
Ruiz graduated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before their investigation is over, Glavin said police expect to
charge others involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Though MIT officials have been tight-lipped about the
circumstances surrounding Guy's death, court documents indicate
that police had looked into the possibility that he had committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The night Guy died, Mosher and Ruiz were out of town, records
indicate. They had asked a friend, Alison Novak, to care for their
cat, Rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, just after midnight, when Novak entered the dorm
to feed Rainbow, she found Guy lying on a mattress on the floor.
Over his head was a plastic bag, which police believed he filled
with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, to inhale.
</P>
<P>
   Novak pulled the bag off Guy's head, then ran out of the room,
screaming, ``Help! Does anyone know CPR?''
</P>
<P>
   Two students ran in and tried to resuscitate Guy, but it was too
late. In the meantime, Novak also called police.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators questioned three of Guy's friends, who all said
Guy had been depressed and ``babbled'' often about wanting to
commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Students Dylan Stiles, Kevin McCormick and Nat Friedman all told
investigators that Guy told them he hoped a new anti-depressant he
was taking, Zoloft, would lift him out of his fog. MIT spokesman
Kenneth Campbell said Glavin investigated the possibility that Guy
might have committed suicide, but then dismissed that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conclusion is it was accidental,'' Campbell said. He said
the medical examiner concluded the cause of death was asphyxiation
due to acute intoxication by nitrous oxide. When heavily inhaled,
nitrous oxide can cause oxygen deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's parents spoke to university officials Thursday about their
son's death. A funeral will be held Saturday at Christ Episcopal
Church in Garden City, N.Y. MIT is providing a bus for students and
friends who want to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's death refocuses attention on substance abuse problems at
MIT. In September 1997, Scott Krueger, a freshman, died of alcohol
poisoning after attending a frat party. The fraternity was indicted
on criminal charges, but the case did not go forward. The
university later revoked the diploma of the man who purchased the
alcohol consumed by Krueger.

<P>
   Despite the Federal Reserve's recent attempts to cool the
American economy, the temperature is still pretty hot.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's jobless
rate in August dipped once again, to 4.2 percent, the 29-year low
first reached in March. Even so, employers added 124,000 workers to
their payrolls on top of the 338,000 added in July. And a host of
other measures _ from hours worked to the fraction of Americans who
hold jobs _ showed that the labor market continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor market is tight and getting tighter,'' said Paul
Kasriel, chief U.S. economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at the Labor Department cautioned that both August
and July payroll numbers were distorted because many factories and
businesses that normally close in July to retool and allow workers
to go on vacation didn't this year. Since seasonal adjustment
didn't capture that departure from past patterns, hiring looked
stronger in July and weaker in August than was actually the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at July and August together,'' said Tom Nardone,
chief of labor statistics, ``everything looks like it did earlier
in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which had been bracing itself for signs that the
economy's temperature was even hotter, took comfort in the fact
that the August payroll increase wasn't as large as expected, and
even more in the absence of any sign that wages were taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Hourly pay rose a mere 2 cents in August, to $13.30. Pay had
jumped 10 cents between May and July, frightening investors and
helping to prompt the Fed to raise rates twice this summer. But it
is now just 3.5 percent higher than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This substantially alleviates concerns about another Fed
tightening,'' said Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. ``We thought we were seeing an acceleration in wages, but now
it appears that maybe we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors celebrated with stock and bond rallies. The Dow Jones
industrial average jumped 2.17 percent, and the NASDAQ composite
index had its largest one-day point gain ever, 108.87 points, or
3.98 percent. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell from 6.13 to
6.03.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's relief notwithstanding, employers have been expanding
payrolls faster in the last two months than in the first half of
the year, by 231,000 a month compared with 210,000 a month. That
alone suggests that the economy has picked up steam since the
spring, when growth slowed to a mere 1.8 percent annual rate as a
sharp widening of the trade deficit trimmed the nation's production
of goods and services. Meanwhile, a raft of recent reports point to
robust demand for everything from houses and cars to factory orders
to exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in his right mind would lower their GDP (gross domestic
product) estimate on the basis of today's jobs report,'' said
McKelvey, who estimates that the economy grew at more than a 3.5
percent rate this summer. ``If anything, you could argue that you
should raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Fed more or less in the same bind that it has
been in all year, namely, having to justify rate increases at a
time when, despite rapid growth and a tight labor market, there is
precious little evidence that inflation is breaking out _
especially at the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
   Most of last month's hiring, as usual, took place in the
services area, which already employs the lion's share of America's
work force. Service companies added 219,000 new jobs, only slightly
fewer than the monthly average for the last year. Nearly 50,000 of
those jobs sprouted in business services, many in computer and data
processing. Hiring was strong at brokerage firms, doctors' offices,
hospitals, law firms and all sorts of entertainment businesses,
from movie theaters to amusement parks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But despite help-wanted signs in many of the nation's stores,
retailers hardly added to their head count; retailers had added
99,000 workers to their payrolls in July. And while auto dealers
and furniture stores kept on hiring, fast-food chains and other
restaurants actually reduced the number of workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the otherwise robust job market, there were some glaring weak
spots. Despite a raft of signs _ from rising material prices to
stronger orders and higher production _ that manufacturing is on
the mend as economies in Asia and Europe recover and exports begin
to pick up, factory employment shrank by a sharp 63,000, more than
reversing July's gain of 51,000. But Katherine Abraham,
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cautioned against
reading too much into the August drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of manufacturing job losses has been much slower over
the past two months than during the first half of the year,'' she
said. Makers of cars, furniture, primary metals and electrical
equipment all expanded payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Another soft spot was construction, which shed 29,000 jobs in
August. Essentially, the number of construction jobs is no higher
than it was at the start of the summer. Last summer, by contrast,
construction added 70,000 workers to payrolls. It's not clear,
though, whether higher interest rates are crimping the demand for
new houses, office buildings and roads. Hiring was exceptionally
strong all winter and spring and shortages of both skilled workers
and construction materials may be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market continues to pull in workers who've
historically suffered from high unemployment rates. Unemployment
levels among blacks, Hispanics, women and workers with high school
educations or less are all at or near historic lows. The Labor
Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes not
just those who are job hunting but also those who have stopped
looking, has fallen sharply from a year ago. And employment growth
is outpacing labor force growth by a wider margin than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reserves are dwindling,'' Kasriel said. ``We're calling
them up. That's good for people who are working and want to work.
But we're running out of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's every reason to expect the labor market to stay tight.
Businesses say they anticipate adding to their head counts.
``Hiring plans are strong for the fall,'' said Terry Hueneke,
executive vice president at Manpower Inc., one of the nation's
biggest employment services companies and the sponsor of a
quarterly hiring survey. ``It appears to be fairly well across the
board.''

CHINA DETAINEE CAN'T SHAKE BAD MEMORIES, WIFE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA MASSEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Even in an American hospital, thousands of miles from
the place where he suffered severe injuries while in the custody of
Chinese officials, Daja Meston can't find rest, haunted by
recurring nightmares of his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meston, 29, was inspecting a proposed World Bank project in
northwestern China earlier this month when he was detained by the
Chinese government, which accused him of engaging in an ``illegal
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston scholar and activist sufferred two fractured
veterbrae and crushed heels he jumped or fell from a third-floor
hotel room where he was being questioned by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Boston on a medical-evacuation flight on Tuesday
and was immediately taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital where his
wife, Phuntsok, held a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot describe my feelings of joy and happiness at having
my husband back here after his ordeal in Tibet,'' Phuntsok, 30, a
Tibetan exile, said in her first public comments since her
husband's return. ``What they did to him was inhumane and appalls
me. And what they are doing to other people there who raise
questions, I can hardly imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Phuntsok said her husband, who is more commonly known by his
Tibetan name, Wangchuk, has not told her much about his detainment
or the several days during which officials grilled him in the hotel
room, but said he has had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine what he went through and what he saw,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Meston told a friend that he was ``in hell
for two weeks,'' but ``this is heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple are focusing their ``energy and strength'' on
Meston's recuperation and on the effort to locate Tsering Dorjee, a
translator who was travelling with Meston and another researcher,
Australian Gabriel Lafitte, when the three were detained, Phuntsok
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, Wangchuk's greatest worry is what happened to
Tsering Dorjee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 supporters who gathered outside the hospital Friday
carried signs demanding Dorjee's release. They fear the man may be
treated worse and possibly tortured because he is an ethnic
Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   Meston stressed that her husband, a Jewish-American who was
raised in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal, went to Tibet to
pursue a longstanding interest in Tibetan development.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been daring in his efforts to rally public
sentiment against Chinese efforts to destroy Tibetan culture,
Meston has said he entered China on a tourist visa simply to
interview residents in the Qinghai province about the controversial
World Bank project.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan to resettle 58,000 poor farmers into an area
now dominated by Tibetan and Mongolian herdsmen that is part of
historic Tibet. The plan depends, in part, on World Bank funding.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the project will dilute the Tibetan population in
the area. In June, the World Bank voted to delay its funding
pending a bank inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A highly sought-after translator, Meston assisted US
Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, in making
an unauthorized trip to Tibet two years ago, after which Wolf
sharply condemned Chinese repression of the Tibetans, to the fury
of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Meston was allowed to leave China after signing a confession
outlining his activities in China. ``He agrees with the events,''
family friend Carl Williams said, ``but not . . . that it's a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Gates said Meston was in stable condition and
``recovering well'' Friday. Although he will probably need
permanent pins and screws to repair his bones, he will be able to
walk, Gates added.

REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS EMBRACE GUN CONTROL MEASURES

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As each new high-profile shooting roils the national
debate over gun ownership rights, advocates for greater gun control
are winning a measure of support from Republican governors, an
unlikely source.
</P>
<P>
   After several shootings in recent years, including the mass
shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April,
almost a third of the nation's 31 Republican governors have taken
positions to strengthen gun control in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these governors, including Bill Owens of Colorado and
Bob Taft of Ohio, were strongly endorsed in their last campaign by
the National Rifle Association, which generally favors Republicans
over Democrats and stronger enforcement of existing gun laws rather
than the passage of new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But as the dialogue over gun ownership slowly expands from
arguments over the Second Amendment to include consideration of
public health and safety, a growing number of the Republican
governors have found solutions closer to the political center _
even as Congress has been unable to agree on any new federal gun
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to constituents, the governors have vetoed
legislation that would allow people to carry concealed weapons and
have won or pushed for laws that would require trigger locks, make
parents and other adults responsible for minors' use of their guns
and toughen sentences for crimes committed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   While some governors have defied their own state legislatures to
get measures passed, modest new laws _ primarily dealing with
public safety _ have won support from both sides of the gun debate,
including the NRA, which favors laws that keep guns out of the
hands of children, people with mental disorders and people with a
criminal background, and Handgun Control Inc., a leading advocate
for more restrictive measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine opened a new era in the gun debate,'' said Utah Gov.
Michael Leavitt, a second-term Republican who has fought with his
state's Republican-controlled Legislature for tighter gun control,
including a measure to prohibit concealed weapons in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to get a sense of proportion,'' Leavitt added.
``There is a capacity to protect Second Amendment rights, but that
does not mean we can't limit the way guns are used. That dialogue
is starting to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is evident throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, a package of public safety initiatives signed into
law this year by Gov. George Ryan, a first-term Republican,
included mandatory trigger locks on guns to prevent child access, a
gun storage law that holds parents accountable for acts of violence
committed with a gun by their children, and new penalties for using
guns in crimes, including an automatic 15 years added to the prison
term of someone who brandishes a gun while committing a felony. The
additional penalty rises to 20 years if the gun is fired, and 25
years to life if someone is shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who had the support of Handgun Control in his victorious
1998 campaign against Glenn Poshard, a Democrat, also said he would
veto any bill that would allow Illinois residents to carry a
concealed weapon. Thirty other states have such laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Gov. Bill Graves, a second-term Republican, vetoed a
bill in 1997 that would have allowed state residents to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, who are a strong majority in both the
Kansas House and Senate, have not passed a similar measure since.
</P>
<P>
   This year Graves signed into law a measure he proposed last year
that provides stricter punishment, including the loss of driving
privileges, for students who take weapons into schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where Republicans also control both houses, Taft, a
Republican who is a first-term governor, has refused to endorse any
concealed-handgun bill that does not have the support of the
state's law-enforcement agencies. So far, no bill has reached his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where both houses of the Legislature are
overwhelmingly Democratic, Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican, signed
into law last year a sweeping package of initiatives that included
a ban on assault weapons, increases in fines and prison terms for
gun-related crimes and a prohibition against gun dealers selling
weapons from their residences.
</P>
<P>
   This year Cellucci introduced legislation that would impose
stiffer penalties against anyone who shot a gun at a car or at a
house, school or other building.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Republican governors, Marc Racicot of Montana this
year vetoed a measure that would have allowed anyone carrying a
concealed gun to enter a bar or a restaurant that sells alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has vowed to veto any
concealed-weapon bill.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman says she supports mandatory
child-proof locks for guns.
</P>
<P>
   And Connecticut Gov. John Rowland signed into law this year a
measure that allows the authorities to remove guns from the homes
of people believed to be a threat to the community.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors are responding to their constituents,'' said Joe
Sudbay, director of state legislation for Handgun Control, who
contends that two of the most recent shootings of children, at
Columbine High and at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in
Los Angeles in August, energized people around the country as no
events before.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   NRA chief lobbyist James J. Baker said that the NRA supported
the governors' efforts as ``common-sense proposals that the
shrieking of the media have drowned out'' in focusing on
gun-related issues in purely Second Amendment terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more complicated debate than that,'' Baker said, adding
that the rifle NRA supported sensible measures that both sides
could agree on, like trigger locks and pilot programs like Project
Exile, in which cities prosecute gun violations in federal courts,
where penalties are stiffer than in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas of law where we can find a lot of common
good,'' Baker said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps no two Republican governors have encountered more
opposition in pushing through new measures than Owens in Colorado
and Leavitt in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when the Columbine High shootings occurred, the
Colorado Legislature was preparing to pass a package of gun
initiatives, including one that would have made it easier for more
state residents to carry a concealed weapon and another that would
grant gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. After the
shootings, the concealed-weapons bill was pulled, and the Governor
vetoed the immunity measure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shootings, the governor has advocated measures that
would hold parents accountable for the use of guns they own,
require sales at gun shows to include the same background checks as
sales in retail stores, and raise the minimum age for sales at gun
shows to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent shooting, in which a man killed his three
daughters, prompted Owens to order the Colorado Bureau of
Investigation to conduct background checks on all gun sales to pick
up state and local concerns that the standard federal check might
miss.
</P>
<P>
   For those efforts, Owens has drawn fire from several gun
organizations in the state. The Rocky Mountain Gun Owners group
calls him `'Governor Gun Control,'' and the Colorado State Shooting
Association, an affiliate of the NRA, has vowed to defeat the
measures when the Legislature returns in January.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, fatal shootings this year in two Salt Lake City
buildings prompted Leavitt to propose amending the state's law on
concealed weapon to prohibit sales to people with mental disorders
and those with violent criminal backgrounds, and to prohibit the
carrying of concealed weapons in schools. Among states that allow
concealed weapons, Utah is the only one where guns are permitted in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several statewide polls that showed Utah residents
overwhelmingly oppose the right to carry guns into schools,
Republican lawmakers fought Leavitt on each initiative before
agreeing to consider two of the three measures when the Legislature
meets in January; they have vowed to defeat any effort to bar
concealed weapons from schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that promise, a coalition of civic organizations
is collecting signatures to put the question to voters in the
November 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the measure has left the governor scratching his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Leavitt said. ``This is not about the
Second Amendment. It's about the use of guns and balancing the
rights of a few against the rights of a large community that just
wants to feel safe in its environment.''

 INVESTING WITH: WILLIAM L. WILBY of OPPENHEIMER GLOBAL  
(For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is

(jt) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An avid sailor, William L. Wilby has used maps and compass to
navigate a sloop, an Island Packet 40, around the inlets of
Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But in navigating the stock markets of the world, Wilby, manager
of the $5.21 billion Oppenheimer Global fund, does not care for
maps. ``We buy stocks,'' he said, ``not regions or countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wilby, 55, a former Federal Reserve economist, has
steered clear of the top-down economic analysis favored by many
global equity managers when allocating assets around the world.
``I'm a theme-based, out-of-favor growth investor,'' Wilby said
from his office in the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The approach has produced superior results. Oppenheimer Global
returned 20.7 percent, annualized, for the three years ended Aug.
31, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
That compares with 13.7 percent for its peer group of world stock
funds, and 19.1 percent for the Morgan Stanley World index,
Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of the fund is invested in Europe, 37 percent
in the United States, 10 percent in Asia and the remainder around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   To pick stocks, Wilby relies on a simple credo: ``We like to buy
good companies in good businesses at good prices at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Good businesses often fit into one of his four themes. The first
is mass affluence, meaning the rise of the middle class in
less-developed countries and the growing numbers of wealthy people
in industrialized countries. The second is new technology, which
runs the gamut from biotechnology to the Internet. The other themes
are the aging of the global population, which leads him to health
care and financial services, and corporate restructuring _ the
continuing trend of companies to focus on their core businesses by
divesting themselves of peripheral operations.
</P>
<P>
   Good businesses usually have strong top-line revenue growth.
Unlike many money managers, Wilby relies more heavily on a
company's price-to-revenue ratio than on its price-earnings ratio.
``Earnings are much more volatile than revenues, so the
price-revenues ratio is a better indicator of when a company is
cheap,'' he said. And he likes when a company's business has strong
barriers to entry, he said, ``so that the company can maintain its
profit margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby aims to buy a stock when few Wall Street analysts are
recommending it, though he likes to see salutary corporate
developments in the works. ``A stock can be cheap, but we want to
see a catalyst that will change the market's view of the stock and
help us realize its value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To pick the 85 to 90 stocks in the fund's portfolio, Wilby
consults a list of several hundred perennial favorite stocks that
he has developed during his 20 years in the business; he also
relies on the Oppenheimer global quantitative model, which covers
30,000 stocks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The model screens companies weekly for valuation, earnings
growth and relative stock strength, as well as earnings revisions
and a proprietary measure he calls ``dynamic price-earnings
ratios,'' whose methodology he will not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   He recently added to his position in Getronics N.V., a Dutch
information technology services company. Its recent acquisition of
the computer maker Wang Global, he said, ``makes Getronics one of
the top three players in the world.'' The catalyst for growth he
said, ``will be a boom in business re-engineering based on a need
to develop E-commerce platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock is both a new technology and a restructuring play:
``We think the company will divest some of its less profitable
businesses and become a pure investment technology consulting
company, which is a much higher-margin business,'' Wilby said. He
originally bought shares in June at an average cost of $37.37; they
closed on Friday at 47.70 euros, or $50.8816, which is 2.7 times
1998 revenues per share, about half that of similar companies. And
he predicts a three-year earnings growth rate of 40 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Cadence Design Systems, a San Jose, Calif.,
company that writes software used by semiconductor engineers to
create ``system-on-a-chip'' technology, designed to put the
functions of different computer chips on a single microprocessor.
Cadence, which Wilby calls the ``leading design automation company
in the world,'' is out of favor because it changed the way it books
revenue _ over time instead of up front _ which caused its sales
and earnings to drop far below analysts' expectations. But the new
accounting, he said, should produce more stable earnings in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors will drive a new upgrade cycle for design automation
tools, he said: the evolving system-on-a chip technology as well as
a move to smaller line widths in semiconductor chips. He bought
Cadence shares in March at $21; they closed on Friday at $13.8125,
or 2.6 times 1998 revenues per share, below that of most software
companies. He predicts a three-year earnings growth rate of 35
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby has also added to his holdings of Quintiles Transnational,
a Durham, N.C., contract research organization for health care
companies. New biotechnology drugs in the next decade, he said,
should accelerate demand for Quintiles' services.
</P>
<P>
   The shares fell from their December 1998 peak of $56.875 to a
low of $30.25, last month because of two recent controversial
acquisitions that expanded its business into health economics and
drug marketing consulting. Wilby approves of the buying spree.
``Their business is data, and they're trying to get a monopoly on
the data that affect the economics of drugs,'' he said, adding that
there would be ``fantastic synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   At $37.875, Quintiles' stock sells for 2.9 times 1998 revenues
per share, down from a multiple of 10 in 1996. He sees a three-year
earnings growth rate of 32 percent a year.

NEW EVIDENCE SPURS WACO TRAGEDY PROBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty-odd yards of Pennsylvania Avenue separate
FBI headquarters from the US Justice Department, but the gulf seems
much wider as the two agencies, goaded by the press and conspiracy
theorists, spar over what seemed an extraneous detail in a closed,
6-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   But because the case is the 1993 shootout in Waco, Texas, and
because of an ongoing tension between the two agencies, the mixture
of fiery tragedy, videotape and bureaucratic infighting provoked
calls for a new investigation. Now all three branches of government
will be reinvestigating the 51-day siege, during which more than 90
people died in a showdown between federal agents and the Branch
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday she will soon announce
an ``outside investigator'' to sift through the ashes and evidence
of Waco. Congressional leaders are planning one or more committee
probes. And a civil suit against the US government by relatives of
the Davidians has been given the go-ahead by a federal judge in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Senators John Danforth of Missouri and Warren
Rudman of New Hampshire, and former FBI Director William Webster _
who led the bureau during the Reagan administration _ were among
those under consideration for the job of independent investigator.
Though the independent counsel statute has expired, the attorney
general has authority to appoint outside counsels in matters where
there is a potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the FBI and the Justice Department had assured
Congress and the public that no incendiary devices were used in the
April 19, 1993, raid, during which the Branch Davidian compound
erupted in flames as the FBI used tanks to spray tear gas inside
its walls. Even the congressional oversight probe led by
Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who has clashed
repeatedly with Reno and the Clinton administration, concluded the
fire was set by the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and other flammable agents had been spread inside the
wooden compound. FBI listening devices taped the Davidians as they
discussed how to ignite a suicidal conflagration, and surviving
Davidians later testified they heard other group members shouting
orders to light fires. Most of the Davidians did not choose to flee
from the fire or were prevented by other members. More than a dozen
members were found with gunshot wounds consistent with suicide or
point-blank executions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the FBI's admission this week that two
military-style, combustible tear gas rounds were fired at a
concrete bunker a short distance from the main complex was seized
as possible proof of a coverup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waco is seen by people in hate groups, and in the larger
anti-government movements, as a repressive government attacking a
man in his church simply because he had the temerity to be a
dissident,'' said Mark Potok, an official with the Southern Poverty
Law Center, an Alabama-based organization that monitors right-wing
hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a government professor at the University of
Virginia, ``For a very large group that hates the government, Waco
has become their Boston Tea Party. This last week has re-energized
them, providing all the proof they need that their government lied
to them. It is a little bit scary as to where it all could lead.''
</P>
<P>
   To avenge the Branch Davidians, Timothy McVeigh blew up the
Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, on the anniversary of the
Waco raid.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the documents and videotapes released this week
challenge the findings of the previous investigations of what
happened at Waco. Indeed, segments of the newly released videotapes
support the FBI's contention that the flammable tear gas rounds
bounced off the concrete bunker without effect hours before the
wooden compound began to burn. On the videotape released by the FBI
Friday, one agent is heard to say, ``the military gas did not
penetrate that bunker ... it bounced off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts that we know now indicate that the FBI did not set
that fire,'' Reno said Friday. ``That fire was set by David Koresh
and the people in that building. It was a terrible tragedy that
came on the heels of federal agents being killed, just murdered.
We've got to put it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI's admission _ prompted when Waco conspiracy
theorists uncovered evidence of the combustible tear gas rounds in
Texas _ opened the door for critics to ask what else the bureau was
hiding. And Reno's aides want to know why the Justice Department
had not been informed when news of the flammable gas cannisters
began to circulate in the FBI hierarchy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In unusual slaps at the FBI, a White House spokesman said
Thursday that ``the president is deeply concerned that the attorney
general appears to have been misled and may have been lied to.''
Separately, the Justice Department dispatched a US marshall to FBI
headquarters to take possession of the bureau's newly discovered
videotape of the early-morning hours of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, meanwhile, a federal judge ordered the Justice
Department to turn over all evidence from the raid on the Branch
Davidians, saying it is needed in the wrongful death suit filed
there. Judge Walter Smith threatened to cite the department with
contempt if it does not comply with his Thursday order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a suitable topic for investigation,'' said
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who serves on
the House Judiciary Committee. ``If you don't do it now, it
blossoms into Roswell,'' said Frank, referring to the New Mexico
site that has spawned 40 years of allegations that the government
is covering up proof aliens have visited the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But an outside investigation might not satisfy everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think no matter how independent the investigation is, if it
disagrees with the allegations of a cover-up, it will be seen to be
merely another cog in the massive conspiracy machine,'' said Potok.
``I don't know if this is some lower-level officials engaged in a
coverup to protect themselves, or an inadvertent mix-up, but it is
a disaster that the government didn't make these facts known.''

CAPITAL'S MAKEOVER IRKS TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital is getting a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Even buildings where the nation's most powerful people stride
about need a little retooling now and then, and lately, scaffolding
has been clinging to monuments like ivy.
</P>
<P>
   The metal structures have sprouted alongside the Capitol dome,
and a more elaborate one shrouds the Washington Monument. At other
monuments and memorials, construction workers are replacing light
bulbs, tightening screws, and filling in cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cross between plastic surgery and dermatology,'' said
James Ellison, the special assistant to the Capitol architect.
``You're peeling away the dead, ugly layers and tinkering with
what's underneath. It's not supposed to look different, just
better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time so many projects have coincided,
according to the National Park Service. And for some monuments, the
tinkering is more complex than a nip and tuck.
</P>
<P>
   On the Capitol dome, years of rain, snow, and sun have taken
their toll, causing cracks along the dome's inner and outer shells.
Layers of paint have peeled off, and water has seeped through
crevices, staining parts of the decorative Rotunda surface. Recent
inspections have also turned up lead paint on the dome.
</P>
<P>
   The workers have been hanging from suspended cables inside the
dome to clean its surface and patch up cracks, in a project begun
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dead of summer when the temperature creeped past
100, workers donned non-breathable rubber suits to remove lead
paint between the inner and outer shells of the dome. Once the lead
paint is removed, the dome will get a fresh coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no dome quite like the dome of the US Capitol,'' said
Ellison, who is overseeing the project. ``Sure, there are other
domes, but this one is special. When you have a dome like this, you
know fixing it up is going to be major.''
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million project is one of the most extensive since about
1960, when the dome was last cleaned and repainted. Ellison said
the current project should wrap up by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent renovation is at the Washington Monument,
with its intricate aluminum-and-nylon casing jutting above the
capital landscape at the other end of the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The blue diaphanous mesh imitates the block pattern on the
monument and cloaks about 37 miles of aluminum tubing surrounding
the structure. Designed by renowned architect Michael Graves, the
scaffolding has become so popular that some people are pushing to
keep it around the monument even after the renovations are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary repairs, started in January 1998, replaced
electrical, heating, and air-conditioning systems, and reburbished
the 40-year-old elevator. Work on the monument's exterior has been
proceeding since early this year. Chips and cracks along the
interior and exterior will be patched. The $9.4 million project
should be completed by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fix one thing and then you have to fix another _ a
never-ending cycle,'' said Stephen Lorenzetti, the chief of
resource management for National Capital Parks, a division of the
National Park Service. ``Otherwise, you won't have whole monuments
anymore. They'll crumble to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzetti said minor repairs are ongoing, but renovation
projects occur every 30 to 50 years. At the Jefferson Memorial, the
base of the steps are being replaced, and at the Korean War
Veterans Memorial, the lighting is being upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   The dust and noise that surround the beautification projects
have ruffled some tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take a picture without some metal rod sticking out
from behind,'' said Rod Gurtney of St. Louis, while visiting the
Lincoln Memorial. ``It makes our vacation pictures look ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln Memorial, where scaffolding slightly obstructs
the marble statue of the president, the marble ceiling panels are
being rewaxed so that when the sun shines around the pillars into
the memorial, more light can reflect off the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Jade Williams of Portsmouth, N.H., complained that metal bars
were all she could see when she looked out from the top of the
Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a breathtaking view, and all that mess got in
the way,'' Williams said. ``That's no way to go sightseeing.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Every year, right around now, this city finds its
capillaries badly clogged by the bright, orange-striped bulks of
what residents believe must be the greatest convergence of U-Hauls
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least one rental truck, driven by a heedless student,
inevitably smashes its top into one of the low-clearance
underpasses that booby trap roads along the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first one hits, we say, `They're back!''' said Gary
Larivee, president of U-Haul Co. of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And the long-suffering neighbors of the city's nearly 90,000
students _ who give Boston its youthful intellectual flavor and
make up almost one-sixth of its population _ are reminded yet again
of why it is not only a blessing but also sometimes a curse to live
in the college capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Webster, a neighborhood advocate in the South Brighton
section of Boston, a pocket of particularly heavy student presence,
said that sometimes ``it feels like it's some kind of sci-fi movie
where everyone over the age of 25 is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Labor Day weekend is over, only the foolhardy venture into
student-filled neighborhoods like Allston-Brighton, Kenmore Square
and the Fenway, and the nearby cities of Cambridge and Somerville,
or those who do not mind sitting patiently as sweating young people
empty the back maws of Ryder and Penske and Budget trucks. The
drivers must also be ready to skirt the curb-side mounds of
crumbling sofas, dead plants, beer-stained carpets and folded
cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a swarm of bees coming in,'' said James
Cahill, director of the code-enforcement police, who watch for
trash violations. ``And they do their thing and all of a sudden
it's over. It's just an amazing influx in such a short span of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The city tries hard to maintain control. It shifts virtually all
of its garbage code-enforcers to student neighborhoods around now,
and has been issuing $300 tickets right and left, perhaps 100 a
day, to landlords who let their trash get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas Menino warned landlords this week about trash
disposal, declaring: ``Every year, we welcome back the students to
the city of Boston. But I don't want their return to be a nightmare
for the people who live in the neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, some in the neighborhoods say. The Allston-Brighton
area, where an estimated 15,000 students live in four square miles,
gets to looking like ``a hurricane scene, with none of the houses
destroyed but with debris everywhere,'' said Paul Berkeley,
president of the Allston Civic Association.
</P>
<P>
   True, it will mostly pass in a week or so. But this time of the
year, despite all the rosy appeal of the fresh, excited faces
flooding town, also serves to highlight the problems that such a
giant student population poses for a city, problems serious enough
to merit a University-Community Relations Committee on the Boston
City Council.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee held a public meeting several months ago,
said Brian Honan, its chairman, about 300 people came, compared
with the usual 5 or 10 on other issues. The total student
population in Boston is estimated at 135,000, but some students do
not live in the city itself; in the greater Boston area, students
number approximately 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boston proper has 32 colleges and universities, which generate
an estimated $3.1 billion a year in spending. There are 33 more
colleges in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are really a double-edged sword in our
neighborhood,'' Honan said of Allston-Brighton. ``They shop and use
the goods and services, so they provide an economic backbone with
the tremendous buying power they have. But oftentimes their
schedules do not necessarily jibe with those of people who have to
get up at 6:30 in the morning to get to an office downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension goes beyond schedules. The real estate market in
Boston is blazing, and students' willingness to live like sardines
and pool their rent money helps drive prices up. Their very
numbers, too, increase demand and raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of their transience: they have a
reputation for being indifferent toward neighborhood esthetics and
good relations, at least, compared with long-term residents, and
their density can create garbage and parking problems. Transience
also means less interest in pressuring City Hall for physical
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the symptoms of extreme gentrification with
nothing to show for it,'' said Ms. Webster, head of the Aberdeen
and Reservoir Civic Association. ``We are gentrified in terms of
price, minus the usual quality of life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As local institutions like Boston University and Boston College
have grown over recent years, the city has been pressing them to
build more housing for their undergraduate students. The results
have been mixed. Boston University is completing a dormitory for
more than 800 students; Harvard has just promised 288 new
apartments for its graduate students, and other building plans are
in the works. But universities tend to get more excited about
adding new academic buildings than dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   When they are asked to build housing, Honan said, ``the typical
response is that we're landlocked or don't have any more place to
build buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we turn around,'' he said, ``and they're building
science buildings, academic buildings, new pools and gyms and
stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials do say that the colleges' efforts to rein in bad
student behavior off-campus have noticeably improved in recent
years. Many issue instructions about everything from trash to
late-night noise. The police, too, have learned the trick of
arresting a few disorderly students at the start of the school
year, and getting the message across, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But several residents commented on the overflowing high spirits
that some students, often living free from supervision for the
first time, just have to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get their furniture set up, the first thing they say
is, `Let's have a party,''' Berkeley said. ``All of a sudden, 10
guys move in next door and music is blaring and they're all
excited. If you're the person next door, it can wear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, from the students' point of view, moving day is no
picnic, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a U-Haul in this town was like the worst experience
I've ever had,'' said Chris Lucca, a senior at Wentworth Institute
of Technology. ``You call to get one, and they tell you they're
booked up two months in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students reported that truck rental clerks simply laughed
when they called this week.
</P>
<P>
   Moving can get a bit, er, boisterous, too.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Cahill of the code-enforcement police said, ``you'll
find things hanging in trees _ newspaper or clothing _ when they're
cleaning out an apartment, but that's few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the apartment he was vacating the other day, Chip
Baskerville, a Boston College student, said: ``It's destroyed.
There's like four different kinds of cereal on the floor.''

CHINA DETAINEE CAN'T SHAKE BAD MEMORIES, WIFE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Even in an American hospital, thousands of miles from
the place where he suffered severe injuries while in the custody of
Chinese officials, Daja Meston can't find rest, haunted by
recurring nightmares of his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meston, 29, was inspecting a proposed World Bank project in
northwestern China earlier this month when he was detained by the
Chinese government, which accused him of engaging in an ``illegal
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston scholar and activist sufferred two fractured
veterbrae and crushed heels he jumped or fell from a third-floor
hotel room where he was being questioned by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Boston on a medical-evacuation flight on Tuesday
and was immediately taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital where his
wife, Phuntsok, held a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot describe my feelings of joy and happiness at having
my husband back here after his ordeal in Tibet,'' Phuntsok, 30, a
Tibetan exile, said in her first public comments since her
husband's return. ``What they did to him was inhumane and appalls
me. And what they are doing to other people there who raise
questions, I can hardly imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Phuntsok said her husband, who is more commonly known by his
Tibetan name, Wangchuk, has not told her much about his detainment
or the several days during which officials grilled him in the hotel
room, but said he has had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine what he went through and what he saw,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Meston told a friend that he was ``in hell
for two weeks,'' but ``this is heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple are focusing their ``energy and strength'' on
Meston's recuperation and on the effort to locate Tsering Dorjee, a
translator who was travelling with Meston and another researcher,
Australian Gabriel Lafitte, when the three were detained, Phuntsok
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, Wangchuk's greatest worry is what happened to
Tsering Dorjee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 supporters who gathered outside the hospital Friday
carried signs demanding Dorjee's release. They fear the man may be
treated worse and possibly tortured because he is an ethnic
Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   Meston stressed that her husband, a Jewish-American who was
raised in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal, went to Tibet to
pursue a longstanding interest in Tibetan development.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been daring in his efforts to rally public
sentiment against Chinese efforts to destroy Tibetan culture,
Meston has said he entered China on a tourist visa simply to
interview residents in the Qinghai province about the controversial
World Bank project.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan to resettle 58,000 poor farmers into an area
now dominated by Tibetan and Mongolian herdsmen that is part of
historic Tibet. The plan depends, in part, on World Bank funding.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the project will dilute the Tibetan population in
the area. In June, the World Bank voted to delay its funding
pending a bank inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A highly sought-after translator, Meston assisted US
Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, in making
an unauthorized trip to Tibet two years ago, after which Wolf
sharply condemned Chinese repression of the Tibetans, to the fury
of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Meston was allowed to leave China after signing a confession
outlining his activities in China. ``He agrees with the events,''
family friend Carl Williams said, ``but not . . . that it's a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Gates said Meston was in stable condition and
``recovering well'' Friday. Although he will probably need
permanent pins and screws to repair his bones, he will be able to
walk, Gates added.

CLINTONS' HOME PURCHASE INVOLVES UNUSUAL FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with CLINTON-MCAULIFFE) 
(bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The package that the cash-strapped first family
will use to buy a $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is a
clever and unusual piece of financial engineering designed to avoid
various tax and other pitfalls, real estate and financial
specialists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Terry McAuliffe, the president's chief
political fund-raiser, to personally supply $1.35 million in
collateral that the lender, Bankers Trust Private Banking, could
seize should the Clintons fail to make payments on a house costing
more than three times what a presidential salary could support.
</P>
<P>
   Some private analysts said they were struck by what a good deal
it appeared to be for the Clintons _ even though the bank itself,
with whom three Clinton administration aides or friends have had
ties, seemed to have not been particularly generous.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bankers Trust, which was acquired in June by
Deutsche Bank, would not want to have to explain to examiners an
ostensively uneconomic loan to a couple with negative net worth
because of $5.5 million in legal debts, a sum that far exceeds
their assets of about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be content to use only the house itself for
collateral because of the public black eye it would certainly
suffer in the unlikely, but imaginable, event it should ever have
to foreclose.
</P>
<P>
   And while some people initially raised their eyebrows at the
seemingly low interest rate, which was calculated at 6.52 percent,
they agreed that while this would have been a concession for a
conventional 30-year mortgage, it was about the going rate for the
first phase of a five-year loan adjustable every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In providing additional details Friday, the White House said
McAuliffe's $1.35 million in collateral would consist of cash,
rather than what some had presumed would be Treasury securities,
and that he rather than the Clintons would receive the interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are to supply $350,000 for the down payment, drawn
from their blind trust, an amount just above the 20 percent of
purchase-price minimum that excuses the couple from paying many
hundreds of dollars a month in mortgage insurance to protect the
lender. The Clintons will be making their own monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also called the mortgage an existing bank
product, not something invented for them. Many major banks have
special units, like Bankers Trust Private Banking, that cater to
the carriage trade and often accommodate special situations like
that of the Clintons, who have considerable income potential after
they leave the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Friday, a spokesman said, whether the Clintons
will make a copy of the contract publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Although political opponents and others may contend that
something of economic value, the use of McAuliffe's cash
collateral, is being conferred on the Clintons, tax specialists
said they doubted this would result in taxable income unless it
were to be taken to pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent nature of the money's deployment, the White House
said, also exempts it from government disclosure rules, the White
House said, declaring that the Office of Government Ethics agreed
with its position.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be immediately learned whether any of the
president's former aides or Vernon Jordan, a close friend, played
any role in the setting up the transaction. Jordan is a former
Bankers Trust director.
</P>
<P>
   The current vice chairman, Eugene Ludwig, served as Comptroller
of the Currency. And Frank Newman, who was deputy Treasury
secretary, became chief executive of Bankers Trust after leaving
Washington. Newman oversaw the sale of the bank to Deutsche Bank
and retired this year with a $100 million severance package.
</P>
<P>
   At least one group came forward on a pre-holiday Friday to
denounce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the president of the United States and someone is doing a
million-dollar favor to him to help him with his personal financial
needs,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a policy
body seeking campaign-finance and other political reforms. ``That
creates an appearance problem, a potential conflict problem, and
it's a dangerous kind of act.''

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS TO SIGN PEACE AGREEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators struck a deal
late Friday for a long-delayed West Bank troop withdrawal, setting
the two sides on a new course toward a peace agreement after months
of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which will be signed Saturday night at a ceremony
in Egypt's Sinai desert, calls for Israel to pull back from another
11 percent of the West Bank in three stages and for both sides to
negotiate a final peace agreement in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli pullbacks would give Yasser Arafat's autonomous
Palestinian Authority 42 percent of the West Bank, which Israel
seized in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
met with Arafat in the Gaza Strip in a dramatic, last-ditch round
of shuttle diplomacy aimed at breaking a negotiating impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is playing the role deemed useful by both parties,''
Albright said. ``The parties themselves have written the agreement.
I was, maybe, just the handmaiden.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with President Clinton by telephone to share the
news, Arafat said, ``We have worked hand-in-hand in order to
achieve the peace of the brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said from the United States that peace in the Mideast
``is now a step closer'' because of the deal. ``This is truly a new
beginning,'' Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, which officials said would
implement the Wye River accord negotiated nearly a year ago in the
United States, Israel and the Palestinians would begin talks on a
permanent peace agreement with the goal of an overall settlement by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Palestinians would beef up efforts to
confiscate illegal weapons, arrest militants wanted by Israel, and
submit to the Israelis a list of names of its police officers. The
issue of the Palestinian police has been a point of contention
because Israel alleges that the number of Palestinian police
exceeds the amount agreed upon in earlier accords.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the Israeli withdrawal would come in three
stages. The first would occur Sept. 13, the day the accord would be
implemented, then Nov. 15 and Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the deal also would
provide for routes for Palestinians to travel across Israel between
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for construction of a seaport in
Gaza, which the Palestinians consider necessary for developing
their economy. Both provisions would begin Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they had agreed to release 350 of their
nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, holding firm in their resolve
not to free any convicts with ``blood on their hands,'' a reference
to Palestinians convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's negotiators had asked for freedom for 400 prisoners and
had called for members of Fatah, Arafat's party, to be released,
even if they had been convicted of killing Israelis during a
seven-year Palestinian uprising that pre-dated the Oslo peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also had objected to Israel's plan to release
common criminals along with political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the prisoner issue had delayed the signing
ceremony, originally set for Thursday. It was apparently resolved
only after Arafat replaced Eraket, with Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, after seeing Albright in
Jerusalem, urged Syria and Lebanon to join a widening circle of
peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of good will and we must seize it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a veiled ultimatum
Thursday after meeting with Albright, saying the Palestinians had
until Friday to agree with the deal or Israel would implement the
original Wye River accord. That would have meant a smaller Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, an Israeli Cabinet minister, said the impasse over
the prisoners was overcome once Palestinians understood that ``the
number we proposed is a final number, and we are not going to add
even one single prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal came, however, after Albright stayed up half the night
shuttling between the two sides, first meeting with Arafat on
Thursday afternoon in Alexandria and then flying to Jerusalem for
an after-midnight three-hour chat with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle diplomacy appeared to contradict earlier pledges by
U.S. officials to refrain from getting too involved in the
microscopic details of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said Friday's deal ushered in a ``new era'' in
peacemaking, which for months had been mired in mistrust. Now, he
said, negotiations would be frank and open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything (will be) put on the table,'' he told a television
network.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an Israeli government headed by former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu carried out the first troop withdrawal, then
froze implementation of the next steps required by the agreement,
citing Palestinian noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barak's election in May, Palestinians have counted on his
center-left government to revive the Wye River agreement.

CANDIDATES THUMP EDUCATION ISSUE, BUT DO VOTERS CARE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One is the son of an elementary school teacher, and
a second was a high-ranking Education Department official. A third
says her most memorable year was teaching at Melrose (Mass.) High
School, a fourth is the heir to the ``education president,'' and a
fifth says his life goal is connecting every classroom to the
Internet (which he didn't invent).
</P>
<P>
   Any serious student of the 2000 presidential campaign should
score 100 percent on this back-to-school, name-the-candidate quiz.
In order of one through five _ Bill Bradley, Gary Bauer, Elizabeth
Dole, George W. Bush, and Al Gore _ have made their credentials and
commitment to education key in their races to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret why: Most national polls show education as the
No. 1 concern in America. In a Harris poll taken last month,
respondents put education ahead of taxes, crime, health care, and
Social Security as the most important issue for public officials to
address.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents don't have a particularly large role in setting
education policy; 93 percent of school money and most
decision-making comes from state and local governments. But the
anxieties of families about both the quality and safety of the
learning environment in the nation's public schools at the start of
a new century is making education just too ripe for the
presidential candidates to resist.
</P>
<P>
   In their zeal, they are blurring the ideological lines between
the GOP, which historically has stood for shrinking the
already-small federal role in education, and the Democratic Party,
which in the past has stood in solidarity with national teachers'
unions against and cutting the strings tied to federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the Republican candidates is calling for abolishing
the Department of Education, though that was a plank in the party's
1996 platform and for many years a popular GOP rallying cry.
Neither Bush nor Dole will talk directly about providing tuition
vouchers for children to attend private and parochial schools,
another important conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, reaching beyond the loyal union
constituency, says he supports teacher testing and giving autonomy
to experimental charter schools. Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator who is challenging Gore for the Democratic nomination, also
says teachers must be held accountable for student performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles on Thursday, Bush went beyond his GOP rivals with
details, offering the first of what he promises will be three
substantive speeches on education. The Texas governor pledged to
upgrade pre-school Head Start into a national literacy program, and
he proposed taking away federal money from disadvantaged public
schools that perform poorly over three years and giving it to
parents to spend on education alternatives, such as private schools
and tutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, federal money will no longer flow to
failure,'' said Bush,  not call his plan a voucher program.
Bush has not made a strong push for vouchers in Texas, either,
though he has been an activist on education, implementing statewide
skills-assessment tests and taking credit for a notable rise in
student test scores, particularly among black children.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the Bush speech, Gore on Wednesday traveled to a
poor Hispanic neighborhood in San Antonio, toured a dilapidated
elementary school, and decried the condition of school buildings in
Texas as ``particularly bad.'' Gore too has put forward an
ambitious education agenda, from expanding opportunities for
pre-school and college to mandating national testing, ending social
promotion, guaranteeing techonology literacy, building classrooms,
and hiring more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blizzard of education proposals, it's too early to
tell if they will penetrate the public mind and influence voting
behavior in next year's primaries and general election. A new study
by Ralph Whitehead, professor of public service at the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst, suggests they might not.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead compared presidential voting patterns in 1996 and
1972, when enrollment in grade school was peaking and the nation
had a laser focus on education. He found that while there were more
parents of schoolchildren in 1996 than in the early 1970s, they
made up a smaller percentage of those voting for president. In
1972, parents accounted for 33 percent of all voters; in 1996, it
had fallen to 24.6 percent. Turnout among the elderly, by contrast,
grew 6 percentage points in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps today's parents are too busy to vote, or too socially
and economically diverse to be organized into a voting bloc, or too
cynical to believe that public policy makers touting national
achievement tests or school uniforms can wave a magic wand and
bring discipline, character-building, and scholarship into the
classroom, Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that `education' has a symbolic resonance that goes
far beyond how the nation treats its schoolchildren,'' Whitehead
said. ``What is clear is that parents _ the core constituency for
school-age children _ are not rushing to the polls to try to
improve conditions for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the opinion polls aren't reflecting something
new and important, said Deborah Wadsworth, executive director of
Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization in New York. The
American public, she said, has reached a ``significant consensus''
on the need in education for higher achievement, holding children
and teachers accountable for learning, ending social promotion, and
maintaining a zero-tolerance attitude for violent student behavior
that disrupts the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schwartz, president of Achieve Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.
organization funded by corporations to help dozens of states
implement academic standards, says parents have made the connection
between education and prosperity in the new economy. ``While the
economy is booming along now, there is an underlying anxiety about
how long it will last and whether we have equipped our kids to
survive a downturn,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Celinda Lake said as a political issue, education is
gaining momentum with the approach of the millennium. ``People are
wondering, `How do we raise our kids better, how do we solve our
problems, how do we compete in a global economy?' '' Lake said.
``Education is always the place that can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup poll found 71 percent of Americans want public
schools improved. But the same survey, conducted for Phi Delta
Kappa, an advocacy organization for public education, shows if the
government paid tuition, 39 percent of public-school parents would
chose a private or parochial school instead. ``Parents want to see
results,'' said Nina Rees, an education-policy analyst at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ``They don't care
if it is private, religious, or public, as long as it is
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   While voters historically have viewed Democrats as stronger on
the issue, Lake said, Bush has the experience of a governor and the
image of a moderate to make education a competitive battleground.
``A surprising number of voters remember that his mother (former
First Lady Barbara Bush) was strong on education, and they think he
comes from an educated family,'' said Lake, who is advising Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Webster, a mother with three children in Boston public
schools, says parents are deeply committed to improving public
schools and are becoming very sophisticated about standards, test
performance, accountabiility, and professional development for
teachers. It's not adequate, she said, for political candidates to
expect these families to be satisfied with platitudes and posturing
on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate for president needs to sit in a classroom and
see for himself what kind of learning is going on,'' said Webster,
who is parent coordinator for the Boston Plan for Excellence in 61
city schools. ``Then they should sit down with parents and say,
`What are your standards, and are they high enough?' ''

 &HT;    Film producer says flash-bangs may have started fire at Mount
Carmel
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A film producer claims an evidence log put
together by the Texas Department of Public Safety shows that
flash-bangs were found near three spots where the fires that
destroyed Mount Carmel are thought to have originated.
</P>
<P>
   Flash-bangs are concussion devices meant to startle and contain
a small amount of pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McNulty _ apparently the only outsider to view the evidence
stored for the upcoming civil lawsuit filed by surviving Davidians
against the government _ thinks the public is paying too much
attention to the furor over military tear gas, which is an
incendiary device, being used on bunkers located away from the
rambling wooden structure that housed David Koresh and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, those two projectiles didn't start the
fire,'' said McNulty, one of the producers of ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement.'' ``Other devices may have. We should be talking about
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, McNulty was given access to the Davidian
evidence held in Austin by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston of
Waco. McNulty said the flash-bangs were mislabeled as silencers or
suppressors. Anyone looking at an inventory of the evidence
wouldn't know any flash-bangs had been found inside Mount Carmel,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found six of these in the evidence chain,'' McNulty said.
``Two of those were found outside the building. Four were found
inside the building _ three at the points of origin of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   His declaration is based on an evidence log put together by DPS
detailing where each piece of evidence was found, McNulty said.
Also, arson investigators chosen by the FBI determined that the
fire that killed Koresh and 75 followers started simultaneously in
three places.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officials declined to comment on McNulty's assertion since
the evidence is now technically in the custody of U.S. District
Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ordered the U.S. Marshals Service to take custody of the
evidence, although it has yet to be transferred.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Tron Brekke said no flash-bangs were used on the
day of the Davidian fire, April 19, 1993. The Justice Department
report on ``the events at Waco'' notes that flash-bangs were used
periodically during the siege. Agents tossed flash-bangs toward
Davidians who stepped outside Mount Camel on several occasions,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Brekke said he wouldn't be surprised to learn that flash-bangs
were found inside Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-something days before there had been an assault by the
ATF, if you'll remember,'' Brekke said. ``There are all kinds of
possibilities ... I'm not surprised that they were found somewhere
inside. No.''
</P>
<P>
   Brekke said the FBI still believes the Davidians started the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Government bugs inside Mount Carmel picked up voices yelling,
``Start the fire,'' and ``The fire is lit,'' among other things.
Surviving Davidians, though, claimed tanks rumbling into their
residence knocked over lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   How flammable are flash-bangs?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Cooper, a University of Texas-Dallas professor and law
enforcement consultant, said flash-bangs have the potential to
start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called stun grenades,'' Cooper said. ``They're
designed to produce a shock wave, which is supposed to have an
inhibiting effect against those it's used on. They're used to
attack hijackers aboard aircrafts, for example. Anything of an
explosive nature, if it comes in contact with materials with a
propensity to go up in flames, can act as a kind of detonating
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Phil Hansen, who is with the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department's SWAT team, however, balks at calling flash-bangs an
explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ignition device in them,'' Hansen said. ``One of
the by-products is heat. It's high heat but for an extremely short
duration. We're talking milliseconds. Because of that, there's a
low probability of fire. Like anything else, though, it depends on
your surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Smith of the Lexena, Kan. Police Department said
flash-bangs have been known in certain circumstances to start
fires.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, like Hansen, is on the Board of Directors of the National
Tactical Officers Association,
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an incident that happened in Kentucky a couple of
years ago,'' Smith said. ``There was a barricaded suspect. He had
poured flammable liquid on the carpet. When law enforcement used
diversionary devices, it started a fire. You don't have any control
of what's on the floor. But, generally speaking, they don't cause
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith thinks tear gas is more likely to start a fire than a
flash-bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to put money on it, I'd bet on burning gas
before I would a distraction device,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials confirmed earlier this week that
two military tear gas canisters were fired just after 6 a.m. on
April 19, 1993. Their target was a bunker near the compound.
Officials claimed the canisters hit the bunker's roof, bounced off
and landed in a field. They maintain none were fired at the
Davidian's living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Military tear gas canisters were used because the
non-pyrotechnic tear gas canisters failed to penetrate the bunker,
according to Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he doesn't consider flash-bangs much of a fire
threat because they don't smolder.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a fire is not as great a consideration as much as
placing them too close to a person,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Flash-bangs have the capability of killing someone if discharged
close enough, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fire these things off in an area where there are women and
children would be irresponsible,'' Cooper said. ``If one didn't
detonate and was picked up later by a child, it could cause death
or very serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who was Koresh's attorney, said
he handed authorities a spent flash-bang given him by the Davidians
after he visited Mount Carmel during the siege. Davidians also
showed him a live flash-bang, which they kept, DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't about to take that one out,'' DeGuerin said. ``I was
afraid I'd be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin, like McNulty, thinks the presence of the flash-bangs
inside Mount Carmel should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they were throwing them throughout the standoff,''
DeGuerin said. ``The FBI claimed it didn't throw any the last day.
But I find it funny, given they were logged in at three spots where
the fire supposedly started, that they had the wrong labels. I do
think it's possible they were left behind by the ATF. But you
should be able to check the inventory of what ATF went in there
with and what they came back with. It bears looking into, I
think.''

CHAMPION US TEAM BACK IN THE FRAY, AGAINST IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When the invitation arrived in Dublin, the
recipients thought it must be a joke. Play the best women's soccer
team in the world in the States in a big stadium on a holiday
weekend? ``I was pretty astounded,'' captain Rosie Power admits.
``We're only Ireland.'' And the Americans are world champions,
150-21-9 over the past decade and beaten once on home soil since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was my first reaction? Frightening,'' says Irish coach
Mick Cooke, whose astounded _ but delighted _ squad will get a
taste of the global fast lane when it meets the US for the first
time Saturday at Foxboro Stadium before the Revolution-Tampa Bay
MLS match.
</P>
<P>
   For the hosts, who haven't been together in uniform since they
beat the Chinese on penalty kicks in the World Cup final eight
weeks ago in the Rose Bowl, it's something of a class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been away from each other for so long,'' says forward
Tiffeny Milbrett, whose teammates were inseparable for seven
months. ``You feel the energy now that we're back together. An
almost childlike excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for keeper Briana Scurry (previous obligation),
midfielder Michelle Akers (recuperation) and defender Lorrie Fair
(back in school at North Carolina), the entire Cup squad is back
for duty as the Yanks, who've already played two dozen matches this
year, lace up for another grinder of a season.
</P>
<P>
   There's the US Cup next month, an indoor tour, an Olympic tuneup
in Australia during the winter, the Algarve Cup in Portugal,
probably a July tournament in Germany and the Summer Games in
September. ``This is not a nothing game,'' says US coach Tony
DiCicco. ``This is the start of our Olympic preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Irish, who will watch the Games on television, this is
an unexpected chance to test their game against the gold standard.
``It lets us see where we are,'' says forward Claire Scanlon, who
has played professionally in Japan and now coaches at Troy State in
Alabama. ``The world champions are up here. Where are we?''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are in Europe's second tier, looking for the
breakthrough. If they can win at the upcoming continental
championships, they could make it into the qualifying competition
for the 2003 World Cup _ and onto soccer's global map.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they have any illusions about knocking off the
Americans Saturday. The differences in experience, skills,
athleticism, and in depth are simply too great. ``They play the
fastest of any team,'' says midfielder Holly Pierce, who played for
the US under-20 squad. ``They'll run you up and down the field. If
we were to beat them, we'd be celebrating for the rest of our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have already had their celebration of a lifetime.
They went home to stash their gold medals, see their families,
answer their mail, decompress and recharge their physical and
emotional batteries. Saturday they press the reset button. ``We
have to be ready to play an international opponent,'' says DiCicco.
``Just because the Irish haven't broken through yet doesn't mean
they're a bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   They're astounded, perhaps, to be invited. ``Very surprised,''
says Cooke. ``Of all the teams around, why choose us?'' But
flattered, definitely. ``It's an amazing opportunity,'' says
Pierce. ``We get to play the best team in the world in Boston.
We're lucky.''

   KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Notre Dame 1-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 at Michigan 0-0
</P>
<P>
   A start-of-the-season clash of ranked teams. Michigan, with Tom
Brady returning at quarterback, is favored. Notre Dame rushed for
363 yards against Kansas last Saturday, but Coach Bob Davie of the
Irish said after the game: ``Our football team realizes it doesn't
matter where we are now. It matters where we are next week.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Arizona 0-1
</P>
<P>
   at Texas Christian 0-0
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona, a preseason top-five team, took a 41-7 beating

disgusted, violated.'' This Sunday night game gives Arizona a
chance for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford 0-0
</P>
<P>
   at Texas 0-1
</P>
<P>
   Texas, ranked 17th in preseason, has something to prove, too. It
had three punts blocked, costing 16 points, in a 23-20 upset loss
to North Carolina State. Stanford should not be a pushover.

   No. 5 Nebraska (0-0)

FANS' HEARTS BELONG TO BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We now know that a revered ex-captain of the Boston Celtics
played at least part of his career with a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   That captain declined through the end of his playing days to
inform the team that he was experiencing heart palpitations. Later
diagnosed as an arrythmia, the condition is one often triggered by
substance abuse, the substance being alcohol. Years later, he has
chosen to reveal it in a memoir due in stores this month.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird's revelation this week raises an obvious parallel to
allegations regularly made against Reggie Lewis that he and his
wife misled the Celtics and their insurance companies after
rejecting the team's medical advice in favor of that of their own
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also obvious differences: For one, the fraternity
of loudmouths, the talk-radio shut-ins who know everything about
everything, have been nowhere to be found this week. To them, this
is a nonissue, no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another difference: Bird is white, Lewis is black.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to trash Bird for coming clean about his condition.
His problem, atrial fibrillation, is less severe than ventricular
fibrillation, the disease that killed Lewis, and is apparently
being controlled with medication. That is all good news.
</P>
<P>
   Bird has not directly discussed his illness. But the Celtics'
team physician, Dr. Arnold Scheller, said earlier this week he
urged Bird to cut his alcohol consumption and to monitor his diet
and exercise after the condition was diagnosed, several years after
Bird retired.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's episodes, as he refers to them, occurred during his
offseason summer workouts. His book, ``Bird Watching: On Playing
and Coaching The Game I Love,'' says the condition worsened after
he began coaching two years ago. He nearly fainted in 1998 during a
game against the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Lewis died, we have been treated to repeated
speculation that he was responsible for his own demise. The only
plausible cause for his death, this theory goes, was cocaine abuse,
and he ripped off the Celtics and their insurance companies by
hiding his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Bird certainly was insured while he wore the green and
white. So wasn't he obliged to reveal his ``episodes'' when they
were occurring? And if his lifestyle contributed in some way to his
weakened heart, shouldn't that offend the moralists? Celtics
spokesman Jeff Twiss was not available for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after playing his last game for the Celtics, Bird
remains a basketball icon and understandably so. When he visits
with his new team, the Indiana Pacers, he is treated to what must
be the longest standing ovations any NBA coach has ever received.
And the more people see of Antoine Walker, the more they cherish
their memories of Bird. All of which is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lewis saga grows ever sadder. The ill-considered
malpractice suit filed by his widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, has
resulted in a hung jury and as many unanswered questions as there
were at the start. Efforts to settle the case seem to be going
nowhere, despite the prodding of the judge who apparently dreads
the prospect of another trial as much as the rest of us do.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has been cautious about raising race as an issue in
her battle against Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge and (by extension) the
Celtics. Some of those close to her do raise it, though. If Larry
Bird or Kevin McHale had suffered from a heart condition, they say,
the public would have been much slower to turn the illness into
ammunition to assault their character.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they were proved right.
</P>
<P>
   As I've written before, I don't claim to have a clue whether
Lewis used drugs. Or, for that matter, whether alcohol played any
role in Bird's condition. Nor do I care very much; one is alive,
one is dead. Both should be alive. That's the tragedy. Unless
someone can prove that cocaine use caused Lewis's death, the issue
is a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's own doctor apparently concluded that drinking should be
limited as part of his treatment. But Bird is Bird, and Lewis is
Lewis. And it seems to be a lot easier to throw stones at black
athletes than at white.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad Bird is feeling better. I wish Reggie Lewis's problems
had proved so easily controlled. And I have one additional wish: I
wish Lewis had known the understanding and sympathy that will come
pouring in for his old friend, teammate, and captain.

 &HT;    Gingrich admirers downplay scandal
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ Phyllis Sears' affinity for Newt
Gingrich goes back more than a decade, but she came to a gathering
of conservatives at a five-star Colorado Springs resort to tell him
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to say, `Newt, we followed you over a cliff,'''
said Sears, a former elected official in Arizona and a participant
in the Weekend, an annual conference for conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she asked Gingrich if he would be producing new
inspirational audio- and videotapes, like the ones he made in the
1980s with GOPAC, his one-time political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said she knows Gingrich to be a good man and is reserving
judgment on the breakup of his marriage and relationship with a
much younger congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made his first public appearance Friday since filing
for divorce in late July. He received no fee, said David Horowitz,
the conference organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd consisted of several hundred wealthy conservatives,
many of whom contributed to Gingrich's congressional campaigns or
GOPAC. Many knew him personally and it was a friendly setting,
though there was also an undercurrent of disappointment over the
reports about Gingrich's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz, the '60s radical who became a conservative author,
introduced Gingrich as the American most responsible for balanced
budgets and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we as conservatives have a place in our heart for
Newt Gingrich, and always will,'' said Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich talked about a broken system of health care, changing
the Republican Party's image in the eyes of blacks and Hispanics,
and the need for conservatives to look into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see at least as much change between now and 2025 as we
saw in the last 100 years,'' he said at the luxurious Broadmoor
Resort in the shadow of Pikes Peak.
</P>
<P>
   He also decried the gossip that permeates the Sunday political
talk shows, but made no reference to his own situation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Edmonds of Naples, Fla., was one of those who rushed to a
microphone to pose a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the greatest speeches I've ever heard,'' Edmonds
said, before asking Gingrich if he would have found a way to press
for President Clinton's removal from office had he remained
speaker. ``No,'' Gingrich replied.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Krieble, a transplanted Coloradan and longtime GOPAC
supporter, said Gingrich ``is no more perfect than anyone else who
sits out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``We've almost become a socialist country.
Without Newt to remind us what makes us a beacon to the world, we'd
have lost it 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brown of suburban Atlanta said Gingrich remains a
visionary leader. But he said Gingrich's marital problems troubled
him, because ``we looked to him as someone who was a leader in
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington-area pollster Frank Luntz said that listening to
Gingrich reminded him why he became a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that,'' he said ``is why I find all the personal stuff so
tragic.

THE REAL STORY: HOW A LAWYER AND A FILMMAKER FOUND HOLES IN FBI'S
OFFICIAL VERSION OF WACO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
(Attn: Ariz. and Colo.) 
 
(Eds.: Sub to correct to ``75'' sted of ``80'' in third graph) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The big cannons of Congress had their shot at
uncovering the truth about Waco and the Branch Davidians, and they
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice and Treasury departments had their own crack at the
truth and fared no better. Neither did the dozens of lawyers and
scores of journalists who chased hundreds of leads and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The official story remained undented: David Koresh and his cult
followers at Mount Carmel instigated the gunbattle with federal
agents in the spring of 1993 and, 51 days later, committed mass
suicide by setting fire to their Texas compound. Koresh and some 75
followers died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, fragments of the official version began to crumble,
but it took an unlikely pair of outsiders _ a lone-wolf lawyer from
Tucson, Ariz., and a low-budget documentary film researcher from
Fort Collins, Colo. _ to force the revelations that FBI agents
withheld evidence about the siege and possibly committed perjury to
keep that evidence secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall of silence, the stonewalling, finally is starting to
come apart,'' said Joe Phillips, an associate of the Houston law
firm Caddell &AMP; Chapman that has filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against the government.
</P>
<P>
   What finally cracked the wall was the perseverance of David
Hardy, a former Interior Department attorney who set out five years
ago to write a book about the ``militarization of law
enforcement,'' and Mike McNulty, a down-sized insurance
salesman-turned-filmmaker whose first effort, ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement,'' was nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was drawn to Waco because it was an illustration, he says,
of the dangers of turning soldiers into cops. McNulty, a Mormon,
has said he became interested in the story because of its
similarities to the massacre of church members at Haun's Mill in
Missouri in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty did not return phone calls for comment on his role in
forcing the FBI to amend its previous version of events, but Hardy
said that while they had different interests in the Branch Davidian
siege, they have worked closely together and shared information.
</P>
<P>
   What their labors led to may not alter the verdict on Waco.
However, it has dented the credibility of the Justice Department
and could have an important impact on wrongful death lawsuits filed
by the families of Davidians who died in the Mount Carmel fire. A
trial is set for Oct. 18 in federal court in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major disclosures of the past 10 days:
</P>
<P>
   _ The FBI withheld from Attorney General Janet Reno and Congress
the fact that pyrotechnic devices were used on the last day of the
siege of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   _ FBI officials lied in sworn statements when they said they had
no infrared video of the first four hours of the assault _ videos
that possibly would show the use of pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possible perjury by FBI officials, who, in response to Hardy's
Freedom of Information lawsuit, told a federal judge they had no
recording of the radio traffic during the entire six-hour assault.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's hostage rescue team had a tape that revealed that
Reno's order not to use pyrotechnic devices was violated; that the
first two hours of the assault were recorded on infrared videotape;
and that there was an audio recording of the use of pyrotechnic
devices being ordered by Richard Rogers, commander of the hostage
rescue team. For six years, that tape had been in the custody of
the hostage rescue team in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In his years as an Interior Department lawyer, Hardy said, he
became familiar with the federal Freedom of Information Act. After
he left government and returned to Tucson in 1988, he began to use
that law to gather material for his book.
</P>
<P>
   While his mostly civil law practice often had civil liberties
overtones _ he prosecuted one lawsuit that challenged gun control
and another that ultimately restricted government spying on
churches _ he disputes the suggestion that he is part of the
anti-government, militia, conspiracy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want information I'm entitled to have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for documents pertaining to the Davidian incident,
Hardy first sued the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which
conducted the botched raid that led to the 51-day siege and
subsequent fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ATF lawyers responded that certain materials it once had were
turned over to the Texas Rangers, which had gathered evidence from
the scene after the siege ended.
</P>
<P>
   He then filed a state open records request with the Rangers, who
told him they only had custody of the evidence and were not
authorized to release it without approval from the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circle was closed,'' Hardy said. ``The Justice Department
controlled it but didn't have it. The Rangers had it but didn't
control it. They could bat you back and forth forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they almost did.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1997 and 1998, he was passed from one agency to another:
the U.S. attorney's office, the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys,
the FBI, the ATF, the Rangers again.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, McNulty was pursuing material for a sequel to his
first Waco film, this one titled ``Waco: A New Revelation.'' He was
encountering the same run-around.
</P>
<P>
   More vocally anti-government than Hardy, McNulty once hosted a
talk radio show and billed himself as chairman of the Citizens
Organization for Public Safety of Fort Collins, Colo. But Waco was
his passion and his research was dogged enough that lawyers in the
wrongful death lawsuits paid him for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what he considered stonewalling by the government,
McNulty began calling on Bill Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney
in Waco, who would play a peculiar role in the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Once accused of covering up, Johnston would suddenly turn
whistle-blower. During congressional hearings in 1995, Fort Worth
attorney Tim Evans, who represented one of the Davidians charged
with murder in the death of four ATF agents, gave the committee an
internal ATF memo which alleged that Johnston ordered the agents to
stop their internal investigation into the assault on the Davidian
compound. Johnston, the memo said, did not want the ATF to develop
evidence that defense lawyers could use in the criminal trial of
the accused Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnston, according to one lawyer, ``had a change of
heart'' late last year and agreed to give McNulty limited access to
the evidence being held by the Rangers in Austin, Texas. Between
November and March, McNulty made four visits to the evidence room
and on one occasion he was accompanied by Johnston.

NEGOTATING DAFOE MAY BE ABSENT AS TRAINING OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT AND NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ The Bruins open training camp this morning a few
miles south from here, in Wilmington, Mass., but a bunch of
veterans took their last informal tuneup twirl here at the Icenter
in anticipation of the coming-out party.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, however, Byron Dafoe still had plans for
something far more private _ a going-home soiree.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe's agent, Ron Salcer, and Bruins president/general manager
Harry Sinden exchanged faxes, a move that Sinden termed, if
anything, counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said that when he and Dafoe sat down for a meeting
Tuesday, he was told he'd receive from Salcer documented evidence
of why Dafoe should be paid the $4 million a year he's reportedly
seeking. He said the alleged evidence wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent me a fax like he promised he would,'' said Sinden.
``He sent us the comparisons we were looking for as to why they
believe they can justify a contract demand from us that was equal
to (New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur). It was negligible, to tell
you the truth. It was so sparse that in many ways, I thought it was
disrespectful to the negotiations. We knew he couldn't come up with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   We've been working on this forever, trying to find reasons for
us (to pay him what Dafoe is asking). There aren't any. I've worked
in (Boston's) North End for a long time and the word they'd use for
it is shakedown. That's what the neighbors would use for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he wasn't angry with Dafoe because he believes Dafoe
thought his agent could provide the necessary documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron was convinced, and I think he was sincere, that his
agent could come up with these facts that would support his
position,'' Sinden said. ``I believe Byron really felt that way. I
said, `Fine. This may get us off dead-center.' But it just isn't
there. I told him I'd be awful surprised if he can because we've
been working on this thing for a long time. I was right, he
couldn't. We advised them to reconsider and come to the reality of
this impasse before they're sorry for it. But I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Sinden began talking as if the Bruins would
be willing to move on without Dafoe. Perhaps it's posturing, but
history shows that the Bruins view everyone as expendable. Sinden
said Dafoe was the diamond in the rough when they made a
multiplayer trade with the Los Angeles Kings. At that time, Dmitri
Khristich was considered the jewel of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt this hurts our team,'' Sinden said. ``We need
a goalie like Byron. We didn't expect what we got when we got him.
Maybe we'll get the same thing with the next guy who plays goal.
It's a serious impasse. They're stuck on this and after all our
analysis, we're certainly stuck (in the team's position).''
</P>
<P>
   With this development, it appears Dafoe will board that plane
for Los Angeles Saturday evening, which he has said he'd do if
there was no pact.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Sinden's comments, Dafoe paused as if a little
stunned. ``Well, then I guess I'd better pack my bags,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the scenario plays out as it now looks, the Bruins will be
without their No. 1 goalie, one of their top defensemen (Hal Gill)
and one of their top checking wingers (P.J. Axelsson) when the
young and old begin to mix at Ristuccia Memorial Arena. All three
remain restricted (Group 2) free agents, disenchanted with the
money offered by Messrs. Sinden and Mike O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the Vault: The jobs will go to the able, the
signed, and the willing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell on the possibility of going this season with a
combination of Rob Tallas and John Grahame in net: ``They haven't
convinced me that they can't do it. Dafoe is a terrific goalie, and
we'd like to have him on our team. But, look where he was when he
first got here. He was around a .500 goalie when he got here, sort
of the odd-man out in LA, and we wonder, could these guys _ Tallas
or Grahame _ do the same with a similar opportunity?''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, however, the preference among management,
teammates, and fans would be to have Dafoe back in the cage. This
is a franchise that waited a long time, dating back to the
departures of Rejean Lemelin and Andy Moog, to have someone who
could so reliably protect the most valuable 24-square-foot piece of
land in town. Sure, Tallas and Grahame might get it done, but they
could also be the new millenium's version of Jon Casey and the
Amazing Technicolor Five Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the two sides work out their $3 million difference _ $12
million vs. $9 million over three years _ the opening of the
1999-2000 season will be hauntingly similar to the start of
1998-99. Last season, Kyle McLaren and Anson Carter were the MIAs
(missing in autumn), and it took a few weeks for Jason Allison,
late to sign his deal, to round fully into form.
</P>
<P>
   The color of money again colors the feel of fall.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At Friday morning's weekly press briefing, Attorney
General Janet Reno answered virtually every question by saying she
was ``dedicated to finding the truth,'' wanted to ``use the process
to get to the truth'' and planned to ``continue to pursue the
truth.'' In half an hour, she referred to ``the truth'' a total of
25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Again, reporters were asking whether she would resign over the
latest disclosures about the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas, where about 80 people died. And again, in
response, Reno spoke softly, smiled pleasantly and said very
little. In answer to the final question of the day about the
continuing Waco fiasco, she said, ``I think we'll let the truth
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   But across party and ideological lines, critics who have
disagreed with Reno for quite different reasons over the last six
years do tend to agree on one thing: President Clinton's attorney
general seems to have had a hard time ferreting out the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say she never even got close on Waco or on alleged
campaign finance abuses by administration officials, including
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. They were infuriated by her
repeated decisions not to name special prosecutors to get to the
bottom of those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   And many conservatives felt that her initial statement after the
Waco fiasco that ``the buck stops here'' was not only an inadequate
answer to the loss of many lives but became a substitute for a
thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that, on the contrary, she was too willing
to appoint special counsels to look into allegations against
Cabinet members, including Henry Cisneros, Mike Espy and Bruce
Babbitt, and gave a green light to Kenneth Starr to expand his
investigation of Whitewater to include the Lewinsky scandal. They,
too, seem frustrated by Reno's repeated insistence in times of
crisis that while she is ultimately responsible, she is also often
out of the loop, misinformed or, as she suggested last week,
deceived by her own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing a hard job,'' said a former Justice Department
official. ``The Clintonites don't like that she gave Ken Starr a
blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   And Reno, because of her reserve and stubborn refusal to
schmooze, is perceived as out on a limb by herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Periodically, they come and ask for her resignation,'' Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said of her
friend's critics. ``The insiders feel she doesn't have a
constituency because she's not a member of the legal establishment.
The boys in town, Democrats and Republicans, see a constituency as
only in the Beltway, but the American people like her. They see her
as an Abe Lincoln figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's anguished acceptance of responsibility after the Waco
tragedy did earn her high marks for honesty, at least in some
quarters. But Friday, her assurances that she was still in charge,
still digging, still determined to get to the truth, seemed to be
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a weak attorney general and that is one Cabinet
position in which it's actually important to know what you're
doing,'' said Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly
Standard. ``Republicans are going to beat her up, and she deserves
it.'' He went on to say that conservatives are so fed up with Reno
that they are giving Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, a pass
simply because he is perceived as anti-Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was not Clinton's first choice for the job, nor his second.
He considered a number of other women, including Zoe Baird and
Kimba Wood. She was not a friend, in the way that many attorneys
general have been to presidents, and after moving to Washington
from Florida, where she was the Dade County prosecutor, she kept
mostly to herself, socializing to this day with only a tiny handful
of friends, most of whom are visitors from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from almost the first, she entered office while the
standoff with the followers of David Koresh was already under way.
Her tenure has not been an easy one. After ordering the attack,
which was supposed to force the Branch Davidians out of their
bunker after 51 days, but instead led to their deaths, the new
attorney general said that making that call had been ``the hardest
decision in the world to make'' and was ``based on what we knew
then. Based on what we know now,'' she admitted immediately after
the attack, ``it was obviously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure a week ago that agents had used heat-generating
military tear-gas rounds _ which they had always denied using _ at
a covered bunker not far from the main Branch Davidian compound
several hours before the deadly fire broke out, again forced Reno
to acknowledge that her credibility had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, though her hands and arms were shaking vigorously
from her Parkinson's disease, she seemed placid, even unfazed.
``You dig at it until you get it right and you get people telling
you what actually happened,'' she said. ``You don't run away from
it. You don't say, `Oh, me. I can't handle this.' You keep at it
until you get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say the calm is real. ``She doesn't take it
personally,'' said Shalala, who added that she has never heard Reno
even question why she is so often under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as another friend, the former Justice Department official,
put it: ``She just doesn't embarrass. There's been a lot of
personal vitriol, and I never saw it bother her. She's totally on
her own island.''

 &HT;    Two-level Home Depot on drawing board in New York
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's first double-decker site could debut in
New York's East Harlem district.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based retailer is one of several proposed anchors
for a $150 million mall that will replace the soon-to-be-demolished
Washburn Wire Co. plant on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. The
shopping center, dubbed East River Plaza, spans several stories and
six acres.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is considering putting its regular warehouse store on
one floor and an Expo Design Center on another, said Andrew Katz of
developer Blumenfeld Development Group.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot does not comment on real estate under development.
Scheduled to open in 2001, the site hasn't received full approval
from local authorities yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem site would be Home Depot's first two-story setup.
Recently the retailer has tried to build Expos next to existing
warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   While Home Depot would conceivably draw consumers from Upper
Manhattan, the store would certainly target Harlem's new influx of
residents. Since 1994, more than $1 billion has been invested in
new and rehabilitated housing, and the area has become a hub for
national retail chains such as Starbucks and Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big box'' retailers are the latest to join in. Discounter
Costco Cos. also has expressed strong interest in East River Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's proposed stores would join a half dozen or so in
metro New York, including sites in the Bronx and Brooklyn.

FUND-RAISING LETTER GOES BEYOND THE USUAL HYPERBOLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fund-raising letters postmarked in this city have
always used language that is hyperbolic. But in a recent ``urgent''
letter, a Republican fund-raising chairman asked for contributions
of $25 or more to help the Senate protect the United States from a
looming nuclear attack by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, began the four-page letter this way, ``Dear
Fellow American: My colleagues in the United States Senate must
have your immediate help to protect our country from a potentially
devastating nuclear attack.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said a ``generous emergency gift of $25 or more''
would help Senate Republicans defend the United States and ``do
what President Clinton will not: preserve, protect and defend the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Included with the mailing was a ``Nuclear Crisis Action
Survey,'' a list of eight multiple-choice questions that the reader
was asked to complete and return within 48 hours. ``We want your
opinions,'' the letter said, ``on how you want the Senate to act on
the shocking information that has only recently come to our
attention: The Communist North Korean government has obtained
nuclear technology, and possibly the capability of reaching our
shores with nuclear missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth and final question: ``Will you do your part to help
today?'' There are boxes for amounts ranging from $25 to $1,000.
McConnell, R-Ky., assured recipients that he would share the
survey's results with the Senate Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan, and South Korea have threatened to cut
off foreign aid and remittances if North Korea proceeds with a test
of a missile that has the capability to reach Hawaii or Alaska. Two
weeks ago, the United States and North Korea agreed to meet this
month in Europe to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have said that the missile North Korea
plans to test-fire is an advanced version of the Taepodong rocket
it launched last year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Republicans' main fund-raising group,
McConnell is one of the most outspoken and influential opponents in
Congress to a bill that would ban unlimited campaign contributions
known as soft money. Last month, McConnell urged as many as 20
executives to resign from a committee dedicated to advancing the
bill that would overhaul campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   His fund-raising letter is clearly intended to play off North
Korea's potential of fielding a ballistic capable of striking the
United States. But it would take another technological advance to
enable North Korea's rockets to have the range to reach the lower
48 states. The Pentagon last month positioned two Navy observation
ships to watch for a possible test launch.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steven Law, the executive director of the Republican committee,
said that the letter was a test mailing sent to several thousand
people and that the response was less than what they hoped for. But
Law defended the letter's message and its tone, saying, ``This is
standard fare for direct mail, and it is a good deal less
incendiary than some mailings I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, he said, fund-raising letters used scare
tactics about nuclear war to drum up support. ``These letters have
been a staple of direct mail fund-raising drives for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell declined to comment on the letter. And Robert Steurer,
his press secretary, referred questions to the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform advocates said they were outraged by the
letter's message and tone, calling it a brazen attempt to play upon
people's fears to raise money. They also said it was the first time
they could recall that a fund-raising letter depended on the
specter of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of direct mail and people play a lot of games,
but I've never seen anyone take us to the verge of nuclear war to
raise a few bucks,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of
Democracy 21, a nonprofit public policy organization that endorses
changes to campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Haley
Barbour, said that shrill language in fund-raising letters is
typical and is used by both Republicans and Democrats. ``To me, the
shrillest letter I've ever seen was a Democratic letter that
accused the Republicans of taking away Social Security from
millions of senior citizens,'' Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell accuses the Clinton administration of giving over $200
million of ``YOUR TAX DOLLARS'' to North Korea, which he said the
nation used to aid its nuclear program. In recent years, the
Clinton administration has guaranteed North Korea $200 million in
aid for food in the face of widespread domestic starvation and fuel
for its civilian nuclear plants, in return for a pledge to restrain
its military nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shameful reality,'' McConnell said, ``is compounded by a
terrifying fact: If the North Korean Communists launch a nuclear
attack on our nation, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE A WAY TO STOP
IT.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we retaliate with our own missiles,'' he wrote,
``their nuclear bombs will have already killed hundreds of
thousands of our citizens. And the reason is, the Clinton-Gore
administration for years refused to allow deployment of the
military's missile defense program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans have seized upon anti-missile defense as an issue.
In March, after the White House yielded to pressure and dropped
longstanding objections to anti-missile deployments, the Senate and
House voted overwhelmingly for the United States to build a
defensive system. Congress is pushing for an anti-missile force to
be set up as early as 2003 or 2005, and the Pentagon says that such
dates may be feasible. Opponents argue that with deployment of a
missile defense system, Washington might abandon diplomacy and arms
control in favor of a potentially false sense of security backed by
a faulty defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Law defended the accuracy of the letter, saying all its
assertions were backed up by research conducted by the Republican
committee.

STUDY OF CANCER PATIENTS SHOWS WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN WILL TO LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proponents of a right to assisted suicide argue that choosing
death can be a rational response to intolerable suffering, while
opponents caution that inadequate treatment for pain, depression or
other conditions can color the decision to die.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scientists are only beginning to investigate systematically
what leads some patients in the grips of a grave illness to give up
the will to live, and how a longing for death may either fade or
remain constant over time.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by Canadian researchers suggests that in the
weeks before death, cancer patients show substantial fluctuations
in their will to live. And the factors that contribute to a loss of
that will shift over time, the researchers found, and often involve
suffering that can be alleviated through treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The authors said they had undertaken the study both to explore
an issue that is central to the debate over physician-assisted
suicide and to increase understanding of how to improve palliative
care for patients nearing the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if we're going to be responsible, attentive and
compassionate to the needs of the dying patient, we need to be
informed and competent about how to go about managing reversible
distress at the end of life,'' said Dr. Harvey Chochinov, professor
of psychiatry and family medicine at the University of Manitoba and
lead author of the study, which appears in Saturday's issue of the
British medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the
University of Pennsylvania, applauded the researchers' efforts to
quantify the complicated feelings and needs of dying patients. Such
studies are ``of crucial importance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the debate about doctor-assisted suicide has been
floating untethered from any empirical understanding of dying,''
Caplan said. ``It's done like a resolution at a high school debate
club: Are you for it or against it? But it's in the details of the
psychosocial and the emotional that a lot of the resolution of the
debate will lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Chochinov and his colleagues studied 168 cancer patients
admitted to the hospital for end-of-life care. The patients were
screened to make sure that they had the mental competence and the
physical strength to participate in the study, which involved
filling out a questionnaire twice a day _ a process that Chochinov
said took about a minute _ and continued until shortly before
death. The participants were asked to rate themselves on 100-point
scales measuring pain, nausea, appetite, activity, drowsiness,
sense of well-being, depression, anxiety and shortness of breath.
They also rated the strength of their will to live.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the patients in the study were elderly, although the
youngest was 31 (and the oldest 89). On average, the participants
survived for 18 days after entering the hospital. One woman,
however, survived for more than 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   Over a 12-hour period, Chochinov said, the patients' will to
live could fluctuate by 30 percent or more. Over a 30-day period,
the shifts were even larger, on average up to 60 percent or 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These large fluctuations suggest that will to live is highly
unstable,'' the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the period just after a patient entered the hospital, a
decrease in the will to live was most strongly associated with
anxiety, perhaps as a result of the psychological shift required in
moving from out-of-hospital care, Chochinov said. One to two weeks
afterward, the researchers found, depression was the symptom most
strongly associated with decreased will to live.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final days of life, physical distress _ specifically
pain and shortness of breath _ repressed patients' will to live
more strongly than psychological suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both sides in the right-to-die debate said
the study was interesting. But the two sides differed in their
interpretations of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the state with the nation's only law authorizing
physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Gregory Hamilton, an opponent of
the practice, said, ``This study demonstrates numerically that
feelings of suicidal ideation or suicidal despair can be influenced
through treatment and should not be taken at face value as some
kind of abstract philosophical right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People's feelings about themselves and about the value of
their lives vary over time,'' said Hamilton, president of the
anti-suicide group Physicians for Compassionate Care, ``and what we
need to do with patients who are very ill is to take care of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   George Eighmey, executive director of another Oregon group,
Compassion in Dying, which favors a right to physician-assisted
suicide, said the study ``in a sense confirms what we have found to
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the study indicates the greatest
correlation between physical symptoms and loss of will to live as
death approached,'' Eighmey said. ``The overwhelming majority of
our patients who have a sustained desire and will to end their life
do so because of fear of loss of autonomy, and of the indignities
associated with losing control over bodily function. And we know
that dying individuals find solace and comfort in knowing that it's
an option.''

BAY STATE SEX-OFFENDER REGISTRY INOPERATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' sex-offender registry, passed three
years ago with great fanfare and a promise it would help protect
the public from predators, has quietly ceased operating.
</P>
<P>
   A series of court decisions calling for due-process rights,
along with legislative inaction, has left Massachusetts without
some basic protections from sex criminals that are provided to
residents in 49 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 11, when the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that all
13,000 people in the state who have committed sex crimes are
entitled to hearings before being listed on the registry, the
agency has essentially shut down.
</P>
<P>
   That means:
</P>
<P>
   --No longer can Massachusetts residents visit local police
departments to learn the names and addresses of sex offenders
living and working near them and their children _ a bedrock
provision of the registry law.
</P>
<P>
   --Law enforcement officials throughout Massachusetts have been
told to stop posting information on fliers, posters and local cable
television about the most dangerous sex offenders in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   --Day-care centers and youth organizations who have concerns
about a potential employee or volunteer can no longer conduct
background checks through the state's central registry of sex
offenders. The registry receives 10,000 inquiries a year from the
public.
</P>
<P>
   --The state stands to lose $1.1 million in federal
crime-fighting funds unless legislators pass a law by Sept. 12 that
provides the constitutional safeguards ordered by the court and
also complies with federal sex-offender standards. A key House
lawmaker says this is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   --Even if new legislation is adopted, the state must start over
again, re-registering thousands of sex offenders following due
process hearings. Many months could pass before the state makes up
the lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   The registry in three years has examined 10 million court
records, compiled current data on 8,000 offenders, and, so far,
classified only the most dangerous 1,388 people. Now, even that
initial work will have to be re-done.
</P>
<P>
   Declared one senior government official: ``For all practical
purposes, the sex-offender registry has ceased to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who wants to expand the registry and
toughen penalties for sex offenders, Friday demanded lawmakers fix
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature's inaction is putting lives at risk, and there
is no excuse for them not to act,'' the governor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Haley said next week, the
Legislature will try to craft legislation that addresses the
constitutional concerns raised by the court. But he said
Massachusetts has little chance of obtaining the federal grant,
which demands that offenders convicted of sex crimes register
immediately after conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said that he and the attorney general's office have
proposed language to bridge the gap between the SJC ruling and
federal funding requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Haley has not accepted the proposal, which involves alternative
definitions of ``register'' that might satisfy the federal
government. Because of the impasse, the registry is a stagnant
concept waiting to be re-created.
</P>
<P>
   The concept enjoyed broad public support when first passed by
the Legislature in 1996. It called for all people convicted or
released from prison, probation or parole after Aug. 1, 1981, to
register at their local police station.
</P>
<P>
   After identifying themselves to local police, offenders were
classified in one of three categories of potential danger by the
Sexual Offender Registry Board. For those considered least
dangerous, or Level 1 offenders, their personal data were made
available at the police station for residents who lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But for Level 2 and Level 3 offenders, the more dangerous
groups, police were required to publicize their whereabouts through
more aggressive means such as high-visibility fliers and written
notices to residents and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Problems soon began to plague the system. Offenders did not
register as quickly as expected, law enforcement authorities lacked
the resources to find and punish those who failed to. And state
courts moved swiftly to protect the privacy rights of offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled people convicted of
open and gross lewdness, such as urinating in public, and indecent
assault and battery on a person over 18, which includes
inappropriate touching, were entitled to a hearing before
registering.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, the same court nullified classifications for
Level 2 and 3 criminals because they had not been given an
opportunity to be heard by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the court has ruled that due process requires hearings for
all sex offenders before they are placed on the register, as well
as another hearing when their level of dangerous is determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has put the registry dead in the water, and I think the
public might not be aware of that,'' Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Haley laid part of the blame for the registry's fate on the SJC,
saying that the court did not provide adequate guidelines when the
sex-offender legislation was drafted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incumbent on them that if they saw an issue with
registration, to tell us just what was required,'' said Haley, who
co-chaired the Joint Criminal Justice Committee when the bill was
adopted. ``I think we've wasted 2 1/2 years from a public safety
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci continues to point the finger at Haley and other
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature's failure to fix the registry will continue to
allow violent predators to walk the streets and prey on victims,''
Cellucci said angrily Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activists, however, and the public defenders who
represent many sex offenders, said part of the blame may lie with
politicians who rushed to support a popular, but structurally weak
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a law that has a lot of flaws,'' said Larni Levy, an
appellate attorney for the Committee for Public Counsel Services.
``Those flaws are fundamental, and they need to be rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Levy said, even a 15-year-old who has had
consensual sex with a 14-year-old would be required to register as
a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a devastating decision,'' William Leahy, chief counsel
for the public defenders committee said of the SJC ruling. ``The
Legislature really must narrow the scope of the statute to separate
the people who are likely to commit the kinds of crimes that
parents and others fear against children versus the people who are
just nuisances and don't really pose a risk of violent sexual
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley said he is confident that a compromise bill can be
dispatched for debate as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that our main focus should be on crafting
legislation that is workable, maximizes public safety, and
addresses the somewhat surprising liberal constructs that the court
has announced,'' Haley said.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Mark Baird was picking his way through a
tiny lunch. It was barely past noon, but, as the World Bank's new
country director in Indonesia, he had already had breakfast at this
same Hilton hotel with an Indonesian economist and, later, meetings
with a variety of business people and officials. Now he was
explaining to a reporter how, in a country jaded by years of
bureaucratic bungles, he intended to reshape the image of the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the name's got to go,'' Baird said with a dry laugh.
```World' is too grandiose, and for most people, the word `bank'
sounds like we are just here to make money, like every other
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   What Baird is here to do is supervise the multibillion-dollar
bailout of Indonesia's shattered economy, a rescue planned by the
bank, the International Monetary Fund and foreign nations. In early
August, just as the currency, the rupiah, seemed to be recovering
from its 1998 collapse, investigators found that Bank Bali had paid
more than $70 million in fees to a company controlled by a top
official of the ruling party. Baligate, as the local newspapers
labeled the scandal, could scare away investors again.
</P>
<P>
   Baird, a New Zealander with a master's degree in economics from
the University of Canterbury in England and many years of
experience at the World Bank, never expected his current job to be
easy. He arrived here last March, shortly after the bank, in a
startlingly powerful self-criticism, acknowledged that it had
ignored widespread government corruption during the 33-year rule of
former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the comparison was justified, people here for
years associated the World Bank with the government, says Eric
Bjornlund, Indonesia mission director for the Washington-based
National Democracy Institute, an American organization that
promotes democratic politics. ``There was all this money sloshing
around,'' he said, ``and here was the World Bank in partnership
with government.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, 48, says that as an economist for the bank in Jakarta in
the late 1980s, he followed the old style. ``We prided ourselves on
working behind the scenes, with the government,'' he said. ``We got
things done that way. Now, I think we should have spoken out on
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird left Jakarta in 1989, returning to New Zealand to help his
own government introduce economic reforms. Later, he held senior
posts at World Bank headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Baird returned to Jakarta, it was a very different place.
Street protests in 1998 had ousted Suharto. A frenzied democratic
election campaign was under way. The economy was in shambles, and
the World Bank was determined to hold officials accountable for the
use of billions of dollars in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival, Baird did not head directly downtown, to his
offices in the Jakarta Stock Exchange building, or to the Jakarta
home where he and his wife and younger daughter would live.
Instead, in line with the World Bank's new policy of having its
officials experience life below the lofty level of national
leaders, he spent a week with a family in a small rural village in
Central Java. There, hundreds of miles east of the capital, women
in conical hats stoop over the rice paddies, harvesting crops by
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government was irrelevant, and the World Bank was totally
unknown,'' he said. ``It was darned hard to explain to people what
we do. People can't begin to comprehend millions of dollars. They
count in terms of hundreds of rupiah'' _ pennies, at the current
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the people's curiosity challenged his natural reserve.
Crowds followed him even to off-duty appointments. ``I had several
massages, and people would gather just to see this weird white guy
getting a massage,'' he said. ``They would stand around talking and
serve coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a $700 loan to the village _ minuscule to Baird, but a
fortune to the villagers _ became a lesson in the hurdles faced by
the World Bank. ``The men haggled over who would deal with the
money, and the women came up with five ideas of what to do with it,
like opening a restaurant,'' Baird said. ``It was obvious that
development is about more than money; it's about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird says some of his recent actions would have been
unthinkable for a World Bank functionary 10 years ago. Recently,
for example, he told reporters that the bank would consider
withdrawing financing if Baligate was not resolved to its
satisfaction..
</P>
<P>
   Baird says, Indonesia is a crucial test case of the
organization's new willingness to challenge its partners around the
world. Ending corruption, he said, has become essential.
</P>
<P>
   He still faces a tough battle convincing some Indonesians of the
World Bank's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark doesn't do much to make the image better,'' said Wardah
Hafidz, the coordinator of the Urban Poor Consortium, a collection
of activist groups in Jakarta. Ms. Hafidz and others, accusing the
government of corruption and waste, pleaded with Baird to delay
millions of dollars in loans for government social programs until
elected representatives could appoint a new president this fall.
Baird refused, arguing that the loans would provide essential
financing so that poor Indonesians could sell their crops and send
children to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they aren't involved in politics, but that's like
saying you're in timber, chopping down trees, but you're not
involved with the environment,'' Ms. Hafidz said. ``A bank is a
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what fuels Baird's fantasy of a change in the
World Bank's name.

DON'T LOOK FOR NHL PLAYERS IN 2002 OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if you might not have to worry about the US hockey
team trashing any more apartments at the Olympics. As things stand
now, NHL owners won't be allowing their players to go.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting a few days ago in New York, NHL commissioner Gary
Bettman presented league owners a list of demands from the Players'
Association if its members were going to play in the 2002 Olympics
in Salt Lake City. They played for the first time in Olympics
history last year in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs, the owners won't
allow them to go because the demands are too outrageous, including
a 20-day break in the league schedule, and money going to
financially strapped Pittsburgh as partial payment for funds the
Penguins might have realized during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were never high on the use of NHL players in the
Games anyway, and were trying to accommodate the fans who wanted to
see their countrymen compete under their flags in the biggest
international competition on the planet. When CBS didn't air the
games from Nagano in prime time, that didn't sit well with the
owners, either. Now this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The work continues daily. Quietly. Without fanfare. The two
tracks are being poured. The race cars are being assembled. And
down the stretch it is coming to New England _ indoor car racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first track being built in the Northeast,'' said
Dick Valentine, who has dreamed of this for five years, and is now
trying to make something that seems crazy to us locals into the
craze it has become in Europe. Valentine, from Hingham, Mass., is a
professional race car driver who has seen how successful indoor
racing is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 250 of them alone in Germany,'' said Tony Stewart,
who has moved from London to oversee the building of Valentine's $5
million track in Braintree, Mass., in two buildings that formerly
housed the Blue Hills Tennis Clubs. Stewart has designed some of
the top indoor tracks in Europe, and says when it is finished, the
one in Braintree ``will be the best in the world. This is really
exciting. People are going to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   This racing is not for professionals. The public has embraced it
in Europe over the past decade. The track is grand prix in design,
and will feature Indy-style cars. They go up to 35 miles per hour.
The drivers have to wear the full racing uniform, attend a training
session, and drive practice laps before they are allowed to have a
full run.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it has become a corporate toy in Europe more than
anywhere else, attracting businessmen 25 to 55 years of age. The
Braintree track will include a large meeting area and convention
center and restaurant. ``We plan to open in January with a large
celebrity event, with the proceeds going to Children's Hospital in
Boston.'' This track isn't even finished, and Valentine and his
partners are already planning to build two more in the Greater
Boston area.

   Colleague Dan Shaughnessy wrote a column Aug. 22 about the late,
great Ray Fitzgerald, who honored this paper with his sports
columns for many years. This prompted a letter from old friend Jack
Warner, former Boston Redevelopment Director, now retired to
writing books out of his Cape Cod home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Westfield, Mass., with Ray. He was a little bit
older and my hero. He was a legendary high school athlete in
baseball and basketball. Years later, we were part owners of a
weekly paper in Westfield, before he left to go to the Boston Globe
and fame, if not fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many memories of Ray. One in particular is a stunning
example of the power of his gentle nature. Ray and I went with a
friend to a Giants-Cleveland Browns game at Yankee Stadium. After
the game, we moved with the crowd across the street from the
stadium. As we moseyed along the sidewalk, suddenly, two steps in
front of us, four or five young men, walking with the crowd, began
to argue, voices suddenly shrill. In an instant _ a moment that
changed our postgame euphoria to tense, alert, shocked watchfulness
_ one of the group plunged his hand into his pocket and whipped out
a slim object that, with a snap, became a long, thin-bladed
stiletto. You could hear and feel the onlookers catch their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man with the knife began to stalk another, and
slowly circled around him, his eyes wide, and fixed on the knife.
No one else moved except Ray Fitzgerald. He walked between the
knife and its intended. He kept his eyes on the man with the knife.
His voice was low, calm, and almost chatty. `Don't do something you
will regret for the rest of your life. Think for a moment what
using that knife could mean to both of you.' He held out his hand.
`That knife won't make your life better.' He was speaking gently.
No one in the crowd, moved or spoke. `Give me the knife,' Ray said
quietly, extending his hand. `The knife won't help you.' He slowly
took the knife from the young man's hand, and without another word,
walked over to a nearby trash barrel and tossed it in. The crowd
stared in silent wonder. They had seen a remarkable act, by a
remarkable man.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Warner also served as the head of Boston Parks and
Recreation and during his tenure left a lasting mark, including
starting the Boston Neighborhood Basketball League, which are
ongoing to this day.

   Thinking of Yankee Stadium, and admiring George Steinbrenner. He
is truly The Boss. Twenty-five years ago, Steinbrenner bought the
Yankees for $10 million. Now he is merging the team with the owners
of the NBA's New Jersey Nets. Steinbrenner's fellow owners, (the
Boss owns 60 percent) will be paid out at $6 million for each 1
percent they own. They bought in at $90,000 for a point. Meanwhile,
each one of those fellow owners has taken out between $5 million
and $10 million since they bought in. The Boss, for putting the
deal together, will get an 8 percent finder's fee, or about $40
million, and he still keeps all of his equity interest in the club.
So George has made an incredible score without giving up
everything, and still has the best baseball team in the game. The
deal is awaiting approval by the NBA and Major League Baseball. All
the money is in place for the vote . . . Kevin Steele, the head
coach of Baylor, was a finalist for the Boston College job. Steele
was a linebacker coach for the Carolina Panthers at the time, and
was being pushed hard by then-general manager Bill Polian. However,
when school president Rev. William P. Leahy, S.J., interviewed
Virginia assistant coach Tom O'Brien, O'Brien got the job.
Meanwhile, then-athletic director Chet Gladchuk had told
Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride he was
going to be the next BC coach, and Gilbride was making arrangements
to leave Jacksonville to come to Boston for a press conference when
he got the news that O'Brien had been picked instead. Steele and
O'Brien face each other Saturday. Gilbride is now the offensive
coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

   Boston's favorite athlete, Michael Jordan, reportedly has made a
$600,000 deal to rent a house in the neighborhood of The Country
Club for the week of the Ryder Cup . . . Brian Rose has told
friends he simply ran out of gas in the second half of the year and
knows he will have to work harder preparing for next season. Rose
sat out most of '98 with an arm injury, and feels it will take
another season to get all his strength back. He also must know that
he has to get a better fastball if he wants to be successful next
year. Opposing hitters were sitting on his changeup after the
All-Star Game, when he got hammered . . . The year 2000 will mark
the 50th season with the Celtics for Red Auerbach, who celebrates
his 82d birthday Sept. 20. Bob Cousy played his first game the same
season, but left the C's to coach Cincinnati and later Boston
College, before returning to the club as a broadcaster 25 years
ago. Auerbach said years ago any athlete is only worth top dollar
if he can actually put bodies in seats. Mike Piazza of the Mets is
one of the few who has ever done that. Before his trade from the
Dodgers a year ago, the Mets were averaging 22,000 per home game.
Since he arrived, they have averaged 33,000.
</P>

   Friends of Mo Money say the reason he is having such a poor year
is the ankle injury he suffered the first game of the year when he
fell on the dugout steps going after a foul pop. In 1941, Ted
Williams suffered a hairline fracture of his ankle, which bothered
him during the season, on the way to hitting .406 . . . Believe it
or not, Celtics tickets fetched more money than either the Red Sox
or Patriots when auctioned off in the US Bankruptcy Court last
week. A sports fan, who had front-row seats to the Celtics, box
seats to the Red Sox, and lower-level seats to the Patriots on the
30-yard line, had to give up his seats to be auctioned off to pay
back his creditors. All the 20 or so bidders who showed up in court
were buying was the right to buy the seats in the future. Nearing
the end of the bidding, the two Celtic floor seats were going for
$26,000; the two Sox box seats for $12,500, and the two Patriot
seats for $8,500. Then a lawyer stepped up representing an
anonymous bidder, and won the whole package by bidding $48,000 _
bidding $1,000 more than all of the individual bidders combined.

 &HT;    Coke's slump expected to linger
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Embattled Coca-Cola's summer of discontent will extend
at least through Christmas as the world's largest soft drink
company deals with weak foreign sales, lower-than-expected
third-quarter profits and fourth-quarter results that will be
affected by a summer product recall in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, owner of the world's most famous
brand name, said Friday it will earn about 32 cents per share in
the third quarter, after allowance for the recall, instead of the
consensus forecast of 36 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 35 cents from operations in the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola blamed the shortfall on the costly recall of its
products in Belgium and France in June due to a health scare,
coupled with slower sales in other European and Latin American
markets and higher marketing costs to maintain market share.
Turkey's earthquake and floods in China have also have hurt sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it expects the European product withdrawal
``to have a continued impact on fourth-quarter results,'' but did
not quantify it.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement surprised Wall Street, where analysts were
expecting the company's problems to bottom out in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester had said on June
30: ``We believe the worst is behind us, and we remain optimistic
about improving business conditions in the second half of this year
and into the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester reiterated in Friday's announcement that global economic
conditions have resulted in ``gradually improving volume trends,''
resulting in the first quarterly upturn in unit case volume so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street greeted the announcement with a sell-off that sent
the company's share price tumbling by $2.12 1/2, or 3.6 percent, to
$57.37 1/2 on turnover of more than 7.8 million shares, or more
than double average daily volume. Coca-Cola was one of the few big
losers on Friday in an otherwise rising market.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts were quick to lower their earnings
projections, according to Charles L. Hill, research director of
First Call, a New York research firm that tracks analysts'
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The new consensus forecast for the third quarter is 31 cents to
33 cents per share, down from the earlier 36 cents. The
fourth-quarter consensus dropped to 30 cents from 32 cents, the
1999 estimate to $1.30 from $1.36 and the 2000 estimate to $1.51
from $1.56, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Hill noted that this was the fifth consecutive quarter that the
company had warned the market of lower-than-expected earnings, and
it will be the fourth straight quarter in which earnings fall below
year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   There's some disagreement among analysts as to whether the
fourth quarter will mark the end of Coca-Cola's grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts view this as a two-quarter problem,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder &AMP; Co. beverage analyst Caroline Levy told CNBC on
Friday that an earnings recovery will take six to nine months. She
said the company's problems are not limited to Europe, and local
competitors in several countries are eating into Coca-Cola's market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities analyst George E. Thompson said the
company ``has a long way to go,'' but that an estimate of how long
``is difficult to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears in certain instances that the worst is over and
things are back to normal, but there are other places, such as
Germany, where that is not the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Thompson did not downgrade his ``strong buy'' rating on
Coca-Cola's shares, saying the company is a ``basic long-term''
value.
</P>
<P>
   In its press release, Coca-Cola said it expects to report
per-share earnings ``in the range of 34 cents to 35 cents'' in the
October quarter. That excludes the impact of the European product
recall, which the company estimated would reduce earnings for the
quarter by 2 cents to 3 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned 36 cents a share in the third quarter of
1998. The results included a gain of 1 cent per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company did have some good news: Unit case volume increased
in the third quarter, reversing two previous down quarters, thanks
to the addition of brands acquired during the quarter from Cadbury
Schweppes PLC.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement, Coca-Cola said it expects North American
unit case volume to increase 2 percent to 3 percent during the
third quarter. It would only say that, worldwide, the unit case
volume increased ``in the low single-digit range.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said consumer confidence in Europe is increasing, and
the company believes the confidence level is on track to return to
pre-recall levels by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it has retailored its marketing programs
in Europe ``to reconnect the brands with consumers,'' with
additional marketing programs during the rest of the year ``focused
on rebuilding the trust of our loyal customers.''
</P>
<P>
   It plans to continue heavy marketing efforts to win back
customers inBelgium, France and Poland, countries where it was
forced to withdraw products because of the health scare.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said it is ``encouraged'' by the current pricing
trends in North America and expects higher retail prices to support
its long-term growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that bottlers for
Coca-Cola and rival Pepsico have been raising soft drink prices
this year in a bid to improve thin operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's problems this year were marked by the June recalls,
difficulties completing acquisitions, a European Union
investigation of merchandising practices and a class-action racial
discrimination suit.

 &HT;    Yahoo! site on Web offering CheckFree bill-paying service
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo!'s bill-paying Web site, powered by CheckFree,
is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which is expected to be officially announced
Wednesday, makes CheckFree's payment processing service available
to Yahoo!'s monthly visitors at bills.secure.yahoo.com/bps.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Yahoo! and CheckFree declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! is one of the Web's most popular sites, attracting about
32 million visitors per month, according to Media Metrix, a Web
measurement firm.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree processes payments for about 3 million customers. It
expects to add 2 million in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, a million will come from regular customers, which
include utility, cable television and phone companies. The other
million will come from new Internet sources, which include Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   The service will be free to users for the first three months and
then offered under two plans. A monthly charge of $7 gives a user
the ability to pay up to 25 bills. For $2, a user can pay as many
bills as necessary per month at 40 cents per payment.
</P>
<P>
   Users will be able to make payments to anyone in the United
States who bills them, but they won't be able to make state and
federal tax payments or court-ordered payments. The service would
deduct money, as requested, from the user's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``For consumers, I think this is big news,'' said Avivah Litan,
an analyst with Gartner Group. ``This could potentially be popular
to 90 percent of the U.S. population.'' Few industry observers
question whether the Internet will be a place where people will get
and pay their bills. The real question is which sites they will
use. Will they choose sites like Yahoo!, or go to an individual
biller's Web site or to their bank's?
</P>
<P>
   Litan said market research is showing that people, at least ones
new to the idea of online bill-paying, are starting to trust
portals as much as banks.
</P>
<P>
   Litan said America Online is expected to offer a similar
service, also backed by CheckFree, to its 17 million subscribers by
year's end.

 TERRY McAULIFFE: MASTER FUND-RAISER IS ALSO CLINTON'S PERSONAL(With sidebar, CLINTONS-HOUSE-DEAL) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is a competition for first friend, Terry
McAuliffe would seem to be setting a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Charming, energetic, irreverent and equally skilled at raising
money and making it, McAuliffe has proven to be a life saver, both
politically and personally, for President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in coming to the aid of the Clintons this week by agreeing
to put up $1.35 million of his own money, in cash, to help them
with their purchase of a $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
McAuliffe put himself in an especially remarkable position:
personal financial benefactor to the most powerful man in the land
in an era when connections and access to powerful people are more
lucrative than ever. The Democratic National Committee had its most
successful event earlier in June in a tribute to a McAuliffe, which
raised $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who has grown wealthy from 20 years at the nexus of
business investments and political fund raising, will put $1.35
million into an interest-bearing account at Bankers Trust in New
York to provide rock-solid assurance to the bank that its $1.35
million mortgage loan to the Clintons, who have $5.5 million in
legal debt, will be secure.
</P>
<P>
   Though the deal probably could have been structured some other
way, McAuliffe's involvement clearly helped the Clintons get the
house at a more favorable interest rate. Still, the White House
said Friday that McAuliffe's money did not constitute a gift under
government ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the real estate deal, McAuliffe's efforts on behalf
of the Clintons have been on an exceptional scale. He has solicited
millions of dollars in donations for their legal defense fund, the
president's planned library in Arkansas, the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, Mrs. Clinton's likely run for the Senate and their
planned gala on the Washington Mall to mark the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly helps the president _ ``the Big Guy'' to him _
relax or blow off steam with a golf game, a glass of wine or guy
talk. And he never objects when Clinton bends the rules on the golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has grown in prominence in Washington and in
Democratic circles around the country, McAuliffe has encountered
persistent questions about the ways he has used his connections and
visibility in the business world, forcing him to fend off legal and
ethical questions that have only intensified since Thursday with
the announcement of his role in the Clintons' purchase of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is increasingly held up by critics of the
current campaign finance system as the embodiment of a class of
Washingtonians who mix politics and money, public service and
personal opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably no one has more and longer tentacles into the worlds
of money and politics than Terry McAuliffe,'' said Ellen Miller,
executive director of Public Campaign, an organization promoting
changes to the campaign finance system. ``It's an unhealthy
relationship for anyone to have to the president and first lady. In
a way, he has incredible power over them and incredible power
through them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has always defended his conduct as legal and ethical.
He has chalked up the criticism as part of the rough and tumble of
big-league politics and says he raises money for the president
because he likes him and expects nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could he do for me?'' McAuliffe asked in a recent
interview about Clinton, suggesting he has everything he needs. He
said he does not lobby the president and knows little about
legislation. ``I don't know how to get a bill through Congress,''
he said. ``I couldn't name you 20 members.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been called to testify or provide information in
a range of criminal, civil and congressional investigations, he has
never been the target or subject of any criminal inquiry and has
always cooperated fully, said his lawyer, Richard Ben Veniste, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe has never been shy about his relationship with the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, he helped sponsor a fund-raiser for Mrs.
Clinton's expected Senate campaign at Mulrooney's Bar in his native
Syracuse, N.Y. He told the crowd of 400 people crammed in that he
had ``no closer friends than the president and the first lady.'' No
one doubted him. The goal for the evening was $25,000. McAuliffe,
who packed the place with friends and family, pulled in $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event was as much a celebration of McAuliffe as it was a
fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At age 42, McAuliffe, who got his start in national politics
raising money for President Jimmy Carter's unsuccessful 1980
re-election campaign, is perceived among Democrats as the man with
the Midas touch. His favors are sought by many and granted to few.
Vice President Al Gore, who has so far failed to woo him to his
presidential campaign, has called him ``the greatest fund-raiser in
the history of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Richard McAuliffe was born in Syracuse in 1957, the son
of a real estate agent. Terry, as he is known, was the youngest in
an Irish Catholic family of four boys, an experience that friends
say helped him form his exuberance for the rough-and-tumble world
of politics and his fierce sense of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Of his support for Clinton throughout the impeachment scandals,
McAuliffe once said: ``I won't desert him. I'll stick with him
through thick and thin. That's an Irish trait.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He attended Catholic University in Washington, graduating in
1979 with a major in political science. In 1984, he graduated from
Georgetown Law School but never practiced law. He had already
become something of a wunderkind in the world of political fund
raising, working closely with Richard Swann, Carter's Florida
chairman. In 1988, McAuliffe married Swann's daughter, Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   The best man at his wedding was Tony Coelho, who is now running
Gore's campaign for president. For a while, it looked as though
Gore might be challenged by another McAuliffe pal, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, who was an usher at McAuliffe's wedding and gave the
McAuliffe children a surprise of a golden retriever puppy for
Christmas three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though Gephardt has declined to run for president,
McAuliffe has told friends he is too overextended to answer Gore's
plea to spearhead fund raising at the Democratic National
Committee, although he plans to help Gore raise money next year.
McAuliffe and his wife, who live in McLean, Va., are expecting
their fourth child in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton is 10 years older than McAuliffe, they have
become extremely close. The president often drapes his arm around
McAuliffe and seeks him out in a crowd. ``He feels comfortable with
Terry,'' said Doug Sosnick, a senior adviser to the president. ``He
doesn't feel like Terry wants anything from him. There's a level of
trust there, and when you're president, it's hard to know who you
can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly how wealthy McAuliffe is. Most of his
business dealings in the past few years have been in home building
and real estate, though he has told associates of profiting
handsomely from investments in technology companies. .

NEWS ANALYSIS: FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT BETWEEN ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As important as any concrete agreements reached
Friday between Israel and the Palestinians is what the success in
negotiating them portends for the future.
</P>
<P>
   To many Israelis and Palestinians watching from the outside, as
the talks appeared to be deadlocked this week, it did not seem to
be the dawn of the new peacemaking era that Ehud Barak, the prime
minister of Israel, had promised.
</P>
<P>
   It looked to many just like the old ultimatums, recriminations
and obstructionism at work. It looked like a replay of the era of
Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister who inherited the
peace process and begrudgingly pushed it forward.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing made senior Israeli officials more incensed this
week than even a whispered comparison to the Netanyahu days. For
they knew as did all the parties involved _ Israeli, Palestinian,
American and Egyptian _ that the dynamic had altered significantly.
They knew, as did the others, that there would be a deal in a
matter of days, once the standard 11th-hour crisis was behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew that the moment was ripe: Barak's aggressive
desire to make peace in a big, regional way was matched by the
equally keen determination of Yasser Arafat, who is 70 and suffers
health problems, to proceed speedily toward a final, fixed and
lasting peace deal with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Even before an agreement was reached Friday night to revive the
frozen peace effort, a senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat,
had acknowledged that the dynamics of the dialogue had changed for
the positive. It was not only that he and Gilad Sher, the Israeli
negotiator, met publicly and as equals.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the first time in a long time, he said, he was able to
put himself in the shoes of the Israelis and see things through
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is almost as significant an accomplishment as the
memorandum itself, which is a detailed plan to resuscitate and
carry out the Wye River agreement, negotiated in Maryland last
fall. For negotiating the plan was the first test of whether a new
rapport could be established between the new Israeli government and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Without the new rapport that enabled this deal, the ambitious
task ahead of forging a permanent peace within a year would seem
laughable. If either side had allowed a disagreement over the
release of 50 prisoners _ which was this week's final sticking
point _ to scotch the deal, then it would have boded ill for their
ability to come to terms over such looming and complex issues as
Jerusalem and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis' self-imposed deadline of reaching a deal before
the arrival of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright midweek did
somewhat backfire on them.
</P>
<P>
   It created an artificial sense of failure when it took just a
few days longer than anticipated _ and the eyes of the world media
were chronicling every facet of the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   And it lent the impression that Albright was indeed needed to
nudge the parties into agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak had wanted to deliver an agreement as a present to the
American secretary of state, whose Mideast peace team had
officiated so many Israeli-Palestinian meetings during the
Netanyahu years that they became minor celebrities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And the Palestinians knew that their window of opportunity could
close; Albright was scheduled to travel on Saturday to Damascus to
work on reopening Israeli-Syrian negotiations and they didn't want
their conflict to move to the back burner of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was also determined to restore the Israeli-Palestinian
relationship to a bilateral one, and he did make strides in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The modified Wye agreement apparently struck both sides as a
better document than the American-brokered original.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear when Barak's negotiating weapon _ a threat to
carry out the original as written _ worked. Arafat must have
believed in the end that the new agreement was a better deal for
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the prisoners, for instance, Arafat accepted the
Israelis' final offer to release no more than 356 security
prisoners _ rather than the 400 the Palestinians demanded _ because
it was a better deal than the Israelis' literal fulfillment of Wye
would have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Wye calls for 750 prisoners to be released. In a
verbal agreement at Wye, Netanyahu had promise that 200 of them
would be security prisoners, according to senior Israelis. Last
fall, he released 98 security prisoners; that meant the
Palestinians were owed 102 more, according to the Israelis' strict
reading of their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, 350 is better than 102, especially with the deal
sweetened by the promise of a bonus prisoner release during the
Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   This could prove disappointing to the Palestinian public; for
many, the return of their young men is almost more important than
the transfer of land. But Palestinian officials are hoping that
they will be mollified by the many immediate rewards from the
revived peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday night, Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian
official who is usually reserved about the benefits of the peace
process, sounded almost ebullient about what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A first batch of political prisoners will be released
immediately, and a first withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank will start right away, too. Preparations to open a seaport in
Gaza and a safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank are
also supposed to get underway in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, formal negotiations for a final status
agreement will begin. Israelis, who originally want to set a
deadline of December 2000, finally agreed that September 2000 would
be the target date for a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have guaranteed, in a side letter of assurances,
that the Israelis will not withhold what they have promised if the
final status negotiations do not go well, Shaath said Friday night.
There will be no link made, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to withdraw from an additional 11 percent of the West
Bank, the Israelis will split their land transfers into three
stages. After the first immediate pullback, the next one will take
place in October and the third in February. A senior Israeli
negotiator said that the maps prepared by the Netanyahu government
had been redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu government's plan, under Wye, to turn over 2
percent of the Judean Desert to the Palestinians _ to be set aside
as a nature reserve _ has been discarded. Barak thinks it would
create a security risk. He instead told the Palestinians that they
would receive a chunk of the West Bank contiguous with their other
land, ``a higher quality area,'' the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, Barak threatened to end the negotiations if the
Palestinians didn't accept the Israelis' offers. Many Palestinians
cringed.
</P>
<P>
   The issuance of ultimatums was a throwback to the Netanyahu era.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the unexpected, underscoring a real change: Barak
reportedly called Arafat and apologized for his threatening tone.

FRENCH SUMMIT IN MONCTON? IT'S A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Makes it Robert Monckton)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONCTON, New Brunswick _ For the record, this is a nice, small
city inhabited by 100,000 or so very nice people. What gritty
Moncton lacks in urbanity, beauty, or _ rather critically for this
occasion _ French ambiance, is counterbalanced by the friendliness
of local folk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question is unavoidable: What on earth was Canada
thinking when it decided to host a summit, beginning Saturday, of
French-speaking nations in this barely-a-city where not quite a
third of those friendly folk speak a word of French?
</P>
<P>
   A place, for that matter, named after an 18th-century English
military commander, Robert Monckton, infamous for his role in a
brutal 1755 campaign to drive French settlers, called Acadians,
from their homes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But that unfortunate bit of history ranks only about midway on
the list of gripes and controversies swirling around the Moncton
summit _ somewhere between the complaints about brown tap water and
the uproar over modern-day war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, prime ministers, and other delegates from 52
ostensibly French-speaking countries arrived Friday for the eighth
biannual summit of l'Agence de la Francophonie, a sort of French
league allied by language, which the Globe and Mail newspaper
described this week as ``of short history, vague goals, and a
dubious membership.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monctonians are fretting that protests by human rights
groups might turn the summit into a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   For along with an array of perfectly upright nations, la
Francophonie embraces a fair number of member states with appalling
human rights records, such as Burundi and Rwanda _ scene of some of
this decade's bloodiest massacres _ along with the thuggish regimes
of Togo, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 28 members of the French league have been censured by
Amnesty International for abuses ranging from the muzzling of
dissidents to murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights watchdogs have blasted Canada for rolling out the
red carpet for some of the visitors. But Ottawa says there's
nothing to be done, since none of the delegates attending the
summit are officially indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these countries are here does not mean we agree
personally with every head of state or government,'' said Don
Boudria, Canada's political representative at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Summit organizers, meanwhile, say they are getting fed up with
all the carping about human rights; not to mention the complaints
about Moncton itself, which critics have described as too small and
too English for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Moncton's defenders note that the town boasts the Universite de
Moncton, Canada's largest French-language university outside
Quebec. And 30,000 or so of Moncton's inhabitants do speak French.
Anyway, English-flavored or not, the town is the only big center in
the vicinity of New Brunswick's Acadian region, where French is the
first tongue for about 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this accenting of the negative,'' said
Fernand Landry, the Canadian director-general of the summit. ``This
is all very marginal compared to the significance of the summit.
This is a historic event. Very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, nobody seems able to explain exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   La Francophonie was founded in 1986 as a sort of French answer
to the Commonwealth, the economic alliance of Britain and its
former colonies. in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   So far, la Francophonie seems an unwieldy and costly exercise
that has done little to accomplish its stated goals of ``building
democracy'' and ``guarding French language and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those messy dictatorships, some Francophonie members
have no significant French-speaking communities or historic
connection to France: Bulgaria is a member in good standing, as are
Romania, the former Soviet republic of Moldova, Egypt, and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The last is at least a former French colony, although English
ranks as the ``second language,'' after Vietnamese, and French has
scarcely been heard for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Albania, Macedonia, and Poland are waiting in the
wings for membership. A cynic might suggest that poorer countries
are only too aware that wealthy France is most likely to loosen its
foreign-aid purse strings to countries showing enthusiasm for
things French.
</P>
<P>
   Another unlikely member is the tiny African archipelago nation
of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony inhabited by 400,000
people, of whom perhaps 500 speak French.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the French teachers, of course, and maybe some
French people who came for our beaches and stayed,'' said a Cape
Verdean official. ``But we admire France very much. And every human
must be loving French wine . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The champagne, chardonnay, and cabernet sauvignon will surely be
flowing like water in Moncton. Which is more than can be said for
the water itself; the stufffrom town taps recently turned an
ominous brown. Rust, maybe. Maybe worse. There is debate about
whether it's safe to drink. On the bright side, local sellers of
bottled water seem destined for a boom _ if supplies last.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4,000 delegates and 450 journalists are expected to
turn out. The Canadian government is popping for most of the bill _
$8.2 million for hotel rooms, booze, limos, and the like, plus
another $8 million for security.
</P>
<P>
   That security will be some of the tightest ever seen in Canada,
with at least 1,500 officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
bracing with Moncton police for any eventuality. ``Whenever there's
this many heads of state, there is a risk that terrorists might
grab the opportunity to put their plight on the world stage,'' said
Mounted Police Sergeant Andre Guertin.
</P>
<P>
   Down on Main Street, whose freshly-painted corner signs read
``Rue Main,'' Moncton's inhabitants are savoring their moment in
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tourists, sure, but not many presidents and prime
ministers stop by, especially not from Africa,'' said Veronica
MacDonald, a telephone sales manager. ``People are just thrilled
Moncton is finally getting recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of New Brunswick isn't too hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec, whose official language is French, hosted an earlier
summit of la Francophonie, and New Brunswick is the only other
Canadian province with a substantial population of French speakers.
It is the only officially bilingual province in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Moncton was a tougher call.
</P>
<P>
   Although the former railroad center lies on the edge of New
Brunswick's French-Acadian region, it doesn't boast much French
character, with the notable exception of the Universite de Moncton,
a prominent French-language university.
</P>
<P>
   The main local landmark is a 413-foot, steel-and-concrete
telecommunications tower. And Moncton's only real tourist
attraction is the tidal bore _ a twice-daily surge of water up the
Petitcodiac River from the Bay of Fundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Moncton won't remind anyone of Paris or Quebec City, but
the university does make us a French center, and the summit should
help our image as a place of French culture,'' said George Wybouw,
dean of the faculty of administration at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real reaching out between the two communities,
French and English, in New Brunswick. And that is a positive thing
in a country where the two sides seldom meet.''

SWISS INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE LAUNDERING OF RUSSIAN MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: the 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET)

<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss prosecutors probing into suspected
money-laundering by officials at high levels of the Russian
government have ordered Swiss banks to provide information about
two dozen Russians who may have accounts in Switzerland and have
frozen at least 59 bank accounts over the past two months,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians under investigation include Pavel Borodin, the
powerful head of the Russian president's property management team,
as well as his wife, daughter and son-in-law, and Oleg Soskovets, a
former deputy prime minister heavily involved in the military
industry and arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss investigation was opened in response to requests made
last spring by Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, who was
subsequently fired by President Boris Yeltsin but technically
remains in office because the Russian parliament rejected his
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The probe continued after Skuratov's removal, but until now
little has been known about Swiss participation.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of a list of names Friday and the announcement
that many accounts had been frozen _ a stunning number by Swiss
standards _ were the first indication of the scope of the Swiss
involvement. The timing seemed at least in part related to widely
publicized reports that huge sums of Russian money had moved
through the Bank of New York and the attendant renewed focus on
corruption in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   No link has been established between the Swiss and U.S.
investigations, although the investigating magistrate in Geneva who
released the 24 Russian names, Daniel Devaud, said that
``possibly'' a link would emerge but that it was ``too soon to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a separate investigation could begin examining
Geneva-based companies connected with the Bank of New York, most
notably Valmet S.A., a financial advisory service whose Geneva
offices also house a Russian-controlled company, Runicom SA, which
investigators suspect may have been involved in money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has said it is cooperating with a U.S.
investigation into a possible money laundering scheme at the bank
involving Russian money. It has declined any other comments.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the list, which appeared Friday in a Geneva
newspaper and in Corriere della Serra, Italy's leading newspaper,
caps a week in which a Russian investigator came to Switzerland to
press the Russian corruption case and meet with the Swiss
prosecutor general, Carla del Ponte. Mrs. del Ponte questioned
several people thought to be involved in Russian money laundering
and corruption this week, including a former employee of a Swiss
building contractor that has been at the center of an inquiry into
kickbacks allegedly pocketed by top Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte will leave her job later this month to become
chief justice of the International War Crimes Tribunal at the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Mrs. del Ponte's office began ordering Swiss banks o
freeze accounts in an investigation of Swiss companies that did
business with the Kremlin or with Russian companies including
Aeroflot, the airline, and Avtovaz, the auto maker.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and Swiss government officials said that since July, at
least 59 accounts, and possibly more, have been frozen at Swiss
banks in connection with that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the action are accounts held by Mabatex Project
Engineering, a Lugano construction firm that recently refurbished
part of the Kremlin, and two companies in Lausanne, Andava S.A. and
Forus S.A., which are involved in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The two Lausanne companies have ties to the powerful Russian
financier, Boris Berezovsky, who is part of Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures here have been an embarrassment for Yeltsin, who
clearly gave his consent to fire the general prosecutor earlier
this year. Various Yeltsin enemies have made accusations, so far
unproven, that the president's daughters, Yelena Okulova and
Tatyana Dyachenko, had received kickbacks and other payments.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has denied that Yeltsin and his family ever had
foreign bank accounts. Borodin also said that he had never held an
account in Switzerland. Oleg Soskovets, the former deputy prime
minister, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no charges have been filed against any Kremlin officials
or others involved in the investigation. But several companies in
Switzerland have been crippled by the inquiry because of the frozen
accounts and business records confiscated by Swiss authorities in
raids earlier this year.

CLINTONS' HOME PURCHASE INVOLVES UNUSUAL FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with CLINTON-MCAULIFFE) 
(Repeating; also moved in `a' category) 
(bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The package that the cash-strapped first family
will use to buy a $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is a
clever and unusual piece of financial engineering designed to avoid
various tax and other pitfalls, real estate and financial
specialists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Terry McAuliffe, the president's chief
political fund-raiser, to personally supply $1.35 million in
collateral that the lender, Bankers Trust Private Banking, could
seize should the Clintons fail to make payments on a house costing
more than three times what a presidential salary could support.
</P>
<P>
   Some private analysts said they were struck by what a good deal
it appeared to be for the Clintons _ even though the bank itself,
with whom three Clinton administration aides or friends have had
ties, seemed to have not been particularly generous.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bankers Trust, which was acquired in June by
Deutsche Bank, would not want to have to explain to examiners an
ostensively uneconomic loan to a couple with negative net worth
because of $5.5 million in legal debts, a sum that far exceeds
their assets of about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be content to use only the house itself for
collateral because of the public black eye it would certainly
suffer in the unlikely, but imaginable, event it should ever have
to foreclose.
</P>
<P>
   And while some people initially raised their eyebrows at the
seemingly low interest rate, which was calculated at 6.52 percent,
they agreed that while this would have been a concession for a
conventional 30-year mortgage, it was about the going rate for the
first phase of a five-year loan adjustable every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In providing additional details Friday, the White House said
McAuliffe's $1.35 million in collateral would consist of cash,
rather than what some had presumed would be Treasury securities,
and that he rather than the Clintons would receive the interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are to supply $350,000 for the down payment, drawn
from their blind trust, an amount just above the 20 percent of
purchase-price minimum that excuses the couple from paying many
hundreds of dollars a month in mortgage insurance to protect the
lender. The Clintons will be making their own monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also called the mortgage an existing bank
product, not something invented for them. Many major banks have
special units, like Bankers Trust Private Banking, that cater to
the carriage trade and often accommodate special situations like
that of the Clintons, who have considerable income potential after
they leave the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Friday, a spokesman said, whether the Clintons
will make a copy of the contract publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Although political opponents and others may contend that
something of economic value, the use of McAuliffe's cash
collateral, is being conferred on the Clintons, tax specialists
said they doubted this would result in taxable income unless it
were to be taken to pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent nature of the money's deployment, the White House
said, also exempts it from government disclosure rules, the White
House said, declaring that the Office of Government Ethics agreed
with its position.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be immediately learned whether any of the
president's former aides or Vernon Jordan, a close friend, played
any role in the setting up the transaction. Jordan is a former
Bankers Trust director.
</P>
<P>
   The current vice chairman, Eugene Ludwig, served as Comptroller
of the Currency. And Frank Newman, who was deputy Treasury
secretary, became chief executive of Bankers Trust after leaving
Washington. Newman oversaw the sale of the bank to Deutsche Bank
and retired this year with a $100 million severance package.
</P>
<P>
   At least one group came forward on a pre-holiday Friday to
denounce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the president of the United States and someone is doing a
million-dollar favor to him to help him with his personal financial
needs,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a policy
body seeking campaign-finance and other political reforms. ``That
creates an appearance problem, a potential conflict problem, and
it's a dangerous kind of act.''

 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday that she
was determined to uncover the truth behind previously undisclosed
FBI audio recordings that clearly show how agents fired combustible
tear gas rounds during the disastrous 1993 assault on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference, a resolute-sounding Reno, swept
up once again in a furious law-enforcement debate, said that she
would demand the facts to determine whether the FBI contributed to
the deadly fire or the deaths of about 80 people inside the
cultists' compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dig at it until you get it right, and you get people
telling you what actually happened,'' Reno said. ``You don't run
away from it. You don't say, `Oh, me. I can't handle this.' You
keep at it till you get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At her news conference, Reno declined to announce her selection
to conduct what she has said will be an independent inquiry into
the events at Waco. But other government officials said that Reno
and her aides have focused on former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri
Republican who has told Justice Department officials that he would
accept the appointment. For their part, Justice Department
officials say they have not decided whether to offer it to him.
</P>
<P>
   As currently envisioned, the officials said, the inquiry is
likely to be organized as an administrative inquiry rather than a
criminal investigation, but the precise legal authority, scope and
structure of the inquiry has not been defined. It will almost
certainly use agents from outside the FBI to underscore the
independence of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she would choose someone who is free of ``conflicts of
interest and will be well-received'' as the head of an independent
investigation into the operation. ``What I hope will happen is that
we will be able to agree on a mandate that gives them full
authority to pursue any unanswered question,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a welter of questions, Reno _ who has taken responsibility
for the government's actions in Waco, but has blamed Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and other cultists for starting the
fire _ said that she still believed the evidence pointed to him.
But she expressed her willingness to reexamine any relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what every piece of information I have seen
clearly shows,'' Reno said of her conclusion about Koresh's
culpability. ``And it is important, again, to put it in
perspective. But it is also important that we pursue any confusion,
any question, in order to provide the American people with the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno decided to renew long-closed inquiries into the Waco
assault, after the attorney general, who has often found herself in
the crosshairs of controversy, suffered some of the most bruising
attacks of her tenure. In recent days, law enforcement critics and
Republicans in Congress have assailed her, saying that she misled
them about the use of military style inflammable tear gas devices.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would resign, Reno said she would accept any
outcome that resulted from the inquiry. ``I'm going to pursue the
truth,'' she said. ``If the truth shows that I've done something
wrong, then I will accept the consequences. If the truth shows what
I believe to be the case, that we tried to set up something that
would bring the people out, give them a chance to come out in a
safe and orderly way, and that it was their determination and their
judgment and their action that brought that fire upon them, then I
must use the experiences that we have here and figure out what we
can do for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno's credibility took another blow when FBI
officials disclosed that they had discovered in their files a tape
of radio voice communications in which agents at the scene sought
and obtained approval from their superiors to fire the
military-style tear-gas rounds at the bunker. On Thursday, FBI
officials said that they had found a second tape of additional
voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   The second tape, which was released Friday by the FBI, contained
conversations between an agent and his commander over the use of
military gas. Like the first tape, which was released on Thursday,
FBI officials said, the second recording supports the government's
account that the military tear gas canister bounced off a bunker
near the compound but was not responsible for the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first tape, the voices were recorded on audio tracks of
infrared tape that picked up conversations between Richard Rogers,
the commander in charge of the Hostage Rescue Team, and
unidentified agents who were near the compound inside armored
vehicles. The second tape encompassed a period from 8 a.m. on the
day of the assault, April 19, 1993, to 9:30 a.m., a time frame in
which the FBI has previously said no videotape existed.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in the armored vehicle said, ``Yeah, the military gas
did not penetrate that, uh, bunker where the bus.'' After a pause
the agent added, ``It bounced off.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno reacted angrily to the disclosure that the FBI had
uncovered the tapes, which FBI officials said had been stored for
more than six years at the agency's training academy in Quantico,
Va., at the offices of the Hostage Rescue Team, the unit that
carried out the assault on the compound. When she learned of the
tapes, Reno ordered agents of the U.S. Marshal's Service to the
FBI's headquarters to seize the material for safe-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Reno said that her action was not meant as a rebuke to
the FBI, although some of her associates said at the time that she
was fully aware that the step would be perceived as gesture of no
confidence in the FBI. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure
out what the best way to do it was, and some people making some
assumptions that weren't correct,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Department and FBI officials have said that
interactions between the two agencies have been increasingly tense
and strained, Reno said that her dealings with FBI Director Louis
Freeh remained positive and that their relationship was ``one of
the best relationships that people can have in law enforcement,''
although she acknowledged that she sometimes disagreed with Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an FBI director and an attorney general who can
discuss matters, disagree on some things, as we have, agree on most
everything in a principled way, I think that's what we should be
about, and that's what I think I have with Louis Freeh,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a federal judge has ordered the
Justice Department to turn over all evidence from the FBI raid as
necessary in a wrongful death suit filed by survivors and family of
the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Walter Smith, in Waco, dismissed the Justice Department's
argument that gathering, copying and transferring the evidence
would be ``an unwarranted and substantial burden.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Smith expressed hope that gathering the evidence
in one place would deflect suspicions of ``a massive cover-up.''
The Justice Department is considering an appeal of the order.

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel and the Palestinians, prodded by the presence
of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, agreed Friday night to a
sweeping peace deal which envisions finalizing the borders between
them and resolving the future of Jerusalem in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night by Albright, who spoke with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, at her side at his offices in
Gaza City, also calls for the completion of a land-for-security
agreement signed last fall in Wye, Md., which had been stalled
until the coming to office of the new Israeli prime minister, Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the new agreement is a plan to negotiate
a conceptual ``framework'' for a permanent settlement between
Israel and the Palestinians by February 15, 2000 and the conclusion
of detailed talks by next September.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called on both sides to refrain from taking
unilateral action, which is understood to mean that the
Palestinians will not unilaterally declare statehood before a peace
accord is reached and that Israel will not build new Jewish
settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had repeatedly declared over the past year that if no
agreement was reached , he would declare a Palestinian state by May
2000, the date on which the original Oslo agreements were to
conclude with a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement did not explicitly describe what sort of
Palestinian entity would be established at the end of the process,
leaving that to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On the land-for-security aspects of the Wye agreement, the
Israelis agreed to cede control over another 11 percent of the West
Bank in three stages _ in September, November and by January 20 _
said a senior American official.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hurdle in the negotiations leading up to Friday's
agreement was the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released
from Israeli jails. In the end, Arafat abandoned his demand for
400, and accepted Israel's offer to release 350, a senior Israeli
official said. Israel resisted releasing Palestinians ``with
Israeli blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive display of Middle East brinkmanship in the
past several days, the agreement Friday night came after the
veteran American envoy for the Middle East, Dennis Ross, spent the
day with the Israelis working on on the language of the deal, and
after the document was taken to Arafat by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   A signing ceremony was scheduled for Saturday night, after the
end of the Jewish Sabbath, with Albright, the Egyptian president,
Hosni Murbarak, and the Palestinian and Israeli leaders at the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai seacoast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a stifling hot reception room at Arafat's
headquarters in Gaza City, with her back to a huge painting of the
Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Ms. Albright praised both sides for
working together to reach a forward looking agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have seized a historic opportunity to tackle the issues
that will define their peace together for generations to come,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the secretary of state, who spent 3 1/2 hours
with Barak in the small hours of Friday morning, gave the two sides
a deadline to work against, and prodded them by her presence to
overcome the last obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Barak's request that the Americans play a more
modest role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations than in the
past three years, Albright's spokesman insisted before she left
Washington for this trip that it would be only to ``take stock.''
While the two sides had done the bulk of the work in more than 15
negotiating sessions before she came with the State Department's
top team of negotiators, her presence pushed the Israelis and
Palestinians over the finish line Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the usually forceful Albright remained anxious to
stress that she was not a mediator, perhaps not even a facilitator,
but something even more lowly. ``Perhaps I should not introduce a
new term into all this, but maybe I was just the handmaiden,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night gives Albright a boost as she
travels to Syria on Saturday to meet with the Syrian leader,
Hafiz-al Assad, in an effort to persuade him to restart
negotiations with the Israelis that broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has expressed eagerness to settle with Syria but Assad's
apparent initial enthusiasm when the Israeli prime minister first
assumed office appears to have waned in recent weeks. With a
successful Israeli-Palestinian negotiation in hand, Albright will
be hoping that Assad does not want to be left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The central conflict in negotiating the modifications to the Wye
accords of last fall has been the competing longer term aim of
Barak and the shorter term goal of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, getting the transfer of West Bank land from Israeli
to Palestinian control that was pledged in the Wye agreement but
was stalled by the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, has been an essential short term goal. By accomplishing
that he can get more West Bank land and win the release of more
prisoners, Arafat can show his people that some progress has been
made in negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, the relinquishing of land _ 11 percent more of the
West Bank _ was not as enticing as getting the start of a process
that will determine the permanent relationship between Israel and
Palestinians and help shape an overall peace agreement that covers
Syria and Lebanon. The start of final status talks means dealing
with the biggest problems of all: the status of Jerusalem, the
return of refugees and the permanent boundaries of Israel in regard
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the accord finalized Friday night is the
February 15 target for a framework _ something like a declaration
of principles _ for this final status agreement. The nitty gritty
details of the framework would be completed sometime by September.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had been reluctant to set the February date, fearing that
if such a framework was agreed upon early in the new year Barak
would feel free to turn his attention away from the
Palestinian-Israeli relationship and look instead toward
negotiating with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point, apparently one of the last, was Arafat's
desire to be able to take such ``unilateral action'' as threatening
to declare a Palestinian state. He used this threat as leverage
earlier this year _ by pledging to delay the declaration of a
Palestinian state last May, Arafat won a promise from President
Clinton that he would call a summit of Middle East leaders within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, a member of Arafat's cabinet, Nabil
Shaath, the Minister of Planning, said Friday night that the
Americans had been helpful to the Palestinians on this matter in
``letters of assurance.''  &QL;

   How do your earnings measure up?
</P>
<P>
   This set of charts allows you, over the Labor Day weekend, to
compare the fruits of your labor with the fruits of others in the
same line of work, not only in your home city, but in other cities
as well. Are you a podiatrist in Chicago? Well, consider moving to
Detroit, where the average annual pay for your profession is
$94,080, considerably above the $80,020 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Such detailed data are being gathered for the first time by the
government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has expanded its
wage surveys. Instead of just telling the nation what secretaries,
for example, earn in an individual industry _ the hotel industry,
for example _ annual wage levels are now available for secretaries
across all industries and in 300 cities.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of accumulating all this data is to help the Labor
Department's Alien Labor Certification Program determine prevailing
pay for a particular occupation in a particular city. By law,
employers are required to pay at least the prevailing wage to
immigrant workers; now the government has a new tool for applying
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond keeping pay apace for immigrant workers, the detailed
data have other uses. For one, millions of Americans can now
compare their pay with the average wages for their occupation _ in
their hometowns, in other cities and regions, or across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And the expanded data are becoming available just as states and
cities are taking over programs once operated at the national
level. Welfare is one. For the first time, the wages for
low-skilled jobs _ those generally available to people shifting
from welfare to work _ will be easy to determine. The average pay
of a janitor in Kokomo, Ind. _ $29,170 _ is more than double the
amount in Wichita Falls, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to judge how people are faring as national
programs disappear,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at
the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But beware the shortcomings of the bureau's new survey. How can
it be that the highest-paid occupation in New York City is
``structural metal worker'' _ the people who erect a skyscraper's
steel framework? There is no question that great skill is required
to walk narrow girders dozens of stories up. Even so, don't
investment bankers and white-shoe lawyers earn more?
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course they do. The problem is that the bureau's survey
covers only employees who get regular paychecks, with taxes
withheld, and qualify for unemployment insurance. That eliminates a
whole army of workers, including business owners and partners (the
latter is the status of most well-paid lawyers and investment
bankers), the self-employed and day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the survey's response rate. Since 1996, the
survey has been mailed annually to 400,000 companies, and roughly
30 percent have failed to reply each year.
</P>
<P>
   For lack of enough replies from New York companies, the bureau
could not produce reliable wage estimates for salaried physicians,
lawyers, judges, top executives and securities brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The annual earnings in these charts are for 1997. The 1998
numbers will be published in December and those for 1999 in
December 2000. Meanwhile, says Douglas Himes, a bureau economist
who helps to produce the survey, one should add roughly 5 or 6
percent in raises over the last two years to bring the wages up to
date.

 Metreon Teeming With Gawkers

 &QL; 
Twelve weeks into its tenure in downtown San Francisco, is Metreon
living up to the hype?
</P>
<P>
   Sony Corp.'s shiny new techno-mall has wowed shoppers and
generated favorable press coverage in the United States and abroad.
But the $85 million question _ that's how much Sony spent building
Metreon _ is whether the buzz will translate into financial
success.
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives readily admit that there are still kinks to be
worked out at the mall, which is still in its infancy. But in
general, the early returns are positive, with foot traffic coming
in well above forecasts and revenues hitting expected levels.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bright spots is Metreon's 15-screen cinema and
large-screen IMAX theater, which has rocketed to among the nation's
top five movie complexes in terms of gross receipts, said Mike
Swinney, president of Sony Development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the four restaurants in Metreon's upscale Taste of
San Francisco food court are packed with visitors. A fifth eatery
serving Mexican  &LR;   &LR; cuisine will open in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal is riding on Metreon. The silver-gray facility,
which contains a unique mix of stores, restaurants and theme
park-style attractions, is viewed as a key ingredient to the
revitalization of the South of Market area.
</P>
<P>
   And as the first center of its kind, it is an important
bellwether for the future of such complexes, which may be the next
hot shopping format _ or just an expensive fad.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of foot traffic, Metreon is an unequivocal
success. Between 20,000 and 22,000 visitors swamp the four-story,
350,000-square-foot facility each day, an impressive 50 percent
higher than projections.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues are also healthy, but they are coming in only at
expected levels _ not higher, as the traffic levels might suggest.
Sony is sticking to its initial projection that the center will
bring in $100 million in sales of merchandise, food, movie tickets
and special-event fees in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants and Sony executives attribute the discrepancy between
foot traffic and sales to throngs of curious locals who wander in
to check out the city's latest hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the first couple of weeks, we were experiencing
high traffic of what I call the looky-loos,'' window shoppers who
have no intention of making a purchase, said Lily Kanter, business
manager for the Microsoft/SF store.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of METREON0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Still, ``given all the food and beverages and so on, I would
think that you couldn't help yourself but buy something,'' said
Alan Billingsley, a retailing specialist with the RREEF Funds, a
real-estate investment firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The looky-loo theory is supported by Metreon's ratio of Bay Area
visitors to out-of-towners, which John Macleod, a senior vice
president with Sony Development, estimates at about 60 percent on
the local side. In the long term, the mix is expected to even out
to 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's ever done anything like this before, so a lot of
people are coming in to check it out,'' said Sony's Swinney. ``Not
a lot of people are walking in to buy 50-inch televisions, but
that'll come at Christmastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mali Forssatt, a tax analyst who works just two blocks from
Metreon, is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing good things about Metreon from friends, Forssatt
stopped by for the first time this week and spent $6 on lunch. But
she plans to come back soon after work to see movies and shop at
the Sony and Microsoft stores. ``I will take the whole tour,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartening news for Sony is that shopper polls rank
Metreon a ``9'' experience on a scale of 1 to 10. And local
visitors surveyed said they plan to return an average of seven
times in the coming year, said MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   That's not an unrealistic number, particularly since the
center's cinema complex will attract a lot of repeat visitors, said
consultant Pat Esgate, who specializes in entertainment-oriented
retail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sony and its tenants are busy tinkering with
Metreon's design, technology, pricing and merchant mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are a bit bored by ``The Way Things Work,'' an
attraction based on a series of children's science books by David
Macaulay. The exhibit features a talking robot, a film of Macauley
and his cartoon creations, and exhibits of gears and pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is working on a deal for San Francisco's Exploratorium to
develop interactive exhibits on topics such as how an auto
transmission works. ``People were saying, `We wish there was
something more to do,''' Swinney said.
</P>
<P>
   The center has also begun giving visitors full-day privileges to
its Where the Wild Things Are funhouse attraction, based on a book
by Maurice Sendak. Previously, the steep $7 ticket price ($5 for
children) allowed just one visit. (``Price was not the issue,''
said MacLeod. ``People just wanted to be able to go in and out.'')
</P>
<P>
   Among all of Metreon's attractions, its first-floor Marketplace,
featuring booths by local artisans, ``needs the most work,'' said
Swinney. ``People are walking right past them. We'll move them
around a little bit and create some road bumps and keep working on
the mix of who's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Metreon was riddled with technological glitches when it first
opened, but most of them seem to have been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft store ``had nothing but problems in the first
three to four weeks'' because the company didn't have adequate time
to set up and test the computers, digital cameras and other
products on display before it opened, said Kanter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the store's network problems have been solved and
``we've been running smoothly for about six weeks now,'' Kanter
said. Sales are on plan and visitors seem to be enjoying the
high-tech toys. For example, more than 1,600 visitors per day are
sending e-mail ``postcards'' of themselves from the store, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic about the traffic and the use of the devices,''
Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Signage is another area that needs improvement in the center.
The entrance to the upscale Montage restaurant, for example, is
hidden behind a curved wall, making it difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   Although the restaurant has received positive reviews in both
the local and national press, ``our biggest struggle right now is
with visibility and signage,'' said Dave Hoemann, regional director
of operations for Levy Restaurants, which owns Montage. Still,
total revenues are in line with forecasts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Metreon's weak spots are counterbalanced by its raging
successes, said Swinney. The Airtight Garage, a gaming arcade in a
science fiction setting, is ``going through the roof,'' he said.
Groups of visitors are plunking down $60 to $100 an hour to reserve
lanes at Airtight's Hyperbowl game, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Communications is pleased with sales at its
first-floor Discovery Channel store, which are coming in well ahead
of projections, said Linda Mariano, marketing director for
Discovery Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, Metreon ``is probably on the right on track for
where they want to be,'' said Esgate, with Esgate &AMP; Associates in
Nyack, N.Y. She expects Metreon, if it is ultimately successful, to
jump start similar projects by other entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of an urban entertainment center has been kind of a
holy grail in the industry for the last several years, and a lot of
people are looking at Metreon to see how it does,'' Esgate said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, executives from virtually every entertainment company
have come through Metreon since its opening, including scouts from
Disney and Time-Warner, MacLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong, visited twice
during a recent vacation, MacLeod said. Hong Kong will soon be home
to a Disney amusement park, and ``he's looking to bring more theme
ideas to Hong Kong,'' MacLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sony is already scouting sites for Metreons in
Chicago and Washington, D.C. Similar Sony attractions are opening
in Berlin and Tokyo in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Metreon concept is viable in the long term remains
to be seen. While its early run seems promising, several
much-ballyhooed retail and entertainment hybrids, such as the
Rainforest Cafe and Planet Hollywood chains, met with initial
success but fizzled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Metreon ``seems unique enough that it could have some legs for a
while,'' said Esgate. ``But God, who knows.''

TIMES MIRROR TO SELL UNDERPERFORMING UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times Mirror Co. announced plans Friday to sell its
underperforming assets, including its professional training
company, its health information company and its software
development subsidiary. The move would further whittle away those
portions of the company not directly related to the business of
newspaper and magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also putting The Sporting News on the block,
hoping that the country's oldest sporting magazine, which a company
official says has been sporadically profitable at best, will find a
buyer with broadcast interests and the ability to promote and
underwrite the magazine and its Web site, as Disney Co. has done
with its highly successful ESPN magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror also announced that it was buying back 17 percent,
or 12.4 million shares, of its 70 million outstanding common
shares, from the trusts set up by the company's founding family,
the Chandlers.
</P>
<P>
   The complex transaction, which mirrors a 1997 arrangement
designed to minimize the sale's tax consequences for Chandler
family members, created TMCT, a limited liability company with
$2.67 billion in assets to invest, half of the assets contributed
by the family trusts and half by Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect of the actions, in the view of analysts and
company officials, was to further raise the profile of the
company's core newspaper business, which has been the centerpiece
of the corporate strategy put forth by the chairman and chief
executive, Mark H. Willes. ``We clearly have more eggs in that
basket now,'' Willes said in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects our growing confidence that we can in fact grow
the newspaper business,'' he added. Since joining Times Mirror four
years ago, Willes has set high goals for circulation and revenue
growth at The Los Angeles Times, the company's flagship newspaper,
and other properties like Newsday and The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street initially greeted Willes' vision and his early
cost-cutting with great enthusiasm, but that enthusiasm waned as
revenue at the flagship Los Angeles Times fell below expectations
in 1998. Since spring, advertising revenue growth at The Times
improved markedly over 1998 levels and the price of Times Mirror
stock reached $63 5/16, its 52-week high, on April 20 before
falling back.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, bullish on several newspaper stocks, clearly welcomed
the Times Mirror announcement on Friday; shares of the company
closed at $61.50, up $3.875, though still below its April high.
</P>
<P>
   As Lauren Rich Fine, a newspaper analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
explained, ``People do obviously like share repurchases. The sale
of some of these properties was probably somewhat expected _ so the
reaction was favorable.'' It was especially so, she said, because
the training and health information businesses, ``have commanded
huge premiums in the past.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company's dividend obligations on its preferred
shares were cut by about 63 percent, from $21.7 million to $8.1
million, by the transaction with the Chandlers, which puts 80
percent of the Chandlers' preferred shares in the new company. At
the same time, the amount of voting stock controlled by the
Chandler trust will be reduced from about 73 percent to about 65
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., said,
``Generally, it's a very good thing that they're clearing the
decks, taking three pretty dramatic steps all at once. I think the
stock is going to continue to rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Unterman, 54, the company's chief financial officer, who
has directed its strategic planning and venture capital program,
will step down from that post at the end of the year to become a
principal of the general partner of TMCT Ventures, the
venture-capital arm of the new company, which will have up to $500
million to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said in a telephone interview that the transactions serve
the Chandler family's need for a broad-based investment portfolio.
``As we narrow the kind of opportunities we're involved in, they
need to diversify. This gives them a way to do it.'' He also said
he will look for Unterman's replacement both within the current
executive ranks and outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   With the training company, Achieve Global; the health
information company, StayWell; and Allen Communication, an
interactive software company, ready for sale, the major non-print
asset that remains is the Jeppesen Sanderson flight information
service, which, Willes said, has higher profit margins than any
other part of the company. One company official put the unit's
margins above 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing growth in commercial aviation is expected to result
in more revenue for Jeppesen Sanderson, which is based in
Englewood, Colo., and employs about 1,270 people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its newspapers, Times Mirror publishes 20
magazines, most of which cover aspects of the sporting life. The
four largest magazines are Field &AMP; Stream (with a circulation of
1.8 million), Popular Science (1.6 million), Golf magazine (1.4
million) and Outdoor Life (1.4 million).
</P>
<P>
   In this stable, Sporting News, a magazine for spectators rather
than participants, was the odd man out, Willes said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1997 redesign that cost Times Mirror about $6 million,
The Sporting News does not make a profit, said an executive
involved in the plans for the sale. But the magazine's revenue is
growing: For the first six months of this year, the magazine
reported $11.5 million in advertising revenue, up from $9.7 million
for the same period in 1998 and $7.9 million for the same period in
1997, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Times Mirror estimated that the magazine's 1999
advertising revenue would be around $23 million. Circulation has
dipped slightly, from 549,000 in 1996 to 540,000 in 1998, according
to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two years, The Sporting News has been dwarfed by
the success of the biweekly ESPN magazine. Since 1998, when ESPN
magazine was founded, its circulation has soared to 800,000. The
strength of The Sporting News lies in the fact that it publishes
more sports-nut statistics than its competitors, and has a strong
online presence.
</P>
<P>
   Efrem Zimbalist III, the president and chief executive of Times
Mirror Magazines, said that the company had decided to sell it
because it is the only magazine in the group that covers spectator
sports with a news angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the only magazine in our group that deals with spectator
sports, not participatory sports,'' Zimbalist said. ``And we
believe that to be No. 1 in that field, you need to have a strong
broadcast or cable relationship, and that is an asset that Times
Mirror does not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers include News Corp., a company that sought a
presence in the sports-publishing field four years ago, but did not
start a planned sporting project. Because 95 percent of The
Sporting News' circulation is through subscription, it could also
be an inviting purchase for Time, Inc. or Disney, which could buy
the magazine and bolster their existing subscription lists, and
could close a competitor.

HACKETT FINALLY GETS HIS FREE TRIP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Seven years later, USC coach Paul Hackett finally is
getting his free trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was set to play Hawaii in 1992, when he was the coach at
Pittsburgh, but he lost his job right before the season-ender
against the Rainbow Warriors. Pitt had been embarrassed 57-13 by
Penn State the week before, and its overall record stood at 3-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired my butt,'' Hackett said. ``And the last thing they
said was `You're not going to Hawaii.' I wasn't any part of the
Hawaii trip. I was in Key West fishing for marlin.''
</P>
<P>
   This is more than another road trip for Hackett. His aunt has
lived here for 45 years and several other relatives reside in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's ready: Cornerback Kris Richard might be under more
scrutiny than any other player tonight, because he has almost no
college experience. But the sophomore is eager to show he deserves
his starting position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely ready. I'm very anxious. I've been waiting all
summer,'' Richard said. ``It's hard to explain the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard has solidified his position this week through attrition,
because freshman Darrell Rideaux is injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely hate to lose a guy,'' Richard said. ``It's a big
loss losing Darrell for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark ailing: Hackett said defensive back Tanqueray Clark
probably will play, but Clark was walking on crutches and had his
sprained ankle in a boot Friday. Rideaux is bothered by a back
injury but will dress for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Big man in Simi Valley: Defensive tackle Ryan Nielsen weighs
about 285 pounds, 40 more than his playing weight at Royal High.
Nielsen has tried to bulk up to play defensive tackle, and said
some friends didn't even recognize him when he went home this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple people walked right past me, without realizing it was
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All in the family: USC left guard Faaesea Mailo is enjoying a
family reunion. Mailo's family lives in Hawaii and his brother
Anipati is a freshman linebacker at Hawaii. His mother Christina
celebrates her birthday today.
</P>
<P>
   So who will his mother root for? ``Me, because I'm her
favorite,'' Mailo said.

FOSTER KEEPS HIS COOL FOR UCLA OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bruins tailback DeShaun Foster is making no
predictions about his first college start tonight against Boise
State, or about his sophomore season to come.
</P>
<P>
   If he's anxious about carrying two rookie quarterbacks and a
young offensive line, he isn't showing it. If he has personal goals
_ 1,000 yards? 1,500 yards? 20 touchdowns? _ he's keeping them
private.
</P>
<P>
   And that's fine, because Foster's coaches and teammates are
happy to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just amazing,'' defensive tackle Pete Holland said.
``Every day I get home and (receiver) Brad Melsby says, `Did you
see that stiff arm DeShaun gave that guy?' Or, `Did you see that
escape DeShaun made?' He's really incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster was the third-stringer last year out of coaches' respect
for veterans Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown. But this year talent
won out and the Bruins are ready to unleash Foster. He's expected
to carry the ball 20-25 times a game, and nobody's complaining _
not Brown, not Lewis, and certainly not the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not touching the ball a lot, then we're not using his
services the way we should,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``He can be as good as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime UCLA watchers believe Foster might be the most talented
running back in school history _ big, fast and elusive, possessing
great balance and vision _ and they fret he'll leave for the NFL
after his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Toledo has joked about limiting Foster's opportunities
this season to reduce his NFL value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a great back,'' Toledo said, seriously. ``And
he'll have the opportunity to carry the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Sweaty palms: While starting quarterback Drew Bennett practiced
with increasing confidence as game day approached, reserve freshman
Cory Paus felt the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hit him that he's going to play, and he's pressing a
little,'' Toledo said. ``He's not as loose as he normally is. He's
got to relax. It's affecting him in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished: The 12 suspended players (11 for the disabled-parking
scam and one for fighting) will not be in uniform or on the
sideline tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be in the stands or at home,'' Toledo said. ``They
won't be on the field. They won't be in the hotel or on the bus.
They won't be around the team.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Bruins are 6-3 in home openers in the '90s
and 66-29-2 overall at the Rose Bowl since moving there in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is 20-4 in the last two years, the best record in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins averaged a school-record 73,709 fans last year, but
they won't reach that number this season with Boise State and
Fresno State on the schedule and no home game against USC.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 45,000 is expected tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Game info: As usual, the Bruins will operate a shuttle bus from
the Parson Engineering Building in Pasadena to the Rose Bowl.
Service begins four hours before kickoff. There is a $4 charge.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10,000 fans will receive a ``Do You Believe?'' poster
featuring receiver Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 15-minute fireworks show after the game.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Five months after pleading guilty to
racketeering and extortion charges, John A. Gotti was sentenced on
Friday by a federal judge to 77 months in prison, a bittersweet
coda to his alleged reign as the acting boss of the Gambino crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was less than the maximum of 87 months that
prosecutors had sought, offering a small victory to Gotti and his
supporters. U.S. District Court Judge Barrington Parker also
granted Gotti 45 more days of limited freedom, allowing him to
continue living under house arrest at his home in Oyster Bay, Long
Island, before his prison term begins.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentence still means that for the next six and a half
years, Gotti, 35, will not be able to watch his four children grow,
will not be able to watch the birth of his fifth child _ due next
May _ and, most importantly to prosecutors, will not be able to
participate in a criminal racket that involved bribery and
extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a man's man,'' Gotti said, in his brief remarks to Parker,
before a hushed courtroom crowded with supporters and reporters.
``I'm here to take my medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotti now joins his father, John J. Gotti, the former head of
the Gambino crime family, as a ward of the federal prison system.
His flashy father, known as the Dapper Don for his impeccably cut
suits and outsized personality, was convicted of murder and
racketeering charges in 1991, and is now serving a life sentence
without parole in an Illinois prison.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the younger Gotti, known to some as ``Junior,''
requested that Gotti be detained at a prison in the Northeast,
perhaps in Pennsylvania, so that he could be closer to his family.
</P>
<P>
   With both father and son behind bars, it is not yet clear who
will dominate the Gambino crime family, which federal investigators
say is the nation's second-largest Mafia group. In recent months,
investigators have said that they believe the elder Gotti is trying
to cling to power through his brother Peter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to federal investigators, John A. Gotti took over as
acting boss of the Gambino crime family shortly after his father
was convicted. In January 1998, he was indicted on federal
racketeering charges along with 22 other defendants. Most of those
defendants soon pleaded guilty to sharply reduced charges, but
Gotti resisted for months.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his trial, however, Gotti unexpectedly pleaded
guilty to six charges: bribing a labor official, conspiring to
extort money from a construction company, understating his income
on a loan application for $336,000 to refinance his mortgage,
running an illegal gambling operation in Connecticut, understating
his income on a tax return, and loan-sharking.
</P>
<P>
   He made the plea, his lawyers said, because he was tired of the
relentless scrutiny, and because he wanted some closure to the
process so he could raise his children before they were grown.
</P>
<P>
   Had he gone to trial and been convicted, he would have faced a
possible sentence of 20 years. Under his guilty plea, which also
included a $1-million fine, he made no admission that he had been
the Gambino crime family's acting boss.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, government prosecutors and Gotti's lawyers had
haggled over the speed and means of Gotti's attempts to pay that
fine.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, the haggling continued, as Assistant U.S. Attorney
Bart Van de Weghe questioned whether the $757,000 that has so far
been paid to the government came from untainted sources. But in the
end, Parker struck a compromise, granting the prosecution's request
to force Gotti to forfeit $358,000 in property, should he not be
able to document the legitimacy of the $757,000 within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the sentencing segment. While Van de Weghe pressed for
the maximum, two of Gotti's lawyers, Gerald Shargel and Charles
Ogletree, beseeched Parker to consider two thoughts: the idea that
Gotti, the tabloid figure, was being tried for his celebrity, not
the facts of the case, and the idea that Gotti, soccer dad, was a
loving family man.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's lawyers even produced letters _ without their client's
prior knowledge, they said _ from Gotti's wife, Kim, and from his
children's teachers, asking the judge for leniency. Mrs. Gotti did
not attend the sentencing on Friday, nor, for that matter, did any
other close relative, with the exception of the younger Gotti's
brother Peter, said Sarita Kedia, one of the defendant's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to repay to society over the next 77 months the
debt owed to your community,'' Parker told Gotti. ``But once that
is taken care of, you will have to spend the balance of your time
trying to repair a family where children have to navigate without a
father. You have that opportunity, and I hope that you take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Parker announced his ruling, some of Gotti's supporters
held back tears, while his lawyers and others breathed an audible
sigh of relief. Dressed in a black suit, a white shirt and a dark
blue tie with yellow flowers, Gotti seemed at ease as well, smiling
and hugging a few close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside the courthouse, though, Gotti's celebrity took
center stage. He was swarmed by thrusting photographers and
cameramen while en route with his lawyers to the Pizzeria Uno
restaurant in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a photographer stumbled. Gotti helped him up. No one
was hurt, but Gotti still shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I need,'' he said. ``That's what I need.''

   ONCE AGAIN, COCA-COLA PREDICTS LOWER EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola fell $2.125, to $57.375, after the
soft-drink company confirmed Wall Street's fears that near-term
profits will suffer, as improving unit volume remains a challenge
for the rest of this year. Citing the lingering impact of halted
sales in parts of Europe this summer, as well as sluggishness in
other markets, Coke said unit case volume in the third quarter
would increase only at a low single-digit rate. Analysts figure the
increase to be about 2 percent, which is down slightly from the 3
percent to 4 percent they had originally estimated. As a result,
the company lowered earnings expectations by 3 cents to 5 cents a
share. Including the product recall in Europe, which will account
for 2 cents to 3 cents against earnings, third-quarter profits may
be as low as 31 cents a share, in contrast to the 36 cents analysts
had been expecting.

of course, is no novelty in Russia. It is as old as the czars and
was a hallmark of the old Soviet bureaucracy. But the oceans of
Western cash that have washed through Russia in recent years,
combined with scandal-plagued efforts to privatize state-owned
companies, have created an unprecedented ability for the country's

 &HT;    Vision dims: Virgin Mary sightings lead to lawsuit
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nancy Fowler's life isn't as crowded as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do hundreds of thousands of visitors gather near her
Conyers home to look heavenward in search of visions of the Virgin
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Still living in the three-bedroom ranch where her famous
pilgrimages began, the 51-year-old homemaker now focuses on her
14-year-old son and his private schooling, getting by on
$1,000-a-month alimony from her 1997 divorce, and _ in her most
cherished moments _ just being quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call my quiet time my time with God,'' she said in her first
interview ever with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The former nurse who once commanded the ability to clog Rockdale
County traffic for miles (although she would give credit to Jesus
and Mary) now lives a largely private life, driving her 1989 Buick
Skylark to the supermarket, making banana nut bread and writing her
autobiography. Fewer people recognize her in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the apparitions were going on, I was stopped everywhere
all the time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, visions of the Blessed Mother were central to
her life.
</P>
<P>
   But today, a newer realization nags at her. She suspects that a
married couple whom she counted as trusted advisers and organizers
of her gatherings are no longer on her side. Robert and Bernice
Hughes, she says, are capitalizing on her fame and using money from
her ministry to support another visionary, a woman from the South
American country of Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a lawsuit stemming from the conflict went to U.S.
District Court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses respond that they have maintained their mission of
charity and the spread of the divine word. It is Fowler who has
departed from an organization they founded to support her mission,
they allege.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Fowler sat in the home of a couple with whom
she has remained close, Ammon and Eleanor Ripple, who moved to
Conyers just to be near Fowler's visions. The Ripples are such dear
friends that Fowler has her own stuffed armchair in their living
room and used their house as a meeting place for the interview. She
did not want to meet at her home for privacy's sake.
</P>
<P>
   For 1 1/2 hours, Fowler told how demonic visits turned to sacred
visions, described her first mystical experiences and reiterated
that she will never make another apparition public, the last one at
her home on Oct. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Swam in Walden Pond
</P>
<P>
   Fowler was raised in Cambridge, Mass., by an Irish-Catholic
father who often worked two or three jobs as a laborer and janitor,
and a Syrian mother who worked in a sewing factory and was an
Eastern Rite Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go swimming at Walden Pond,'' she recalls. ``That
was my stomping ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a simple pleasure in a life of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very poor, but very rich,'' she says. ``It was a
blessing not to have had so many material things. I liked church,
just being there. I wasn't having mystical experiences, but I was
at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   She married an Air Force officer and raised two sons, moving
often according to her husband's assignments.
</P>
<P>
   She studied for two years to be a nurse and working in intensive
care, the ER and coronary units.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in the world like everyone else, going to church
once a week,'' she says. ``I didn't have any knowledge of anything
beyond me. You know, nursing's a very concrete science.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler talked about her past in an almost playful tone, her eyes
glistening as she spoke of the apparent fulfillment of a ``caring
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   But her voice softens as she speaks of the period in the
mid-1980s when, she says, God ``pulled the rug out from beneath
me'' during an Air Force stint in Centerville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler begins to speak in what might be called a commanding
whisper, drawing the rapt attention of five friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the night, I heard a scuffing of feet, like
an old man taking his last step,'' she said. ``I thought, `this is
my imagination.' Then I was poked in the arm, and I screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a series of nightly ``experiences'' that
made her wonder if the house was haunted. Pictures would crash to
the floor, and outside doors would inexplicably be ajar in the
morning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming were visions of vague human figures in combat _
black images vs. white ones.
</P>
<P>
   A priest who heard her account became angry and told her she was
imagining things. Confession helped, but didn't make the events go
away.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a Pentecostal friend advised her to repeat the phrase,
``In the name of Jesus, Go!'' It worked, she said, and the demons
went away.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, her husband left the Air Force as a captain and
moved the family to Norcross in search of a new career. Fowler
joined prayer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day in her apartment, she said she saw a light on a
crucifix and received a message to move to Conyers. She had no idea
why. But she drove and, lost off Ga. 138, saw the ranch in front of
a hill that had been in her vision. There was a ``for sale'' sign
in front.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Fowlers bought it. Today, the ranch remains the home
of half the family. She will not go into details about her divorce,
or reasons why she has no contact with her older son, who is 19.
</P>
<P>
   The first visit from the Virgin Mary came in 1990. Unprompted,
she describes the visits in spiritual terms: ``It was a profound
experience of love and humility,'' she says. ``I was enthralled
with her beauty. The beauty is God dwelling within.''
</P>
<P>
   But pressed to explain, Fowler gets specific. It could be any
time, day or night, while in bed or reading or walking in the
house. A light precedes the vision. Mary is preceded by angels and
flanked by saints. Fowler doesn't mention the saints' names, but
recognizes them from pictures in books. The entourage might descend
through the ceiling, ``as if it didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The vision speaks in an ``interior voice, a gentle loving
woman's voice,'' spoken clearly in English. ``One day, I'm working
in the kitchen and I hear a voice that says open the Bible. I open
the Bible and the crucifix is bursting with light,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Friends moved by Fowler's first visions began gathering at her
home, the groups growing from 20 to 50 to 80. She would address
them from the front porch of her two-acre property.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuit on Fowler's behalf
</P>
<P>
   Word of the gatherings evolved into networks, and the crowds
multiplied. By the tens of thousands, they would come to hear
Fowler's recitations of messages she claimed to receive from the
Virgin Mary, and they would look to the clouds to see her, many of
them pointing cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses became involved in 1991. They formed Our Loving
Mother's Children Inc., to handle crowd logistics, publish Fowler's
messages and collect donations. Fowler says she never paid
attention to those details.
</P>
<P>
   Registered as a nonprofit corporation, OLMC also bought nearly
100 acres surrounding Fowler's home.
</P>
<P>
   There were no public signs of discord until this year. In July,
OLMC was sued to stop the group from publishing Fowler's messages,
particularly a new collection, ``Be Children of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler did not file the suit, but has made it clear that she is
fully in agreement with the man who did, her friend George Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge Sidney Nation ruled in Rockdale Superior Court
that no one should publish the book until the issue is settled.
Last week, the case moved to federal court because it deals with
U.S. copyright issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Fowler says the publishing battle is part of a larger war
over control of her messages _ and the money they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Getting too commercial?
</P>
<P>
   She said that only this year has she become aware that OLMC is
overcommercializing her ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they profiting? I don't know the answer to that. The facts
speak for themselves. I've given all my talks for free, and the
object is to get the message out to the people at the minimum
cost,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The group charges too much for books and videos, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Michael Powell, representing the Hugheses, responded:
``Our Loving Mother's Children is a church-type organization, doing
good community service and volunteer work.'' There is little money
since Fowler discontinued her pilgrimages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the disagreement is OLMC's recent association with
Katya Rivas of Bolivia, a woman who claims divine visions similar
to those in Conyers. Fowler said she isn't casting doubt on Rivas's
authenticity. ``I simply object to the mixing of my messages with
hers,'' she said. The Hughes have capitalized on their
Conyers-rooted donations and switched visionaries, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she will sue to force OLMC to divulge all financial
records.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler announced an end to her pilgrimages last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the Blessed Mother as I did,'' she said. ``My gift
has not changed. But the visions of the Virgin Mary, that very real
way that I got to see her, they have ceased.

Mark Baird, the man with the unbankerly beard, tours a school in
crisis-racked Indonesia, where he is the World Bank's country
director. Baird, 48, says that as an economist for the bank in
Jakarta in the late 1980s, he followed the old style. ``We prided
ourselves on working behind the scenes, with the government,'' he
says. ``Now, I think we should have spoken out on corruption.''

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relaxing in a plush Manhattan hotel room recently, Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most influential
businessmen, chatted about theft.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant stealing, Khodorkovsky conceded, was certainly bad for
Russia. ``If what we're talking about is sucking the lifeblood out
of industry into some personal holdings so that this money will no
longer be plowed back into the company, if we word it that way,
then yes, it's a huge problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Khodorkovsky quickly added, that is not his game _ it is
the game of politicians, who, he believes, are responsible for the
lion's share of corruption in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Rosprom, the holding company for Yukos Oil,
Russia's second-biggest oil company, Khodorkovsky, 35, said he was
determined to build an industrial empire as competitive as any
Western enterprise. At times, he allowed, that has meant trying to
move control of his companies to places outside Russia _ but only
to keep the companies out of the hands of corrupt politicians or
nettlesome investors, and always with the goal of rebuilding the
Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Khodorkovsky, his oil company and another Rosprom
business _ Bank Menatep, which is now insolvent _ have been drawn
repeatedly into investigations of possible wrongdoing. Russian
securities regulators are examining whether Yukos used offshore
entities to illegally evade the scrutiny of Russian authorities.
Some of his shareholders, including prominent American financiers,
have similarly complained in legal filings in Russia that he has
spirited away oil profits from Yukos subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the money-laundering investigation of the Bank of New York
by United States authorities is examining whether Khodorkovsky's
companies moved funds illegally through the New York bank,
authorities say. The Bank of New York examination _ involving at
least $4.2 billion and possibly as much as $10 billion _ is the
biggest money-laundering investigation in American history and has
become a lightning rod for criticism of how the West has carried
out foreign policy and conducted business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Bank of New York handled banking
transactions for Khodorkovsky's companies, a relationship that he
said in a recent interview was legitimate. And no one has charged
Khodorkovsky or his companies with breaking any laws.
</P>
<P>
   His business empire, however, is being scrutinized by
investigators looking at the activities of Natasha Gurfinkel
Kagalovsky, a senior vice president at the Bank of New York who
oversaw the bank's dealings in Russia. Ms. Kagalovsky is married to
Konstantin Kagalovsky, a former Russian government official who is
now a vice chairman of Yukos and was a vice chairman of Menatep,
Khodorkovsky's bank.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of Khodorkovsky's empire with the Bank of New
York investigation has drawn attention to the vulnerability of
Western institutions that chase lucrative deals while willingly or
unwittingly ignoring the freewheeling business practices in many
pockets of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Graft, of course, is no novelty in Russia. It is as old as the
czars and was a hallmark of the old Soviet bureaucracy. But the
oceans of Western cash that have washed through Russia in recent
years, combined with scandal-plagued efforts to privatize
state-owned companies, have created an unprecedented ability for
the country's business and political elite to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At their disposal are secretive offshore concerns, dizzying
arrays of subsidiaries and holding companies, bogus bankruptcy
procedures and other forms of financial sleight of hand designed to
hide money and assets from Russian tax authorities, law enforcement
officials and investors.
</P>
<P>
   This financial arsenal allows criminals, politicians and
businesses to siphon vast sums of money out of the country. Some of
these operations are legal _ but not, many Russians say, in the
best interest of their country. Others are of dubious legality. And
some are clearly criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money siphoned out of Russia illegally in recent
years is difficult to quantify, because the government does not
track it closely and because much legitimate cash is sent abroad in
search of stable banks. Russia's interior ministry estimates that
anywhere from $50 billion to $250 billion was transferred out of
the country illegally from 1994 to 1998. In a recent report, the
credit rating agency Fitch IBCA said $136 billion left the country
from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians don't recognize that by cheating someone today, they
are hurting themselves in the long run,'' said Stephen Kotkin,
director of the Russian studies program at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind by the plundering are average Russians whose
livelihoods and futures are diminished by the ingrained corruption.
And the corruption in Russia threatens any Western institution that
does business there, including private companies like the Bank of
New York and publicly financed lenders like the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ especially when such
institutions are so focused on raking in easy profits or achieving
policy goals that obvious problems are sometimes ignored.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, the money-laundering investigation at the Bank of
New York has further laid bare the real dynamic that has driven
events in the country in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole political struggle in Russia between 1992 and 1998
was between different groups trying to take control of state
assets,'' said Nodari A. Simonia, deputy director of the Institute
of World Economy and International Relations, a Moscow research
organization. ``It was not about democracy or market reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Connect the Dots
</P>
<P>
   Last March, a phalanx of private guards dressed in paramilitary
uniforms and toting machine guns were hired by Yukos Oil to block
access to a shareholders meeting in Moscow. In response, and
fearing that Yukos' managers would use the meeting to tighten their
grip on the company and loot it, some investors enlisted the help
of the local police. And the police, arriving in an armored vehicle
and wearing bulletproof gear, succeeded in postponing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown bore little resemblance to the lofty visions of a
market economy embraced by reformers who sent Russia on its
pell-mell sprint from Communism to capitalism in the early 1990s _
a sprint unencumbered by an adequate regulatory and legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Yukos, a major force in an industry that employs hundreds of
thousands of people and that is vital to the Russian economy, is
swamped in allegations of wrongdoing. Russian securities regulators
have begun a criminal investigation of possible theft, stock
manipulation and tax scams at the company.
</P>
<P>
   A Yukos spokesman said the criminal investigation was
``prejudiced and groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned until 1995, Yukos reported a loss of $79 million
last year on revenue of about $4 billion. Khodorkovsky, who once
held a top post in Russia's energy ministry, won control of the
company for about $310 million in a privatization auction marred by
rigged, low-ball bids.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism of Yukos has been leveled directly at
Khodorkovsky, who vigorously defended his record in a series of
lengthy interviews with The New York Times that began late last
spring and culminated in a telephone interview from Moscow on
August 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from today, I expect that Yukos' operating
efficiency should be no less than any Western company,''
Khodorkovsky said through an interpreter. ``We've told our
shareholders that we are acting in their interests, even if they
think we are not.''
</P>
<P>
   At once congenial and hard-nosed, Khodorkovsky bears a long scar
on his left forearm from a knife fight on the streets of Moscow, a
teen-age memento offset by the expensive suits and Ermenegildo
Zegna ties he favors.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of factory workers, Khodorkovsky was a gifted
chemistry and mathematics student who parlayed academic prowess,
entrepreneurial zeal and valuable Communist Party connections into
a personal-computer business in the late 1980s. The venture,
sponsored by the Soviet government, was so profitable that it
helped start Khodorkovsky on his career as a banker, when he
founded Menatep in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Menatep blossomed after the fall of Communism. But like most
large Russian banks, it made questionable loans to related
companies or gambled large sums on risky securities. It collapsed
last year as Russia's flimsy financial structure came unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Menatep's name has resurfaced in the money-laundering
investigation involving the Bank of New York. Money laundering is a
catch phrase for the criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains
and moving them through a sequence of bank accounts so they
ultimately look like legitimate profits from legal businesses. The
money is then withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are examining whether Menatep moved funds
through the Bank of New York, authorities say, a suspicion fueled
by the Kagalovskys' jobs and relationship. Neither of the
Kagalovskys has been charged with wrongdoing, and their lawyer,
Stanley Arkin, said they never engaged in money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, in the phone interview late last month, said
Menatep has never been found guilty of money laundering, despite
repeated investigations in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menatep in its history has never done any money laundering,''
he said. ``Tying Kagalovsky into this scandal that is raging in the
United States seems strange to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent statement, Menatep said it ``valued the Bank of New
York for the high level of service that came with the extraordinary
commitment that bank consistently demonstrated to the Russian
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Khodorkovsky has nothing but praise for Ms. Kagalovsky,
whom he considers representative of the new Russians leading their
country to a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Gurfinkel became very well known in Russia before she
married Kagalovsky,'' Khodorkovsky noted. ``She was a native
Russian who had emigrated to the States and became a U.S. citizen
and returned to Russia bringing banks with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which said it is cooperating with the
money-laundering investigation, has not been charged with any
wrongdoing. It has declined to comment further on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Business as Usual?
</P>
<P>
   But many banks that avidly pursued business ties with Russia are
now scurrying to explain how they actually conducted business
there. And Russian regulators and Western investors say
Khodorkovsky is, at a minimum, turning a blind eye to misconduct
within his own business empire. Some of the harshest critics say
that Yukos may be looting parts of its sprawling operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the angriest critics is Kenneth B. Dart, the wealthy and
reclusive heir to a foam-cup fortune, who gave up his United States
citizenship years ago for residence in tax-free havens like Belize.
His Russian investment vehicle, Dart Management, has stakes in
Yukos subsidiaries and has sued Yukos in Russia, accusing the
company and Khodorkovsky of illegally diverting money, oil and
other assets out of Yukos subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dart Management and other investors in Yukos subsidiaries
contend that Khodorkovsky has shifted billions of dollars from the
subsidiaries by selling their oil at artificially low prices to the
parent company _ a contention substantiated by evidence of the
practice in footnotes to Yukos' own financial statements. The oil
is then resold by Yukos at much higher prices to buyers on the open
market. Investors say that these windfall profits accrue to Yukos
alone _ not to the subsidiaries _ and may even be channeled away
from Yukos and into offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yukos has failed to make reasonable disclosure of its
financial dealings,'' said Michael Hunter, president of Dart
Management, which is based in Summit, N.J. ``It is therefore
difficult to gather conclusive evidence of where this cash goes.
</P>
<P>
   `` Khodorkovsky surely knows the answer,'' Hunter added, ``and
presumably has his own reasons for his unwillingness to share the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky says he has not pilfered money from Yukos or
improperly managed its finances. He says oil is transferred at
rock-bottom prices between Yukos and its subsidiaries to minimize
taxes, a strategy that he said all Russian oil companies use. The
Darts' contentions are baseless, he said, part of a campaign by
their lawyers to wrest control of Yukos from him. But Khodorkovsky,
who enthusiastically told of a job he once held guarding payrolls
armed only with an ax, said he likes a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have teeth, and we know how to bite back,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Offshore, and Under Inquiry
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dart Management, like most Western investors in
Russia, is hardly naive when it comes to the hardball tactics and
unsavory realities of doing business there, and the firm has been
tough-minded about getting its own way in deals that straddle the
globe. But investors are not the only ones complaining about Yukos.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Tomsk, a Siberian city that is home to Tomskneft,
one of Yukos' biggest oil subsidiaries, are also upset. They say
Tomskneft, the city's main employer, has been purposefully
mismanaged, resulting in the layoffs of tens of thousands of oil
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomskneft was one of the few companies in Russia that was
profitable, took care of its workers and had very efficient
output,'' said Alexander Yakovlevich, a local director of the
Russian Federal Securities Commission, who has lived in Tomsk for
all his 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlevich also complains that even as Khodorkovsky has
enriched himself while running Yukos, he explains the layoffs by
saying the company's cupboards are bare. ``The explanation
Khodorkovsky gives for all of this is that there's no money,'' he
said. ``But how is that possible?''
</P>
<P>
   One way that Yukos' assets might be disappearing is through the
use of offshore shell companies.
</P>
<P>
   Financial documents show that Yukos has established offshore
entities in Cyprus, Switzerland, the Caribbean and elsewhere. And,
according to corporate documents, arrangements have been made for
these entities to receive controlling stakes in Yukos'
subsidiaries, a move that investors like the Darts think will
solidify Khodorkovsky's control and allow him too much leeway in
managing his oil riches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the offshore entities is Valmet, an investment vehicle
located on the Isle of Man, in the Irish Sea. Khodorkovsky's bank,
Menatep, bought a big stake in Valmet a few years ago from the
Riggs National Corp., a Washington bank. Valmet subsequently played
a central role in a possible fraud that the Russian government is
now investigating. The government moved in April to take over a
Russian titanium company, Avisma, in which Menatep once had a large
stake, saying the metal company's profits were siphoned by Menatep
and stashed in Valmet's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs and Valmet declined to comment, citing client
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky says the government's allegations of theft at
Avisma are meritless, but he acknowledges that Valmet has been the
recipient of some Yukos assets. He says, however, that he does not
use companies like Valmet to facilitate theft. On the contrary, he
says, he uses his stable of offshore companies to protect his
holdings from interlopers like Dart Management or from
expropriation by corrupt government officials in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Dart, which also once held a stake in Avisma, has also been
pulled into the problems surrounding the titanium company. Avisma
recently sued Dart and other Western investors in federal court in
Newark, N.J., accusing them of diverting profits from the company.
Dart representatives say the charges are meritless.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has attracted the attention of federal investigators
examining the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce S. Marks, a Philadelphia lawyer representing Avisma, said
he was contacted recently by Justice Department officials seeking
information related to the Bank of New York investigation. While
declining to offer details about the agency's query, Marks said he
planned to subpoena the Bank of New York for records pertaining to
Valmet. ``We believe Bank of New York was in the loop because
Menatep was in the loop, and Menatep transacted through Valmet,
Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are interested in Valmet as well. A Swiss government
prosecutor said last week that he is examining Valmet's ties to the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A Daunting Troika
</P>
<P>
   All the interest from law enforcement officials in the dealings
of Russian businessmen rankles Khodorkovsky. In the telephone
interview late last month, he suggested that Russian politicians
controlled a large portion of the funds being examined for money
laundering at the Bank of New York, asserting that the officials
sent their money abroad before Russia's financial collapse last
year. It is a theory that many Russians, including Boris Y.
Nemtsov, a former first deputy prime minister, _ say is extremely
credible.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, while perhaps Khodorkovsky's opening salvo against
politicians anxious to investigate his dealings, also points out
some difficulties of tackling corruption in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While wrongdoing in the Russian worlds of politics, business and
organized crime is often discussed separately, denizens of these
groups typically rub shoulders in their dealings, and this powerful
troika presents a tremendous hurdle to meaningful reform. As long
as that is the case, few observers of Russia are optimistic about
the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Russia is that the government, business and
organized crime are so closely involved with one another that it is
very hard to find clean institutions to work with,'' said R. James
Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and
now a lawyer in Washington. ``Right now, I don't think you can put
any real money into Russia without its getting stolen.''

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fund-raising letters postmarked in this city have
always used language that is hyperbolic. But in a recent ``urgent''
letter, a Republican fund-raising chairman asked for contributions
of $25 or more to help the Senate protect the United States from a
looming nuclear attack by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, began the four-page letter this way, ``Dear
Fellow American: My colleagues in the United States Senate must
have your immediate help to protect our country from a potentially
devastating nuclear attack.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said a ``generous emergency gift of $25 or more''
would help Senate Republicans defend the United States and ``do
what President Clinton will not: preserve, protect and defend the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Included with the mailing was a ``Nuclear Crisis Action
Survey,'' a list of eight multiple-choice questions that the reader
was asked to complete and return within 48 hours. ``We want your
opinions,'' the letter said, ``on how you want the Senate to act on
the shocking information that has only recently come to our
attention: The Communist North Korean government has obtained
nuclear technology, and possibly the capability of reaching our
shores with nuclear missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth and final question: ``Will you do your part to help
today?'' There are boxes for amounts ranging from $25 to $1,000.
McConnell, R-Ky., assured recipients that he would share the
survey's results with the Senate Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan, and South Korea have threatened to cut
off foreign aid and remittances if North Korea proceeds with a test
of a missile that has the capability to reach Hawaii or Alaska. Two
weeks ago, the United States and North Korea agreed to meet this
month in Europe to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have said that the missile North Korea
plans to test-fire is an advanced version of the Taepodong rocket
it launched last year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Republicans' main fund-raising group,
McConnell is one of the most outspoken and influential opponents in
Congress to a bill that would ban unlimited campaign contributions
known as soft money. Last month, McConnell urged as many as 20
executives to resign from a committee dedicated to advancing the
bill that would overhaul campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   His fund-raising letter is clearly intended to play off North
Korea's potential of fielding a ballistic capable of striking the
United States. But it would take another technological advance to
enable North Korea's rockets to have the range to reach the lower
48 states. The Pentagon last month positioned two Navy observation
ships to watch for a possible test launch.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steven Law, the executive director of the Republican committee,
said that the letter was a test mailing sent to several thousand
people and that the response was less than what they hoped for. But
Law defended the letter's message and its tone, saying, ``This is
standard fare for direct mail, and it is a good deal less
incendiary than some mailings I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, he said, fund-raising letters used scare
tactics about nuclear war to drum up support. ``These letters have
been a staple of direct mail fund-raising drives for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell declined to comment on the letter. And Robert Steurer,
his press secretary, referred questions to the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform advocates said they were outraged by the
letter's message and tone, calling it a brazen attempt to play upon
people's fears to raise money. They also said it was the first time
they could recall that a fund-raising letter depended on the
specter of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of direct mail and people play a lot of games,
but I've never seen anyone take us to the verge of nuclear war to
raise a few bucks,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of
Democracy 21, a nonprofit public policy organization that endorses
changes to campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, the founder and executive director of the Center
for Public Integrity, said the letter's ``fear-mongering techniques
just take my breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a hysterical fly-by-night direct mail thing,
and the fact a United States senator would allow something like
that to go out under his name really takes the United States Senate
to a new low,'' said Lewis, whose organization is a nonpartisan
campaign finance watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Haley
Barbour, said that shrill language in fund-raising letters is
typical and is used by both Republicans and Democrats. ``To me, the
shrillest letter I've ever seen was a Democratic letter that
accused the Republicans of taking away Social Security from
millions of senior citizens,'' Barbour said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell accuses the Clinton administration of giving over $200
million of ``YOUR TAX DOLLARS'' to North Korea, which he said the
nation used to aid its nuclear program. In recent years, the
Clinton administration has guaranteed North Korea $200 million in
aid for food in the face of widespread domestic starvation and fuel
for its civilian nuclear plants, in return for a pledge to restrain
its military nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shameful reality,'' McConnell said, ``is compounded by a
terrifying fact: If the North Korean Communists launch a nuclear
attack on our nation, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE A WAY TO STOP
IT.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we retaliate with our own missiles,'' he wrote,
``their nuclear bombs will have already killed hundreds of
thousands of our citizens. And the reason is, the Clinton-Gore
administration for years refused to allow deployment of the
military's missile defense program.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no missile defense force, but Congress is
pushing for an anti-missile force to be set up as early as 2003 or
2005, and the Pentagon says that such dates may be feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Law defended the accuracy of the letter, saying all its
assertions were backed up by research conducted by the Republican
committee.

OREGON DOCTOR DISCIPLINED FOR NOT TREATING PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ In what appears to be the first such action in
the nation, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners this week
disciplined a doctor for insufficiently treating pain in his
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The decision underscores the medical community's changing
attitudes about how doctors should help patients deal with severe
and chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   Like many state medical boards, the Oregon board had focused on
disciplining doctors who had overprescribed drugs. But in this
week's case, the board found that Dr. Paul Bilder of Roseburg,
Ore., had not prescribed enough drugs to alleviate pain in six
patients between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The board ordered Bilder to complete a physician's education
program and a program on physician-patient communications. It also
ordered that he undergo psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the instances the board listed were Bilder's instructions
that an 84-year-old man with lung cancer and urinary incontinence
not be allowed a catheter, but that he wear diapers instead. Bilder
also denied sedatives and pain medication to a 35-year-old female
patient who was wheezing and having problems using a ventilator,
the board said. And it cited Bilder's refusal to administer pain
medication to an 82-year-old man suffering from congestive heart
failure who had told nurses he could not breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office, Bilder declined to comment. His lawyer,
Bud Smith, also declined to talk about the case in detail but did
say: ``I've known Dr. Bilder for over 25 years, and I think he's
probably the most caring, compassionate physician I've ever run
across. He genuinely does care for the well-being of his patients,
more than any doctor I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials in Oregon _ known for its legalization of
physician-assisted suicide and its focus on end-of-life care _
lauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an extremely tolerant'' action, said Dr. Brett
Stacey, director of the Pain Management Center at Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey called the specifics in Bilder's case ``bad patient
care'' and decried ``some of the things those poor patients
suffered through.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw many similar cases at the center, which often
treats terminal patients.
</P>
<P>
   But a former president of the Oregon Medical Association
questioned the board's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to end up driving doctors crazy,'' said
Dr. Leigh Dolin, an internal medicine specialist in Portland, who
added that a decade ago, the board was questioning doctors for
overprescribing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all of a sudden,'' Dolin said, ``the fashions have changed
and the board's going to start harassing doctors for not
prescribing enough pain medication. It makes it extremely difficult
for the average Oregon physician to know what to do to make the
board happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of better pain treatment said doctors simply needed to
educate themselves about current medical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Several said the Oregon case represented only the beginning of
the sea change in how the public believed pain should be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Austin, deputy executive vice president of the Federation
of State Medical Boards, said he was not aware of any other
disciplinary action by state boards around the country for
undertreating pain, but said such actions might increase.

THAILAND TO SELL TROUBLED BANK TO STANDARD CHARTERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The authorities in Thailand said Friday that they
would sell the troubled Nakornthon Bank to Standard Chartered Bank
of Britain, acting to revamp the financial industry in a
long-awaited move that is widely seen as crucial to the nation's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered will buy a 75 percent stake in Nakornthon for
12.4 billion baht, or $319 million, nearly double an investment it
agreed to in April, officials said. The Thai government, which
nationalized Nakornthon in July, will sell an additional 10 percent
stake to the public once Standard Chartered's management takes over
the Thai bank.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered won an agreement to buy Nakornthon in April
only to see it fall apart two months later amid criticism that the
sale was a misuse of taxpayer funds. The deal Friday is the second
time Standard Chartered has had to double its spending to realize
its plans to buy branch networks in Asia: In July, it more than
doubled its bid for a stake in Bank Bali of Indonesia, paying $123
million for 20 percent of that bank, which has since become
embroiled in a political scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Nakornthon sale represented overdue progress
in efforts to revive the Thai financial system. Growing exports and
increased spending by the government and consumers have brightened
the country's economic prospects. The International Monetary Fund
has predicted that gross domestic product will expand by 5 percent
next year. But continued problems in the financial sector threaten
to cut recovery short by putting a lid on fresh credit, economists
warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue growing, Thailand needs the financial sector to
recover,'' said Thanomsri Fongarun-rung, an economist at Merrill
Lynch who in a recent report predicted that Thailand's economy
would grow just 2.8 percent next year. More than half of Thai bank
loans are nonperforming, Ms. Thanomsri said, making banks reluctant
or unable to extend new loans to feed the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Aftershocks from the reckless lending that helped precipitate
Thailand's financial crisis in mid-1997 are still being felt. Last
month, regulators shut a finance company that was operating with a
negative net worth. And Thai Farmers Bank, abandoning its own
efforts to bail out the nation's largest finance company, said it
would instead hand it over to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on the Thai banking sector in June, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said that theindustry remained in deep
crisis and that all of Thailand's banks were ``heavily insolvent in
true economic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakornthon, which was founded in 1933 by an ethnic Chinese
family that maintained control until this year, is one of the
country's oldest and smallest commercial banks, with 67 branches.
For Standard Chartered, those branches represented a quick way to
reach consumers with new services. Standard Chartered, a longtime
fixture in Asia's financial markets, is among the banks that print
Hong Kong's currency and counts on Asia for 70 percent of its
revenue. But after 100 years in Thailand, the 150-year-old Standard
Chartered still has only one branch.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Standard Chartered reached a deal to pay 6.2
billion baht for a 68.4 percent stake in Nakornthon, with the
government injecting 13.3 billion baht for a 20 percent stake.
Critics accused the government of using taxpayer funds to spruce up
the bank for foreign buyers, and in mid-July the government
nationalized Nakornthon and reopened bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered reportedly beat a competing bid from United
Overseas Bank of Singapore, which is said to be the likely winner
in a tender for another nationalized institution, Radanasin Bank.
The government hopes to sell two other lenders, Siam City Bank and
Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered is the third foreign bank to buy a majority
stake in a Thai bank. Last year, the Development Bank of Singapore
bought a majority of Thai Danu Bank. ABN Amro bought 75 percent of
Bank of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday comes amid complaints by foreign
investors that restructuring is falling victim to a nationalist
backlash and that some delinquent Thai borrowers are using politics
to keep their holdings from being sold to foreigners until an
improving economy enables them to service their loans.
</P>
<P>
   One opposition leader recently accused the government of
conspiring with the World Bank to sell the government-owned Krung
Thai Bank to foreigners after using public funds to clean up the
bank's balance sheet.

LABOR GOES TO CAPITALISM'S CITADEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of a movement that has often been the
nemesis of business _ the labor movement _ did an unlikely thing in
an unlikely place Friday. He rang the opening bell at the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Why did John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, put aside
thoughts of class struggle and enter the hallowed halls of
capitalism?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to do what's counterintuitive,'' said Denise Mitchell,
the communications director of the AFL-CIO. ``We've been delivering
a lot of messages to corporate America about improving wages,
health care and pensions, and we've also delivered messages about
ways that all of us can cooperate more. We thought we might as well
be where they are, if we're going to get their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traders joked that perhaps Sweeney ought to be invited back
to ring the opening bell every day because the stock market had a
big day Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring
235.24 points, or 2.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to invite Sweeney came from Richard A. Grasso, chairman
of the New York Stock Exchange, who has long believed in building
bridges to many segments of the community. One reason he invited
Sweeney, union and exchange officials said, was that the 600
runners, clerks and reporters of stock trades at the exchange are
unionized. They are members of Local 153 of the Office and
Professional Employees International Union, and not surprisingly,
the union's president, Michael Goodwin, stood with Sweeney as he
rang the bell.
</P>
<P>
   They were enthusiastically applauded by the many union members
working on the exchange floor. Afterward Sweeney and Goodwin toured
the floor with Grasso, who was once a member of Local 153.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little unusual being there,'' Goodwin said. ``It's
the first time in history that an American labor leader rang the
opening bell. It's because Dick Grasso and the New York Stock
Exchange have a new respect for the labor movement due to the
movement's resurgence under John Sweeney.''
</P>
<P>
   But a stock exchange spokesman had a simpler explanation. ``We
did this in honor of Labor Day,'' the spokesman said, adding that
Grasso was also mindful of the billions of dollars in pension funds
controlled by labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that stocks soared, however, did not exactly delight
Sweeney: the Labor Department reported Friday that job growth had
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the unfortunate part,'' said Goodwin, whose view of
the news, as befits a labor leader, differed sharply from the
interpretation prevailing on Wall Street. Many investors were
heartened by the job slowdown on the theory that as a result, the
Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again this year in an
effort to slow the economy.

AN UMPIRE ANNOUNCES HIS RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The umpiring crew that worked the game between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago Friday was a shell
of its former self. Jerry Meals was the lone remnant. Larry Poncino
and Gary Darling were no longer working, a result of the umpires'
mass resignation movement, and Steve Rippley was in Florida
deciding whether he would end his career, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announced my retirement yesterday,'' Rippley said. ``They
haven't taken it yet. They're giving me time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rippley, a 17-year National League veteran, said he was
contemplating retirement because he was disheartened over the loss
of 22 of his colleagues, concerned about the ramifications of that
action for him and fearful that the economic package available to
him if he retires now will not exist four months from now.
</P>
<P>
   His state of mind was not an unexpected aftermath of the
National and American Leagues' termination of 22 umpires, who
resigned as part of their union's bargaining strategy and then, to
their surprise, had their resignations accepted. The umpires who
support the union leader Richie Phillips, Rippley among them, are
angry with major-league baseball and the umpires who abandoned the
resignation strategy, blaming them for their colleagues'
unemployment _ even though the 22 lost their jobs because of the
strategy designed by Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I retiring?'' Rippley, 45, said, repeating a question.
``In support of the 22 guys who got fired. I can also see down the
road that my workload will be overloaded because there's no one
left to work. They're not going to let the new guys they hired work
postseason play, or a lot of important games in the next month.
Who's going to get overloaded? The senior guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Rippley, chief of his crew, said he also expected umpires to be
``on the street'' as of Jan. 1. Their contract expires the day
before, and the umpires believe they will be locked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have in my hand right now if I retire; I don't
know what's in the bush,'' he said by telephone from South Florida.
``Come Jan. 1, I don't know if I'll have a paycheck; I don't know
what my benefits will be. Everything becomes a jump ball Jan. 1. I
could be on the streets. I may be one of the guys who's not hired
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rippley certainly does not feel wanted at the moment. He said he
was told that when someone in the commissioner's office _ he does
not know who, though he has his suspicions _ found out that he was
talking of retiring, ``They said, `Good, that's another guy out the
door.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already shown us how ruthless they can be,'' Rippley
said. ``It's a deep concern for me. I've seen them whack these
guys. What's to say they won't whack me next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Rippley, whose salary under the umpires' pay scale is $155,000,
would receive at least $300,000 in severance if he walked away from
the job now or after the season. If he stayed and worked the
postseason, he would earn additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Rippley denied that he receives money from Pilot Air Freight, a
Philadelphia shipping company that Phillips operates. Other umpires
included him on a list of seven umpires that they said were on
Pilot's payroll. Terry Tata, an NL umpire who has lost his job, was
also named, and he, too, denied being on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Rippley and Tata accused umpires from the anti-Phillips faction
of disseminating false information. ``The people who are spreading
it can't prove it, and they shouldn't be saying it,'' Rippley said.
``Their rumor is because we sit on the union board they're slipping
us this money, paying us $20,000, so we keep Richie as our lawyer.
There are some people who have done PR work, speaking engagements
and such, for Pilot. There's some compensation for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The schism between the two factions of umpires, divided mostly
along league lines, is only growing deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how the two groups can fit back together again,''
Rippley said. ``We have to get back together, but I can't even
fathom what's going to happen if we're in the same room.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been a suggestion by some baseball people
that some of the 22 umpires could be rehired next season, if crews
were expanded from four to five, an official said Friday night that
the idea of five-man crews has been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Another official did not hold out hope that any of the 22 would
be rehired. He said it was possible that two or three could be
rehired in the future, but added that no such plan is contemplated
now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rippley planned to spend the weekend deciding whether
to head for Milwaukee and his next scheduled assignment Tuesday or
into early retirement.

GIANTS LOSE GAME TO RAVENS AND RUNNING BACK TO INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ On the second offensive play, they lost their
starting running back. On the last play, they lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Giants' winsome railway adventure to Baltimore
for the final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' principal goals for this trip were to avoid a major
injury and to win the game for the momentum it would bring heading
into the season opener Sept. 12 at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When running back Gary Brown sprained the medial collateral
ligament in his left knee on his first carry against the Ravens,
the chief goal of the day was unattainable. But at least it
appeared the Giants were going to finish the preseason with a
winning record for the first time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as time expired, the Ravens scored on a 37-yard touchdown
pass to win, 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Giants ended the preseason with a 2-2 record after a
vexing mistake by rookie safety Lyle West allowed the Ravens to
score as the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brown, he said it would be a miracle if he was ready to
play next week. He expects to be sidelined for at least a couple of
weeks. The team made no official estimation on the severity of his
injury and scheduled a magnetic resonance imaging test of Brown's
knee for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The likely replacement for Brown is LeShon Johnson, who has
never started a National Football League season as a team's
featured running back. Johnson had cancer surgery last year and
missed the 1998 season. He also tore ligaments and chipped a bone
in his right thumb last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some real bonehead mistakes that cost us the ball
game,'' coach Jim Fassel said. ``They tried to give us the game and
we couldn't take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens nearly scored twice earlier in the fourth quarter
only to turn the ball over at the Giants' goal line. It seemed the
Giants were going to escape with a 24-21 victory when they punted
the football to Baltimore with 42 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens advanced to the Giants' 37-yard line, but with only
eight seconds remaining and no timeouts, Baltimore hurriedly lined
up for a desperate attempt. Stoney Case, a reserve quarterback,
threw to the right sideline near the Giants' 10-yard line, where
rookie wide receiver Brandon Stokley went for the ball along with
West.
</P>
<P>
   Stokley caught it as West fell out of bounds. Stokley kept his
balance and raced into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyle went for the ball,'' Fassel said. ``There are ways to go
for the ball and still get the man, and that's what he should have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was injured at the end of a 4-yard run less than five
minutes into the game. Brown was bent backward on the tackle by a
group of Baltimore defenders, his left foot planted in the grass as
his body twisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the amount of pain I felt, I thought it was going to be
worse,'' said Brown, who missed two preseason games recovering from
injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. ``Right now, it hurts
but I can walk.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he was told by team doctors, Brown was not
specific other than to say that his rehabilitation would be weeks
not days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who wears a cast on his thumb when he plays, had 19
rushing yards on six carries Friday, but he also fumbled the ball
once. It was his second fumble in 20 rushing attempts this
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel acknowledged that he was concerned about Johnson's
ability to hold on to the football with the thumb cast, which
Johnson has to wear for at least another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Bennett, a rookie, could split time at running back with
Johnson. Bennett had 19 rushing yards in 13 carries Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The starters played slightly more than a quarter Friday, leaving
the game with the Giants ahead, 10-7. Kent Graham, who completed 8
of 11 passes for 70 yards, led the team on an eight-play touchdown
drive in the first quarter that ended with Charles Way's 1-yard
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Daluiso also had a 51-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, who were undefeated in four preseason games, took a
14-10 halftime lead, but Kerry Collins led the second-team offense
on two second-half touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed 5 of 6 passes for 71 yards in a nine-play,
third-quarter scoring drive that ended with a 19-yard screen pass
to Bennett, who darted in and around a host of defenders for the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore briefly regained the lead but Collins led the Giants
on another touchdown drive, first connecting with David Patten on a
52-yard pass and then on a spectacular 23-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the fourth quarter, the Ravens were in position
to gain the lead when a call was reversed after an instant replay.
Billy Davis, a Baltimore wide receiver, caught a sideline pass and
appeared to get only one foot inbounds. The pass was ruled
incomplete by the game officials. The Ravens challenged the ruling
and the controversial call was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   An interception by Giants rookie Andre Weathers ended the
Ravens' scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were 0-4 in replay challenges during the preseason,
counting challenges they made of calls and ones made by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a belly full of them,'' Fassel said of the replay
reversals. ``With my luck right now, you might never see another
replay challenge out of me.''

 &HT;    8 killed in Florida plane crash
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pilot's voice was calm when he
radioed the control tower at Palm Beach International Airport in
the middle of the night asking for clearance to land. Two minutes
later, air traffic controllers heard a garbled plea for help, then
a loud and clear ``Mayday!'' Seconds later, another pilot saw the
glow of the burning plane on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Beechcraft King Air BE-90, which was carrying a Manalapan
doctor and seven employees, struck the corner of a pool supply
warehouse near just before 3:30 a.m. Friday _ and about a half-mile
from the PBIA runway it was trying to reach. The plane apparently
somersaulted, striking powerlines and the airport's outer fence,
then burst into flames and killing all on board.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Constantine Chambers, a pioneering hair replacement surgeon
who operates clinics in Florida and three other states, was
returning from a late evening of surgery in Troy, Mich., family
friends said. The plane was en route from Pontiac, Mich., to Boca
Raton, but the pilot radioed PBIA at 3:23 a.m. asking permission to
land there instead. He gave no reason. Investigators said it was
not clear Friday night whether the pilot at the controls was
Chambers _ the plane's owner and a student pilot _ or George Rivera
of Tampa, a professional pilot who often flew Chambers from clinic
to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Chambers' son-in-law, Peter Passaris, 30, of
Clearwater; Andrea Coolidge, 31, of Broward County; Shawn
Meckelburg, 19, of Lake Worth; Erica Jones, 22, of Boynton Beach;
Mindy Marino, 17, of West Palm Beach; and Alan Steven Rivera, 19,
of Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Alan Yurman
said all those aboard except the pilot were employed in Chambers'
hair restoration clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Meckelburg and Alan Rivera, no relation to the pilot, were
friends at John I. Leonard High School, where Meckelburg starred on
the football team. Rivera helped his pal get the job at Chambers'
clinic about six weeks ago, according to Meckelburg's mother,
Deborah, who sat at home Friday night watching the news of her
son's death in a room full of family photos.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators may not know for months what caused the crash,
said Yurman. Witnesses in the area reported hearing ``a funny
noise'' coming from the plane just before the crash, Yurman said,
but there ``was no definite inflection (of stress) in his voice''
when the pilot first called for the unscheduled landing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from Pontiac, Mich., late Thursday with seven
people on board, according to NTSB investigators. They were looking
into a report that it landed in or near Atlanta and picked up
another passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was approaching the airport from the northwest at
about 120 mph when it struck the northeast corner of the Luria
Plaza shopping center. The main landing gear of the twin-engine
prop punctured the concrete-and-tin roof of the pool and spa
company's warehouse, snapping off part of the landing gear and
spewing hydraulic fluid over boxes and equipment stored below. The
wheel then bounced off the inside wall and landed against boxes of
pool filters, leaving shattered concrete and roofing tiles
scattered inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   The plane skidded off the top of the building and flipped,
striking power lines and landing near a wooded area on the
airport's property. The fuselage landed upside down, though the
plane's twisted tail remained upright.
</P>
<P>
   John Rohde, a BellSouth technician repairing cable along
Military Trail, was the first on the scene. Deputies searching for
a robbery suspect in the area were close behind. The cockpit had
erupted into flames before the men arrived, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a bang and a boom,'' said Dep. Steven Lipinski, who
was a couple of blocks away. He rushed to the scene, and could see
the glow from the flames behind the building as he approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The propeller was still spinning and one of the winglights was
still flashing,'' Lipinski said. ``The cabin was in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski and Rohde did not try to approach the cockpit because
``there were no voices, no screaming,'' Lipinski said. ``There was
nothing to indicate there was anyone in there to save.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could not say Friday whether the victims died
because of the fire or on impact. There was no indication the plane
was on fire in the air, Yurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue employees spent hours Friday
morning removing the victims from the gnarled plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do some cutting and some removal of the airplane
parts to get to the victims,'' Yurman said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials moved the plane's debris to a hangar at PBIA to
continue the investigation. They planned to finish their on-site
investigation by Sunday, Yurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and his employees often flew between medical clinics,
family friends said. He worked long hours _ often finishing work
late in the evening _ and flew home to his wife Susan and their
young son, Alexander. He enjoyed the flights, said Palm Beach
sculptor John Raimondi, who has known Chambers for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he did in life. He drove his own plane, he drove
his own Rolls Royce.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamber's family, including his grown children from a previous
marriage, were devastated, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely horrible,'' Raimondi said. ``(Alexander) was
running around as if nothing's happened, not knowing while
everyone's upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff reporters Ron Hayes, Trebor Banstetter, Mary Ellen
Flannery, Lillian Weis, Tim O'Meilia, Stephanie Desmon and
researchers Sammy Alzofon and Dorothy Shea contributed to this
report.

A MYSTERIOUS COMPONENT ROILS MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A cryptographer for a Canadian software firm,
dissecting a piece of Microsoft security software, made an
unexpected find: an element in the Windows operating system labeled
``NSAKey.''
</P>
<P>
   When his discovery was made known on his company's Web site
Friday, it set off a firestorm of Orwellian visions in Internet
discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Was the buried software component, as the cryptographer
surmised, a Trojan horse that gave the National Security Agency a
hidden back door into the world's computers? Or was it merely a
Microsoft programmer's remarkably bad choice of language in a
software system designed to protect electronic communications and
commerce?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives insisted that there was no Big Brother
feature in the software. ``The big answer is that these charges are
completely false,'' said Scott Culp, a security product manager at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Security Agency, which gathers
electronic-signal intelligence worldwide and is responsible for the
security of the government's computers, issued a terse
three-sentence news release distancing itself from the controversy,
saying, ``Questions about specific products should be addressed to
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft officials acknowledged that the episode was a
black eye for the world's largest software publisher. ``We're going
to pay and pay and pay for this,'' said one of the company's
security experts, who spoke on the grounds that he not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Microsoft has become a lightning rod for
criticism of its products' security and has had to deal with
several gaffes, including the discovery last week of a security
flaw that exposed the e-mail of users of its Hotmail service.
</P>
<P>
   The latest uproar was set off by Andrew Fernandes, a
mathematician in Research Triangle Park, N.C., who is chief
scientist of Cryptonym Corp., a small Canadian-based software firm
that is developing computer security products.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes first presented his findings at a technical meeting
last month in Southern California, but word did not spread more
broadly until Friday, when a news release was posted on the
Cryptonym Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Fernandes said he had made his
discovery while exploring and trying to replicate the security
software in Microsoft's Windows and Windows NT operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The operating systems make use of a key _ a large number _ to
authenticate software components, providing confidence that a
component is correctly identified and has not been tampered with.
For example, when new encryption functions are added for security,
the key verifies that they comply with government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptographers had previously noted the existence of a second
key whose use they could not account for. What Fernandes found in
the program was an identifying tag, disguised in earlier versions.
And the label was ``NSAKey.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery shocked him, Fernandes said. ``It doesn't make any
sense why they would put in a second key,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the key represented a serious security flaw
that would leave Microsoft's operating system vulnerable to
intrusion. ``The result is that it is tremendously easier for the
NSA to load unauthorized security services on all copies of
Microsoft Windows, and once these security services are loaded,
they can effectively compromise your entire operating system,'' his
news release asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But at Microsoft, Culp said the key labeled NSAKey was a backup
permitting Microsoft to authenticate encryption components if the
first key was damaged. And he said the name was simply unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Because the key ensures compliance with federal export laws, and
the National Security Agency is the authority responsible for
reviewing software and hardware products intended for foreign use,
the component has been referred to colloquially at Microsoft as the
``NSA key,'' he said. But he insisted that the key is not shared
with any outside party, including the NSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We protect it with dobermans and barbed wire,'' he said.
``Conspiracy theorists are worked up about this, but real life is
more boring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Security and privacy experts were generally skeptical about the
notion that Microsoft was cooperating with the nation's electronic
intelligence agency. Microsoft has vocally opposed proposals by law
enforcement and intelligence agencies that would give them
electronic back doors to monitor computer data.
</P>
<P>
   Some security experts said that even if there was no sinister
explanation for the NSAKey, Microsoft should not add components to
its security software system without publicly identifying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've debased their currency once again by not disclosing
this,'' said Mark Seiden, chief consultant for the information
security group Kroll-Ogara.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said there had been no reason to publicize
the backup key. ``It was not something that anyone had expressed
any interest in,'' Culp said.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, the Big Brother that Fernandes said he had
discovered turned out to have an Achilles heel. He said he had been
able to develop a small program that strips out the second key.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis' expression didn't change: with the
smile of a barracuda that knows where its next meal is coming from,
she squashed her inexperienced third round opponent Friday and then
chugged ahead to the next bit of stage business at the U.S. Open, a
public reconciliation with Richard Williams and, by proxy, his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Hingis merrily accused Richard Williams of having
``a big mouth,'' a description she felt he earned by insisting
Venus and Serena Williams would monopolize the 1999 women's final,
and one day after Serena Williams sniped back in her dad's defense
and lamented Hingis' lack of formal education, the 18-year-old
Swiss star struck up a timely detente with all of the Williamses.

   Just after pleasing the capacity crowd at the Louis Armstrong
Stadium with an increasingly spunky 6-3, 6-1 demolition of Sandra
Kloesel, a 213th-ranked German qualifier with insufficient
credentials to trouble her, Hingis extended her generosity to
Richard Williams by presenting him with an autographed T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   According to her, he'd been pestering her to autograph his arm
for months now, and this seemed the perfect moment to present him
with something more substantial. The ink on autographed arms, noted
Hingis, tends to wash off in the shower: why waste her time and
ink?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to fit you; it's extra-large,'' said
Hingis, dwarfed but not intimidated by the hulking Williams
patriarch, as she proffered the shirt. ``Now you don't have to ask
me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After the exchange was made, they hugged and mugged for the
cameras, then Williams hustled off to Arthur Ashe Stadium to view
his daughters' doubles match and left her to do the explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was happy to oblige. According to her, Richard Williams'
talk of an all-in-family finale here has been more of an
inspiration than an insult. As for Serena Williams' observation
that Hingis might have picked up a little more Swiss diplomacy by
spending more time getting ``a formal education'' there, Hingis
said she didn't feel inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any education? I don't think I'm that dumb,'' she
grinned. ``I'd like to see some other people talking in three
languages; it's not always easy. It's a little misunderstanding
sometimes what I say,'' she said, referring to the
misinterpretations of her reaction to Richard William's Open
prediction. It was the father, not the daughters, she labeled a big
mouth. ``It wasn't them; it was him. He always has his comments.
This is a free country, people are free, so they can say basically
whatever they want. You know, I still am going to try to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And then came the stinger: ``You know, it's fun. Because I'm
better than them so far. I'm the number one, and not them.''
According to Hingis, she and Serena Williams smoothed over the
hubbub by having a laugh in the locker room. ``I don't take it that
serious; things happen. But I don't want to become this is the main
thing: it's still tennis. That should still be the number one thing
people should be interested about.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Williams controversy under control, Hingis turned her
attention tennis and her Round of 16 assignment, 10th-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the 1994 Open champion she's beaten in
their last 11 meetings. Sanchez-Vicario, who advanced with a 6-2,
6-2 defeat of Patty Schnyder, hasn't solved Hingis since their
first meeting on clay four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arantxa always gets where she's supposed to get; you have to
take her quite serious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran who failed to get where she was supposed was
eighth-seeded Jana Novotna, a 6-3, 6-2 casualty to the powerful
passing shot of a reinvigorated Anke Huber, who's used the comeback
of her beau Andrei Medvedev, the runner-up to Andre Agassi at the
French Open, for guidance. The 30-year-old Novotna complained that
she's not the player she was when she won the Wimbledon title last
year, not since spraining her right ankle in a collision with her
doubles partner, Natasha Zvereva, at the French Open this June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I cannot get my movement back, and obviously I was
overpowered out there today,'' said Novotna, who hinted that the
injury could hasten her retirement. ``It's not a point here, a
point there; it's a lack of confidence and lack of matches and lack
of movement that I'm missing in my game. If I feel I cannot
physically be out there and stay in the top ten, then I will think
about leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Novotna, the women's side lost 13th-seeded Dominique
Van Roost of Belgium, who surrendered without a fight, 7-5, 6-0, to
unseeded Mary Joe Fernandez, a two-time Open semifinalist. The only
seeded loser from the men's quadrant was Ecuador's 16th-seeded
Nicholas Lapentti, who fell to Fredrik Jonsson 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5
in 3 hours 7 minutes. ``I'm disappointed because my hopes for this
tournament were much, much bigger, and I lost in the second
round,'' said Lapentti after failing to replicate the hard-court
prowess, like a semifinal finish at the Australian Open, in his
first slam as a seeded contender.
</P>
<P>
   The last time 206th-ranked Richey Reneberg, who received a
second-hand wild card into the 1999 draw after an injured MaliVai
Washington turned it down, passed the Open's third round was five
years ago _ and he defaulted with a hamstring injury during his
Round of 16 match with Todd Martin. This time the 33-year-old
Reneberg faced the seventh-seeded Martin in the third round, and
although he hung in until the final point, that point went to
Martin: the seventh-seed used 20 aces of his own, and 30 unforced
errors from Reneberg, to advance 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the disappearance of four-time champion Pete Sampras
and two-time champion Patrick Rafter from his half of the draw did
not necessarily gild his path: ``If they pull out or if they lose
or if something happens to them, it's still difficult to get to
where you would have had to play them. I have a lot of work left to
do,'' said Martin, who's already played ten sets in two matches.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the hard court form that carried him to his first and
only Grand Slam final at the 1997 Open, ninth-seeded Greg Rusedski
crushed David Prinosil 6-4, 6-3, 6-1.

SHUTTLE FLEET IS GROUNDED BY DAMAGE TO WIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's fleet of four space shuttles will be
grounded at least until the end of October while technicians
continue detailed inspections that have already turned up numerous
cases of wiring damage, NASA officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians have discovered dozens of nicked or exposed wires so
far in shuttle inspections and are repairing the faults as they are
found, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the findings so far, they said, shuttle managers
decided Thursday to expand the wire inspections into additional
areas on the space vehicles, and this could add up to two weeks to
the process of getting them ready to fly again. In any event, at
least one shuttle mission will have to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious situation, and we are treating it as such,''
said Ron Dittemore, the shuttle program's manager, in a telephone
interview on Friday. ``I've ordered a stand-down of the shuttles to
complete these inspections, and we are not going to fly again until
we understand what we have and get it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle wiring inspections have been going on for about a month
because of problems experienced by Columbia on its last flight. On
July 23, five seconds into that flight, a short circuit knocked out
computer controllers for two of the shuttle's three main engines.
Backup computers took over the job, and the mission, to place the
Chandra X-Ray Telescope into orbit, was successful. But technicians
later traced the problem to a bent wire whose insulation had been
torn away, which shorted when it touched a metal screw head.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections of the shuttles Endeavour and Discovery are now
about 75 percent complete and have so far identified dozens of
instances of damaged wiring in the recesses of the vehicles. As of
late this week, inspectors had discovered 38 spots with exposed or
damaged wiring in Endeavour and 26 in Discovery, causing managers
to expand the checking, which had initially included areas like the
engine compartment and the cockpit, to more remote wiring,
including that under the floor of the cargo bays.
</P>
<P>
   Full inspection of Atlantis will begin later this month at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where Endeavour and Discovery are
now being serviced. Columbia is being taken off flight status for a
previously scheduled 10-month, $80-million overhaul at a Boeing
plant in Palmdale, Calif., and will have full wiring inspections
done there.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are expected to have examined about half the 200
miles of electrical wiring in each shuttle by the time they are
finished.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the replacement of damaged wiring, technicians
are adding protection against future problems. Among the steps:
encasement of some wires in plastic tubing, addition of Teflon
wrapping to others and replacement of some connectors with more
robust versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of wiring problems we've found has come as a little
bit of a surprise to us,'' said Dittemore. ``At first, we thought
we'd find one or two in each vehicle, just by the nature of the
jobs we do in them'' _ maintenance and other work that requires a
lot of moving around _ between flights. ``It appears our inspection
routines have not been as rigorous as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The latest inspections show that the shuttles have flown for
years with some of these wiring problems, Dittemore said, a
testament to their robust design and the numerous safety backups
built into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Dittemore said all the wiring problems appeared to have been
caused by work-related mechanical damage that stemmed from the
wires' being rubbed or stepped on, or from heavy objects set down
on them. None of the problems, he said, appears related to age of
the wiring, normal wear or vibrations from shuttle operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Future remedies being examined, he said, include changes in work
rules to prevent inadvertent wire damage by workers, changes in
work platforms to prevent people or tools from touching certain
parts of the shuttle and the addition of more detailed wire
inspections to the processing that each vehicle undergoes between
flights.
</P>
<P>
   If all inspections and repairs of wiring are completed promptly,
the soonest a shuttle could fly would be at the end of October,
Dittemore said. Endeavour had been scheduled to fly a 10-day
mission to map the Earth with radar Sept. 16, and Discovery had
been set to conduct an emergency servicing mission to the Hubble
Space Telescope sometime in October.

NO. 1 IS BIGGEST DRAW AS CROWD SETS RECORD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Record crowds are contending for the same number of
seats at the 18 competition courts of the U.S. Open, so some people
do not get to see the matches they want.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Friday afternoon's record crowd of 29,042 wanted to
watch Martina Hingis, seeded first among the women, play Sandra
Kloesel in the second match of the day in Louis Armstrong Stadium.
When the first match there lasted 2 hours 59 minutes before Tommy
Haas beat Mariano Puerta in five sets, early arrivals for
Hingis-Kloesel slipped into the empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   The public-address system and in-house television soon warned
those not in Louis Armstrong Stadium that the 10,000 seats there
were filled. The optimists were undaunted. A half-hour before
Hingis and Kloesel took the court, 145 people stood in line, hoping
to get a peek at Hingis. When the match began, most of the
optimists were still in line.
</P>
<P>
   Lapentti Takes Loss in Stride
</P>
<P>
   This shaped up as the breakthrough tournament for 23-year-old
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador. Until this year, he had never been
ranked higher than 55th in the world, but in 1999 he has reached
the final of the Swiss Open and the semifinals at the Australian
Open and tournaments in Hamburg and Amsterdam. Then he won the RCA
tournament in Indianapolis, and his ranking rose to 16th.
</P>
<P>
   He was seeded 16th at the Open, but his dream ended Friday in
the second round. Fredrik Jonsson of Sweden, who had to go through
the qualifying tournament because he ranks 148th, upset Lapentti,
6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up serving very big,'' Lapentti said, ``and he was the
one that took the chances. He was much more aggressive, and I felt
like I was under pressure the whole time. I'm just disappointed,
not because I lost to a bad player. I'm disappointed because my
hopes for this tournament were much, much bigger, and I lost in the
second round. It happens. It has been a great year so far. I just
have to forget about this and just keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ball Stays in the Park
</P>
<P>
   Mets third baseman Robin Ventura and Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands each attempted to become the first person to hit a
tennis ball out of Arthur Ashe Stadium, the Open's main arena. Both
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stadium opened in 1997, many players have tried to
clear the walls. Jay Snyder, the tournament director, said only Jim
Courier had come close, and he reached only the sixth row from the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis broke Courier's record, reaching the fourth row from
the top. Ventura, using a tennis racquet and then a baseball bat,
reached only halfway up the top tier.
</P>
<P>
   But the day wasn't a washout for Ventura. Because the Mets
played Friday night in Shea Stadium, he stayed for the afternoon
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's Lessons on Life
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Jennifer Capriati became the youngest Grand Slam seeded
player, youngest Grand Slam semifinalist and youngest top-10
player. In later years, she lost motivation, got into minor
troubles with the law and quit the tour for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 23, she has reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open,
where she will play 11th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CBS Sports, Capriati said her problems were
not a result of too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never regret anything in my past,'' she said. ``It's what
happened. Maybe it's been my fault because I've never really opened
up about the past or what happened. I'm sure no one wants to be
hassled about every little thing they did. I feel like I'm still
young. I've been on both sides of the spectrum, and I realize I
want to be on the most healthy path that I can be on.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, from Wesley Chapel, Fla., said she finally got rid of
wrong friends. She said it was not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not when I realized what I wanted,'' she said. ``It was like,
`What am I doing?' I don't want to be brought down, peer pressure
and all that stuff. I was never really pressured like that before.
Everything I have to learn, I have to learn by myself in order to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when I turned 20 or so, I just started to think about
what I wanted. This is the start of my independence now. I really
don't feel like a child anymore. I feel like I'm in total control
of my life. Whatever I do from this point on is up to me.''

   TV-PBS-LOVESTORY (Undated) _ At first glance, to the camera's
casual eye, the most conspicuous aspect of the Wilson-Sims family
is that the mother looks like an interloper. Karen Wilson is a
slightly built white woman. Her children, Cicily Wilson and Chaney
Sims, resemble their father, and not only because their skin is
dark. With their strong jaw lines and tall builds, you would pick
them out of a roomful of other young black women as Bill Sims'
daughters. The physical differences are part of what makes the
family's obvious affection so touching.

film, an adaption of Edith Wharton's ``House of Mirth.'' She had

British performers have acquired a sizable following since meeting
at a clown school in Paris a little more than 10 years ago.
Absurdist drollery with a sprinkling of Sartre and a dash of
Beckett might describe their most popular show so far: about being
locked in a bathroom with a stranger for 25 years. On Sept. 8 that
show, ``Do You Come Here Often?,'' will mark the New York debut of
Sean Foley, 34, and Hamish McColl, 37. The work, which runs through

Livingston, N.J., have mostly been packed up and shipped out. About
20 percent of his collection was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame,
where a wing named for this collector non pareil has been built.
Most of the rest of the collection will be sold at a weeklong
auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan, beginning on Sept. 23, which,
according to Sotheby's, has a chance to break the house record of

   MUSIC-WAGNER (Bayreuth, Germany) _ Does Bayreuth's cult of
Wagner still matter? Some mavens say no and stay away. In the first
decades after World War II, timeless, ascetic, psychologically
profound stagings by the composer's grandson Wieland Wagner
revitalized the tradition. After Wieland's death, in 1966, other
pioneering directors carried on. The last thunderclap from
Bayreuth's Green Hill sounded in 1976, with the unveiling of the
post-modern centennial ``Ring,'' directed by Patrice Chereau and
conducted by Pierre Boulez. Since then, wherever opera is
performed, the array of theatrical styles has exploded
exponentially. Iconoclasts from Arizona to Australia are forging
``Rings'' of their own, with or without regard to Bayreuth
precedent. If the festival no longer enjoys its old hegemony, that
is simply a measure of its success. These days, Wagner belongs to
the world. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

there were only two choices among luxury touring bikes: the
Harley-Davidson Electra Glide or the Honda Gold Wing. Both are very
good long-distance bikes, and both are made in America. These are
motorcycles that come with AM/FM radios, CB radios, tape players
and cigarette lighters, in addition to a large, powerful engine,
the traditional windshield, saddle bags, cargo box and plenty of
cushy seat room for two. They are, essentially, two-wheeled cars.
Now BMW has created the K1200LT, the new absolute ruler of the

 TERRY McAULIFFE: MASTER FUND-RAISER IS ALSO CLINTON'S PERSONAL (With sidebar, CLINTONS-HOUSE-DEAL) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is a competition for first friend, Terry
McAuliffe would seem to be setting a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Charming, energetic, irreverent and equally skilled at raising
money and making it, McAuliffe has proven to be a life saver, both
politically and personally, for President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in coming to the aid of the Clintons this week by agreeing
to put up $1.35 million of his own money, in cash, to help them
with their purchase of a $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
McAuliffe put himself in an especially remarkable position:
personal financial benefactor to the most powerful man in the land
in an era when connections and access to powerful people are more
lucrative than ever. The Democratic National Committee had its most
successful event earlier in June in a tribute to a McAuliffe, which
raised $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who has grown wealthy from 20 years at the nexus of
business investments and political fund raising, will put $1.35
million into an interest-bearing account at Bankers Trust in New
York to provide rock-solid assurance to the bank that its $1.35
million mortgage loan to the Clintons, who have $5.5 million in
legal debt, will be secure.
</P>
<P>
   Though the deal probably could have been structured some other
way, McAuliffe's involvement clearly helped the Clintons get the
house at a more favorable interest rate. Still, the White House
said Friday that McAuliffe's money did not constitute a gift under
government ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the real estate deal, McAuliffe's efforts on behalf
of the Clintons have been on an exceptional scale. He has solicited
millions of dollars in donations for their legal defense fund, the
president's planned library in Arkansas, the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, Mrs. Clinton's likely run for the Senate and their
planned gala on the Washington Mall to mark the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly helps the president _ ``the Big Guy'' to him _
relax or blow off steam with a golf game, a glass of wine or guy
talk. And he never objects when Clinton bends the rules on the golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has grown in prominence in Washington and in
Democratic circles around the country, McAuliffe has encountered
persistent questions about the ways he has used his connections and
visibility in the business world, forcing him to fend off legal and
ethical questions that have only intensified since Thursday with
the announcement of his role in the Clintons' purchase of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is increasingly held up by critics of the
current campaign finance system as the embodiment of a class of
Washingtonians who mix politics and money, public service and
personal opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably no one has more and longer tentacles into the worlds
of money and politics than Terry McAuliffe,'' said Ellen Miller,
executive director of Public Campaign, an organization promoting
changes to the campaign finance system. ``It's an unhealthy
relationship for anyone to have to the president and first lady. In
a way, he has incredible power over them and incredible power
through them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has always defended his conduct as legal and ethical.
He has chalked up the criticism as part of the rough and tumble of
big-league politics and says he raises money for the president
because he likes him and expects nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could he do for me?'' McAuliffe asked in a recent
interview about Clinton, suggesting he has everything he needs. He
said he does not lobby the president and knows little about
legislation. ``I don't know how to get a bill through Congress,''
he said. ``I couldn't name you 20 members.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been called to testify or provide information in
a range of criminal, civil and congressional investigations, he has
never been the target or subject of any criminal inquiry and has
always cooperated fully, said his lawyer, Richard Ben Veniste, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several of his business dealings have come under legal
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Labor Department investigated a deal under which
McAuliffe convinced a union pension fund in 1991 to put up the
money for the purchase of some Florida land. McAuliffe put in no
money of his own but saw a $2.4 million profit, according to the
Orlando Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago federal prosecutors examined McAuliffe's role in
helping Prudential Insurance Co. lease a building to a Government
agency. Prudential paid McAuliffe $375,000 for helping to insure
that the deal was not derailed by any last-minute opposition and
was later charged with falsely certifying that it had not paid
anyone to influence the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential settled the case without admitting wrongdoing, and
McAuliffe was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 1996 presidential election, McAuliffe was
questioned about his role in a fund-raising effort at the Teamsters
union that led to the ouster of the union's president, Ron Carey.
But he was never a subject of the investigation, Ben-Veniste said.

EARNHARDT-LABONTE BUZZ DOMINATES DARLINGTON TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Kenny Irwin won the pole for the 50th running
of tomorrow's Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, the oldest
superspeedway on the NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's A.J. Foyt announced plans to field a NASCAR Winston
Cup team next year.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup star Ernie Irvan said he is retiring as a driver,
effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Petty announced that after almost 30 years, STP will
no longer be the primary sponsor of the No. 43 car, beginning in
July.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic drawing the most attention yesterday at Darlington
remained Dale Earnhardt vs. Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt spun out Labonte on the last lap Saturday, causing a
multicar crash, and won the Goody's 500 at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor
Speedway. NASCAR officials reviewed the incident but did not
penalize Earnhardt although Jerry Nadeau was penalized two laps
earlier in the race when he spun out Dale Jarrett. The
controversial finish elicited boos at Victory Lane last week and
more comments from drivers and NASCAR officials yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, senior vice president and chief operating officer
of NASCAR, said the Nadeau-Jarrett accident could have been
avoided, but officials could not conclude that the
Earnhardt-Labonte incident was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR legend Richard Petty, however, called the wreck blatant,
and other drivers agreed. Helton conceded that NASCAR officials are
human and judgment calls are debatable. But he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that the drivers ... would prefer to race and
not be afraid in attempting to pass someone and have an accident
occur and then face a penalty from that. NASCAR is all about
fender-to-fender and door-to-door racing. That plays a big role in
our judgment calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who after the incident warned that Earnhardt had better
tighten his belts, said he has put the shove behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go on and work toward this week and the rest of
the season,'' the Corpus Christi native said. ``We can't let what
happened last week affect anything. Unfortunately it happened, and
I hate it happened, and I'm sure Dale hates it. It just did.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, however, added that he is surprised Earnhardt hasn't
talked to him about the wreck. ``We're parked next to each other in
the garage,'' he said. ``I'm sure before the weekend is over we'll
run into each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said that both drivers have been busy since Bristol
and that he plans to talk to Labonte when the media aren't around.
``I have a lot of respect for Terry,'' he said. ``We've got along
good all the years we've raced together.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be retaliation?
</P>
<P>
   Labonte said you can't hold grudges in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, the '50s and '60s, they would have been out
scrapping in the garage,'' driver Sterling Marlin said. ``But you
can't do that these days. Terry might not get him back this week,
next week, next month or next year, but he'll get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The big winner is Jim Hunter, president of Darlington Raceway.
Hunter said the track received 1,300 phone calls Monday, and 1,400
Tuesday. Approximately 3,200 tickets to tomorrow's race have been
sold this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: Veniste said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has never been shy about his relationship with the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, he helped sponsor a fund-raiser for Mrs.
Clinton's expected Senate campaign at Mulrooney's Bar in his native
Syracuse, N.Y. He told the crowd of 400 people crammed in that he
had ``no closer friends than the president and the first lady.'' No
one doubted him. The goal for the evening was $25,000. McAuliffe,
who packed the place with friends and family, pulled in $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event was as much a celebration of McAuliffe as it was a
fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At age 42, McAuliffe, who got his start in national politics
raising money for President Jimmy Carter's unsuccessful 1980
re-election campaign, is perceived among Democrats as the man with
the Midas touch. His favors are sought by many and granted to few.
Vice President Al Gore, who has so far failed to woo him to his
presidential campaign, has called him ``the greatest fund-raiser in
the history of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Richard McAuliffe was born in Syracuse in 1957, the son
of a real estate agent. Terry, as he is known, was the youngest in
an Irish Catholic family of four boys, an experience that friends
say helped him form his exuberance for the rough-and-tumble world
of politics and his fierce sense of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Of his support for Clinton throughout the impeachment scandals,
McAuliffe once said: ``I won't desert him. I'll stick with him
through thick and thin. That's an Irish trait.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He attended Catholic University in Washington, graduating in
1979 with a major in political science. In 1984, he graduated from
Georgetown Law School but never practiced law. He had already
become something of a wunderkind in the world of political fund
raising, working closely with Richard Swann, Carter's Florida
chairman. In 1988, McAuliffe married Swann's daughter, Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   The best man at his wedding was Tony Coelho, who is now running
Gore's campaign for president. For a while, it looked as though
Gore might be challenged by another McAuliffe pal, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, who was an usher at McAuliffe's wedding and gave the
McAuliffe children a surprise of a golden retriever puppy for
Christmas three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though Gephardt has declined to run for president,
McAuliffe has told friends he is too overextended to answer Gore's
plea to spearhead fund raising at the Democratic National
Committee, although he plans to help Gore raise money next year.
McAuliffe and his wife, who live in McLean, Va., are expecting
their fourth child in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton is 10 years older than McAuliffe, they have
become extremely close. The president often drapes his arm around
McAuliffe and seeks him out in a crowd. ``He feels comfortable with
Terry,'' said Doug Sosnick, a senior adviser to the president. ``He
doesn't feel like Terry wants anything from him. There's a level of
trust there, and when you're president, it's hard to know who you
can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly how wealthy McAuliffe is. Most of his
business dealings in the past few years have been in home building
and real estate, though he has told associates of profiting
handsomely from investments in technology companies.

ERNIE IRVAN RETIRES AFTER RECENT CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ His voice cracking during a moment he
admittedly never thought he would have to face, a teary-eyed Ernie
Irvan yesterday announced his immediate retirement as a NASCAR
Winston Cup driver.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's announcement before a packed media center at Darlington
Raceway follows an Aug. 20 crash during practice at Michigan
Speedway that left him unconscious. That wreck came exactly five
years after Irvan suffered near-fatal injuries in an accident at
the same track.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, 40, said doctors did not tell him he had to retire but
warned that another accident would be ``detrimental to me to be
able to live a wholesome life.''
</P>
<P>
   With wife Kim, daughter Jordan and son Jared at his side, Irvan
thanked his family, team, fellow racers and friends for their
support throughout an up-and-down career. ``It's something that
brings tears to my eyes, knowing that I'll never drive a Winston
Cup car again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Irvan said her husband's decision to retire was his alone.
But she added: ``It was a miracle in '94, and most people don't get
one miracle, and we got ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan retires with 15 career victories, 22 pole positions, 68
top-five and 124 top-10 finishes in 313 starts.
</P>
<P>
   His most memorable victory came in June 1997 when he won at
Michigan almost three years after the serious crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to win there, that was an awesome thing,'' Irvan
said. ``Being able to win a Winston Cup race knowing that I almost
died at that racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nadeau has been driving the No. 36 M&AMP;M's Pontiac as
Irvan's replacement, a job he said he might keep for the rest of
the season before moving to the Hendrick Motorsports No. 25
Chevrolet next season. Irvan said he wants to remain active in
NASCAR, and MB2 Motorsports general manager Jay Frye said Irvan
will remain part of the team.  &LR; subheds:Foyt to field Cup team
Houston native A.J. Foyt announced that he will head a NASCAR
Winston Cup team beginning with next year's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, who already owns a two-car team in the Indy Racing League,
said he has a primary sponsor, Conseco, and a car number, 14, and
is building a shop in Charlotte, N.C. He doesn't, however, have a
driver, crew chief or car manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he would like to hire an experienced Cup driver but
would settle for one ``a little bit naive.'' He ruled out IRL
driver Kenny Brack, saying Brack doesn't have the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt won 67 Indy-car races as a driver and is the only driver to
win the Indianapolis 500, Daytona 500 and the 24 Hours of LeMans.
Any chance he'd drive the Cup car himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to,'' Foyt said with a smile. ``But I'm afraid that
time has passed me by.''  &LR; subheds:Irwin on pole Kenny Irwin earned
the pole position for tomorrow's 50th Pepsi Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin toured the 1.366-mile, egg-shaped oval in 170.970 mph in
the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus for his third career Cup
pole and first since the Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway in
March. Irwin outclassed Jeff Gordon, who qualified fourth with a
170.792-mph lap in his attempt to win a fifth consecutive Southern
500. And he was far better than Dale Jarrett, Irwin's teammate and
the Winston Cup points leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's left rear tire went flat during his qualifying run,
but he saved his Ford from tagging the wall, recording a
130.582-mph effort _ last among 45 cars _ that prevented him from
making the field during the first day of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regular Ward Burton won the pole for today's
Dura-Lube 200 Busch Grand National race. Burton claimed the spot
with a lap of 167.676 mph in the No. 2 Murray Pontiac. He qualified
second in the No. 22 Caterpillar Pontiac for the Pepsi Southern
500.  &LR; subheds:New look for Petty General Mills will become the
primary sponsor for the No. 43 Cup team owned by Richard Petty next
year, replacing STP, Petty's main sponsor for the past 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   STP will remain the primary sponsor for the Pontiac driven by
John Andretti through the June 2000 race in Sonoma, Calif. General
Mills will become the primary sponsor beginning with the Pepsi 400
in Daytona Beach, Fla. STP plans to continue its relationship with
Petty, but plans have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   With STP, Petty's team has won 73 races, four Daytona 500s and
four Winston Cup championships.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chanel Gilpin stood unsmiling as her mother cooed
about how cute she looked in her new school uniform: a blue,
pleated jumper with a short-sleeved yellow shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, who is in the fifth grade, was not upset about the
jumper, which basically resembled a barrel with straps, but about
the yellow shirt. She wanted to wear white. But only boys at Public
School 9 in Brooklyn are allowed to wear white, her mother, Cynthia
Malcolm, explained the other day while shopping at Cookie's, a
children's clothing store that specializes in school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with uniforms,'' said Mrs. Malcolm, a 42-year-old
native of Jamaica who grew up wearing school uniforms. ``Kids talk
about name brands, but not everyone can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a Board of Education policy passed in March 1998, students
at public elementary schools are required to wear uniforms
beginning this fall unless their schools have chosen to opt out of
the policy. Parents at participating schools can also submit a
written request for an individual exemption for their child.
</P>
<P>
   While students who fail to meet the uniform requirements cannot
be suspended or sent home, they may be supplied with a reprimand or
a loaner. To induce students to conform, some schools will provide
banners and certificates for classes that have 100 percent
compliance for a week, or offer pizza parties for those that comply
for a month, said Philip Russo, a spokesman for the board.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 163 of the city's 672 elementary schools have agreed to
participate, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the board. But
additional schools may join before Nov. 1, the deadline to notify
board officials, she said. Schools that opt out of the program
generally do so because of strong parental resistance.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Thompson Jr., president of the board, who spearheaded
the dress code effort, said he expected more than half of the
city's elementary schools to have a uniform policy in place this
school year. Last year, more than 300 schools participated in the
program voluntarily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say that about 70 percent of the schools
will participate,'' he said. ``Our strong anecdotal experience is
even where youngsters were at first resistant, they come to like
them a great deal after they become required.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents like Chanel's mother, the new policy translates into
savings. Mrs. Malcolm, an unemployed mother of three, said she was
pleased to get a break on the cost of clothes: uniform prices range
from about $40 to about $100 for a complete outfit, according to a
report by the city's Consumer Affairs Department that was released
last week. Students are allowed to buy their clothes from any store
as long as the clothes fit their school's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city that defies uniformity, there are bound to be
protesters. Daniel J. Lipsman, 54, a retired high school and
college teacher who lives in Washington Heights, filed a lawsuit
last year to prevent his 11-year-old daughter, Angela, a student at
P.S. 187, from even having to opt out of the policy. But the suit,
filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan claiming a violation
of civil rights, was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in Long Beach, Calif., the first district in the
country to adopt a mandatory policy, in 1994, say they are
convinced that uniforms have had a positive influence on their
70,000 students, though no independent research confirms a link
between uniforms and academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``School uniforms bespeak authority,'' Carl A. Cohn, the
superintendent the Long Beach Unified School System, said last
week. ``This is a system where the adults are still in charge. If
you listen to anecdotal information from teachers, youngsters come
to school more focused on the business of learning. That has to be
a healthy sign.''

NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO, TCU ``COCKROACHES'' ENDED TEXAS'
NATIONAL-TITLE HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Buddy Iles needs only to hear the word
cockroach and an image from Nov. 18, 1961, begins forming in his
mind as if being diagrammed on John Madden's Telestrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny \RGibbs\S turned and tossed to the halfback,'' said
Iles, an end on the 1961 TCU team. ``Larry \RThomas\S showed power
sweep and instead tossed back to Sonny.''
</P>
<P>
   Iles paused, retracing his steps. He remembered racing downfield
then slashing inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught the Texas defense rotating around to the other
side,'' Iles recalled. ``I was standing there all by myself. Sonny
must have thrown it 10 miles high. I didn't think it was ever going
to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs' 50-yard pass landed in his hands and he lunged forward
for TCU's game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the crazy thing is?'' Iles said. ``As I was
waiting for the ball, I knew that was going to be something I'd
remember for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Iles' memory has faded just a bit since then. A sign of age and
almost 40 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But TCU's 6-0 upset of No. 1 Texas that day remains as fresh as
if engraved in his memory yesterday. He became a ``cockroach'' that
day, sealing arguably TCU's biggest upset in the past 50 years by
denying Texas a chance at the mythical national championship.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Longhorns coach Darrell Royal compared TCU to a
cockroach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what he eats or totes off, but what he falls into and
messes up,'' Royal said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances for a memory-making upset like that come along once in a
blue moon, Iles said. Nearly 40 years have passed and Iles sees a
blue moon rising as TCU prepares to play No. 15 Arizona at 6:30
tomorrow night at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're supposed to be good, picked to have a chance
to win a national championship and all in the preseason,'' Iles
said of Arizona. ``Texas was kind of like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas came in ranked No. 1, with 41 of 47 first-place votes in
The Associated Press poll that week. Texas needed only to defeat
TCU and Texas A&AMP;M a week later to capture a national championship.
TCU, 2-4-1, traveled to Austin a 24-point underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had stayed in Temple and were driving to Austin. It was
obvious we were a joke,'' TCU defensive end Ben Nix said. ``Donny
Smith and I walked around the track \Rbefore the game\S. You could
just sense they didn't think we had a chance. I turned to him and
said, `I'd sure like to beat them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs remembered thinking, ``They're going to beat us 100 to
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the locker room before the game seemed to echo
Gibbs' thoughts. Horned Frogs coach Abe Martin walked in and then
walked out, as close as the stoic coach came to nervous energy,
before returning to deliver his pregame speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is about to start. You know what you need to do. Now
go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it, at least, all of it that any of the guys can
remember. Martin was never one for words.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing they knew they were standing with their hands on
the 1-yard line and their feet in the end zone, trying to keep
Texas from going the 1 yard to a score on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Jack Collins lunged forward. TCU's Tommy Joe Crutcher
pushed him back, one of two goal-line stands by the Frogs in the
first quarter. Texas halfback James Saxton already had been
sidelined by a concussion from an earlier tackle, although he
returned to sustain another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a superior team lets the other one off the hook, whatever
advantage they had is gone,'' Crutcher said. ``We showed we could
stop them. Now, we just had to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs to Thomas to Gibbs to Iles handled that midway through
second-quarter action. At halftime, Martin said: ``Well, laddies,
you are doing good. I don't have anything to add.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the game was a blur of Longhorns chances followed by
Frogs' defensive stands, the last one coming midway through the
fourth quarter. Texas again traveled to within spitting distance of
TCU's end zone. Eight yards were all that separated Texas from
tying TCU. Mike Cotton began scrambling, trying to buy time to pass
to an open Collins. Instead, Crutcher and Iles sacked him for a
2-yard loss on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Iles remembered looking up and thinking, ``OK, six minutes. We
can do this.'' Martin, meanwhile, restricted his players to a
single play _ fullback dive. Crutcher's number was called again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Joe came to the huddle and he said, `I can't run another
step,' '' Iles recalled. ``Sonny looked him in the eye and said,
`You are going to run with it until you fall down.' And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Crutcher, TCU marched downfield as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Those memories remain. Gibbs, Crutcher and Iles talk of hearing
the crowd of 50,000 go silent. They mention the feeling of going
from the quiet of the stadium to the bedlam of their locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Iles remembered a hat that looked a lot like Coach Martin's
being thrown in the air but he wouldn't swear to it. The
unlikeliness of the victory didn't sink in at the time, Iles said.
It wasn't until years later when they were on the golf courses or
walking in their respective hometowns when old Longhorns alums
would walk up to them and utter the word.
</P>
<P>
   Cockroaches, they'd say. Then, they'd remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cockroaches,'' Gibbs said with a sigh. ``To this day, I still
hope Darrell Royal four-putts every green he's on when he plays
golf for that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel and the Palestinians, prodded by the presence
of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, agreed Friday night to a
sweeping peace deal which envisions finalizing the borders between
them and resolving the future of Jerusalem in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night by Albright, who spoke with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, at her side at his offices in
Gaza City, also calls for the completion of a land-for-security
agreement signed last fall in Wye, Md., which had been stalled
until the coming to office of the new Israeli prime minister, Ehud
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the new agreement is a plan to negotiate
a conceptual ``framework'' for a permanent settlement between
Israel and the Palestinians by February 15, 2000 and the conclusion
of detailed talks by next September.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called on both sides to refrain from taking
unilateral action, which is understood to mean that the
Palestinians will not unilaterally declare statehood before a peace
accord is reached and that Israel will not build new Jewish
settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had repeatedly declared over the past year that if no
agreement was reached , he would declare a Palestinian state by May
2000, the date on which the original Oslo agreements were to
conclude with a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement did not explicitly describe what sort of
Palestinian entity would be established at the end of the process,
leaving that to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On the land-for-security aspects of the Wye agreement, the
Israelis agreed to cede control over another 11 percent of the West
Bank in three stages _ in September, November and by January 20 _
said a senior American official. Israel has already withdrawn from
27 percent of the West Bank.
 &UR;  &LR; The last major hurdle in the negotiations leading up to Friday's
agreement was the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released
from Israeli jails. In the end, Arafat abandoned his demand for
400, and accepted Israel's offer to release 350, a senior Israeli
official said. Israel resisted releasing Palestinians ``with
Israeli blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive display of Middle East brinkmanship in the
past several days, the agreement Friday night came after the
veteran American envoy for the Middle East, Dennis Ross, spent the
day with the Israelis working on on the language of the deal, and
after the document was taken to Arafat by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   A signing ceremony was scheduled for Saturday night, after the
end of the Jewish Sabbath, with Albright, the Egyptian president,
Hosni Murbarak, and the Palestinian and Israeli leaders at the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai seacoast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a stifling hot reception room at Arafat's
headquarters in Gaza City, with her back to a huge painting of the
Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Ms. Albright praised both sides for
working together to reach a forward looking agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have seized a historic opportunity to tackle the issues
that will define their peace together for generations to come,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the secretary of state, who spent 3 1/2 hours
with Barak in the small hours of Friday morning, gave the two sides
a deadline to work against, and prodded them by her presence to
overcome the last obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Barak's request that the Americans play a more
modest role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations than in the
past three years, Albright's spokesman insisted before she left
Washington for this trip that it would be only to ``take stock.''
While the two sides had done the bulk of the work in more than 15
negotiating sessions before she came with the State Department's
top team of negotiators, her presence pushed the Israelis and
Palestinians over the finish line Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the usually forceful Albright remained anxious to
stress that she was not a mediator, perhaps not even a facilitator,
but something even more lowly. ``Perhaps I should not introduce a
new term into all this, but maybe I was just the handmaiden,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday night gives Albright a boost as she
travels to Syria on Saturday to meet with the Syrian leader,
Hafiz-al Assad, in an effort to persuade him to restart
negotiations with the Israelis that broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has expressed eagerness to settle with Syria but Assad's
apparent initial enthusiasm when the Israeli prime minister first
assumed office appears to have waned in recent weeks. With a
successful Israeli-Palestinian negotiation in hand, Albright will
be hoping that Assad does not want to be left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The central conflict in negotiating the modifications to the Wye
accords of last fall has been the competing longer term aim of
Barak and the shorter term goal of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, getting the transfer of West Bank land from Israeli
to Palestinian control that was pledged in the Wye agreement but
was stalled by the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, has been an essential short term goal. By accomplishing
that he can get more West Bank land and win the release of more
prisoners, Arafat can show his people that some progress has been
made in negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, the relinquishing of land _ 11 percent more of the
West Bank _ was not as enticing as getting the start of a process
that will determine the permanent relationship between Israel and
Palestinians and help shape an overall peace agreement that covers
Syria and Lebanon. The start of final status talks means dealing
with the biggest problems of all: the status of Jerusalem, the
return of refugees and the permanent boundaries of Israel in regard
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the accord finalized Friday night is the
February 15 target for a framework _ something like a declaration
of principles _ for this final status agreement. The nitty gritty
details of the framework would be completed sometime by September.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had been reluctant to set the February date, fearing that
if such a framework was agreed upon early in the new year Barak
would feel free to turn his attention away from the
Palestinian-Israeli relationship and look instead toward
negotiating with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point, apparently one of the last, was Arafat's
desire to be able to take such ``unilateral action'' as threatening
to declare a Palestinian state. He used this threat as leverage
earlier this year _ by pledging to delay the declaration of a
Palestinian state last May, Arafat won a promise from President
Clinton that he would call a summit of Middle East leaders within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, a member of Arafat's cabinet, Nabil
Shaath, the Minister of Planning, said Friday night that the
Americans had been helpful to the Palestinians on this matter in
``letters of assurance.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials indicated Friday night that the redeployment
of Israeli troops would begin within 10 days. Two further
redeployments would take place on Nov. 15 and Jan. 20, they said.
</P>
<P>
   These moves would leave 40 per- cent of the West Bank under full
or partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The release of 200 Palestinian pris- oners would also take place
within the next 10 days with another 150 released in early October,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the agreement on Saturday, work is set to
start on opening safe-passage routes across Israel that will allow
Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza, a move
intended to enhance economic development in both L places. As well,
construction of a seaport in Gaza, which was called for in the Wye
agreement but never got off the ground, will also start.
</P>
<P>
   The talks for the framework agreement on the final-status issues
are set to begin at once, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The target date of Feb. 15 is ambi- tious, officials said. But
by focusing on an early date, an American offi- cial said it was
hoped to focus both sides on the final outcome of how Israel and
the Palestinian lands would be shaped. Israeli officials said the
framework would also serve to defuse the threat of a unilateral
Palestinian declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The framework agreement would deal with the biggest issues like
bor- ders, Jerusalem, water rights and the return of refugees in a
broad sense, with the details to be complet- ed by next September.

 &HT;    Pillow talk led to confession of fatal torture, wife says
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few nights after investigators say Timmy Cole and
two friends tortured and killed a 17-year-old girl and left her
body in a creek, Cole cuddled in bed with his wife about 40 miles
away. The lights were dim. A compact disc player filled the room
with romantic music. Cole and his teen-age bride, Tabitha, decided
to swap secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Tabitha, I've cheated on you,''' the bride said
Friday. ``I said, `With who?' He said, `You don't have to worry
about that. She's dead now.'''
</P>
<P>
   This bit of pillow talk began a sequence of events that led
investigators to a creek at the bottom of a ravine in Morgan County
days later. There they found the body of Krystal Gayle Archer, with
broken bones, bruises, stab wounds and burns. Her assailants
tortured her over several days before one of them slit her throat.
The authorities lodged murder charges against two Covington men,
21-year-old Cole and 19-year-old Michael Teal, and a woman,
Danielle Hubbard, 18, formerly of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral ceremonies were held for Archer on Friday night in
Danielsville, about 20 miles north of Athens. Among the mourners
was Timothy xxHolloway, 18, of Athens, a former Clarke Central High
School classmate. ``I found out she was gone and I worried she
might have been dead,'' he said. When xxHalloway learned Krystal
had been killed, he ``just got in my car and drove back to Clarke
Central and places we hung out.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have struggled to find a motive for the killing
since they discovered Archer's body on Tuesday. But Tabitha Cole,
who gave birth to her and her husband's first son eight months ago,
thinks her release from a youth detention center created an awkward
tension his friends set out to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Her view is the second time that jealousy has been raised as a
possible motive in Archer's slaying. Police say Archer's three
friends turned on her when they were in a Morgan County pasture
looking for hallucinogenic mushrooms. They say Danielle Hubbard was
jealous because she thought Archer had been ``eyeing'' her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But Tabitha Cole leans more on the timing than the jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of the killing, she said, her 126-day stay at a
youth detention center ended. She said a judge sent her there for
violating a condition of probation _ she was arrested for
shoplifting while on probation in juvenile court for running away
from home. She said she was released in the first week of August
from a center in Emanuel, Ga. It was about this time or shortly
afterward _ authorities have had difficulty firmly establishing
dates _ that Archer was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I think all this happened is because I was
coming home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Pam Flaig, said Cole is upset at the notion that her
husband might have killed for the sake of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just like, `Oh my God! Are they sick enough to do this
for me?''' Flaig said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole brushed aside talk that Hubbard's jealousy triggered the
attack. She said Hubbard ``is far from the jealous type.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Ken Pritchett of Morgan County said Friday that his
detectives have uncovered ``a lot of factors, not just one'' to
explain the vicious attack. He confirmed that Cole told his wife
that he had been having an affair, but that the affair was over and
the woman was dead. He also confirmed Cole's stay in the detention
center.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said his department has obtained hotel receipts that
showed Archer and the three suspects spent the night in a hotel
Aug. 7, leaving after a wake-up call at 10:45 a.m. the next day. He
would not identify the hotel. Investigators first believed the
attacks happened between July 31 and Aug. 4, but Pritchett said
Friday that the attacks probably began on Aug. 8 and ended on Aug.
11 when Archer's throat was slit.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said her husband later told an odd story about the death.
He told her that ``some dude named Lance'' called him to say that
he had ``raped and killed Krystal and left her in a cow pasture in
Madison.'' She said she asked her husband about Lance. He said he
didn't know anyone named Lance. She asked how ``some dude named
Lance'' would even know his telephone number. He said maybe the
killer found it in some of Archer's belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe it at first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the young couple was visiting friends when
Cole encouraged her husband to tell his story. He did. This time,
however, he added a new detail: He had seen the body and was having
nightmares. How did he know where to find the body? Cole said his
explanation strained credulity: ``Lance'' told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I decided that we needed to tell the police _ when
things didn't add up,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, incredulous family friends who heard Timmy Cole's
story called Tabitha's mother, Flaig. You need to talk to your
son-in-law, they said. He was over here talking about a dead body.
</P>
<P>
   Flaig confronted Cole the next time she saw him: ``I said `So
why don't you tell me about the dead girl?' Timmy just looked like
the blood kind of went out of his body at that moment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on a couch in Flaig's living room and watched television,
his baby son crawling on the floor, as Flaig peppered him with
questions: Who is Lance? Where is the girl's body? Why haven't you
called the police?
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept saying `I don't know,''' she said. ``He kept
looking at the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaig said she pressured her daughter to persuade Cole to go to
police, pressure that Cole said she applied with some success.
</P>
<P>
   Tabitha Cole said she and her husband went first to a police
station in DeKalb County. She said Timmy Cole told an officer in
very vague terms about a runaway who had left a suicide note
somewhere. She said the officer said he ``didn't have enough
information to make a missing-persons report'' and that he should
alert authorities in Madison, the Morgan County seat, because that
was where the runaway supposedly vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Cole said, her husband drove her to Madison County on the
pretext of talking with investigators. She said she did not realize
at the time that the town of Madison, where Archer was killed, was
miles away in Morgan County. She said she thinks her husband drove
her to Madison County even though he knew investigators there would
know nothing of the case.
</P>
<P>
   She said he stopped the car in Madison County in front of ``an
old schoolhouse'' that was ``something out of the `Little House on
the Prairie.''' She said he was inside for an hour-and-a-half and
emerged to announce that an officer told him to drop the matter
because ``Lance'' had turned himself in and the woman's body had
been found. She said it ``never crossed her mind'' that she was not
really at a police station even though she saw no sign or flag out
front and no police officers and sheriff's deputies going in and
out.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to metro Atlanta, Cole said, her mother was
furious. She wondered whether they had gone to police at all. She
demanded proof _ a business card, a receipt, something. The young
couple set out again. Cole said her husband went to police in
Rockdale County and even swung by the traffic court in Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking me everywhere but where we needed to go,'' she
said. ``I told Timmy `We've got to go to Madison.'''
</P>
<P>
   They got off the interstate in the afternoon. He pointed to a
spot beyond a cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `That's where her body's at right there,'' Cole said.
``That's when something clicked in my mind: He's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators arrested Cole and the two other suspects Tuesday.
Each is charged with felony murder and aggravated assault. Cole
said the crime's brutality shocked her. She said she does not want
to see her husband and the two other defendants executed if they
are convicted _ a veteran officer said ``if this is not a death
penalty case, I've never seen one.'' But Cole admits she might feel
differently if she were not married to one of the suspects and
friends with the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I'd never met them before and was just watching the
news,'' she said. ``I'd say they need to fry.''

 &HT;    Tearful Irvan leaves racing
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Ernie Irvan realized he has suffered one
crash too many.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, who was nearly killed in an accident at Michigan Speedway
five years ago and was seriously injured at the same track two
weeks ago, retired from Winston Cup racing Friday at Darlington
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Always known as one of the sport's most fearless drivers, Irvan
said it was the fear of his next crash that prompted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that the doctors have actually told me,''
Irvan said. ``They did say if I had another accident like the one I
had (on Aug. 20) and the one I had at Michigan earlier, it would
probably be detrimental to me being able to live a wholesome life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate to be able to sit here and tell
everybody that I know it's probably good for me to retire so I can
comprehend what I'm saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, 40, was joined at the news conference by his wife, Kim,
and two young children, Jared and Jordan. He had tears in his eyes
before speaking and choked up several times as he explained the
reasons for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked a lot the last couple of weeks about what to do,
but it was his decision to retire,'' said Kim, as she began crying.
``It's like a cat with nine lives, and he has used eight of them.
It was a miracle in 1994, and most people don't get one miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '94 crash at Michigan, Irvan suffered critical brain and
chest injuries and was given a 10 percent chance of survival. Irvan
made an improbable return to racing 14 months later but was never
the same driver as before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's biggest accomplishment during the past five years, along
with winning at Michigan in '97, was establishing financial
security for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of time, financially, (a driver) can't retire,'' Irvan
said. ``I'm able to make that decision and make it smart. I know
that my wife and family (are taken care of), and that means a lot
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Named one of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers, Irvan leaves the
sport with 15 victories, 22 pole positions, 313 career starts
during a 13-year career. Irvan said he hopes to remain involved
with NASCAR as the co-owner of a full-time Cup team, but his
presence will be missed on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us are relieved (for Irvan) and have a lot of
compassion for the decision and how hard it has to be,'' Mark
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dale Jarrett: ``We're going to miss him here. Ernie was a
good friend and great competitor to a lot of us, but I'm also glad
he'll be able to just carry on with his life normally.''

JOHNSON KNOWS THE CURSE OF EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I handed Davey Johnson an old newspaper clipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be from 1969,'' the Dodgers' manager said as he
digested the yellow-highlighted paragraphs, holding the paper at
arm's length in the Dodger Stadium dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The paper quoted Johnson, described as a ``scholarly second
baseman,'' talking about the '69 Baltimore Orioles following their
World Series loss to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been talking about the '99 Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're expected to do things and you don't, it messes you
up,'' Johnson had said back then, when he was a 26-year-old sharing
the Orioles infield with Boog Powell, Mark Belanger and Brooks
Robinson. ``But when you aren't expected to do things and you do
them, they pick you up. It's part of momentum, it has a mushrooming
effect in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not supposed to do something, everything you do is
a plus. If you don't do it, you're not embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, winners of 108 regular-season games, had gone into
that Series expecting to take apart the Miracle Mets.
</P>
<P>
   A little like the Dodgers, who began this season expecting to
win the National League pennant, according to general manager Kevin
Malone's bold prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles had won the opener in Baltimore, Mike Cuellar
outpitching Mets ace Tom Seaver, confirming their belief that this
was going to be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then strange things started happening,'' Johnson said the
other day in the dugout, putting the paper down on the bench beside
him as he reminisced. ``(The Mets') Al Weis hit a home run or
something...''
</P>
<P>
   Weis had a game-winning single in Game 2. The 160-pound utility
man saved his homer for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly things didn't look so easy for the O's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we didn't get a base hit, it pumped them up. Every
strike on us was a nail in our coffin,'' Johnson said. ``(Mets
right fielder Ron) Swoboda made a great catch. The ball had to find
his glove because he sure as hell didn't find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoboda's diving backhand in Game 4 became the photo image of
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   There were others: Tommie Agee's great catches, the Donn
Clendenon homer that followed Mets manager Gil Hodges' winning
argument that a smudge of shoe polish proved Cleon Jones had been
hit by a pitch in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the wind blew the ball to them and away from
us,'' Johnson said. ``Once it started going that way...''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires seemed to turn every close call against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' J.C. Martin should have been called out for running
inside the first-base line after a bunt. He got away with it, Pete
Richert's throw glanced off his wrist and into right field, and Rod
Gaspar scored the winning run in the 10th inning of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went wrong for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when we went to Shea (Stadium),'' Johnson said.
``We'd hit balls hard and they'd be right at people. They'd hit a
little something and it would drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won games 2, 3 and 4, and by then the Orioles were
cooked, the disappointment working on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in fate,'' Johnson said, talking now about how the
Orioles came to realize it wasn't their week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fly ball to Jones in left turned into the final out of
the Series, the one that's shown over and over when those Mets are
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I went to work for them (as the Mets' manager,
1984-90),'' he said. ``What a strange world this is.''
</P>
<P>
   What does this have to do with the '99 Dodgers? Everything.
</P>
<P>
   Same torture, only slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``When expectations are tremendously high, everything that goes
wrong kills you. And when there are struggles, it makes you try a
little too hard,'' Johnson said this week, with his Dodgers 15, 16,
17 games behind their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being good,'' Johnson said, meaning he'd rather have a
talented roster and the expectations that go with it. ``You don't
get a handicap, unlike golf. But you've got to prove it. When
there's nothing you can do to satisfy everybody, that becomes an
albatross.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations go with the Dodgers uniform and the Fox paycheck.
What do you bet that, despite everything that has happened in 1999,
the Dodgers will be widely picked to win the NL West in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   All they can do is avoid putting extra pressure on themselves
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Please, somebody stick a sock in Malone's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we got the gorilla off our backs,'' Johnson said in
the dugout, working up a wry smile as he stood to walk away. ``Now
everybody thinks we're horse----.'' &QL;

3 CASES OF ENCEPHALITIS, ONE FATAL, ARE CONFIRMED IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An elderly resident of Queens died this week from a
mosquito-borne viral disease known as St. Louis encephalitis, and
city health officials fear that at least nine other people have
been infected, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference in Whitestone, Queens,
Giuliani said three victims of the disease had been identified in
northern Queens in recent days: an 80-year-old man who died at
Flushing Hospital Medical Center on Tuesday and two middle-aged men
who were being treated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials believe that an 87-year-old woman who died at
Flushing Hospital on Thursday also had St. Louis encephalitis,
Giuliani said. The disease is most common in Southern states, and
the three confirmed cases are believed to be the first ever
contracted in New York City, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, which starts as a flu-like illness in humans but
can progress to a fatal inflammation of the brain, is usually
transmitted to mosquitoes from migratory birds. Most people
infected with the virus never exhibit symptoms, but some _ mainly
children and the elderly _ develop muscle weakness, tremors,
confusion and paralysis that can lead to permanent neurological
damage or death.
</P>
<P>
   City officials would not give the names or addresses of the two
people who died, but Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said all of the
confirmed and most of the suspected cases had originated in the
Whitestone, Flushing and Auburndale neighborhoods of Queens. About
two dozen people are being tested for the disease, including four
who live in the South Bronx and one who lives in Manhattan but
works in Queens, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials passed out insect repellent and brochures about
the disease in the three Queens neighborhoods Friday night, and the
Mayor's Office of Emergency Management dispatched helicopters to
spray pesticide over those areas, focusing on Powell's Cove Park,
on the East River between Whitestone and College Point; the
Flushing Airport, and several other bodies of water where the
infected mosquitoes are likely to breed. The helicopters sprayed
malathion, a pesticide, Friday night, and city officials said
trucks would spray it on the streets in the affected neighborhoods
several times Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We would ask people to understand why we are doing this and to
cooperate with us,'' Giuliani said at the afternoon news
conference, held on 11th Avenue near Powell's Cove Park, as a group
of bewildered-looking Whitestone residents looked on. ``We will do
everything that we can to try to wipe out the mosquito population
and deal with and treat the people who may be bitten and may be
affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the city moved aggressively to prevent more cases of the
disease, Dr. Cohen said a person's chances of becoming infected
were remote.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 out of 300 bites from the mosquito species that carries
St. Louis encephalitis actually transmits the disease, he said.
``The probability of infection is very, very low,'' Cohen said,
adding that the disease cannot be transmitted between people.
``Essentially, because somebody gets a mosquito bite there is no
reason to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no vaccine or specific drug therapy for St. Louis
encephalitis, named for the city where the first cases were
recognized in 1933. But people with serious symptoms usually
receive supportive therapy, like respiratory care, to prevent
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1964 there have been 4,437 confirmed cases of St. Louis
encephalitis in the United States, with an annual average of 193,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. But studies show that the vast majority of cases go
undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens cases come only weeks after two 11-year-old boys
contracted malaria at a Boy Scout camp near Calverton on Long
Island. But city health officials said Friday that there were
actually fewer mosquitoes in the New York region this year because
of the summertime drought.
</P>
<P>
   They added, however, that the area's relatively wet spring and
hot, dry summer had been ideal for the mosquito species that
carries St. Louis encephalitis in the Northeast, Culex pipiens.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Health Department has ordered every hospital
in the city to look out for the disease, and has warned that some
of the symptoms _ like muscle aches and fever _ can be similar to
those of meningitis. Health officials began to suspect an outbreak
of St. Louis encephalitis about 10 days ago, but the CDC did not
confirm the three cases until Friday afternoon, said Dr. Annie
Fine, a medical epidemiologist with the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, several frightened Whitestone residents at the news
conference complained that they should have been alerted as soon as
city officials suspected a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   The residents said their neighborhood had been inundated with
mosquitoes for decades and the city in recent years stopped
spraying pesticides over Powell's Cove Park and other badly
infested areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night you sleep with the air- conditioner cranked up and
the covers up to your eyeballs,'' said Dave Morales, 33, who was
watching as city officials prepared for the spraying in Powell's
Cove Park. ``I always hoped they would spray down there, but they
never did. I would rather take my chances with the cancer from the
insecticide than deal with nine million mosquito bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Reiter, 46, said her yard was so infested with mosquitoes
that she planned to get rid of her swimming pool next year. ``I run
my air- conditioner day and night, April through October,'' she
said. ``Otherwise my home is full of mosquitoes. I think everyone
here is genuinely concerned.''

EAST TIMOR VOTES TO BREAK FROM INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; rewritten throughout.)  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After 24 years of brutal occupation by
Indonesia, the people of East Timor, defying a campaign of terror
instigated by the military, have voted overwhelmingly to become an
independent nation, the United Nations announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that
voters in the referendum on Monday rejected by 78.5 percent a
proposal by the government of a new autonomous status within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the totals in the voting were 344,580 against
autonomy, and thus in favor of independence, and 94,388 for
autonomy within Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed it the next year as its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed
special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of
transition toward independence,'' Annan said. In January, President
B.J. Habibie announced that if autonomy was rejected, Indonesia
would end its claims on the former Portuguese colony and simply let
it go free, after a generation of separatist guerrilla warfare in
which 200,000 people have died. The referendum results are not
binding, however. Technically, the referendum was a ``popular
consultation'' whose outcome would have to be endorsed by the
Indonesian Parliament at the end of the year. But most analysts
said political realities would circumscribe the Parliament's
ability to reject the outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the anarchic situation that has swept parts of the
remote territory of 800,000 people, Indonesia said Saturday that it
was sending additional security forces to try to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting, burning, killing and terror of the ragtag
militia gangs may be beyond the control even of the Indonesian
military that created them as surrogate spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are burning everything,'' said one of 54 U.N. officials
who reached the East Timor, capital, Dili, Saturday after having
evacuated the southwestern town of Maliana, which the militias have
taken over. ``They don't respect anything,'' added the official,
who would not give his name. ``They are out of control. They are
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and witnesses said more than 12 East
Timorese had been killed since the referendum. A spokesman for the
United Nations in Dili, David Wimhurst, said that at least four
local U.N. staff members had been killed since Monday and that six
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear to what extent the violence has been centrally
controlled and organized or what its purpose is. Assuming that the
militias were the creation of the military, which has been
reluctant to cede its hard-fought battleground, they may have
rampaged beyond the control of their masters, said Jusuf Wanandi,
director of a policy institute, the Center for Strategic and

<P>
   But if the militias had really intended to derail the
referendum, it was notable that they had not taken any of possible
high-profile actions that might have accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they would have had to do was kill a couple of foreigners
working for the United Nations to halt the referendum in its
tracks,'' said Donald K. Emmerson, an Indonesia specialist at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``So why didn't they?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After months of intimidation and violence, the militias fell
suddenly silent on voting day, when they could have been severely
disruptive. Instead, nearly 99 percent of the registered voters
turned out in a largely peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Then the killings and intimidation were redoubled. Although the
atmosphere of threat was intense, important targets like the Dili
Museum, where the ballots were counted, were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has no armed presence in East Timor, and
security is in the hands of the Indonesian police, who have been
utterly ineffective in stopping the violence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the United States was worried about the
possibility of an evacuation of foreigners from East Timor, the
Navy placed two ships in the South Pacific on alert, ordering them
to be prepared to move within 72 hours' notice, a military official
said. The ships, the cruiser Mobile Bay, which is off Australia,
and the cargo ship Kilauea, have helicopter landing pads and could
be used to ferry evacuees short distances.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although foreigners and journalists were targets of the
militias' anger and threats, most of the violence appears to
involve local hatreds over the divisive issue of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke rose Saturday once again in Dili from burning houses in
the largely pro-independence Becora neighborhood, which has been
the target of repeated militia attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are running for their lives,'' a resident told The
Associated Press by telephone. ``There is panic. The shooting is
coming closer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even worse violence was reported from rural areas, including
reprisals against people who had helped the United Nations conduct
the referendum. Their very participation put them at odds with the
forces that were trying to block it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly an attempt to terrorize them,'' Wimhurst
said. ``We have been defenseless from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maliana, which has been the scene of some of the most brutal
militia violence, the United Nations reported that two of its
drivers were killed overnight and that five other staff members
were missing. Thirty-three foreign and local U.N. workers had to
spend the night in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that the militias are in control,'' Wimhurst
said. ``The militias are running rampant in the town, and no effort
is being made to stop them.''

 &HT;    Tucker's Jones earns best start of season
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell

<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Buckshot Jones will be in the third position
for today's Dura-Lube 200. It will be his best start of the Grand
National season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like anything has gone right this whole
year,'' Jones said. ``We're just trying to get this team back
together, especially to finish this (Grand National) season.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, Jones has been focusing on the Busch Series. He plans
to continue that routine, which includes a limited Winston Cup
schedule, for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin helps cause
</P>
<P>
   Driver Kenny Irwin does not have a job for next year but says it
had nothing do with him capturing the pole for Sunday's Pepsi 400.
Irwin will be joined on the front by Ward Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the media is) saying I am trying harder,'' said
Irwin, who drives the No. 28 car. ``I think you can ask any race
car driver, I think they race as hard as they can every time they
go on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt: help wanted
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt is returning to NASCAR for the 2000 season as the
owner of a full-time Cup team. Foyt said Friday he has bought a
building and landed a primary sponsor, Conseco. However, he is
behind in his search for a driver and crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything starts popping today,'' Foyt said. ``We have no
plans to race at all in 1999. Earnhardt-Labonte
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR czar Mike Helton met with reporters Friday to defend the
governing body again in the final-lap incident at Bristol last
weekend. Dale Earnhardt caused leader Terry Labonte to spin out and
then took the checkered flag in one of the most controversial
finishes in years. Earnhardt was not penalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it comes to the role that NASCAR has in policing the races
on the track, it's a collection of judgment calls (we) make as the
race unfolds,'' Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   Best lines of the day:
</P>
<P>
   _ Earnhardt: ``Terry said on ESPN he was going to shoot my horse
out from under me the next time we went hunting. The last time we
went hunting, I carried his gun for him; so I'll have to give him
his gun to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Labonte: ``I have never held a grudge against anybody. I'm not
going to hold one against him. I know if it comes down to the last
lap somewhere, I might treat him a little different than I would
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Off track
</P>
<P>
   The longest-running car-sponsorship relationship will end
halfway through the 2000 season. STP will be replaced by General
Mills as the primary sponsor for the No. 43 car of Petty Enterprise
at next summer's Pepsi 400 at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``STP lasted for 28-29 years, and we hope General Mills can last
that long, too,'' car owner
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty said.

 &HT;    Incentives will pump up Stefan's deal
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ As he prepared for his first official speech as
an NHL coach Friday night, Curt Fraser decided there was one
adjective he didn't want uttered by his players: expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get them out of the mindset that we're an expansion
team and we can only be so good,'' the Thrashers coach said. ``We
want to be the model. We don't want to follow the Tampa Bays and
San Joses who weren't successful for a long time. We want to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   With their training camp officially beginning today with
physicals, the Thrashers already have distinguished themselves in
one way: Player negotiations are over. With other NHL still trying
to come to terms with several free agents or top draft picks, the
Thrashers signed their last player expected to compete for a roster
spot Friday when first-round draft pick Patrik Stefan came to
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan, who arrived from Los Angeles on Friday night in time for
the first team meeting, signed for the maximum base salary allowed
for an entry-level player: $3.075 million over three years. The
deal also includes a potentially complex series of bonuses but it
will not match the deal of Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan's individual ``A'' bonus plan is capped at $7.6 million
over three years, less than Lecavalier's $8 million. Stefan also
can earn several million dollars in so-called ``B'' bonuses, but
those are linked to team incentives. The amounts will drop or
increase depending on whether the Thrashers make the playoffs in
the first three years.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had stalled for two days but general manager Don
Waddell phoned agent Steve Kotlowitz in L.A. on Thursday night
after arriving in Orlando. The two had three separate
conversations, the last one ending at 12:30 a.m. with Kotlowitz
saying he would take the latest offer to Stefan. The agent phoned
back Friday morning to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit nervous (about a long negotiation), but I
am glad it's over,'' Stefan said. ``Now I am excited and looking
forward to training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Fraser is as you would expect: ``Fantastic.
Now that everybody's signed, we can move ahead. Obviously we're
going to rely more on team success than any individual this year,
so we needed everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat incentive packages have become the norm for top draft picks
in the past three years. Boston's Sergei Samsonov added $1 million
in the first year of his deal. San Jose's Patrick Marleau did not
hit any incentives in his rookie season but added $2.4 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will be without forward Alexei Yegorov and
defenseman Sergei Vyshedkevich until at least Tuesday because of
visa problems in Russia.

 By JOHN TAGLIABUE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss prosecutors probing into suspected
money-laundering by officials at high levels of the Russian
government have ordered Swiss banks to provide information about
two dozen Russians who may have accounts in Switzerland and have
frozen at least 59 bank accounts over the past two months,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians under investigation include Pavel Borodin, the
powerful head of the Russian president's property management team,
as well as his wife, daughter and son-in-law, and Oleg Soskovets, a
former deputy prime minister heavily involved in the military
industry and arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss investigation was opened in response to requests made
last spring by Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, who was
subsequently fired by President Boris Yeltsin but technically
remains in office because the Russian parliament rejected his
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has continued under Skuratov's deputies, but
until now little has been known about Swiss participation.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of a list of names Friday and the announcement
that many accounts had been frozen _ a stunning number by Swiss
standards _ were the first indication of the scope of the Swiss
involvement. The timing seemed at least in part related to widely
publicized reports that huge sums of Russian money had moved
through the Bank of New York and the attendant renewed focus on
corruption in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   No link has been established between the Swiss and U.S.
investigations, although the investigating magistrate in Geneva who
released the 24 Russian names, Daniel Devaud, said that
``possibly'' a link would emerge but that it was ``too soon to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a separate investigation could begin examining
Geneva-based companies connected with the Bank of New York, most
notably Valmet S.A., a financial advisory service whose Geneva
offices also house a Russian-controlled company, Runicom S.A.,
which investigators suspect may have been involved in money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York has said it is cooperating with a U.S.
investigation into a possible money laundering scheme at the bank
involving Russian money. It has declined to make any other
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the list, which appeared Friday in a Geneva
newspaper and in Corriere della Serra, Italy's leading newspaper,
caps a week in which a Russian investigator came to Switzerland to
press the Russian corruption case and meet with the Swiss
prosecutor general, Carla del Ponte. Mrs. del Ponte questioned
several people thought to be involved in Russian money laundering
and corruption this week, including a former employee of a Swiss
building contractor that has been at the center of an inquiry into
kickbacks allegedly pocketed by top Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte will leave her job later this month to become
chief justice of the International War Crimes Tribunal at the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Mrs. del Ponte's office began ordering Swiss banks to
freeze accounts in the Russian corruption inquiry. The
investigation, initiated by Russian requests for help, involves
Swiss companies that did business with the Kremlin or with Russian
companies including Aeroflot, the airline, and Avtovaz, the
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and Swiss government officials said that over the last
two months, at least 59 accounts, and possibly more, have been
frozen at Swiss banks in connection with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the action are accounts held by Mabatex Project
Engineering, a Lugano construction firm that recently refurbished
part of the Kremlin, and two companies in Lausanne, Andava S.A. and
Forus S.A., which are involved in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The two Lausanne companies have ties to the powerful Russian
financier, Boris Berezovsky, who is part of Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures here have been an embarrassment for Yeltsin, who
clearly gave his consent to fire the general prosecutor earlier
this year. Various Yeltsin enemies have made accusations, so far
unproven, that the president's daughters, Yelena Okulova and
Tatyana Dyachenko, had received kickbacks and other forms of favors
and payments. It is clear that the daughters are under
investigation in Switzerland and Russia based on questioning this
week by Swiss prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has denied that Yeltsin and his family ever had
foreign bank accounts. Borodin also said that he had never held an
account in Switzerland. Oleg Soskovets, the former deputy prime
minister, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no charges have been filed against any Kremlin officials
or others involved in the investigation. But several companies in
Switzerland have been crippled by the inquiry because of the frozen
accounts and business records confiscated by Swiss authorities in
raids earlier this year.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When publicizing the names of the 24 Russians Friday, Swiss
officials said they had asked banks whether any of the individuals
on the list were known to them as beneficiaries of cash, share
deposit or precious metal accounts. If the banks respond
affirmatively, the authorities may then order the accounts frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Devaud, the Geneva magistrate, would not say whether any
accounts had been frozen as a result of the request. But officials
in his office suggested that the list was leaked to the press to
pressure banks that may be slow to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In Bern this week, Mrs. del Ponte called several people who were
implicated in the inquiries for questioning to obtain information
sought by a Russian investigator, Nikolai Volkov, who arrived in
Bern early in the week. Among those questioned, Swiss officials
said, was Franco Fenini, a former consultant at Mabetex, the Swiss
contractor suspected of having paid kickbacks to Kremlin officials
to obtain contracts for work on government buildings in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the questioning involved documents
confiscated in January in Fenini's offices at Mabetex headquarters
in Lugano, including records of credit cards made out to Yeltsin
and his daughters. Mrs. del Ponte is also examining charges raised
by the Russian investigators that $1 million was deposited several
years ago in a Mabetex bank account in Hungary for the Yeltsins.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin, the Kremlin property chief, has acknowledged that his
expenses for business trips to Switzerland and Italy were picked up
by Mabetex, but he has said that was in accord with contracts and
was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Bahgjet Pacolli, the president of Mabetex, has repeatedly denied
ever having paid kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Pacolli, 48, a native of Kosovo, sought to distance
himself from Fenini. In an interview, he denied that Fenini had
ever been a full-time employee of Mabetex and said he knew nothing
of the credit card records.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. del Ponte's office is also examining how in recent years
the foreign currency earnings of Aeroflot were channeled to a Swiss
company once controlled by Berezovsky, the powerful Russian
businessman and Yeltsin ally.

SHEFFIELD CONQUERS BAD DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Gary Sheffield had his worst day at the plate
Wednesday, failing to score a runner from third base three times in
a 5-4 loss to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield responded Friday with a two-run homer and two walks in
an 8-6 Dodgers victory against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough, tough game and I needed to come back
today,'' said Sheffield, who has 23 homers and 81 RBI. ``We always
put pressure on ourselves, probably too much pressure. But I wanted
to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's game, he worked in the batting cage with hitting
instructor Rick Down to help him stay relaxed and not get too
anxious at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick and (manager) Davey (Johnson) do a great job with me,''
said Sheffield, who now has 22 RBI in his last 13 games. ``They
really know when my swing is off and what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitch count: Struggling left-hander Carlos Perez is back on the
shelf after taking a line drive off his right leg in Sunday's start
for Triple-A Albuquerque. The Dodgers were hoping to recall him
after one more minor-league start, but the injury was serious
enough to require an MRI. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna, sidelined most of the year with a torn elbow
ligament, stunned the club when his fastball was clocked at 93 mph
during a recent rehab assignment for Single-A San Bernardino. Even
more impressive was his fastball average (91 mph) with an elbow
that Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe said needs reconstructive
surgery. ``We still need to wait a little bit,'' trainer Charlie
Strasser said of Osuna. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Double-A right-hander Eric Gagne will make his major-league
debut Tuesday in Florida, replacing Mike Judd. The Dodgers are
pleased with Judd, 3-1 in four starts, but Gagne (12-4) is coming
off an 11-strikeout performance in his last outing.
</P>
<P>
   Making plans: Manager Davey Johnson, bothered by the lack of
depth on his bench this season, said it will not happen again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said veterans Hal Morris and Tim Raines expressed an
interest in joining the Dodgers last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our lineup was pretty set and there wasn't much I could
offer them,'' Johnson said. ``If I knew then what I know now, I
might not have ruled anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Former manager Tom Lasorda was the guest vocalist
for ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' in the seventh inning, a
tradition begun by the late broadcaster Harry Carey. ``I waited for
him to sing, `Root, root, root for the Dodgers,' but he never
did,'' reliever Jeff Shaw said with a grin. ``He really
disappointed me.'' . . . Former Dodger Mark Guthrie made his Cubs
debut Friday and allowed two runs in two innings. Guthrie was
acquired from Boston in the trade for closer Rod Beck. Chicago also
received highly regarded third baseman Cole Liniak, who made his
major-league debut and singled in his first at-bat. Guthrie signed
with Boston last winter as a free agent.

 &HT;    Big Cat grateful for spot on bench
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Big Cat is back. After six months of cancer
treatment, Andres Galarraga again wears a Braves uniform. However,
No. 14 won't be batting cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   As he accompanies the team the rest of the season, Galarraga's
brightest offensive weapon will be his smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy, so excited to be here,'' Galarraga said, his
eyes welling up at a Friday news conference. ``Thank you, God ...
thank you, all the fans who prayed for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited to be with the team, at least to be in the
clubhouse to give good support, to help them to win all the way to
the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, 38, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in
February after a large malignant tumor was discovered in his lower
back. The first baseman, who led the team last year in home runs
(44) and RBIs (121), was placed on the disabled list and underwent
treatment at his home in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy and radiation treatment sapped his energy, but not
his spirits. Now his hair has grown in, perhaps a little grayer
than before. And the Big Cat is about 25-30 pounds bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start feeling light now,'' Galarraga said. ``I don't want to
even remember what I've gone through to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. Luis Barreras, said the cancer is gone. The
tumor has disappeared, but the damaged bone is still filling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can get back to the training that he was in before _
which I'm sure that he can _ there are no limitations,'' said
Barreras. ``So he should be just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is even more optimistic. He is 68 home runs shy of
400, and said, ``I think I can do it in one season. I see (Mark)
McGwire and (Sammy) Sosa ... I'm kind of joking, but I'm serious,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Galarraga can't start comprehensive workouts before
November. Barreras said the rotation of his back will be the
critical point, ``whether things hurt or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, Galarraga chatted in Spanish with Eddie Perez
and Ozzie Guillen. Tom Glavine, by way of greeting, rubbed
Galarraga's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought he was going to be here this year,'' Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who wore his number on their caps, have missed
Galarraga's bat as much as he missed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they went to second place, I think that they need me,''
Galarraga said. ``I can see myself in there. ... it drives me
crazy. I want to do something from my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Now at least he's in the same ballpark.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Steve Phillips stood between the Mets infielders Rey
Ordonez and Luis Lopez on Friday in a scene out of grade school:
Phillips, the Mets' general manager, was the principal standing
between two naughty students, forcing them to apologize to the
student body for fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the principal's office, however, but Shea Stadium,
and the student body was a herd of news media representatives who
had come for an explanation of a fight that left Ordonez with a
puffy bruise under his left eye and a purple gash that had needed
six stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   The players, who clearly wanted to be anywhere but where they
were, said little. Ordonez, looking very much like the losing
fighter who caught an evening full of stiff jabs, said something
about his being like brother to Lopez, and maintained that ``it's
over, forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   One television reporter looked at Lopez and called him Rey.
``He's Rey,'' Lopez corrected. ``I'm Luis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez, known as a persistent needler who specializes in
getting under his teammates' skin, refused to talk about why Lopez
slugged him in the eye. One published report put nationalism at the
center of the feud. Lopez, who is from Puerto Rico, reportedly
attempted to make the rookie Jorge Toca, who is from Cuba, perform
rookie tasks, like carrying bags when the team arrived at Newark
International Airport early Thursday morning. Ordonez, who also is
from Cuba, objected. There were heated words and punches.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Phillips denied the fight had anything to do with
rookie harassment. ``That was inaccurate,'' he said. ``This wasn't
about hazing. This was between these two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips admitted he wasn't on the bus but said he spoke to each
player after the brawl. ``It was not about Looie bothering Toca,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say frustration was at the root of it. Ordonez is the
epitome of the fast-track whiz kid, the hare, while Lopez is the
proverbial tortoise, the journeyman. Ordonez was a member of the
Cuban national team in 1993 and defected after competition in the
World University Games. He spent three seasons in the minors,
joined the Mets in 1996 and became a star at his position,
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, born in Cidra, Puerto Rico, was drafted in 1988 and spent
six years in the minors. For two seasons he split time between San
Diego and the minors. He missed 1995 with an injury, and played 63
games with the Padres in 1996. The Mets acquired him in March 1997,
and he played 78 games for them, hitting .270. Last year he played
in 117 games, batting .252.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the surface tension of this intramural squabble is
another, deeper tension for the team. The truth is, this day was
not about a fight between two players who don't like each other.
Friday night's game was the first in a crucial 28-game stretch that
will determine whether the Mets overtake Atlanta and win the
division, capture the wild card or crumble as they did last season
when they needed to win just one of their last five games to
qualify for a shot at the playoffs. They lost all five games.
Phillips, who has done a masterly job of building the Mets into a
contender, feels the fight was a mere blip on a magnificent radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``I think we're too
strong, and I think that this was in effect a nonissue, really.
It's resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``It's not a nonissue,'' he said, ``but
it's resolved. It's behind us. Obviously we don't like the timing
of it. If it's going to happen, you'd rather not have it happen
with 28 games to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said he spoke to Ordonez and Lopez about
judgment, timing and their responsibility to a team in a pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about what happened but hope in the
future they each will have learned from this situation and become
more responsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Valentine concerned that the Mets' equilibrium will be upset?
``I'm worried about whether the guys can play,'' he said. ``I think
I have a pretty good feeling about the team and I don't think this
is going to have anything to do with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez started Friday night and singled to lead off the third,
and broke up a double play by sliding hard into second base. For
the first time under Valentine the Mets are not solely behind other
teams fighting for a playoff berth. They are trailing Atlanta in
the East Division race, but are ahead of Cincinnati in the
wild-card race. For the first time in years, the playoffs appear to
be theirs to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets may be the only ones who can beat the Mets. Given last
year's ending, and Thursday's brawl, that's a formidable opponent.

TEXAS A&AMP;M WELCOMES BACK A WISER D'ANDRE HARDEMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A season of academic exile behind him,
Texas A&AMP;M fullback D'Andre Hardeman steps into the spotlight
tonight as the potential final piece in the Aggies' national
championship puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Since regaining his eligibility in August, two truths regarding
Hardeman have emerged as self-evident to A&AMP;M coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wintered well,'' said offensive coordinator Steve
Kragthorpe, noting the added girth on the 240-pound senior.
</P>
<P>
   The other?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've missed his versatility,'' said A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum,
who has placed Hardeman in the starting lineup for tonight's game
at 7 in Shreveport, La., against Louisiana Tech. ``He gives us more
options on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the sixth-ranked Aggies (0-0) will
explore all of those options in their season opener against the
Bulldogs (0-1). But one thing is certain. The man nicknamed
``Touchdown Tiki'' because of his goal-line prowess could not be
making his return against a more appropriate opponent.
</P>
<P>
   His last action in an A&AMP;M jersey came in the teams' 1998
meeting, when Hardeman scored three touchdowns in a 28-7 victory at
Kyle Field. Before the Aggies' next game, school officials
discovered a clerical error in the posting of grades at the
registrar's office. Under NCAA satisfactory-progress guidelines,
Hardeman was ineligible. His participation in the Louisiana Tech
contest forced A&AMP;M to forfeit that game. Although NCAA rules do not
require schools to alter records in forfeit situations, A&AMP;M's 11-3
mark always will bear an asterisk because of Hardeman's improper
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hardeman said, he considers it ironic that he will make his
1999 return against the same school that served as his 1998 swan
song. But his overriding concern is an opportunity to put an
embarrassing, yearlong ordeal behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating, especially at first,'' Hardeman said.
``But it was my fault I was in that situation. I needed to find a
way to turn it into something positive. Now, I've got that
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey hasn't been easy. A two-year starter, Hardeman was
relegated to scout-team duty last season. At one point, he became
so disenchanted that he considered dropping out of school and
making himself available in the 1999 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the NFL pretty hard,'' said Hardeman, who
ranks sixth on A&AMP;M's career list of rushing touchdowns with 30.
``But the best thing for me was to follow coach Slocum's advice and
come back. If he thought I was ready to play NFL ball, he'd have
told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Slocum convinced Hardeman he would be better-served by
polishing his skills in his senior season. Already a recognized
team leader, Hardeman emerged as a strong vocal influence in
practice despite his scout-team status. He began to make strides in
the classroom, regaining his eligibility during the 1999 summer
term.
</P>
<P>
   Now, A&AMP;M coaches acknowledge him as the best blocker among the
running backs and the lone member of the group who can function
equally well at tailback or fullback. Teammates cite him as a
welcomed, veteran voice in the huddle and another viable option in
an expanded A&AMP;M passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give him credit,'' Slocum said. ``A lot of young
people, as embarrassing as that whole ordeal was, would have said,
`I'm out of here.' That would have been a natural reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being man enough to accept responsibility and admit \Rhis
mistake\S helps. He let himself and the team down. To bounce back
says a lot about him.''
</P>
<P>
   It clearly has caught the attention of quarterback Randy McCown,
who said Hardeman ``lifted us more by what he did off the field
than what he's done on the field,'' despite an A&AMP;M resume that
includes 1,595 rushing yards and a career average of 5.6 yards per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki's always been a leader on this team,'' McCown said. ``But
he gained a lot more respect by taking care of his business and
coming back. He had his back against the wall, and he got it done.
That showed us how serious he was about being a part of this team,
how he was willing to sacrifice to make us better. That means
something to the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman will share the fullback role with sophomore Ja'Mar
Toombs, the 260-pounder who replaced him in the lineup last season.
Hardeman (5-foot-10, 240) will get the start tonight, Slocum said,
because of his superior blocking and receiving skills.
</P>
<P>
   Kragthorpe already is salivating about his short-yardage
options. During the Aggies' first two games of 1998, when Hardeman
and Toombs lined up with three tight ends in the team's ``Jumbo''
set, A&AMP;M was 5-of-5 on fourth-down conversions. Thereafter, the
Aggies were 10-of-14.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could envision punting on fourth-and-one, with both
Hardeman and Toombs at his disposal, Kragthorpe said: ``Probably
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Chris Taylor and Leroy Hodge said Hardeman should
cast a large shadow in the A&AMP;M huddle, and not just because he's
playing at 10 pounds above last year's weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us more confidence offensively,'' Hodge said. ``He's
a team leader. He's very vocal, and he always speaks up when
there's something that needs to be said. He was missed a lot last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's back and has received Slocum's blessing to play his
way into shape. Hardeman said his heavy course load in summer
school precluded as much workout time as he would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still need to lose a couple of pounds,'' Hardeman said. ``I
don't have an ideal playing weight. I just know when my body feels
like it's ready to take on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won the battle of the books, Hardeman now focuses on the
battle of the bulge. A&AMP;M coaches and teammates anticipate he'll win
that, too.

 &HT;    Hamilton has another chance to sink Navy
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ Joe Hamilton never had been to this historic
city, which briefly served as the nation's capital and where the
Treaty of Paris was signed to end the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   But it is where the quarterback's campaign for the Heisman
Trophy will take off _ or not _ today when No. 10-ranked Georgia
Tech opens its most anticipated season in decades against Navy. And
it is where Hamilton would like to put to rest some bad memories.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, as a raw redshirt freshman, Hamilton threw a
rally-killing interception against Navy at Bobby Dodd Stadium, and
the Midshipmen went on to win 36-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young,'' Hamilton said, ``and I was called upon to make
a couple of plays for my team, and I couldn't deliver. The best I
can do right now is even the score up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has developed extremely well since that day. He begins
his last season as Tech's all-time rushing quarterback, with 1,024
yards. And with 36 career touchdown passes, he is 15 away from
establishing another school mark.
</P>
<P>
   But another statistic _ 13 wins in his past 16 starts _ stands
as the benchmark for the Alvin, S.C., native. For three of those
wins, Hamilton engineered fourth-quarter comebacks, over Virginia,
Georgia and Clemson last season, and then he led the winning drive
over Notre Dame in the 1999 Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Navy coach Charlie Weatherbie knows his team will face a far
more polished Joe Hamilton this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Hamilton is a young man who plays with a lot of
confidence,'' Weatherbie said. ``He has grown immensely in the last
four years. ... He's definitely a Heisman Trophy candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Weatherbie is well-aware, however, that Tech is not a one-man
team. The Yellow Jackets return nine starters from an offense that
passed for more than 2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have our hands full,'' he said. ``They are one of
the top five teams in the country. ... They are going to score.
They've done it against everybody they've played.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Georgia Tech is a great football team.''
</P>
<P>
   All preseason, Tech coach George O'Leary has attempted to play
down such talk. But only to an extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be a good football team,'' O'Leary said.
``I don't think we're a great team. I don't think there are any
great teams. There are very good teams that have a chance to be
great by the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, you can count Georgia Tech in that number.

 &HT;    Cockiness the danger for Dogs in opener
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's hard to talk up a game when the first
opponent is a team that lost more games than it won last year in
the Big West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12th-ranked Georgia Bulldogs, who host the Utah State
Aggies at 6 p.m. today in Sanford Stadium, did an admirable job
nonetheless. Even though Georgia is a four-touchdown favorite, it
expects a good game from the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say unless we get a lot of turnovers or unless
some of their guys fall down, this is not going to be some
racehorse game,'' coach Jim Donnan said. ``I'm telling you, Utah
State can make you look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's concern is the Aggies' style of play under second-year
coach Dave Arslanian. Outmanned by Georgia, Utah State will employ
a high-risk, high-reward brand of offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Utah State will use a one-back, four-receiver set
designed to spread the defense and make it vulnerable to long
plays. Defensively, it will put eight or nine players near the line
of scrimmage and send them all after the ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have they got to lose?'' Donnan said. ``They're going to
come in here and do a lot of things. I'd take some chances, too.
That's what you've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Arslanian said Donnan is on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to win the game,'' said Arslanian, who was at
Weber State for nine years before going to Logan, Utah, last
season. ``There's not a lot of pressure on us. No one's giving us a
chance in heck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use three words to describe us _ attack, attack,
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's respect for the opposition results from past
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reflect back on that first game we played here,'' said
Donnan, referring to an 11-7 loss to Southern Mississippi in 1996.
``There wasn't an FBI investigation on it, but there probably could
have been. They did a good job on us, but we did everything in the
history of football to lose the game, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen, and you have to be careful. You have to be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's players have heard Donnan's message, and they're
buying into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't underestimate anybody, any time, and you can't
overestimate yourself,'' junior defensive tackle Marcus Stroud
said. ``Utah State has nothing to lose. They're going to go out
there and lay everything on the line. They're going to try to beat
us, and we better go out there and try to do the same thing.

 &HT;    THE REAL STORY: HOW A LAWYER AND A FILMMAKER FOUND HOLES IN
FBI'S OFFICIAL VERSION OF WACO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
(Attn: Ariz. and Colo.) 
 
(Eds.: Sub to correct to date in 7th graph 1838) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The big cannons of Congress had their shot at
uncovering the truth about Waco and the Branch Davidians, and they
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice and Treasury departments had their own crack at the
truth and fared no better. Neither did the dozens of lawyers and
scores of journalists who chased hundreds of leads and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The official story remained undented: David Koresh and his cult
followers at Mount Carmel instigated the gunbattle with federal
agents in the spring of 1993 and, 51 days later, committed mass
suicide by setting fire to their Texas compound. Koresh and some 75
followers died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, fragments of the official version began to crumble,
but it took an unlikely pair of outsiders _ a lone-wolf lawyer from
Tucson, Ariz., and a low-budget documentary film researcher from
Fort Collins, Colo. _ to force the revelations that FBI agents
withheld evidence about the siege and possibly committed perjury to
keep that evidence secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall of silence, the stonewalling, finally is starting to
come apart,'' said Joe Phillips, an associate of the Houston law
firm Caddell &AMP; Chapman that has filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against the government.
</P>
<P>
   What finally cracked the wall was the perseverance of David
Hardy, a former Interior Department attorney who set out five years
ago to write a book about the ``militarization of law
enforcement,'' and Mike McNulty, a down-sized insurance
salesman-turned-filmmaker whose first effort, ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement,'' was nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was drawn to Waco because it was an illustration, he says,
of the dangers of turning soldiers into cops. McNulty, a Mormon,
has said he became interested in the story because of its
similarities to the massacre of church members at Haun's Mill in
Missouri in 1838.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty did not return phone calls for comment on his role in
forcing the FBI to amend its previous version of events, but Hardy
said that while they had different interests in the Branch Davidian
siege, they have worked closely together and shared information.
</P>
<P>
   What their labors led to may not alter the verdict on Waco.
However, it has dented the credibility of the Justice Department
and could have an important impact on wrongful death lawsuits filed
by the families of Davidians who died in the Mount Carmel fire. A
trial is set for Oct. 18 in federal court in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major disclosures of the past 10 days:
</P>
<P>
   _ The FBI withheld from Attorney General Janet Reno and Congress
the fact that pyrotechnic devices were used on the last day of the
siege of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   _ FBI officials lied in sworn statements when they said they had
no infrared video of the first four hours of the assault _ videos
that possibly would show the use of pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possible perjury by FBI officials, who, in response to Hardy's
Freedom of Information lawsuit, told a federal judge they had no
recording of the radio traffic during the entire six-hour assault.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's hostage rescue team had a tape that revealed that
Reno's order not to use pyrotechnic devices was violated; that the
first two hours of the assault were recorded on infrared videotape;
and that there was an audio recording of the use of pyrotechnic
devices being ordered by Richard Rogers, commander of the hostage
rescue team. For six years, that tape had been in the custody of
the hostage rescue team in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In his years as an Interior Department lawyer, Hardy said, he
became familiar with the federal Freedom of Information Act. After
he left government and returned to Tucson in 1988, he began to use
that law to gather material for his book.
</P>
<P>
   While his mostly civil law practice often had civil liberties
overtones _ he prosecuted one lawsuit that challenged gun control
and another that ultimately restricted government spying on
churches _ he disputes the suggestion that he is part of the
anti-government, militia, conspiracy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want information I'm entitled to have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for documents pertaining to the Davidian incident,
Hardy first sued the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which
conducted the botched raid that led to the 51-day siege and
subsequent fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ATF lawyers responded that certain materials it once had were
turned over to the Texas Rangers, which had gathered evidence from
the scene after the siege ended.
</P>
<P>
   He then filed a state open records request with the Rangers, who
told him they only had custody of the evidence and were not
authorized to release it without approval from the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circle was closed,'' Hardy said. ``The Justice Department
controlled it but didn't have it. The Rangers had it but didn't
control it. They could bat you back and forth forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they almost did.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1997 and 1998, he was passed from one agency to another:
the U.S. attorney's office, the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys,
the FBI, the ATF, the Rangers again.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, McNulty was pursuing material for a sequel to his
first Waco film, this one titled ``Waco: A New Revelation.'' He was
encountering the same run-around.
</P>
<P>
   More vocally anti-government than Hardy, McNulty once hosted a
talk radio show and billed himself as chairman of the Citizens
Organization for Public Safety of Fort Collins, Colo. But Waco was
his passion and his research was dogged enough that lawyers in the
wrongful death lawsuits paid him for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what he considered stonewalling by the government,
McNulty began calling on Bill Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney
in Waco, who would play a peculiar role in the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Once accused of covering up, Johnston would suddenly turn
whistle-blower. During congressional hearings in 1995, Fort Worth
attorney Tim Evans, who represented one of the Davidians charged
with murder in the death of four ATF agents, gave the committee an
internal ATF memo which alleged that Johnston ordered the agents to
stop their internal investigation into the assault on the Davidian
compound. Johnston, the memo said, did not want the ATF to develop
evidence that defense lawyers could use in the criminal trial of
the accused Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnston, according to one lawyer, ``had a change of
heart'' late last year and agreed to give McNulty limited access to
the evidence being held by the Rangers in Austin, Texas. Between
November and March, McNulty made four visits to the evidence room
and on one occasion he was accompanied by Johnston.

 &HT;    Riding high: Donnan, O'Leary having big impact
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jim Donnan was just getting into his standard spiel as
he stood before his umpteenth Georgia Bulldog Club meeting of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be better, but, you know, Florida and Tennessee
haven't stop recruiting, and they're getting better, too . . . .''
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan barely paused when a woman jumped to her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just beat Tech!''
</P>
<P>
   The room erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's going to be that kind of season.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and Georgia Tech don't meet for almost three months. But
everything that happens with those teams, beginning with today's
opening games, is a prelude to the Nov. 27 clash at Bobby Dodd
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools are strong and high in the ratings. A winning
season and a bowl trip should be givens for each. With a little
luck, each team could go into November still in the race for its
conference championship. With a little more luck, a big-time bowl
could be on the line when they meet on the Saturday after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that wherever I go, people are already talking
about the Georgia-Georgia Tech game,'' Georgia quarterback Quincy
Carter said. His decision to play for the Bulldogs after signing
with Tech is one of the reasons the rivalry has become so intense.
</P>
<P>
   A season with so much promise for both schools seemed impossible
in September 1997. Both were coming off 5-6 records and had more
questions than answers. Each program's future was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But two strong coaches, each with a clear plan, have stabilized
and improved the football programs at both schools.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   George O'Leary followed that 5-6 season with a 7-5 one that
could have been much better. Four of the losses were to teams
ranked No. 14 or better. Three were by four points or fewer. In a
27-24 loss to Georgia, the Jackets' hearts were broken when the
Bulldogs drove the length of the field in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But that disappointment set the stage for the 10-2 season of
1998, Tech's second-best season since 1956. The Yellow Jackets got
their first final top 10 ranking since the national championship
year of 1990, and at 7-1they tied Florida State for the ACC
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming the head coach near the end of the 1994 season,
O'Leary has been able to turn the program around by taking the
school's perceived negatives and turning them into positives:
</P>
<P>
   _ When opposing schools knocked Tech's urban campus, O'Leary's
staff showed recruits a downtown renaissance that began with the
1996 Olympics, and continues as people from the suburbs move back
to the city.
</P>
<P>
   _ O'Leary refused to use Tech's limited curriculum as an excuse
and insisted that the school could recruit enough good players who
fit the academic profile. And he told his coaches to work hard
enough to find them. They have. With each season, Georgia Tech has
gotten bigger, stronger and, most important, faster.
</P>
<P>
   _ O'Leary was not afraid to shake up his coaching staff when he
needed to. In 1997, he brought Ralph Friedgen back as offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, the program's gotten a little more stable, because
the athletes who were brought in were better and faster,'' O'Leary
said. ``The first year, we used 13 freshmen. Last year, we used
three. You simply have to commit yourself to making things better
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Donnan struggled through his first season in 1996 as he
attempted to install his system and his discipline. The transition
was not smooth, contributing to a 5-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, with everybody on the same page, Georgia finished
10-2, and one of the wins was a memorable 37-17 victory over
Florida, its first against the Gators since 1989. Despite heavy
graduation losses, the Bulldogs came back with a 9-3 record in 1998
and their second bowl win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight teams in the nation have won more than Georgia's 19
games the past two seasons. But two of themare in the SEC Eastern
Division with Georgia _ Florida and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the success we've had on the field, we've been able
to build some credibility with the high school players and the
coaches in the state,'' Donnan said. ``Plus, we've been able to
build some trust with our own players, and they are the ones who
sell the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also has overcome perceived roadblocks:
</P>
<P>
   _ Donnan's staff immediately shored up recruiting in the state
and has signed two highly ranked classes in a row. Not only has it
beaten Florida, Florida State and Tennessee for key in-state
recruits, it also has gone into Florida and South Carolina and
signed some of the best players in those states.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia has continued to upgrade its facilities to keep pace
with the rest of the SEC. After Donnan arrived, the school
immediately spent $2.5 million to renovate the weight and training
rooms at the Butts-Mehre Building. The school will break ground
soon on a $9 million indoor practice facility and a $5 million
academic center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hiring Rodney Garner and Kevin Ramsey from Tennessee was
controversial, but the two continue their recruiting success.
Ramsey was brought in to teach a more aggressive style of defense.
Georgia now has the athletes to play it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference in our program now (from) two years ago
is that we have more speed and we have an offseason conditioning
program that really works,'' Donnan said. ``Everyone here now
understands the level of commitment necessary for success. That
wasn't true when we first got here.''
</P>
<P>
   The road ahead
</P>
<P>
   Both programs still have obstacles to overcome to maintain their
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech must continue to close the gap with Florida State.
Its closest game was a 29-24 loss in 1992. Tech has lost the past
six games by a combined score of 255-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said the key to taking your program to the next
level is your second team,'' O'Leary said. ``Every year, we get a
little closer to having our second team being as strong as our
first.''
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia, the primary task remains unchanged. Georgia hasn't
beaten Tennessee since 1988, Vince Dooley's last year as coach.
Georgia hasn't won an SEC championship since 1982, Herschel
Walker's final season as a Bulldog. Florida and Tennessee have won
national championships since Donnan became head coach. Donnan is
1-2 against Florida and 0-3 against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer to Tennessee and Florida, but until we
beat them on the field, we haven't arrived,'' he said. ``But we
have everything we need at Georgia to get the job done. There are
no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   If both programs make as much progress in the next two years as
they have in the past two, the Tech-Georgia game of 2001 will be a
doozy.

COLLINS TAKES THE FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Collins' emotions cracked before he could get a single
word out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   His head slumped behind the podium, the tears he fought back
gathered in his throat, and the media audience, except those with
cameras, respectfully diverted their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the resigning Angels manager gathered himself.
``We tried ... it didn't work ... so ... this is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins would elaborate. But those words Friday afternoon more
than adequately summarized his thoughts, and they were very typical
of the man. On a heartbreaking day, Collins refused to blame the
Angels' hideous season on anyone but himself.
</P>
<P>
   We know different. Collins was neither the greatest nor worst
manager to come along, but he certainly wasn't why the 1999 season
was one of the most hideous in the Angels' very messy history.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is the fall guy for a team that has all of the classic
symptoms of baseball at the dawn of the 21st Century. This is a
``team'' of 25 individuals who may or may not like each other; 25
talented athletes who play hard but may not take losses very hard;
25 well-paid athletes who have a problem with accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Collins chose to resign because he had exhausted his supply of
answers, and the season had become little more than a festering
wound. He had to resolve another spat between players before
Thursday's game -- the Mo Vaughn-Troy Percival snit -- and realized
he had spent the last three months dealing with everything but the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That became the focus,'' he said. ``Maybe that's why we didn't
win. Our energy was spent elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins refused to say the players quit on him, and he was asked
the same question a half-dozen different ways. Each time, all he
would do was turn the mirror around. ``I tried everything I know,''
he said. ``I patted them on the back. I kicked them in the butt.
All I know is that it didn't matter what I said or did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing is different today. The only hammer a manager has any
more is the lineup card. But it's still a great job, and they're
hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad, but I'm not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bavasi, on the other hand, is very bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels general manager personally groomed the nucleus of
this team, following a formula that has worked well in Atlanta and
Cleveland. Garret Anderson, Gary DiSarcina, Jim Edmonds, Darin
Erstad, Troy Glaus, Todd Greene, Troy Percival and Tim Salmon were
all reared through the farm system and sold on the concept of a
team growing up together.
</P>
<P>
   And with the obvious exception of not grooming enough pitching,
Bavasi's methods and decisions have generally been well-received
around baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So as depressing as it was to lose September pennant races in
1997 and 1998, the in-fighting of '99, all these Fine Young
Cannibals, takes a far greater toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good guy manager who put every ounce into his job,''
said Bavasi. ``A smart guy, a common sense guy who never said
anything bad about the players in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the players quit on Terry. But they quit on
somebody. We see them play hard. We see them dive for balls. But
based on how they reacted in the clubhouse, the way they spent
their energy, you'd have no other conclusion (that they quit).''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi doesn't care how any of the players react to that
statement, because ``what matters (now) is what we think about
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bitter, and a large part of it is that I put a club
together that had every reason to respond, and it didn't. There are
makeup issues here. We have to take a hard look at the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing any of these players do this September will makeup for
what happened this summer, either. All that was said and done will
color the future location of the players more than any statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And this is without exception. Beyond Chuck Finley, Bavasi has
issues with just about everyone. That includes Vaughn, who was
signed to be a vocal clubhouse leader, not a lawyer. Instead of
bringing the team together, he's been central to two very public
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Other players will be asked why they aired their gripes so
loudly, and others will be asked why they shrank into the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, these guys may be fine,'' said Bavasi. ``The
problem may be the group as a whole. This is just bad chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me to assume everything will be fine the last month of
the season would be irresponsible. Terry leaves with the impression
this may help them play better, but I don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do his bosses at Disney, who by chance have already
decided they're not keen on the baseball business anymore. Disney
didn't need an excuse to consider pruning salaries before a sale,
and now they have one.
</P>
<P>
   Mo's untradeable, but Salmon and Erstad (signed through 2001)
have tradable contracts, and most everyone else is up for a new
pact after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects more on the players than it does Terry,'' said
Disney Sports President Tony Tavares. ``We all thought we had the
right core (of players). That's one of the things we have to ask
ourselves. Did we?''
</P>
<P>
   Not for Collins, and probably not for anyone else.

 &HT;    COMING SOON: FREE COLLEGE CLASS NOTES ON THE INTERNET
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let's say you're a college student who slept in and
missed your 9 a.m. class. No sweat. Roll over and grab a few more
Z's until the lecture notes are posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial at seven Big Ten schools last spring semester,
Versity.com is providing notes for wired students nationwide this
fall. At nearly 90 schools, the Internet site
(http://www.versity.com) is recruiting note-takers and conducting
on-line elections to help determine which courses will be included.
</P>
<P>
   For students, the online service is free, financed by
advertising on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Versity.com is not aimed at helping students skip class,
insisted Jeff Lawson, 22, one of three University of Michigan
dropouts who founded the business as notesforfree.com in 1997 on
the Ann Arbor campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think good students will use our site to get an edge,''
said Lawson. ``If students skip class and rely on our service, I
don't think they will get a great education. They're really
cheating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who think they can skip class and get it all from
versity.com will learn that doesn't work,'' said Aaron Ahuvia, who
teaches marketing at the University of Michigan and conducted focus
groups with professors for the fledgling enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the system is supposed to work: Guided by the student
vote, courses are chosen and a diligent student is hired to take
notes at a rate of $8 to $10 per class. The notes are posted on the
Web site within 24 hours of the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, notes are mostly being provided for large,
introductory-level courses.
</P>
<P>
   Professors are encouraged to make online comments or
corrections, said Lawson. Quality control is also ensured by
academic experts employed by the company and by a Versity.com
operations manager on each campus. ``We also take online feedback
from users of the site,'' said Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   By logging on, students can electronically audit classes all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come up with what 10 different professors said in 10
different universities'' on a common subject, said Ahuvia. Bulletin
boards allow them to post questions to professors.
</P>
<P>
   But not all professors are likely to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Posting lecture notes on the Internet could be considered a
misappropriation of intellectual property if a professor has not
given permission for the work to be circulated, said Iris Molotsky,
a spokeswoman for the American Association of University
Professors.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, she said, ``students gain something from
being in a classroom. A very large part of a college education is
the exchange between teacher and student.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism was stronger from Sue Wasiolek, Duke University
associate vice president for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to subvert the system, a way to avoid individual
responsiblity and accountability,'' she told The Chronicle, Duke's
campus newspaper. ``This seems like an unfair, unproductive,
inconsistent shortcut.''
</P>
<P>
   In his focus groups with University of Michigan professors,
Ahuvia said, the major concern was not that Versity.com would
encourage students to cut class. That might have been because the
campus already had services where students simply paid for the
paper-and-pen class notes, he said. And the professors all taught
classes of between 100 and 1,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many professors already distribute their own notes to
students,'' he said. The professors' major concerns were the
accuracy and perspective on the online notes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahuvia thought the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. He said
that while some students can listen and learn while taking notes,
for others taking notes is a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for those who take notes, it provides another
perspective,'' he said. ``It's common for good students to get
together and swap or pool notes. And at times, students have to
miss class for legitimate reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawson said Versity.com got a ``great response'' after providing
notes for more than 100 courses at seven Big Ten schools.

   NEW YORK _ It was Venus and Serena Williams who packed Arthur
Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open on Friday afternoon, thrilling fans
with their overpowering and fun-to-watch doubles game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was their father who hugged and kissed top seed Martina
Hingis, quelling a feud between Team Williams and Camp Hingis by
accepting a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
   It was an autograph, something Richard Williams apparently has
spent years trying to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) he wanted me to sign his arm,'' Hingis said. ``I was
like, `Why waste it? If you take a shower, it's going to go off
anyway.'''
</P>
<P>
   So she never did it.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, when she called it ``perfect timing.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned a five-day jabfest between three of the top seven
women in the world into a lovefest by simply writing ``To Richard''
and signing her name on a white WTA Tour T-shirt for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain person (is) always asking for my autograph over and
over at every tournament,'' Hingis announced before her news
conference on her third-round defeat of qualifier Sandra Kloesel
6-3, 6-1. ``I'd like to give something to that certain person, to
Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams then entered through a side door. The two hugged and
discussed whether the shirt was big enough. He proved it was by
pulling it on and wearing it throughout his daughters' doubles
match, which was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much,'' Williams said. ``God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he left. The room.
</P>
<P>
   But not the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had started this battle by guaranteeing an
all-Williams final.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1-ranked Hingis took exception, although she likes the extra
pressure it puts on Team Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always have a big mouth,'' Hingis said Wednesday
afternoon. ``They always talk a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said Friday she had been referring to Richard. ``It
wasn't them,'' Hingis said. ``It was him.'' Reporters had long
since taken the question to the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Venus first. She thought it was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's funny,'' she said Wednesday night. ``I'm just here
to play tennis. Naturally, she is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena second. She fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just her problem,'' she said Thursday. ``She's always
been the type of person that ... just speaks her mind. I guess it
has a little bit to do with not having a formal education.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she saw Hingis in the locker room Friday before they
played. They talked and laughed about how the media handled their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came straight at me,'' Hingis said. ``She was like, `Did
you read that?' The people, they always blow it up. Between us,
there is a great relationship, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   And that put the education issue back in the Hingis court. She
did turn pro at 14. Serena Williams has a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose something else over education, going every day into
the school,'' Hingis said Friday. ``I think I learned still enough
traveling. I don't think I'm that dumb. I'd like to see some other
people talking in three languages. It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains a lot, but not necessarily enough. Hingis, who
also speaks Swiss-German and French, has offended in at least two
languages _ Steffi Graf in English and Amelie Mauresmo in
Swiss-German _ during her short career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little misunderstanding sometimes, what I say,'' Hingis
said. ``I don't always mean to hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But confidence combined with honesty and a toothy grin sometimes
derails her, like they do Venus and Serena Williams. Just moments
after giving the T-shirt to Richard Williams, someone wondered if
his predictions bother Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' she said. ``Because I'm better than them so far.
I'm the No. 1 and not them.''
</P>
<P>
   Purely accurate but not the most tactful response.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably part of the reason Richard Williams appreciates
Hingis. He's a talker, like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is friendly with everyone,'' Venus said after her and
Serena's three-set doubles victory. ``He'll talk for hours after
hours after hours, if you have the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis could meet Venus Williams in the semifinals, then Serena
Williams in the final, and those could bring out more talk. All's
fun for now, though. Said Serena Williams: ``We are philanthropists
and we love everyone.''

COWBOYS HAPPY PRESEASON IS PAST

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A day after the Cowboys capped a 1-4 preseason
mark with a listless 27-6 loss to the Jaguars, smiles were abundant
at the team's Valley Ranch headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith played dominoes. Tackle Erik Williams
chatted about his new vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   There was reason for the smiles. The exhibition season was over.
The Cowboys turned their attention to the Sept. 12 season opener
against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's \Rexciting\S to me,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``I
feel like it is for our football team. I'm looking forward to the
season to get a chance to go and compete when it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Said quarterback Troy Aikman, a longstanding critic of the NFL's
lengthy exhibition slate: ``Fortunately, \Rthe preseason\S is
behind us. It's nice to get to the season where everybody knows
what's a mistake and the only objective is to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Michael Irvin said he's even looking forward to coming
back to practice Monday. The end of the preseason also means
shortening Gailey's thick playbook. The players are off today and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to worry about 200 plays anymore,'' Irvin said.
``They were throwing everything at us. Now we can cut it to 50 or
80 plays and game plan for a specific defense. And run those plays
over and over. It limits the things you've got to learn. You can't
help but get better. That's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether the Cowboys are ready, considering
the questions surrounding defensive tackle Leon Lett's suspension
and the injuries to cornerbacks Deion Sanders (toe) and Kevin Smith
(back).
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones remains confident that Lett, serving
an indefinite suspension by the league for violating the substance
abuse policy, will return this season. The Cowboys are still
waiting for NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to make an announcement
on the length of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is expected to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gailey is also hopeful of Lett's return, he said he
has to approach the season and specifically the roster cuts _ the
Cowboys must be down to 53 players by 3 p.m. tomorrow _ like Lett
is not going to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys found out that former Bears defensive end Alonzo
Spellman might be more than a stop-gap solution. Gailey said the
seven-year veteran, who was moved to tackle three weeks ago after
playing end for the bulk of his career, had his best preseason
outing against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really played well,'' Gailey said. ``I'm very impressed
with the transition he's made in such a short time. I think he can
be a very good tackle. But he also gives us some versatility \Rwhen
Lett comes back\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he's also comfortable with Kevin Mathis and Charlie
Williams opening the season as the starting cornerbacks. However,
he said he's worried about the team's depth at the position and
said that the Cowboys might be shopping for a cornerback when cuts
are made this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never accomplish what you want to accomplish \Rin the
preseason\S,''Gailey said. ``But you take what you can get. I think
our players have confidence in what we can do. We know what we can
do. No, we have to go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Williams grumbled, ``It's on now.''

   No. 16 Notre Dame 1-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 at Michigan 0-0
</P>
<P>
   A start-of-the-season clash of ranked teams. Michigan, with Tom
Brady returning at quarterback, is favored. Notre Dame rushed for
363 yards against Kansas last Saturday, but Coach Bob Davie of the
Irish said after the game: ``Our football team realizes it doesn't
matter where we are now. It matters where we are next week.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Arizona 0-1
</P>
<P>
   at Texas Christian 0-0
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona, a preseason top-five team, took a 41-7 beating

disgusted, violated.'' This Sunday night game gives Arizona a
chance for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford 0-0
</P>
<P>
   at Texas 0-1
</P>
<P>
   Texas, ranked 17th in preseason, has something to prove, too. It
had three punts blocked, costing 16 points, in a 23-20 upset loss
to North Carolina State. Stanford should not be a pushover.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Georgia Tech (0-0)

</P>
<P>
   vs. Louisiana Tech (0-1)
</P>
<P>

   This may be an interesting test because Tech can pass the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 12 Georgia (0-0)
</P>
<P>

   No. 20 Alabama (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Vanderbilt (0-0)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   at No. 24 North Carolina State (1-0)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   vs. East Carolina (0-0)
</P>
<P>

West Virginia. ``I don't have a parking lot full of agents
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Nebraska (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Iowa (0-0)

&HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS: FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT BETWEEN ISRAEL,
PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS dates in 26th graf.) (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As important as any concrete agreements reached
Friday between Israel and the Palestinians is what the success in
negotiating them portends for the future.
</P>
<P>
   To many Israelis and Palestinians watching from the outside, as
the talks appeared to be deadlocked this week, it did not seem to
be the dawn of the new peacemaking era that Ehud Barak, the prime
minister of Israel, had promised.
</P>
<P>
   It looked to many just like the old ultimatums, recriminations
and obstructionism at work. It looked like a replay of the era of
Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister who inherited the
peace process and begrudgingly pushed it forward.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing made senior Israeli officials more incensed this
week than even a whispered comparison to the Netanyahu days. For
they knew as did all the parties involved _ Israeli, Palestinian,
American and Egyptian _ that the dynamic had altered significantly.
They knew, as did the others, that there would be a deal in a
matter of days, once the standard 11th-hour crisis was behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew that the moment was ripe: Barak's aggressive
desire to make peace in a big, regional way was matched by the
equally keen determination of Yasser Arafat, who is 70 and suffers
health problems, to proceed speedily toward a final, fixed and
lasting peace deal with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Even before an agreement was reached Friday night to revive the
frozen peace effort, a senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat,
had acknowledged that the dynamics of the dialogue had changed for
the positive. It was not only that he and Gilad Sher, the Israeli
negotiator, met publicly and as equals.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the first time in a long time, he said, he was able to
put himself in the shoes of the Israelis and see things through
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is almost as significant an accomplishment as the
memorandum itself, which is a detailed plan to resuscitate and
carry out the Wye River agreement, negotiated in Maryland last
fall. For negotiating the plan was the first test of whether a new
rapport could be established between the new Israeli government and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Without the new rapport that enabled this deal, the ambitious
task ahead of forging a permanent peace within a year would seem
laughable. If either side had allowed a disagreement over the
release of 50 prisoners _ which was this week's final sticking
point _ to scotch the deal, then it would have boded ill for their
ability to come to terms over such looming and complex issues as
Jerusalem and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis' self-imposed deadline of reaching a deal before
the arrival of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright midweek did
somewhat backfire on them.
</P>
<P>
   It created an artificial sense of failure when it took just a
few days longer than anticipated _ and the eyes of the world media
were chronicling every facet of the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   And it lent the impression that Albright was indeed needed to
nudge the parties into agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak had wanted to deliver an agreement as a present to the
American secretary of state, whose Mideast peace team had
officiated so many Israeli-Palestinian meetings during the
Netanyahu years that they became minor celebrities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And the Palestinians knew that their window of opportunity could
close; Albright was scheduled to travel on Saturday to Damascus to
work on reopening Israeli-Syrian negotiations and they didn't want
their conflict to move to the back burner of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was also determined to restore the Israeli-Palestinian
relationship to a bilateral one, and he did make strides in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The modified Wye agreement apparently struck both sides as a
better document than the American-brokered original.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear when Barak's negotiating weapon _ a threat to
carry out the original as written _ worked. Arafat must have
believed in the end that the new agreement was a better deal for
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the prisoners, for instance, Arafat accepted the
Israelis' final offer to release no more than 356 security
prisoners _ rather than the 400 the Palestinians demanded _ because
it was a better deal than the Israelis' literal fulfillment of Wye
would have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Wye calls for 750 prisoners to be released. In a
verbal agreement at Wye, Netanyahu had promise that 200 of them
would be security prisoners, according to senior Israelis. Last
fall, he released 98 security prisoners; that meant the
Palestinians were owed 102 more, according to the Israelis' strict
reading of their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, 350 is better than 102, especially with the deal
sweetened by the promise of a bonus prisoner release during the
Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   This could prove disappointing to the Palestinian public; for
many, the return of their young men is almost more important than
the transfer of land. But Palestinian officials are hoping that
they will be mollified by the many immediate rewards from the
revived peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday night, Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian
official who is usually reserved about the benefits of the peace
process, sounded almost ebullient about what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A first batch of political prisoners will be released
immediately, and a first withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank will start right away, too. Preparations to open a seaport in
Gaza and a safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank are
also supposed to get underway in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, formal negotiations for a final status
agreement will begin. Israelis, who originally want to set a
deadline of December 2000, finally agreed that September 2000 would
be the target date for a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have guaranteed, in a side letter of assurances,
that the Israelis will not withhold what they have promised if the
final status negotiations do not go well, Shaath said Friday night.
There will be no link made, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to withdraw from an additional 11 percent of the West
Bank, the Israelis will split their land transfers into three
stages. After the first immediate pullback, the next one will take
place in November and the last in January. A senior Israeli
negotiator said that the maps prepared by the Netanyahu government
had been redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu government's plan, under Wye, to turn over 2
percent of the Judean Desert to the Palestinians _ to be set aside
as a nature reserve _ has been discarded. Barak thinks it would
create a security risk. He instead told the Palestinians that they
would receive a chunk of the West Bank contiguous with their other
land, ``a higher quality area,'' the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, Barak threatened to end the negotiations if the
Palestinians didn't accept the Israelis' offers. Many Palestinians
cringed.
</P>
<P>
   The issuance of ultimatums was a throwback to the Netanyahu era.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the unexpected, underscoring a real change: Barak
reportedly called Arafat and apologized for his threatening tone.

   CROATIA: PEACEKEEPING ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, which has begun cooperating with the war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said that it would also begin
contributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations for
the first time since the country became independent in 1991. The
Croats are offering to send soldiers to a military observer mission
in Sierra Leone, where a peace treaty was signed between the

   POLAND: SCHROEDER REMEMBERS VICTIMS
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, during a visit to mark the
60th anniversary of Germany's invasion of Poland and the start of
World War II, laid a wreath at a cemetery outside Warsaw containing
the graves of people killed by the Nazis when they occupied the
city in 1939. Schroeder also had talks about economic relations
with Poland and Warsaw's hopes for joining the European Union by
2003.

   GERMANY: SLAVE LABOR TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will meet German industry chiefs
Monday to discuss a proposed compensation fund for people forced
into slave labor by the Nazis. Recent negotiations got stuck on
crucial issues like the amount of compensation and securing
immunity against future claims. Schroeder's meeting with
representatives of leading German companies might give the issue
new impetus ahead of the next round of official talks Oct. 6 in
Washington.

   With a month of elections ahead, the Bharatiya Janata Party and

Congress, which governs Orissa, the state where the killing
occurred, should have been more vigilant in protecting Christians.
Congress said the Hindu-led national government had created an

   In its first meeting, the Cabinet of President Mireya Moscoso
moved to abolish a new chamber of the Supreme Court set up two
months ago despite public opposition. The Sala Quinta, composed of
three justices who would rule on constitutional guarantees, was
pushed through the legislature by the president at that time,
Ernesto Perez Balladares, despite protests he was packing the court
with political allies who would extend his influence after he left
office. President Moscoso has repeatedly called the new chamber
unnecessary, and her supporters wondered if the ex-president, who
has been enmeshed in a visa-trafficking scandal, created the new
chamber to protect himself.

the House. Responding to Zedillo's state of the union message,
Medina delivered an unusually candid speech criticizing Zedillo's
economic and social policies, angering Zedillo's backers.
Opposition parties, which control the Congress, united in the
speaker's defense.

CATHOLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS TRY TO BRIDGE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the late 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church has
endorsed labor unions as an essential instrument of justice. But
over time the church has found that it was one thing to defend the
right of workers to organize in mills, mines and warehouses but a
far more sensitive matter when it came to its own religious
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   This has been particularly true in health care, where Catholic
institutions make up the nation's largest group of nonprofit
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of places where labor and Catholic
health-care institutions have worked together for many years. But
bitter organization battles have been frequent enough that a
high-powered group of Catholic hospital administrators, union
officials and bishops started meeting in January 1998 to seek a
better way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 months the group hammered out a working paper,
``A Fair and Just Workplace: Principles and Practices for Catholic
Health Care,'' which was released on Aug. 26, as Labor Day
approached. The paper's significance cannot be fully appreciated
without knowing who was involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The group included Gerry Shea, the assistant for government
affairs to John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO; two officers
of the Service Employees International Union, which has been
involved in some harsh organizing struggles; Sister Mary Roch
Rocklage, president and chief executive of the Sisters of Mercy
Health System in St. Louis and the person who asked the American
Catholic bishops' conference to organize the dialogue; three
bishops, and several other front-line Catholic hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who know the battles, and the background, up
close.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic hospitals were founded by religious orders and
long reflected the sisters' culture of sacrifice, discipline and
community. When employees at these institutions sought to unionize,
the nuns in charge often blamed themselves, thinking they had
failed to create a genuinely religious environment.
</P>
<P>
   Pressures to unionize have increased as nonprofit health care
has become more and more businesslike and both management and
employees have been caught in a financial squeeze. A cadre of
consultants has emerged, ostensibly to help church-affiliated
hospitals steer their way through labor law but in many cases
simply to fight unionization.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers have sometimes responded in kind, using
hardball tactics with the added bite of taunts that church people
were failing to practice what they preached. All of this has
confirmed the suspicions of some that the culture of organized
labor and the culture of Catholic health care were incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   The working paper is a down-to-earth effort to bridge this gap,
although the group remains far from consensus on some points. It is
easy to believe Bishop William S. Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., who
chaired the group, when he says that the discussion ``has not been
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The working paper starts with the principle that in the Catholic
perspective, health care is a human right, not a commodity, a
continuation of the healing mission of Jesus. It also affirms the
right of workers to equal opportunity, a work environment ensuring
safety and well-being, a share in workplace decision-making and the
opportunity to choose a union and bargain collectively if they so
desire.
</P>
<P>
   The paper lists criteria for assessing ``whether or not an
institution provides the elements of a just and fair workplace,''
including the wages received by the lowest paid workers,
flexibility of hours, the opportunities for training and
advancement and the use of part-time or contract employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically the church has stood with workers as they
struggled to form and join unions,'' the working paper states, but
``the core of Catholic teaching in this area is that it is up to
workers _ not bishops, managers, union business agents or
management consultants _ to exercise the right to decide through a
fair and free process how they wish to be represented in the
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the matter becomes what constitutes ``a fair and
free process.''
</P>
<P>
   The working paper proposes that when organizing is initiated all
parties should agree on ground rules for meetings, distributing
materials, making public statements and the final process of
voting. There is a long list of behavior to be avoided, like making
threats or misleading claims, using the law as a means of delay and
developing a victory-at-all-costs mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers and consulting firms can be helpful, the paper
declares, but not ``firms that have a record of tactics or guidance
that violates Catholic social teaching and the principles outlined
in these reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper, which is being distributed to health-care, union and
church officials across the nation, ultimately holds out a vision
of a more collaborative relationship between organized labor and
Catholic health care. But none of the authors of the working paper
pretended it would be easy, and that is one of the things rendering
their proposals credible.

 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, swept up once again in
a furious law-enforcement controversy, said Friday that she would
demand the facts to determine whether the FBI played any role in
starting a deadly fire that broke out during the 1993 assault on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding resolute at her weekly news conference, Reno said that
she was determined to uncover the truth behind previously
undisclosed FBI audio recordings that clearly show how agents fired
combustible tear gas rounds, even though officials, including Reno,
had said for six years that the FBI took no action that could have
ignited the fire. After the fire, investigators discovered the
bodies of about 80 people, many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dig at it until you get it right, and you get people
telling you what actually happened,'' Reno said. ``You don't run
away from it. You don't say, `Oh, me. I can't handle this.' You
keep at it till you get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's news conference was held just two days after she
dispatched U.S. marshals to FBI headquarters to seize the
previously undisclosed tapes, an act that left many in government
with a powerful impression that the attorney general no longer
believed the bureau could be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno declined to announce her selection to conduct what she has
said will be an independent inquiry into the events at Waco. But
other government officials said that Reno and her aides have
focused on former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican who has
told Justice Department officials that he would accept the
appointment. For their part, Justice Department officials say they
have not decided whether to offer it to him.
</P>
<P>
   As currently envisioned, the officials said, the inquiry is
likely to be organized as an administrative inquiry rather than a
criminal investigation, and it is not now expected to result in
criminal charges. But the precise legal authority, scope and
structure of the inquiry has not been defined. It will almost
certainly use agents from outside the FBI to underscore the
independence of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she would choose someone who is free of ``conflicts of
interest and will be well-received'' as the head of an independent
investigation into the operation. ``What I hope will happen is that
we will be able to agree on a mandate that gives them full
authority to pursue any unanswered question,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a welter of questions, Reno _ who has taken responsibility
for the government's actions in Waco, but has blamed Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and other cultists for starting the
fire _ said that she still believed the evidence pointed to him.
But she expressed her willingness to reexamine any relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what every piece of information I have seen
clearly shows,'' Reno said of her conclusion about Koresh's
culpability. ``And it is important, again, to put it in
perspective. But it is also important that we pursue any confusion,
any question, in order to provide the American people with the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno decided to renew long-closed inquiries into the Waco
assault, after the attorney general, who has often found herself in
the crosshairs of controversy, suffered some of the most bruising
attacks of her tenure. In recent days, law enforcement critics and
Republicans in Congress have assailed her, saying that she misled
them about the use of military style inflammable tear gas devices.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would resign, Reno said she would accept any
outcome that resulted from the inquiry. ``I'm going to pursue the
truth,'' she said. ``If the truth shows that I've done something
wrong, then I will accept the consequences. If the truth shows what
I believe to be the case, that we tried to set up something that
would bring the people out, give them a chance to come out in a
safe and orderly way, and that it was their determination and their
judgment and their action that brought that fire upon them, then I
must use the experiences that we have here and figure out what we
can do for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno's credibility took another blow when FBI
officials disclosed that they had discovered in their files a tape
of radio voice communications in which agents at the scene sought
and obtained approval from their superiors to fire the
military-style tear-gas rounds at the bunker. On Thursday, FBI
officials said that they had found a second tape of additional
voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   The second tape, which was released Friday by the FBI, contained
conversations between an agent and his commander over the use of
military gas. Like the first tape, which was released on Thursday,
FBI officials said, the second recording supports the government's
account that the military tear gas canister bounced off a bunker
near the compound but was not responsible for the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first tape, the voices were recorded on audio tracks of
infrared tape that picked up conversations between Richard Rogers,
the commander in charge of the Hostage Rescue Team, and
unidentified agents who were near the compound inside armored
vehicles. The second tape encompassed a period from 8 a.m. on the
day of the assault, April 19, 1993, to 9:30 a.m., a time frame in
which the FBI has previously said no videotape existed.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in the armored vehicle said, ``Yeah, the military gas
did not penetrate that, uh, bunker where the bus.'' After a pause
the agent added, ``It bounced off.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno reacted angrily to the disclosure that the FBI had
uncovered the tapes, which FBI officials said had been stored for
more than six years at the agency's training academy in Quantico,
Va., at the offices of the Hostage Rescue Team, the unit that
carried out the assault on the compound. When she learned of the
tapes, Reno ordered agents of the U.S. Marshal's Service to the
FBI's headquarters to seize the material for safe-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Reno said that her action was not meant as a rebuke to
the FBI, although some of her associates said at the time that she
was fully aware that the step would be perceived as gesture of no
confidence in the FBI. ``I think it was everyone trying to figure
out what the best way to do it was, and some people making some
assumptions that weren't correct,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Department and FBI officials have said that
interactions between the two agencies have been increasingly tense
and strained, Reno said that her dealings with FBI Director Louis
Freeh remained positive and that their relationship was ``one of
the best relationships that people can have in law enforcement,''
although she acknowledged that she sometimes disagreed with Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an FBI director and an attorney general who can
discuss matters, disagree on some things, as we have, agree on most
everything in a principled way, I think that's what we should be
about, and that's what I think I have with Louis Freeh,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a federal judge has ordered the
Justice Department to turn over all evidence from the FBI raid as
necessary in a wrongful death suit filed by survivors and family of
the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Walter Smith, in Waco, dismissed the Justice Department's
argument that gathering, copying and transferring the evidence
would be ``an unwarranted and substantial burden.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Smith expressed hope that gathering the evidence
in one place would deflect suspicions of ``a massive cover-up.''
The Justice Department is considering an appeal of the order.

WALTER O. WELLS, 87, A PIONEER IN MOBILE HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.C., Ill., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter O. Wells, a former chairman of Schult Homes Corp., who
helped start mobile homes on the road to what became the
manufactured housing industry in the United States, died Aug. 30 at
his home in Elkhart, Ind. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' career in mobile homes began as a clerk in the W.J.
Schult &AMP; Sons Clothing Store in Elkhart in 1933, said John
Guequierre, vice president for manufacturing at Schult Homes, a
maker of both mobile and modular homes that is now part of Oakwood
Homes Corp. in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Guequierre said, the clothing store's
owner, Wilbur Schult, had begun selling out of the rear of his
store a contraption called Covered Wagon car-trailers. He had
spotted them at the Chicago World's Fair hauling carnival workers.
Schult decided they would be ideal for campers and fishermen, too.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Schult rented a lot to sell his Covered Wagon
trailers. He also became a distributor for Sportsman trailers
produced in Michigan. Thus, the Wilbur J. Schult Trailer Mart was
born, with Wells as the manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Wells suggested that the company make its own trailers.
Instead, Schult bought the Sportsman company and renamed it Schult
Trailer Co. One of its first models, the Sport, was revolutionary
in that it contained a coal heating stove, a portable water tank, a
sofa bed and dinette chairs.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, the company, which later became known
as Schult Homes Corp. and moved to Middlebury, Ind., was the
largest maker of mobile homes in the nation. It was known for
innovations like forced-air heating, steel fames, built-in
electrical appliances and interior plumbing. The company even made
a special 50-foot mobile home for King Farouk of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were trailer builders about 20 years before them in many
places in the country, but they built the first fully successful
company and the oldest company that exists today,'' said Al
Hesselbart, vice president of the RV/MH Heritage Foundation in
Ekhart, referring to Schult and Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilbur was a better builder than a salesman,'' Hesselbart
said. ``Walter was the businessman and salesman par excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Oscar Wells was born in Huntington, Ind., on Nov. 9,
1911, and over the years he worked at Schult Homes in several
positions including chairman and chief executive. He retired in
1997; Schult died in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was also president of the Mobile Home Manufacturers
Association in 1952 and 1953. He was a trustee of DePauw University
and was president of the Elkhart City Planning Commission for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Madelon; a son, Walter E. Wells of
Constantine, Mich., a daughter, Sara Elkin of Elkhart, eight
grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

STANLEY WEIGEL, 93, U.S. JUDGE WHO SOUGHT TO IMPROVE PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mont.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Alexander Weigel, a retired federal judge who had
ordered California to improve living conditions in prisons and,
earlier in his career, had defended professors dismissed for
refusing to take a loyalty oath, died Sept. 1 at his home in San
Francisco. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Weigel was considered a tough judge with a short fuse, but he
was also known for his independence and his courage to render
decisions regardless of their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in 1928 in San Francisco, handling antitrust
cases. But in 1949 he took on a civil liberties case that many
other lawyers had shunned because of its political implications.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one professors had been dismissed by the University of
California for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge. Weigel sued the
university on behalf of the professors and won their reinstatement
with back pay in 1952 when the California Supreme Court declared
that a loyalty oath violated the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Weigel became friends with Pierre Salinger, the
journalist and confidant of the Kennedy family. After John F.
Kennedy was elected president in 1960, Salinger took Weigel to meet
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was screening candidates
for judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Weigel, who had served on the national committee of the American
Civil Liberties Union. was a registered Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, President Kennedy appointed Weigel to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California.
</P>
<P>
   One case over which Weigel presided began in the early 1970s
when inmates in the maximum-security units at the aging San Quentin
and Folsom prisons sued, claiming that living conditions were
inhumane. The case would continue until 1984 when Weigel ordered
the state of California to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was also known for his leniency in sentencing draft
resisters during the Vietnam War. While other judges would often
send those convicted of dodging the draft to prison, Weigel would
routinely sentence them to community service or probation.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Weigel was born in Helena, Mont. He graduated from
Stanford University in 1926 and from Stanford Law School two years
later. He practiced law for two years before becoming a partner in
the firm of Landels, Weigel &AMP; Ripley, now Landels Ripley &AMP; Diamond,
representing corporations in antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
   Weigel also served two years as a lieutenant in the Navy in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly charged issue before Weigel grew out of the
eviction of tenants whose homes stood in the way of the Yerba Buena
urban renewal project proposed by the San Francisco Redevelopment
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Weigel blocked the replacement of the low-income
apartments with hotels and tourist attractions. He ruled that the
developers had not done enough to find replacement housing for the
displaced tenants, a decision that dismayed much of San Francisco's
political and business community. In 1973, Judge Weigel worked out
a settlement in which the tenants were provided new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Weigel reached senior status in 1982 but continued to hear cases
until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Anne Kauffman Weigel; a
daughter, Susan Weigel Pasternak, of Cambridge, Mass., and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 interview with The Recorder, a legal newspaper in San
Francisco, Weigel related how the Salinger-Kennedy connection
landed him in Robert Kennedy's office and on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kennedy was wearing a turtleneck sweater and had a
football and threw it at me as I walked in the door, and I caught
it,'' he recalled. ``That's how I became a federal judge.''

TEXAS STUDENT MAKES AMENS WITH PREGAME PRAYER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With a federal judge's blessing, a Santa Fe High
School senior praised the Lord before Friday night's home-opener
football game and asked him to watch over the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since a very good judge that was using a lot of wisdom this
afternoon ruled that I have freedom of speech tonight, I am going
to take it,'' said a nervous Marian Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Her short speech referred to the Lord four times and Jesus once.
</P>
<P>
   It got a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   She had won the right to make the speech earlier Friday when
U.S. District Judge Sim Lake ruled the Santa Fe school district
could not punish her for giving a pregame devotional speech.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Ward, 17, could use religious speech when
addressing the crowd of about 3,000 before Friday night's kickoff
in Santa Fe, which is about 30 miles southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ward wanted to, and the student body clearly supported her.
Santa Fe officials had previously supported the practice of prayer
during pregame messages, but the district said its hands were tied
because of an earlier appeals court ruling. A judge decreed Friday
that the school board went too far by threatening to punish her if
she used a religious message in the speech.
</P>
<P>
   After the short invocation, Ward, a trumpet player, returned to
her seat among band members.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely great,'' said spectator Norine Delanoix.
``Just about everyone in these stands is one thousand-percent
behind Marian. If you can't praise God, what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ward's fellow students were equally supportive. She
received the longest and loudest cheers of all the senior band
members introduced before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's awesome that she had the opportunity to stand up
for God,'' said Liz Hassanpour, a 16-year-old Santa Fe junior.
</P>
<P>
   Lake earlier had granted a temporary restraining order
forbidding the school district from editing Ward's speech or
punishing her if she delivered a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district may not impose prior restraints on the
expression of privately held views,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Student-led prayers were a longstanding tradition before Santa
Fe football games until the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
New Orleans ruled in February that non-sectarian non-proselytizing
prayer was acceptable at commencements, but inappropriate at
informal occasions such as sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Although disagreeing with the ruling and appealing it to the
U.S. Supreme Court, the school district drafted strict guidelines
this summer prohibiting prayers blessings, invocations or
references to a deity during students' pre-game messages.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Superintendent Richard Ownby has said the
district would be forced to punish, possibly even suspend, students
who offer messages in violation of the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The student first elected to speak, Stephanie Vega, declined,
saying she felt too pressured and did not want to be punished if
she accidentally used God's name.
</P>
<P>
   Ward volunteered. A Baptist church pastor's daughter, she said
she also felt pressured earlier this week when approached by Ownby
and her principal, Gary Causey, and subsequently at least four
teachers, who tried to persuade her to keep the speech within the
school's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The result was Thursday's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district went too far,'' said Ward's attorney,
Kelly Coghlan. ``They were not establishing religion, they were
establishing atheism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake ruled that the new guidelines were essentially
unconstitutional and that the school could not censor her speech in
any way.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the ruling gives the school district some legal cover
while the lawsuit is on appeal. The suit to stop the prayers was
filed in 1995 by two anonymous families in the Santa Fe area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little bit overwhelmed, it takes a great burden
from us,'' Ownby said after Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Added school board member Robin Clayton, ``If you get bigger
than ecstatic, than that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake left it up in the air as to whether Ward's lawsuit would
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and eight other states have asked the Supreme Court to
allow uncensored prayer at public school commencements and sporting
events. The 5th Circuit's ruling case conflicts with another ruling
by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that student-initiated
prayer is protected by constitutional free speech protections.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could decide this fall whether to hear the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, it was enough for Ward and her parents that she
got to express herself before the Santa Fe faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with her character and conviction,'' said Robert
Ward, her father. ``Hopefully this sends a message that there is
freedom of speech, religious or otherwise, for everyone.''

HEIRS SELL ARTWORK ONCE LOOTED BY NAZIS TO CASINO MOGUL STEVE
WYNN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Seattle Art Museum returned Henri Matisse's
``Odalisque'' to the family who lost it to the Nazis, one heir of
collector Paul Rosenberg said she was happy ``his children are
finally coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months later, that particular child found itself up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs of French gallery owner and collector Rosenberg have
sold Matisse's 1928 oil painting to casino mogul Steve Wynn, owner
of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesperson for the Bellagio, confirmed the
painting is on view in the hotel's gallery. Asked how much Wynn
paid for the painting, he said, ``We don't discuss from whom we buy
paintings, to whom we sell them or any of the prices paid in any
transaction.'' The painting is valued at more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Confiscated by the Nazis from Rosenberg in 1941, the painting
turned up at New York's Knoedler Gallery in 1954. The gallery sold
it to Seattle collectors Virginia and Prentice Bloedel without
telling them about the Rosenberg connection, says museum
spokesperson Linda Williams. The Bloedels hung it in their living
room until donating it to the Seattle Art Museum in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the painting came to light after it was listed
as ``whereabouts unknown'' in Hector Feliciano's 1995 book, ``The
Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest
Works of Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg heirs sued the museum in 1998 to get the painting
back. The museum agreed to return the painting after receiving a
report on the painting's provenance by the Holocaust Art
Restitution Project of B'nai B'rith, which investigates Jewish
cultural losses during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was the first against an American museum concerning
ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II. When the
museum agreed to return the painting, Elaine Rosenberg told The New
York Times she was happy for her deceased father-in-law. ``His
children are finally coming home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's Bellagio is home to a notable collection of impressionist
and post-impressionist painting, from Monet to Matisse, as well as
contemporary work from Robert Rauschenberg, Dale Chihuly and Roy
Lichtenstein. The collection is valued at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gates, director of the Seattle Art Museum, said the
Rosenbergs weren't interested in working out a deal letting the
museum retain the painting. ``It belongs to them; they can do with
it as they choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is suing the Knoedler Gallery, contending it sold the
painting to the Bloedels under false pretenses. Knoedler Gallery
attorneys deny the gallery is liable.
</P>
<P>
   Odalisque timeline
</P>
<P>
   1928: Matisse finished ``Odalisque'' and sent it to the
Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   1929: Purchased by a Mrs. Bevan (first name unknown) and brought
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   1937: Paul Rosenberg purchased it from her and brought it back
to Paris as part of his personal collection.
</P>
<P>
   1940: Rosenberg sent all his art holdings to storage in southern
France, hoping to protect them from the Nazis. He and his family
leave Paris for New York.
</P>
<P>
   1941. Nazis seize Rosenberg's collection.
</P>
<P>
   1942: Along with another Matisse and Gauguin's ``Yellow
Christ,'' Nazi leader Hermann Goering traded ``Odalisque'' to
dealer Gustave Rochlitz for a 16th century French painting.
</P>
<P>
   1948: Rochlitz testifies that ``Odalisque'' was lost on a train.
His statement is considered untrustworthy, as he was known to trade
with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   1954: New York's Knoedler Gallery records its purchase of
``Odalisque'' from the Drouant David Gallery in Paris. How the
painting got to the Drouant David Gallery is unclear. Seattle
collectors Prentice and Virginia Bloedel purchase the painting from
Knoedler.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The Bloedels leave ``Odalisque'' to the Seattle Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   1999: The Seattle Art Museum returns the painting to Paul
Rosenberg's heirs. Two months later, Steve Wynn buys it for his
Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At Friday morning's weekly press briefing, Attorney
General Janet Reno answered virtually every question by saying she
was ``dedicated to finding the truth,'' wanted to ``use the process
to get to the truth'' and planned to ``continue to pursue the
truth.'' In half an hour, she referred to ``the truth'' a total of
25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Again, reporters were asking whether she would resign over the
latest disclosures about the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, where about 80 people died. And again,
in response, Reno spoke softly, smiled pleasantly and said very
little. In answer to the final question of the day about the
continuing Waco fiasco, she said, ``I think we'll let the truth
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say she never even got close on Waco or on alleged
campaign finance abuses by administration officials, including
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. They were infuriated by her
repeated decisions not to name special prosecutors to get to the
bottom of those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   And many conservatives felt that her initial statement after the
Waco debacle that ``the buck stops here'' was not only an
inadequate answer to the loss of many lives but became a substitute
for a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that, on the contrary, she was too willing
to appoint special counsels to look into allegations against
Cabinet members, including Henry Cisneros, Mike Espy and Bruce
Babbitt, and gave a green light to Kenneth Starr to expand his
investigation of Whitewater to include the Lewinsky scandal. They,
too, seem frustrated by Reno's repeated insistence in times of
crisis that while she is ultimately responsible, she is also often
out of the loop, misinformed or, as she suggested last week,
deceived by her own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing a hard job,'' said a former Justice Department
official. ``The Clintonites don't like that she gave Ken Starr a
blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   And Reno, because of her reserve and stubborn refusal to
schmooze, is perceived as out on a limb by herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Periodically, they come and ask for her resignation,'' Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said of her
friend's critics. ``The insiders feel she doesn't have a
constituency because she's not a member of the legal establishment.
The boys in town, Democrats and Republicans, see a constituency as
only in the Beltway, but the American people like her. They see her
as an Abe Lincoln figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's anguished acceptance of responsibility after the Waco
tragedy did earn her high marks for honesty, at least in some
quarters. But Friday, her assurances that she was still in charge,
still digging, still determined to get to the truth, seemed to be
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a weak attorney general and that is one Cabinet
position in which it's actually important to know what you're
doing,'' said Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly
Standard. ``Republicans are going to beat her up, and she deserves
it.'' He went on to say that conservatives are so fed up with Reno
that they are giving Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, a pass
simply because he is perceived as anti-Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was not Clinton's first choice for the job, nor his second.
He considered a number of other women, including Zoe Baird and
Kimba Wood. She was not a friend, in the way that many attorneys
general have been to presidents, and after moving to Washington
from Florida, where she was the Dade County prosecutor, she kept
mostly to herself, socializing to this day with only a tiny handful
of friends, most of whom are visitors from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from almost the first, she entered office while the
standoff with the followers of David Koresh was already under way.
Her tenure has not been an easy one. After ordering the attack,
which was supposed to force the Branch Davidians out of their
compound after 51 days, but instead led to their deaths, the new
attorney general said that making that call had been ``the hardest
decision in the world to make'' and was ``based on what we knew
then. Based on what we know now,'' she admitted immediately after
the attack, ``it was obviously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure a week ago that agents had used heat-generating
military tear-gas rounds _ which they had always denied using _ at
a covered bunker not far from the main Branch Davidian compound
several hours before the deadly fire broke out, again forced Reno
to acknowledge that her credibility had been damaged. This week,
Reno ordered U.S. marshals to seize previously undisclosed tape
recordings of conversations between FBI commanders and field agents
on the morning of the tear-gas assault.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, though her hands and arms were shaking vigorously
from her Parkinson's disease, she seemed placid, even unfazed.
``You dig at it until you get it right and you get people telling
you what actually happened,'' she said. ``You don't run away from
it. You don't say, `Oh, me. I can't handle this.' You keep at it
until you get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say the calm is real. ``She doesn't take it
personally,'' said Shalala, who added that she has never heard Reno
even question why she is so often under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as another friend, the former Justice Department official,
put it: ``She just doesn't embarrass. There's been a lot of
personal vitriol, and I never saw it bother her. She's totally on
her own island.''

EDITORIAL: A NEW DEAL WITH THE PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord to be signed Saturday evening by Israel's prime
minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, is
technically a reaffirmation of the Wye River accords that Arafat
signed with the former Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, almost a
year ago. But in reality, this first agreement negotiated by Barak
as prime minister is much more. Both sides have made important
additional commitments, setting a target date of next September for
reaching agreement on a final peace treaty. Israel has also
effectively promised that it will build no new Jewish settlements
and the Palestinians have similarly pledged that they will not
declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu viewed the Wye deal as a necessary but distasteful
installment payment on an overall peace plan he distrusted. In
contrast, Barak has explicitly linked the new agreement with an
accelerated drive to complete a comprehensive peace. While an
assist from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was needed to
iron out final details, this agreement, unlike Wye, was largely
completed by the two sides on their own. Among other things, the
accord spells out arrangements for Israel's withdrawal from a
further 11 percent of West Bank territory and the release of 350
additional Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians agreed to changes proposed by the Israelis in
the schedule for West Bank withdrawals and the starting date for
talks on the main elements of a final peace treaty. As a result,
the Palestinians will get more new territory in the early phases of
the agreement and Israel will get a chance to have the last of the
promised withdrawals take place as discussions proceed on final
boundaries. The two sides will attempt to set basic guidelines for
the final peace accord by Feb. 15 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   As always in such agreements, there was deadline bargaining on
several issues, like the number of Palestinian prisoners to be
released and the wording of the commitments on settlements and a
Palestinian declaration of independence. But significantly, there
was no breakdown in trust between the two sides. This augurs well
for the difficult bargaining ahead over issues like Jerusalem, the
future of Jewish settlements, the nature and boundaries of a
possible Palestinian state and any return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Barak took office promising to revive the
momentum of peace, important progress has been made on the
Palestinian track. Now peace talks must also be revived with Syria,
which Ms. Albright visits Saturday.  &QL;

PARK EARNS SHAKY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Chan Ho Park blew away Sammy Sosa with no outs
and the bases loaded Friday afternoon, he called it the outstanding
moment of his season.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen wasn't so kind, even though Park
did get the win in the Dodgers' 8-6 victory over the Chicago Cubs
in front of 28,435 at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   It is Osteen's job to find the real Park amid memories of last
year's 15 wins and the rubble of this season. If the Dodgers are
going to make a bid for Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez this
winter, they might have to decide between Park or Darren Dreifort
to really be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Osteen on Friday was the way Park let down after
striking out Sosa, who hit his major-league-leading 57th home run
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Park followed by striking out Henry Rodriguez but then walked
light-hitting Jeff Reed to force in a run and allowed an RBI single
to career minor-leaguer Jose Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow I'm going to sit him down and have a long talk with
him,'' Osteen said. ``You could see after he struck those guys out
that he let down. He went behind the mound and you could see that
he thought the inning was over. That just isn't going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Park, it was his third consecutive victory. It also came one
game after wining for the first time in 13 starts at Dodger Stadium
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But as with the team, finding momentum has been difficult for
Park (9-10).
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson got him out of there after five innings
and just 85 pitches. Mark Grudzielanek and Gary Sheffield hit home
runs early and Todd Hundley added the eventual game-winning homer
in the sixth off Scott Sanders (4-7).
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's homer was a two-run shot that capped a four-run
fifth inning and chased Cubs starter and Hart High alum Andrew
Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
   But Park, as he has done so often this season, refused to make
it easy in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good inning and a bad inning,'' Park said. ``This
season, I've learned a lot from the problems I've had and that is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a struggle, but I've gotten through. I've been
over-thinking and over-throwing, but I've learned a lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's teammates credit his determination to get out of tough
spots, even if he created them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get ahead of hitters the way he did last year,''
first baseman Eric Karros said. ``That is going to get you into
trouble no matter who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Although general manager Kevin Malone and club president Bob
Graziano have accompanied the team on the six-game trip to Chicago
and Florida, the biggest decisions will come this winter when the
Dodgers (63-71) try to retool their disappointing club.
</P>
<P>
   The team won for the 10th time in its last 13 road games and
have won 10 of 14 overall. But the eyes are on the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the wish list is Alex Rodriguez, a free agent after the 2000
season whom many think will be traded this winter if the Mariners
cannot sign him to a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek could be part of that offer, but with the New York
Mets and Atlanta Braves expected to throw prospects and front-line
players at Seattle, the Dodgers will need to offer a top pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Park was untouchable. Now the Dodgers aren't sure
what they have.

ABORTION TAKES AN EMOTIONAL TOLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years from now, when Arizona's anonymous 14-year-old girl
remembers the time she went to Kansas to have a 6-month-old fetus
aborted, she might feel any of these emotions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilt,'' said Prescott's Meagan Williams, 22, who had an
abortion at 15. ``It kills you. Now I notice every single pregnant
woman, every single baby, every single thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief. ``I feel like I did make the right decision, though,''
said Williams. ``Now, I would have a 7-year-old. I was just a child
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Regret. ``I was pregnant at age 14,'' said Tiffany Bunstein, now
28 and a teacher at a Mesa junior high who chose adoption. ``My
initial thought was to have an abortion. I thought that was the
easiest way out. But if you place (the baby up for adoption), you
still lose your child, but everyone benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Grief. Says Julie Lessard, a program coordinator for Tempe's
school for pregnant teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the girls that we know have gotten abortions we see
pregnant again within a year. They're going through grief and loss
and this is a way to kind of complete the cycle or make it right,
maybe a way to forget the pain and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, the Arizona girl might not spend time remembering it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to think about that kind of thing,'' said
Megan Hanley, 15, of Chandler, a girl who has never had to face
such a decision. ``We put it out of our minds, can't even imagine
(parenting). I baby-sit for four hours, then I'm ready to go home
and go with my friends and live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers who had abortions, teens that chose adoptions, teens
who kept the babies and the parents and and counselors who saw them
through all agree on one thing: making a decision like that at that
age takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The average 14-year-old girl) is worried about friends and
boys and being accepted,'' says Tempe child psychologist Ellen
Williams. ``The things that are happening to her now are all she
can see. She wants to be sure she's wearing what she's supposed to
wear, looking how she's supposed to look, saying what she's
supposed to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not confirmed the status of the case at this
point, except to say that she went to a Wichita, Kan., clinic to
have the abortion and apparently it is over.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the debate over the case of Arizona's girl has been the
viability of the fetus. At 24 weeks, the estimated maturity of the
baby, medical experts say that the baby has a 50 percent chance of
survival if born. The abortion is so controversial that is is
routinely performed for reasons other than health in Kansas and
California only.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Williams estimates that at this age, the average girl
might not be able to understand all sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A girl that age) cannot conceptualize about a life inside of
her. That's pretty abstract,'' says Ellen Williams. ``There's so
much fear involved that what you'd want to do is just make it go
away, go back to the prom. You're not thinking long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Ellen Williams added, it would be especially difficult for
a girl of this age to make the decision without relying on the
maturity of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is a ward of the court who has bounced from foster home
to foster home since she was 5 years old. Even now, in Kansas for
the abortion, she is without family. She was accompanied to a
Wichita clinic, one of the few places in the country that will
perform such late-term abortions, by a court-appointed advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, this was an issue she decided on 2{
months ago,'' Ellen Williams said. ``Her body probably didn't look
like it does now and her concern is maybe more about how she looks.
Kids who run away deal with their problems by running away from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if they have no other place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a child who has been parented,'' Ellen Williams
said. ``If she had, she would have been on birth control. We're
looking at the physical outcome of a lifestyle that hasn't really
taken care of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Meagan Williams still remembers the abortion she had at 15, and
now, seven years later, she can clearly see the effects that her
decision made on her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember everything too clearly, still,'' she said. ``I had
to wake up early, I remember what I wore, I remember going in there
and all they gave me was a Valium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was completely awake when it happened, and I remember
the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years after the abortion, she found herself in drug
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The abortion) was an issue I had to deal with in rehab,'' she
said, now working for a title company in Prescott. ``It was one of
my top three guilt issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meagan, who had her abortion about 7 weeks to term, thinks an
abortion at this date would be especially hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl has a baby. She has felt it kick. I think about the
spirit of my baby asking me, `Why are you getting rid of me?' and I
think `what if, what if, what if?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't do that. All I can do is accept what I have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she can understand. In her situation, she didn't feel she
had options. Even though the experience was harrowing, Meagan still
thinks she made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is entitled to their own decision, but if
they had the experience that I had, and, seven years later, still
remember it like it was yesterday, they wouldn't make that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Brown, 17, got pregnant at 16 and chose to keep her
baby. Her parents are helping her care for little Ashley Gayle
Burreul.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the emotions I am going through right now are very hard,
I'm very tired,'' she said. ``I knew that I had enough
encouragement and support to keep her, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I was 14, I would probably give it up for adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tiffany Bunstein did. Now 28, she was pregnant at
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awkward. It was embarrassing. I didn't want to deal
with the hassle of being pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunstein wanted to have an abortion, but her parents encouraged
her to take the selfless route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably be carrying that decision today if I didn't
have the parents I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunstein, who now teaches 14-year-olds at a Mesa junior high,
feels terrible for the anonymous Arizona girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me so sad that she has to make this decision, so sad
that she doesn't have the guidance in her life to show her the
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a decision to keep a child can be equally difficult.
Gilbert's Shelley Brown says she has gained a sense of maturity
since she decided to have her child. But life hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up a lot in the past nine months,'' said Shelley,
17, the mother of a 5-week-old baby girl who did not consider an
abortion. ``I never get any sleep, I can't just get up and leave
anymore with no worries, and I can't go out and hang with my
friends much anymore.'' &QL;
