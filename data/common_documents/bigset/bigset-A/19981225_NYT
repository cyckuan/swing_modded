TACO BELL SCORES BIG WITH TALKING CHIHUAHUA TOY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- He's ugly, he's skinny and he's got ears that
rise straight up like two pointy antennas.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't matter to 9-year-old Shannon Bloom from Canyon
Country, who is the proud owner of the talking stuffed toy
Chihuahua, mascot of Taco Bell's ``Yo quiero Taco Bell''
commercials. She owns the one that says ``Feliz Navidad, amigos''
and is itching to collect the remaining three to complete her set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was Christmasy and I liked it,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   During this holiday season, Americans have gobbled up 13 million
stuffed toy Chihuahuas. Taco Bell has an additional 10 million of
the promotional toys arriving and expects to sell out of them
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The stuffed animals are smaller, cheaper versions of a $15
Chihuahua toy available at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The canine creation was the idea of Applause Inc., a suburban
Woodland Hills-based specialist in producing what the industry
calls ``plush'' toys. Applause designed four styles of the plush
pooch and manufactured 23 million in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   They sell for $2.99 to $3.99 and say four phrases: ``Yo quiero
Taco Bell''; ``Viva gorditas''; ``Here, lizard, lizard''; and
``Feliz Navidad, amigos.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's Aunt Joyce has the complete set, and her grandmother
owns several. Her mother, Trasia Barnes, even knows men who collect
them. She said they especially like the one that says ``Here,
lizard, lizard'' -- a line in a Taco Bell commercial in which the
Chihuahua tried to lure Godzilla with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know wants them,'' said Barnes, with no small
measure of wonder. ``As far as Chihuahuas go, I think they're
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   A fad toy doesn't have to be pleasing to the eye to be
successful. In fact, some are downright ugly, said Charles
Bearchell, emeritus professor of marketing at California State
University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the Cabbage Patch doll,'' he said. ``Even if you've got
an ugly kid, you'll have a doll that's even more ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop shoppers from fighting each other for a
doll.
</P>
<P>
   Furbies are the hot item this holiday season. Beanie Babies were
the fad several months ago, and Tickle Me Elmos were flying off the
shelves last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fads may command high prices while they're hot, but they don't
have staying power. Bearchell estimates that trends fizzle out
between six weeks and about a year or two. To make the odds worse,
for every fad that hits it big, there are hundreds that languish on
the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Take the follow-up to the Hula Hoop. While the hoop became a
sensation, Bearchell said a follow-up toy called Nutty Knotter by
the same manufacturer was a flop. It consisted of a fake head
attached to a cord. By whirling the cord, the player would tie a
knot. Not surprisingly, it didn't strike a chord with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Applause hopes to hit plush-toy gold again soon.
</P>
<P>
   The company is collaborating with Taco Bell's parent, Tricon
Global Restaurants, to make toys for the ``Star Wars'' prequel,
``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause and Taco Bell offices were closed Christmas Eve, and
officials could not be reached for comment. They may have been out
buying toy Chihuahuas.

`BOUTIQUE' WINES PROVE GOOD BUY FOR SAVVY INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Suburban Oak Park resident Bill Kissane treats
fine wines like some people do blue-chip stocks: He buys and holds.
</P>
<P>
   Like 3- to 6-liter bottles of French and California reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-liter (bottles) I think are a good investment, but you
can also have them for a dinner party of six to eight people,''
said Kissane, an engineer at Litton Industries, on a recent weekend
day as he inspected some giant investment-grade bottles at the Duke
of Bourbon in suburban Canoga Park and chatted with Bob Long, owner
of Long Vineyards in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 30 cover of Wine Spectator provides a striking
illustration of why some investors are adding cabernet and bordeaux
to their financial portfolios. The magazine features two bottles of
1982 Chateau Petrus, a first-growth bordeaux, with a retail price
of $60 on release and $1,360 today.
</P>
<P>
   David Breitstein, owner of the Duke of Bourbon, said some wines
have achieved ``gem quality'' status, especially those from small
``boutique'' wineries that may just produce 300 to 500 cases a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so boutique that most people can't get their hands on
them. They are like IPOs,'' Breitstein said of the wines.
</P>
<P>
   Experts offer the following tips for building a wine portfolio:
</P>
<P>
   --Be prepared to invest some capital in caring for your
investment. This is critical, experts say, because if the wine is
not stored properly, it can go bad, and collectors can pick up
telltale hints without popping the cork.
</P>
<P>
   You can build your own temperature- and humidity-controlled
cellar or rent space in a professional wine storage facility. Shops
like the Duke of Bourbon can help with the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   --In general, focus on reds, said winemaker Long. ``It's going
to be bordeaux and a handful of California wines,'' he said. ``But
it will be primarily bordeaux, because their value has been
established over time.''
</P>
<P>
   --Thomas Matthews, a senior editor at Wine Spectator, said a
good way to start investing is buying ``futures,'' or wines that
have yet to be released at the retail level. That's typically the
lowest price at which the wine will sell. For example, that $1,360
Petrus had an initial futures price of $63 a bottle, or $756 a
case.
</P>
<P>
   --Buy wines from vintages, or years that get high ratings from
critics. That way you can be assured your investment has at least
some protection. Breitstein said the 1995 vintage is approaching
the quality of 1982, when the $1,360 Chateau Petrus was produced.
</P>
<P>
   --Be prepared to buy at least a case of wine and preferably
more. Matthews said buyers at auctions almost always pay more for
cases in their original packaging than they will for smaller
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   --Spread your money around. ``If you buy more than 10 cases of
any wine, you are really gambling,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   --Single bottles and mixed lots can be harder to sell than
cases.
</P>
<P>
   --Do your research by reading wine publications to find out
what's hot and develop a relationship with a wine shop, which will
help you in your quest for some of the rarer wines.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of Don Cowie, a regular customer of the
Duke of Bourbon. In 1990, he paid $79.95 for three bottles of
Chateau Latour from that vintage. Today collectors will gladly pony
up about $500 a bottle for the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie, a physical therapist, has drunk two of his treasures and
is saving the third for his son Darrin's wedding next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I buy is to drink and share with friends,'' he
said.

LEAD PAINT ON PLAY EQUIPMENT HAS L.A. PARKS OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- City Recreation and Parks Department officials
are moving to shut off access at six parks because of potential
lead exposure from paint and released a list of more than 120 other
facilities with ratings of their paint conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials said Thursday there has been no
indication of any child suffering illness from ingesting lead paint
at any of the city's park facilities. Childhood lead poisoning can
lead to brain damage, learning disabilities or a loss in IQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for anyone to panic,'' said Councilman Mike
Feuer, chairman of the City Council's Arts, Health and Humanities
Committee, who had asked for the report on the danger from lead
paint. ``What we are told by the Department of Health Services is
that problems develop only from long-term ingestion of lead
paint.''
</P>
<P>
   George Stigile, assistant general manager of the parks
department, said it was decided to close off buildings completely
rather than cordon off only problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to close the building rather than the entire
facility,'' Stigile said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of park facilities to be inspected had the six being
closed at the immediate-priority level. There were 58 in the
high-priority category, 27 in the medium-priority group, 11 in low
priority and 25 were listed as nonapplicable.
</P>
<P>
   But Feuer cautioned that the list might overstate the problem at
some facilities based on a cursory survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to release this to let the public know what's going
on,'' the councilman said. ``But some of these facilities might
have peeling paint that is not lead-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing of lead paint was banned in 1978 by the
federal government, but it still can be found in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in a house built before 1978, there is probably
lead paint there,'' Stigile said. ``The same with office buildings.
What we are telling people is to take the same precautions as they
would in their own home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stigile said the department has contacted its lead-paint
consultants, who will work with the county Health Services
Department to further identify the problems at all city facilities
and determine where remedial work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said his committee has set a Jan. 13 hearing to get more
information on the conditions and the level of work to be required.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commission Chairman Steve Soboroff said the department has
received assurances that playground equipment is lead-free, but he
warned that there might still be problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of well-meaning people, and someone may have
painted a piece of equipment with lead-based paint and no one knew
about it,'' Soboroff said. ``But our main concern is public safety.
We have to go in there and make sure there is no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said health officials have told him the major problem is
for children under age 6 who crawl and could pick up lead paint or
dust and taste it.
</P>
<P>
   Stigile said recreation supervisors are on the alert for such
behavior and are monitoring children.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer, who had called for the assessment in July, said at the
time that he was disappointed by the lack of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that so little was known then since this
paint had been banned since 1978,'' he said, ``but I have been
pleased with the response since and the work going on to make our
children safe.''

WE GOT GAMES 
 AREA BECOMES SPORTS HOTBED WITH FIESTA BOWL ON THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The millennium has arrived for metro Phoenix sports.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fiesta Bowl's fourth national-championship game in 13
years, Tempe will host the last of a long line of signature events
in the 1990s. Over the past decade, the Valley of the Sun has
undergone a meteoric rise in stature, from minor-league desert
outpost to sports mecca. And no one in the industry sees Jan. 4 as
the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix still is in young sports adulthood and hungry for more.
Beyond the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, look for events such as:
</P>
<P>
   The NHL All-Star Game, which Commissioner Gary Bettman promises
if the Coyotes get their own arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which is sure to come
to Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Basketball Final Four, for which there are two
potential suitors: BOB, which aspires to host the first open-air
Final Four; and Rio Salado Crossing, a retractable-dome, removable
grass facility that the Cardinals are hoping to build.
</P>
<P>
   A spot in the regular Super Bowl rotation, which the Cardinals
believe would be a spinoff result of a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four, which could come as soon
as 2003 or 2004 to America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And further down the road, perhaps a realistic pursuit of the
Goodwill or Pan American games.
</P>
<P>
   The sports scene in the Valley, long the province of Arizona
State and the Suns, began to expand in the 1980s, with a couple of
national-championship Fiesta Bowls and the arrival of the Arizona
Cardinals from St. Louis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The scene became more kaleidoscopic in the 1990s. America West
Arena opened in 1992, which led to an NBA All-Star Game in 1995.
January 1996 brought the Florida-Nebraska Fiesta Bowl title game,
followed by Super Bowl XXX. The Coyotes emigrated from Winnipeg in
1996, and the Diamondbacks began play in the $358 million Bank One
Ballpark in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is Phoenix has been really positioned as a sports
city,'' said Rick Burton, director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing
Center at the University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And the area's other assets _ a thriving economy, mild climate,
etc. _ will continue to make it an attractive sports locale.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says there are more benefits than what he sees as
inflated economic-impact reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of local pride or patriotism, it causes people to
believe, `I live someplace that is significant or meaningful.' I
view the sports stadium as the village green, where we used to
gather to celebrate our shared heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   That's similar to the message of Tostitos Fiesta Bowl Executive
Director John Junker, who says this year's first Bowl Championship
Series title game is predicted to have a direct economic impact of
$120 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never here to argue about the last penny,'' Junker said.
``The issue is it's big, it's clean, it's fun, it's important, it's
generated by the hometown team of volunteers. And in order to keep
growing, there is going to need to be future commitments made.''
</P>
<P>
   That translates to facilities _ always a knotty issue when
taxpayers are asked to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The $90 million America West Arena, which turns 7 next year,
remains a world-class venue to Suns President/CEO and Diamondbacks
Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo, but recently has been
criticized for more than obstructed hockey seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a state-of-the-art building by today's standards,''
Coyotes defenseman Gerald Diduck has said.
</P>
<P>
   Central players &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes and the Cardinals are central players in the
uncertain future of Phoenix sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are pushing a proposed $600 million renovation of
Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale that would include a 20,000-seat
hockey arena.
</P>
<P>
   About six miles away, Mesa wants to build the $1.8 billion Rio
Salado Crossing with a 67,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof
and floor for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals have their share of vocal detractors.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, Athletic Director Kevin White promises that Arizona
State ``will be the Number 1 physical plant in America'' within the
next decade, which will require up to $125 million in improvements
at 40-year-old Sun Devil Stadium _ not only for ASU's purposes but
to keep the Fiesta Bowl from relocating to Rio Salado Crossing,
should it come to pass. &QL; 
May votes likely
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo is out of the cross hairs on the new projects except
for his role as landlord to the Coyotes. But he's had a lot of
first-hand experience in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``These projects are a long way from reality at this point,''
Colangelo said. ``As it relates to the Cardinals, they've had this
great desire for their own new facility, and that package will be
very appealing to a number of people. It would be in their best
interest to have a new facility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As to the Coyotes, those issues can be resolved from what
we're understanding. But if that's their pleasure, that's their
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious this (area) has been a proving ground of
developing concepts and partnerships. Anyone who follows with a
subsequent project has the advantage of looking back in what
transpired and the advantage of new forms of financing and
packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Although significantly different in taxpayer demand, the Los
Arcos and Rio Salado Crossing projects will face a public vote,
both probably in May, something that neither Colangelo-run facility
had to hurdle. But the backlash price that Colangelo and elected
officials have paid for not going through the polls has been
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a controversial issue since I've been here,'' said
Coyotes President Shawn Hunter. ``That issue is beginning to
dwindle and starting to soften as people experience America West
Arena and Bank One Ballpark. As people get a chance to visit the
venue, they're more comfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it makes the Cardinals and Coyotes move forward
cautiously. It's caused us to take some wide turns that a lot of
teams and cities don't have to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``These projects are enormous and they take time. When you start
out, you have to be patient and develop a thick skin because not
everyone is as passionate as you are about the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Vice President Michael Bidwill senses a softening of
opposition to public funding to projects such as Rio Salado
Crossing, pointing to a recent poll of East Valley residents on the
convention center/stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the more people learn about it, the more support it
gets, and that this will be successful,'' Bidwill said.
``Throughout the United States, voters are supporting
public-private partnerships to build facilities without as much
economic impact as Rio Salado. We're presenting a better package
than has been presented around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hunter, Bidwill believes the amenities at America West
Arena and Bank One Ballpark are a significant selling point for the
new projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have certainly benefited from those two buildings,
and it's also given both of those teams the opportunity to be
successful in acquiring free agents and maintaining their own
players,'' he said. ``Everybody loves Bank One Ballpark and
recognizes it is a huge success and a good idea to build. The
footnote is people didn't like the (funding) process. This process
is different.'' &QL; 
`Commitment to build'
</P>
<P>
   However the facility votes go, Phoenix, the newest of 10 markets
(Atlanta joins next year) with four major professional sports, has
enough variety on its sports platter to rival any of the other
nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any coincidence that you have some
top-notch baseball talent signing to play here,'' Junker said.
``They can pick from six places, and it's not just because it's a
sunny place to live. It's a good place to live because there is a
commitment to growth, a commitment to service, a commitment to
build.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beat goes on:
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open raises its purse to $3 million, one of richest
on the PGA Tour, with an eye toward joining the World Golf
Championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix International Raceway approaches $300 million in annual
economic impact primarily for the West Valley, a lesser beneficiary
of much of the sports industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Cactus League hopes to attract the Los Angeles Dodgers to
add the crowning piece to a renaissance that has all 10 teams
playing in new or refurbished stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   And Arizona State, the only Division I university in the
nation's fastest-growing county, is in the midst of $25 million
athletic fund-raising drive (Sun Devil Stadium excepted) that will
return its physical plant to the stature of the late 1970s glory
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to reclaim that position because of this
institution and the marketplace with its unique forces,'' said
White, coming up on the third anniversary of his hiring at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some tremendous professional sports operators, and
that's tremendous competition. At the same time, the demographics
(100,000 ASU alumni in Arizona, most in Maricopa County) are on our
side. Sports is pop culture in America today. We're at the right
place at exactly the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill Games bid &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, too, could be the Maricopa County Sports Commission, which
is investigating ways to increase its annual budget of $750,000 and
become a genuine player in amateur sports bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in some discussions with government and corporate
members who have a vision for this,'' said Herman Frazier, MCSC
chairman, a vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee and
reigning President of the Fiesta Bowl. ``I'm optimistic we can get
to a point where we can bid on the Goodwill Games. We need to have
a multisport event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games, which brought 1,500 athletes from 60
countries to greater New York City last summer, are going to
Brisbane, Australia, in 2001 then returning to the United States in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 creation of Ted Turner in response to the '80 and '84
Olympic boycotts, the Goodwill Games have reshaped themselves into
a television-friendly format for the most popular Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what we bring to the table in resources and assets, it
(Goodwill Games) has a lot of upside,'' said Mike Plant, Goodwill
Games president and vice president of Turner Sports. ``It can
behoove a city like Phoenix or any other city when a big machine
gets behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pan American Games, a much bigger and more expensive
operation, is second in size to only the Olympics (6,500 athletes
from 42 countries). They go from Winnipeg in 1999 to Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic, in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, North Carolina and South Florida are the U.S. areas
bidding for the 2007 games. If Phoenix can muster the support, it
could potentially bid on the 2015 games, a process that would begin
in 2005. &QL; 
New leaders emerge
</P>
<P>
   Who will lead the Phoenix sports movement into the future?
</P>
<P>
   The Valley sports leadership for the next decade ranges from
33-year-old Suns General Manager/Vice President Bryan Colangelo and
34-year-old Michael Bidwill to Junker, Frazier and White, all in
their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, Cardinals President Bill Bidwill is gratefully
relinquishing the public point-man duties he has never relished to
his son. But Jerry Colangelo, 35th on ``The Sporting News'' top 100
of the most powerful people in sports (Frazier is No. 70), is
hardly ready for pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 59 and feel 39,'' said Colangelo, who came to Phoenix in
1968 as the then-youngest general manager in NBA history. ``The way
I feel today, I plan to stay active for quite a long time. I feel
physically and mentally at the top of my game. If I were to lose
that passion and enthusiasm, it would be another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exciting to be part of this for 30 years. Most of
what's happened has been in the last decade, and that bodes well
for the future. There is tremendous upside for growth and
potential.'' &QL;

NEW, HAPPY LIFE IN U.S. FOR CROATIAN TEENAGER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As the world watched the Baghdad night light up, the
guy whose St. Mary's High School family calls ``Z'' wanted no part
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen enough of it already,'' he told his legal guardian,
Donna Beardsley, who had asked if he wanted to watch the news
reports of the American missile strikes in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Zeljko Gavranovic, 17, a senior, headed to basketball
practice at St. Mary's gym, a world away from the place he left six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was 11, old enough to remember Croatia, the war, the bombs,
his father being killed by a grenade, friends buried beneath the
rubble in Sarajevo, his family's home and business burned down.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers how he, his 6-year-old sister and mother fled to
Austria with just the clothes on their backs; how he took care of
his sister, Irena, while his mother worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was going on, but it was hard to understand why it
was happening,'' Gavranovic said. ``Everybody living there was
afraid of getting killed. You're scared. You can't sleep. You can't
eat. It's just a very bad feeling. I wouldn't want anybody to have
to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories were made fresher by the recent attacks in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can bring up post-traumatic stress,'' said Beardsley, who
is a psychotherapist in Phoenix. ``He's got some gruesome stories.
I don't push him on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic shares the past with those close to him. But he
mostly likes to forget and look forward to a life in America past
high school. He is like most other 17-year-old boys. He loves
basketball, cars, girls and going to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would guess from his command of English that he has been
in America only two years, or from his happy-go-lucky attitude and
quiet charm that he has an uncertain future here.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic is here on a student visa. In February, he turns 18.
After graduating, he could be called back to join the Croatian
army, if he is not going to school. It is not a world he wants to
be part of.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley and her husband, Richard Smith, a federal attorney,
want to adopt Gavranovic and see that he obtains citizenship. They
are working with attorneys to push it through the system, which can
be slow.
</P>
<P>
   They are waiting for his mother, Danica, who lives in Vienna and
doesn't speak English, to give her consent. He can be adopted up to
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hurt her,'' Beardsley said. ``She lost her
husband and this is her only son, so she worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother has said to him, `You're old enough now. You know
what is best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What Gavranovic prays for is a college scholarship. He is making
high Bs, after learning English so well from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty good guy, but it's taken me a year to learn to
pronounce his name,'' said Knights teammate Michael Stidham.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic speaks four languages: Croatian, English, German and
some French. He is 6 feet 5 and a solid if not powerful forward for
the seventh-ranked Knights, scoring 10 points and grabbing seven
rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Z' has gotten more aggressive and physical,'' St. Mary's
Coach David Lopez said. ``I don't think he was used to the physical
play of American ball. He's gotten a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coachable, nice, fits in with everyone around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic doesn't stay awake nights dreaming of an NBA future.
He just wants to stay here. He'd like to get an international
business degree.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hall, a Phoenix resident and coach who saw Gavranovic at a
youth basketball camp near Vienna more than two years ago, calls
small four-year colleges across the country. He searches for a
coach as sympathetic as he was to Gavranovic's story, hoping
somebody will give the young man a scholarship. As long as he is in
school, he doesn't have to go back to Croatia, Beardsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see myself going back there again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic is hoping to get a job after basketball season, but
that becomes tricky without citizenship and a green card.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he may have to return to the uncertainty of Europe,
where his mother is struggling to keep her job. He doesn't have the
money to pay out-of-state college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been a hurdle,'' said Hall, who hired Lopez at
Glendale Apollo in the late '70s and was responsible for getting
Gavranovic to St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   After spending his junior year at St. Mary's, Gavranovic
returned to Europe to renew his passport and be with his family. He
spent two months in Vienna, where an uncle gave his family refuge
six years ago. His uncle paid his tuition, roughly $4,000, at St.
Mary's last school year, but didn't have the money to for his
senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was calling for some help and my phone rang,'' said Hall,
who travels the world to conduct basketball clinics. ``I picked it
up, and a person who wants to remain anonymous said, `My wife and I
talked it over, and we'll take care of (the tuition).' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the tuition taken care of, Smith and Beardsley opened their
home to Gavranovic just before the September deadline. He missed
the first week of school.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley got to know Gavranovic last year, when he dated her
daughter, Vanessa. An extra room opened when Vanessa moved to
Hollywood to attend a performing arts school.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley said she found Gavranovic to be perceptive, sensitive,
polite and well-mannered. She said he oftens asks if there are
chores he can do around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband never had children, so he's like in heaven,''
Beardsley said. `` `Z' has said that if he had to choose somebody
other than his real father, it would be Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic keeps a framed picture of his father, Vojo, in his
bedroom. His father was 19 in the picture, the only photo remaining
of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him,'' he said. ``We were close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic looks forward to another Christmas in America.
Beardsley's mother, who speaks German, will be here from
Connecticut, giving him someone to converse with in German. It also
will give him a greater sense of what he misses in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   His mother calls every Sunday and tells him to behave and keep
up his grades. He talks to his sister, a volleyball star at her
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family has been wonderful,'' Beardsley said. ``When he
first came here, they'd send boxes and boxes of gifts. They're very
happy that he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is hard not seeing his mother and sister on
Christmas, Gavranovic is grateful for a gift that didn't come under
a tree. He is grateful for his American home, for a chance to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people around here have made me feel like part of
their family,'' he said. ``The coaches, the students, the parents.
They're great. It's been overwhelming. It feels like home.'' &QL;

UA'S SMITH CAN CELEBRATE RELATIONSHIP WITH FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Smith is home for Christmas with several gifts.
</P>
<P>
   There is Arizona's 11-1, Cinderella-like season. A No. 5
national ranking and a chance at a 12th victory Wednesday against
Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl are a couple of very nice stocking
stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. A lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's dad, Stu, is recovering from cancer and a series of
small strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Smith's battle through radiation treatment and eventual
recovery coincided with his son's steady, poised role as one of
Arizona's quarterbacks. At Christmas, the father and the son can
celebrate a relationship that has been an inexhaustible gift for
both.
</P>
<P>
   One endured as the other emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my son really became a man this year,'' Stu Smith said
from the family home in Newbury Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The son will tell you that he has, in large part because his dad
was always there with advice on everything from throwing techniques
to the responsibility of sharing the quarterback role with Ortege
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk two or three times a week and always before a game,''
said Smith, a junior who went home Thursday night during a break in
the Wildcats' workout schedule at San Diego State before next
week's game at Qualcomm Stadium. ``It's important to me. He'd just
give me advice like staying within myself. That sort of thing. My
dad and I have been communicating like that for as long as I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged letters when Smith played in junior high school
and later as a prep star in the Los Angeles area. The communication
continued long distance when Smith went to Arizona. But, at times,
it was difficult this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Smith was struck with prostate cancer in June. He already
had suffered a couple of small strokes. Then, there was a third. At
the time, Keith was already in Tucson preparing himself for a
preseason camp at Cochise College and then the season itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, questions swirled about his ability to share the
quarterbacking duties with Jenkins. In retrospect, those questions
had to seem minor.
</P>
<P>
   He always had relied heavily on his dad. He went to him when he
thought about transferring last spring amid speculation that
Jenkins would be the Wildcats' quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to stick it out, all along,'' said Smith, who
also had long talks with Arizona Coach Dick Tomey about his
options. ``He just wanted to make sure that I was convinced I was
doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his dad who talked him into returning to college football
after a season in the Detroit Tigers' minor-league system. The
return meant Smith had to give back a $220,000 bonus, which is a
lot of money for a 19-year-old kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always told me to play the sport I want, not because of
money, but because of a love for it,'' said Keith, who at 5 feet 11
has always been written off by scouts and recruiters as too short.
``He used to tell me that when I was real young. Truth is, I didn't
really have to talk to him about returning that money. I did, of
course. But, all along, I knew I was going to give it back, because
of what he had taught me long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm playing football today, thank God. There's no
way I would be the football player I am without him. He made me
dedicate myself to the game and always reminded me that love of the
game was more important than the money or the politics that went
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the strict, sterile perspective of medicine and science,
it's impossible to say whether the son's leading role in Arizona's
season had any impact on his dad's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But from the dad's perspective, there's no doubt his well-being
was propelled by the weekly news that, once again, his son's poise
and maturity more than made up for his lack of height.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Stu Smith, a track star at Los Angeles
Dorsey High nearly 50 years ago who also worked briefly as a
sportswriter for the old`` Los'' ``Angeles Herald-Examiner.'' ``I
went through the radiation for seven-and-a-half weeks through most
of the season. Because of that I wasn't able to go to all of the
games. I still went to as many as I could. But I was able to follow
the games, and that's been a real blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride that the dad had for his son week after week proved to
be an immeasurable, yet powerful medicine, said Renate Smith, Stu's
wife and Keith's mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely,'' said Renate, who believes the joy her
husband felt in his son's consistent play was a key addition to the
withering regimen of chemotherapy and medication.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking coincidence, one of Stu Smith's toughest times
happened on the same day that Arizona suffered its lone loss. Smith
wasn't able to watch the UCLA game on Oct. 10. The chemo sapped his
strength, knocked him down, as UCLA beat the Wildcats, 52-28, at
Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it, because it came right in the middle of
radiation treatment when he was really feeling bad,'' Renate said.
</P>
<P>
   But there also was a moment the week before that provided a
great boost. Arizona was playing Washington at Seattle's Husky
Stadium. It was a night that Jenkins somersaulted into the end zone
for a game-winning touchdown that in many ways sums up Arizona's
improbable season.
</P>
<P>
   In a play that has been all but forgotten, a Smith pass was
pivotal in the drive that ended with Jenkins' bit of high-flying
artistry. Smith came on and tossed a first-down strike to Jenkins,
of all people.
</P>
<P>
   What Stu Smith remembers more than anything, however, is the
``Sports'' ``Illustrated'' photo of Jenkins in mid-vault. His
oldest son, Brian Smith, was at the game. Brian traveled to Seattle
because his dad could not. Brian got a seat behind the end zone
into which Jenkins landed, feet-first.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, the guy in the red coat with blue pockets is
Brian Smith. At one side of the photo, there's an exultant Keith
Smith leaping about three feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that and thought to myself: `How many dads can have both
of their sons in ``Sports Illustrated'' all at once?' '' Stu Smith
said. ``It was a reason to feel very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   A reason to say Merry Christmas. &QL;

LEAF HAS LOST CHARGERS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Finally, frustrated San Diego Chargers' fans are
buying into the decision to draft quarterback Ryan Leaf with the
second pick overall last April.
</P>
<P>
   He's a steal at half price, which is what Leaf jerseys were sold
for at Qualcomm Stadium last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Allan, manager of The Sports Fan sporting goods store,
wishes he would have thought of that. He can't give away Leaf's No.
16 jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and joke around about how much they are,''
Allan said. ``They say, `Do you have any Ryan Leaf jerseys?' They
know we're not selling any of these. They're just making fun of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Few NFL players have turned off their town faster than ``Cryin''
Leaf. It's so bad, ``San Diego'' magazine recently talked to
public-relations types on how to improve Leaf's image. The headline
on the story was ``Saving No-so-Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a terrible year,'' Leaf said. ``I've had
terrible years before and always have been able to bounce back. I
have to turn it into something beneficial. It's only going to make
me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee ``Hacksaw'' Hamilton, who hosts a radio sports-talk show on
XTRA in San Diego, thinks many Chargers fans already have given up
on Leaf, who has annoyed teammates, feuded with the media, been
accused of going on a drunken binge near the Washington State
campus and been forced to deny recent reports that he fell asleep
in team meetings, was late to others and gone through the motions
in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lost his teammates, lost his community and lost
games,'' said Hamilton, who formerly worked at KTAR in Phoenix.
``That's about as nasty a combination as you can get. He can't
play, can't study and can't talk his way out of situations. In 16
weeks of the season, not one of his teammates has come to his
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Chargers prepare for their season finale
against the Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium, teammates finally have
decided to speak out against Leaf, who has committed 19 turnovers
and thrown just two touchdown passes and hasn't started since Nov.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Kurt Gouveia told ``Sports Illustrated'' that Leaf
needs to grow up. ``You're in the pros now,'' he said. ``Stand up
and be accountable. Futures are at stake. This is not a place for
kids who've got a lot of money to joke around.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Seau, the Chargers' superstar middle linebacker, took
several shots at Leaf on Wednesday, two days after anonymous
players said they didn't want Leaf to start against the Cardinals
because of a lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, you have to perform,'' Seau said. ``You can have
all the marketing tools. You can be touted as a potential great
athlete in the NFL, but what it comes down to is gaining respect in
the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Chargers interim coach June Jones acknowledged that the players'
feelings about Leaf affected his decision to start Craig Whelihan
ahead of Leaf on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf knows he has a lot of enemies in the Chargers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my teammates want me out there,'' he said. &QL; 
Could've been a Cardinal
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL experts thought the Cardinals made a mistake when they
traded the second pick overall in last April's draft to San Diego,
bypassing their chance to get Leaf, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Year at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to stick with second-year pro Jake Plummer, who
entered this season with only nine career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Plummer is the NFL's second-richest player, and Leaf has
been called a $31.25 million mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was put in a tough situa tion,'' said Plummer, who shares
the same agent as Leaf, Leigh Steinberg. ``The whole thing about
getting drafted so soon and having to play immediately is unfair
for any quarterback. He's a tough guy. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau thinks Leaf would be much better off if he were more like
Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see someone go to a position and take that
position and blossom,'' Seau said. ``We need more Jake Plummers in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf didn't get off to a great start with Seau in training camp
when he balked at paying a $2,800 bill the veterans ran up at a
sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to Leaf that it was a camp tradition. He didn't
want to pay and tore up the bill. He complained about it but
eventually paid.
</P>
<P>
   He won the starting job in preseason and led the Chargers to
victories in their first two games. But he completed only 1 of 15
passes for 4 yards on Sept. 20 in Kansas City and then cursed a TV
cameraman in the locker room after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Posner of the ``San Diego Union-Tribune'' newspaper wrote
about the incident, prompting Leaf to go into another
obscenity-laced tirade the next day. Leaf also threw a ball at the
head of Posner at practice but missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his problems are self-inflicted,'' Steinberg said.
``His reaction to his performance in Kansas City was extreme. His
interaction with the reporter was caught on tape and played ad
nauseum. So instead of a 20-second blow-up, it was played like the
Rodney King tape over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's behavior became even more bizarre. After throwing four
interceptions in a loss to the New York Giants the next week, he
questioned whether he was good enough to play in the NFL and said,
``It kind of feels like someone ripped my heart out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to play better after Coach Kevin Gilbride was fired and
his replacement, June Jones, simplified the offense. But then
during the bye week, he went to Pullman, Wash., and was alleged to
have been thrown out of two establishments for rowdy behavior and
accused of throwing beer on two students, spitting on the outside
window of one place and telling numerous people, ``I can buy you
all.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't help his image in San Diego any when he said he had no
regrets about the Pullman incident and acknowledged that ``I'm not
very likeable'' and ``am simply paying the price for my fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Chargers General Manager Bobby Beathard was so upset with Leaf's
behavior, he said Leaf's ``career could be crumbling'' if he didn't
mature.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has started only one other game and lost the San Diego
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad Jim McMahon act,'' Hamilton said. ``It's all
staged and has all blown up in his face. He has to shut his mouth
and do things on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect that to happen this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jones said he plans to use him against the
Cardinals, Leaf thinks he has played his last game of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to take Craig (Whelihan) out and ruin the
camaraderie,'' Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think his teammates have judged him fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things have happened, people have pointed fingers,'' he
said. ``Sure I deserve some of the finger-pointing, but I've always
been told that if you're pointing the finger, somebody has three
fingers pointing back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   So he hasn't fallen asleep at team meetings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how anybody would know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude won't sell any more jerseys. &QL;

CARDINALS RECEIVE BLACKOUT EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The NFL on Thursday granted a request by
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill to extend the local-television
blackout deadline until 4 p.m. on Saturday for Sunday's season
finale with San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   League rules stipulate that a game must be sold out 72 hours in
advance, which would have been at 2:15 p.m. Thursday, to lift the
TV blackout.
</P>
<P>
   At the 72-hour audit, the club had sold 63,039 tickets in
72,994-seat Sun Devil Stadium, powered by unprecedented ticket
demand every day this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals (8-7) beat the Chargers (5-10), the Cardinals
would end the league's longest drought at 16 years and move on to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill said he began talks with the league regarding the
blackout-lift extension on Tuesday. The NFL granted the request
because of the consistent ticket demand this week and the holiday.
The league has made exceptions in the past for teams approaching
sellouts during holidays or when unusual weather might have
prevented travel to a ticket office. It is the first exception
granted to his team, according to Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   If the game is sold out by 4 p.m. Saturday, it will be telecast
live Sunday on KPHO (Channel 5).
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been probably the most dramatic response we've ever
had to a game in my memory,'' Bidwill said. ``If it had been a
normal week on sales I wouldn't have made the call. But we
experienced an unusual amount of business after the New Orleans
game last Sunday at the stadium and Monday was as large a day as
we've ever had in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been building a hard corps of fans, we just extended
that last Sunday (in a 19-17 last-second comeback win over New
Orleans). A lot of people missed a great football game, and we've
had a lot of those in the last two years. It seems a lot of them
are thinking this might be one they don't want to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   The ticket office at the team's headquarters, at Warner and
Hardy in Tempe, will be open today from noon to 8:30 p.m., and
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Tickets may be purchased at
ETM kiosks at Safeway stores on Saturday. The kiosks are closed
today. Telephone orders may be placed 24 hours a day during the
holidays at 1-888-ETM-TIXS.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are aware of at least two local businesses that
have purchased large blocks. Skip Sorely of Top Flight Construction
bought 100 to give to kids and Ron Clark of Ben Franklin Press
bought 100 as gifts for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill said the club would not buy any remaining tickets before
the new blackout deadline because ``the blackout rule as a
precedent has been very important to the home gate.'' He said he
was aware of some talk that others would.
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, director of operations at Channel 5, was not
available for comment whether the station would guarantee the
sellout.
</P>
<P>
   The players are aware of the increased ticket demand and
interest in their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to us,'' said tackle Lomas Brown, an offensive
co-captain. ``The crowd last week was great, but a sellout this
week would be terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, whose team has suffered more than its share of hardship
and ridicule _ it hasn't had a winning record since moving here in
1988 _ acknowledged that he is surprised and moved by the
outpouring of support this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will sell out by game time but I don't know if it
will lift by Saturday. The league was very gracious to extend the
deadline to see if we can get the lift.'' &QL;

TKACHUK GETS GOOD NEWS  
 MINOR KNEE INJURY WON'T KEEP HIM SIDELINED LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes received some good news on Thursday when
tests revealed Keith Tkachuk does not have any serious damage to
his injured right knee and that the left wing could be back in the
lineup early next week.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic resonance imaging examination showed Tkachuk, the
team's leading goal scorer with 17, suffered only a sprained medial
collateral ligament, not a tear or any cartilage damage, as was
feared after he was checked hard into the boards during Tuesday's
6-2 victory in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's good news,'' Tkachuk said. ``I mean, I'm happy
it's not worse, but I'm not happy about having to miss any games,
period. But I thought it was going to be a lot worse than this. I
really did.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith said Tkachuk had a slim chance of
being able to play Saturday night in Los Angeles, but he then
backtracked and said it was more likely that the power forward
would return Monday when the Kings visit America West Arena, or
possibly Wednesday when Wayne Gretzky and the New York Rangers make
their only trip to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shooting for one of those two _ if I can,'' said Tkachuk,
who within the next several days is expected to be named to his
third straight All-Star Game. ``I'm still a little surprised, to
tell you the truth. I thought it was a tear. I had a real bad
feeling it was going to be a lot, lot worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings forward Kris Draper crashed into Tkachuk in the first
period of Tuesday's game and then rolled over Tkachuk's knee, which
slammed hard to the ice. He continued to play, and later scored a
goal and added an assist as Phoenix beat Detroit for the second
straight time, but the knee stiffened up on him later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really got a lot worse after that,'' he said. ``It was
really sore. But, hey, it turns out it isn't so bad. Our trainer,
Gord Hart, told me it won't keep me out very long at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fellow left wing Mike Sullivan is also expected to
make a quick recovery from a broken big toe, suffered last week in
St. Louis when he got hit by a slap shot from Al MacInnis. Smith
said Sullivan could play Saturday, ``if he can get his foot into
his skate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have been fortunate all season when it comes to
injuries. They have lost just 35 man-games to injury through 29
games, among the fewest in the NHL after the first third of the
season, compared to 124 man-games lost at this point last season,
when they led the league with 475.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important for every team to keep your players
healthy,'' Smith said. ``We've been very lucky this year. We've had
some injuries, but certainly, nothing serious, and that's obviously
been a big contributor to our success so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who recently also has been hobbled by a pulled groin,
has only missed three games to date despite playing a rugged style
and taking repeated abuse in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very durable guy his whole career,'' Smith said.
``He's a guy we don't expect to miss a lot of games. But when a
player hurts his knee, and there's some uncertainty there, and he's
still able to come back after a few days, yeah, you feel lucky.'' &QL;

PACKERS GAME KEY TO PLAYING TIME FOR 49ERS YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This fantasy football season has been the tale of
three quarterbacks _  &UR; Randall Cunningham, Steve Young and  &UR; Brett
Favre.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the last week be any different?
</P>
<P>
   In many leagues, owners who drafted those guys probably went
deep into the playoffs. But for leagues that play the championship
game in Week 17, two of three may let you down.
</P>
<P>
   It shakes out like this: Favre will play, since the Packers must
beat the Bears to have a shot at hosting a wild-card playoff game
against the 49ers. If Green Bay wins their game, which begins at 11
a.m., that will force  &UR; Steve Young and his ailing knee into an
afternoon game against the Rams. A win would allow the 49ers to
host the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   But say the Packers lose. Improbable, but not impossible. With
nothing to play for, it's unlikely the 49ers will want to risk
losing Young for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Cunningham, who is nursing a broken left hand.
That's not the one he throws with, but Minnesota has home field
locked up throughout the playoffs. I bet we'll get a heavy dose of
 &UR; Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I keep harping. Have the Fantasy Bowl in Week 16.
Saves on Bromo. Anyway, let's hand out the regular season Mully
Awards. &QL; 
Quarterback &QL; 
Most outstanding performer: Cunningham, Vikings. With more than
3,400 passing yards and 32 touchdowns, only Young has better
statistics. But in most fantasy leagues, Cunningham was drafted
much later that Young, if at all. That greatly increases his value.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise:  &UR; Peyton Manning, Colts. I guess he is his
daddy, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust:  &UR; Scott Mitchell, Lions. He has some of the best
receivers around, and still gets benched for a rookie. &QL; 
Running back &QL; 
Most outstanding performer:  &UR; Terrell Davis, Broncos. That stampede
you heard is every defensive coordinator in the league rushing to
get the tape of Monday night's Denver-Miami game. The Dolphins held
Davis to 29 yards rushing, but he still has a crack at 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise:  &UR; Jamal Anderson, Falcons. I knew he was in for
a good season, especially when his competition,  &UR; Byron Hanspard,
went down in training camp. But nobody thought Anderson would break
the Falcons rushing record and score 15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust:  &UR; Jerome Bettis, Steelers. Three touchdowns. Three?
Something stinks in Pittsburgh. But  &UR; Bill Cowher must be a great
coach. After all, he has a jutting chin. &QL; 
Wide receiver
</P>
<P>
   Most outstanding performer:  &UR; Randy Moss, Vikings. He's already
amassed 1,300 yards and an amazing 16 touchdowns. Defensive backs
might want to try tying his shoelaces together or something. For
some reason, nobody's talking about his past anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise:  &UR; Eric Moulds, Bills. The best thing that ever
happened to this guy was the arrival of  &UR; Doug Flutie, who isn't shy
about chucking the pigskin. The result: 1,278 yards and eight
touchdowns for the fleet-footed Moulds.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest bust:  &UR; Michael Irvin, Cowboys. Irvin has a 1,000-yard
season. But he's scored just one touchdown all year. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   Despite my earlier concerns, I'd go ahead and start Young.
There's no reason the Packers shouldn't clobber the Bears, and
Young is pretty tough. My guess is he'll play until 49ers get
comfortably ahead. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
Kind of late to rescue your squad, but a few guys might help.
Chicago overnight sensation  &UR; James Allen might be worth a try at
running back. And with Dallas playing a meaningless game against
Washington, you might want to grab Cowboys backup  &UR; Sherman
Williams, as Emmitt Smith gets some rest. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
This week it's Miami wide receiver  &UR; Lamar Thomas, who scored three
touchdowns against the Broncos Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, Merry Christmas! &QL;

<P>
   IRAQ-CHRISTMAS (Baghdad) _ Christmas in Baghdad. By Stephen
Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPEACH &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-PROSECUTORS (Washington) _ The Republican congressmen
appointed as managers of President Clinton's impeachment trial in
the Senate have as many questions as answers about the historic
roles they are set to play. By Frank J. Bruni. (1450 words)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RULES (Undated) _ Text of the 25 rules for impeachment
proceedings adopted by the Senate on March 2, 1868, to govern the
trial of President Andrew Johnston. (3000 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other Washington &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-CHRISTMAS (Washington) _ Some government employees, like
firefighters for the nation, remain on station this Christmas day.
By Irvin Molotsky. (800 words)

</P>
<P>
   LA-CHRISTMAS-DINNER (Los Angeles) _ The Laugh Factory is serving
Christmas dinner to the down-and-out, as it has for 19 years. But
in L.A., a city where everybody is from somewhere else, it's not
just the elderly poor and homeless who come to the table. Here, you
find 20- and 30-something wanna-be stars who came to the city to
get famous, but today settle for getting fed. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN (Undated) _ The weekly religion column. By Peter
Steinfels.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-LAW-SCHOOLS (Washington) _ In ``A Civil Action,'' which
opened Christmas Day, John Travolta plays plaintiffs' lawyer Jan

to Jonathan Harr's best-seller, which has become required reading
in courses in at least 50 law schools. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   NJ-BUS-ACCIDENT (Sayreville, N.J.) _ Developments in Thursday's

<P>
   FLA-BURN (Orlando, Fla.) _ Faced with more long-range drought
conditions in Florida, state officials are seeking $35 million for
an aggressive controlled-burning program to prevent a repetition of
last summer's fires, which destroyed more than 500,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>

will leave in its trail is a revival of the cheap-cigar business.
By Jim Carrier. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-TRAVEL (Undated) _ Many Americans have discovered a new
way to keep family ties intact even during the hectic holidays:
huddled around Christmas trees in the lobbies of distant hotels, or
on cruise ships sailing the Caribbean. To be sure, the bright
lights and holiday decorations of New York and other big cities
have for decades attracted scads of vacationers at Christmas, and
many families have long celebrated the Christmas holidays on ski
trails or at the beach, especially families with lots of money and
time. Now, though, a broader number of Americans are going on
vacation at Christmas, not to be alone but to be able to spend time
with older children, parents or grandparents. By Edwin McDowell.
(1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-ON-TAPE (Undated) _ The growing popularity of audio books
has created cottage industries catering to one common trait: many
customers would rather rent than buy the long, expensive unabridged
recordings. In large part, that stems from a simple fact: The
number of times it is enjoyable to listen to a recorded book is
usually no more than one. By Michael Brick. (950 words)

</P>
<P>

Mahler. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   DICKENS-CAROL (Undated) _ Charles Dickens dashed off ``A
Christmas Carol'' in six weeks in the fall of 1843. He needed money
quickly because sales of his serialized ``Martin Chuzzlewit'' were
slack and the demands of his growing family (eventually 10) were
not. The Christmas story netted far less than he hoped, but it
remains his best known and best selling. By Richard E. Mooney.
(1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-MOVIE (Undated) _ He had done time in jail and been
through the Army and he was closing in on the middleweight boxing
crown when race riots convulsed the nation. He ran afoul of the
police and was railroaded into prison for life for a triple murder
he did not commit. Now, 13 years after he was freed through
dedicated sleuthing and lawyering, Rubin ``Hurricane' Carter is
reaping the ultimate vindication. They are making a movie about
him. By Ralph Blumenthal
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND-BARRY (Undated) _ Although novelists have written plays,
and playwrights have written novels, it is rare for a writer to be
equally adept at both arts, with one standout being Samuel Beckett.
But at 43, Beckett's countryman Sebastian Barry seems well on his
way to such an accomplishment. By Mel Gussow. (1650 words)

doubts, anger and fatalism over the question of cheating through
drug use that a widespread cynicism about sport's basic integrity
has taken hold. By Jere Longman. (3300 words)

 &HT;    Ga. Tech opens ECAC play against Hofstra
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Georgia Tech is hoping to flex its newly discovered
muscles over the next two days in the Kodak ECAC Holiday Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets, who open against Hofstra today, are still
celebrating a 66-64 upset over No. 7 North Carolina earlier in the
week, three days after a humiliating 80-39 loss to No. 3 Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Tech played a solid game against the Tar Heels, commiting only
eight turnovers and shooting 44.6 percent. The Jackets won without
scoring a basket in the final 7:57, but they had managed to build a
62-50 lead before the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra, which plays in the America East Conference, has a 5-4
record, but has been beaten soundly in games against two ranked
opponents, 89-59 to Maryland and 70-49 to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets play the Flying Dutchmen at 1 p.m. today and, if
they win, play Sunday at 2:30 p.m. against the winner of the
Iona-Pennsylvania game. With a home date against Mount St. Mary's
on Dec. 30, Tech hopes to enter its ACC schedule with an 11-2 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's success depends in large part on freshman point guard
Tony Akins. Akins played poorly against Kentucky but performed much
better in the North Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony played a very smart game against North Carolina,''
Cremins said. ``Against Kentucky, he tried to do too much himself;
against North Carolina he was a team player. If you're a scoring
point guard, the one thing you have to learn is to become a pure
point guard, and Tony is going to learn to do that. When he passes
a lot, he feels like he's not going to get his offense, but all of
a sudden the offense comes to him. He looked like a different
player against North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech also has the services of small forward Jon Babul, who had
missed four games and 19 practice sessions with a severe ankle
sprain. Babul gives Tech the tough defender it needs and is the
scrappy player who goes after loose balls and scores off of his
teammates' misses.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collier, the Jackets' 7-1 power forward, sprained his
right ankle in the North Carolina game, but he said he plans to be
in the starting lineup today.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the upset of North Carolina, Cremins knows his team
isn't where it needs to be, but he has seen improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win over North Carolina gives us something to build on,''
he said. ``We have a chance now and we've got to take it to the
next level. This team has got to approach every game as if it might
mean getting an NCAA invitation. We aren't good enough to take
anybody for granted, and we're not going to. We've got to go up to
New York and play in front of a lot of people in a big arena and
take care of business.''

 &HT;    HERITAGE BOWL ADVANCE
 &HT;    Jaguars, 'Cats depend on 1st-year QBs
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bethune-Cookman College players insist that head coach Alvin
Wyatt is part preacher, part philosopher, part father and whole
``motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe in him,'' Wildcats senior wide receiver
James Adderley said. ``He gets us ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that readiness should be evident today, when
Bethune-Cookman faces Southern University in the McDonald's
Heritage Bowl at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors as Adderley and starting linebackers James Souder and
Anton Wright have a chance to win their ninth game of the season,
after winning only nine in the previous three.
</P>
<P>
   Southern will have a lot to say about it, however. The Jaguars,
who have played more games in the Georgia Dome than anybody except
the Atlanta Falcons, including regular-season appearances in the
Atlanta Classic, are 3-1 in Heritage Bowl games. They seem
confident in this showdown, billed as the ``Black College Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place like home, and we feel like this is home,''
Southern senior defensive back Jackie Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt, in his second year as the Wildcats' head coach, scrapped
the pro-set passing offense and installed the triple option for the
'98 season. He will be banking on first-year quarterback Pa'Tel
Troutman to duplicate some of the exploits demonstrated during the
Wildcats' five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great athlete _ the player who makes us go,'' Wyatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman, at 5-feet-11, 175 pounds, has been clocked at 4.3
seconds in the 40-yard dash and was picked MEAC rookie of the year
after rushing for 1,054 yards and 15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart today _ Jaguars senior Sam George _ also is a
first-year starter.
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing two-year starter Marcus Jacoby, who quit the
team after the first game, George has averaged 193 yards passing a
game and hit on 51 percent of his 261 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern's primary ballcarrier, running back Steve Wofford,
a 5-10, 180-pound senior, said Heritage Bowl VIII might be
determined by someone other than a quarterback or running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come in here every year since I've been at Southern, and
we've made it happen in the Heritage Bowl twice,'' said Wofford,
who needs four rushing yards to reach 1,000. ``But in games like
this, with two evenly matched teams, special teams usually separate
the winner and loser. That's probably what it's going to come down
to (today).''

 &HT;    Dodge Viper lures plenty of bites
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 CoxNews Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Dodge Viper will go into the automotive
history books as a car that _ like the famed Carroll Shelby Cobra
sport cars to which it is related _ gave new meaning to the term
``snakebit.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost exactly 10 years after it was introduced as a
concept car at an auto show, the Viper is an outrageous,
street-legal creation that has sunk its fangs into considerable
worldwide respect as a true sports car. It's also credited with
helping a fading brand name re-emerge in the '90s by doubling its
sales in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Viper has accomplished this despite being a
kidney-beating, ear-assaulting ride that has generally poor
visibility, can win a speeding ticket in most locales before it's
out of the second of its six gears and has a base price of $65,000
(comparable to the Braselton-assembled Panoz roadster).
</P>
<P>
   But Dodge execs knew they were on to something when the Viper's
introduction was followed by a barrage of orders even though the
car wasn't in production. The situation is much the same today,
with DaimlerChrysler limiting production to about 2,000 vehicles,
which keeps supply well behind demand and imparts the cachet
associated with Ferraris, Aston-Martins, Lamborghinis and other
exotic marques.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference is that the Viper, compared with those
six-figure cars, is a performance bargain, even a steal. It's
nowhere near as comfortable as Chevrolet's $30,000-and-up Corvette,
formerly the only world-class American sports car, but the Viper's
zero to 60 mph time of about four seconds and test-track top speed
of about 180 mph more than offset its harsh qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The test GTS coupe, with amenities that include power leather
seats, air conditioning, CD player and power mirrors, locks and
windows, showed why the Viper is a favorite of entertainers such as
Jay Leno and singer Dwight Yoakam. It's a fun ride with incredible
dry-weather handling, ultra-precise steering, brakes that will stop
on a hint of pressure and all that pure old American big-engine
power (460 horsepower and 500 pounds-feet of torque).
</P>
<P>
   The race-ready test Viper American Club Racing (ACR) version,
stripped of air conditioning, stereo and about 60 of its original
3,500 pounds, was also demonstrative in a Walter Mitty fashion. Its
engine and suspension are tweaked, but it remains street-legal,
while brutal enough to remind that its siblings won the '97 GT2
drivers' and manufacturers' world championships and its class this
year at LeMans.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the Viper's buff-magazine endorsements include
Automobile's claim that it's ``hard to knock'' and normally
conservative Consumer Guide's conclusion that ``few automobiles of
any price match its bold nature.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also difficult to call the Viper anything other than the
current ultimate expression of American automotive muscle and the
inspiration for bad fangs-for-the-memories puns.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicles: 1998/'99 Dodge Viper GTS coupe and Viper American
Club Racer coupe
</P>
<P>
   Prices as tested: $70,700 for GTS, $77,200 for ACR
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags with switchable passenger's, dual
3-/5-point seat belts, heavy duty 13-inch power disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrains: 8.0-liter V-10 engines (460 horsepower), six-speed
manual overdrive transmissions
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicles: 17-inch aluminum wheels on GTS coupe,
$500
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 12 mpg premium unleaded city, 21 mpg highway

   RUSSIA-GOLD _ PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia _ Desperately low
on fuel to run its power plants and short of food to feed its
people, this region suffers grim hardships facing much of Russia
amid an economic crisis and a cruel winter season. What's a poor
Russian region far away from Moscow to do? There's gold in them
there hills. Embedded in the pristine, snow-capped mountains of the
Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East is a fortune in gold,
platinum, silver and other minerals. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-YEAR _ WASHINGTON _ For Bill Clinton, 1998 has been a
roller-coaster ride: from the mire of Monicagate, through months of
ignominous denial culminating in an impeachment vote, and on to
finish as the banner carrier for a party that has clearly seized
the initiative on the strength of his efforts. (Deans, Cox News

   EDs: MOVED Wednesday, Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K _ WASHINGTON _ Think of it as a $600-billion fire drill. For
the next year, governments, businesses and citizens worldwide will
scramble to fix arcane computer code linked to arrival of the new
century. The Y2K millennium bug threatens to halt everything from
airplane flights to Social Security checks. But many segments of
the U.S. economy are in good shape. And Fortune 500 companies are
on their way to fixing Y2K computer glitches. Still, analysts
expect disruptions: Regional brown-outs, disruptions to business
supply chains, problems distributing federal payment through state
and county governments. And the estimated $600 billion to $1
trillion spent to fix the problem could cause a drag on world and
domestic economies. (Regan, Cox News Service).

   Y2K-CONSUMERS _ WASHINGTON _ So what's a nervous Nellie to do?
The Y2K debacle has caused some Americans to play Chicken Little _
stockpiling food, brushing up on survival skills and getting ready
to hit never-used bomb shelters. But many analysts are urging
Americans to use common sense. Don't pull your money out the bank
and stick it under your mattress, but do have at least two weeks
cash on hand, fill up your gas tank, charge up the cellular phone
and have your heating oil tank filled. (Regan, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-CONSUMER-LIST _ A consumer checklist. (Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-LAWSUITS _ WASHINGTON _ If the technical problems aren't
hard enough, the folks who are trying to fix the gliche face the
potential of a flood of lawsuits. Lawyers are readying class-action
litigation against companies that could cost huge bucks. Some in
business see this as the next big reason to enact serious tort
reform. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   CAMPAIGN-MONEY _ WASHINGTON _ Any candidate who wants to win
either major-party presidential nomination in 2000 will have to
raise $22 million to $25 million in 1999, leading campaign finance
experts tell us. That's more than $60,000 a day, 7 days a week. And
that's just the so-called ``hard'' money. Enforcement of federal
limits has become so haphazard that another expert says he can't
even guess at how much unregulated ``soft'' money will be raised
and spent. An explainer of why candidates must raise so much so
early, what the money is spent for, and which candidates are
favored in what pundits call ``the invisible primary.'' (Mollison,
Cox News Service).

HISTORIAN TAKES ON MAINSTREAM WITH VIEW OF PAKISTAN'S FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., R.I., India) (mk) 
 By JONATHAN MAHLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Ayesha Jalal seems like an unlikely agitator.
She is a tiny, angular woman whose small frame is accentuated by
her flowing beige shalwar kameez, a traditional Pakistani outfit
consisting of a loose tunic and baggy trousers. Her scholarly
credentials _ Wellesley, Oxford, Harvard _ are purebred
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Ms. Jalal has taken on the academic and
political mainstream in her native Pakistan as well as the
administration of Columbia University, where she taught history for
seven years. And while her historical work on South Asia has
elicited anonymous threats, it also earned her a MacArthur
Fellowship (commonly called the genius grant) this year, worth
$265,000, no strings attached, and a reputation as one of the most
innovative scholars in the history of the region.
</P>
<P>
   What has angered so many Muslims here and in her homeland is Ms.
Jalal's assertion that the revered founding father of Pakistan, the
slender, eloquent Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had feet of clay. She argues
that the 1947 partition of India _ the event that opened the door
for the creation of Pakistan _ was an accident, a colossal
miscalculation. What's more, she says that Jinnah never wanted a
separate Muslim state; he was only using the threat of independence
as a political bargaining chip to strengthen the voice of the
Muslim minority in the soon-to-be sovereign India.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, she maintains, look no further than Jinnah's reaction
to the partition. ``The state-sponsored nationalist attitude seems
to suggest that what Jinnah had dismissed as a mutilated,
moth-eaten Pakistan is what they were actually fighting for,'' the
42-year-old scholar explained in a recent interview, adding that
Jinnah twice rejected what turned out to be the final model for
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   This is heresy to most Pakistanis, for whom the partition is a
point of pride, a landmark historical event comparable to the
declaration of the state of Israel for Zionists. And to many
Pakistanis, the individual most responsible for the partition is
nothing less than a Muslim paladin. ``It's as though you're telling
Americans that George Washington wasn't a starry-eyed nationalist
but a coldblooded, opportunistic militarist,'' remarked David
Ludden, an associate professor of South Asian history at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   India scholars around the world have found Ms. Jalal's work no
less provocative. ``In Pakistani terms, she takes a very pro-Indian
perspective, but in Indian terms, she's still a Pakistani,''
observed David Washbrook, a professor of modern South Asian history
at Oxford University in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   What may be most unusual about Ms. Jalal is that she studies
Pakistan at all. There are only a handful of scholars of Pakistan
in the United States; most South Asian specialists here focus on
the country's considerably larger neighbor, India. And to hear Ms.
Jalal tell it, the state of Pakistani history in Pakistan is no
better. The country didn't even have a free press until the late
1980s and four decades of military rule have left a legacy of media
self-censorship. The country's liberal arts colleges, for their
part, are controlled by the national government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jalal uses the word ``tragic''to describe the fate of
historical scholarship in her homeland. ``There just aren't many
Pakistanis who are historians,'' she said. ``They're not interested
in history, they're interested in projecting an ideological
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Her three books, starting with ``The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the
Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan'' in 1985, have been
credited by scholars of South Asia with breaking new ground. ``She
is the foremost historian of modern Pakistan,'' Washbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her view of Jinnah and the partition is hardly
conventional. In his biography of Jinnah, Stanley Wolpert, a
professor of South Asian history at the University of California at
Los Angeles, painted a different picture of the partition,
ascribing Jinnah's zealous quest for Pakistani independence partly
to a religious metamorphosis toward the end of his life. Wolpert's
perspective conforms much more closely to that of the traditional
Pakistani narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when ``The Sole Spokesman'' was published, several
Pakistani newspapers assailed Ms. Jalal for understating the role
of religion in Jinnah's push for partition and accused her of being
under the sway of an Indian academic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jalal is teaching at Harvard University this year after a
bitter fight with Columbia. At Columbia, she says, enrollment in
her South Asian history courses doubled from 1991 to 1995, but she
was denied tenure in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that a cadre of Indian and India-centric faculty
members who objected to a Pakistani woman teaching Indian history
had put the kibosh on her tenure application, she sued the
university the next year, alleging religious and ethnic
discrimination. Columbia refuted her contentions, and this spring,
a federal judge in New York's Southern District dismissed the case,
labeling the evidence of bias ``thin,'' though ``suggestive.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was pursuing her claim against Columbia, Ms. Jalal was
selected for a new chair in modern South Asian history at Brown
University. But after winning the approval of the history
department and a tenure review committee, she said she was rejected
by Brown's administration.
</P>
<P>
   So come June, Ms. Jalal may find herself unemployed. She plans
to stay in the United States, where she first arrived in 1970, when
her father, a lifelong civil servant, was posted to the United
Nations in Manhattan. When the family returned to Pakistan two
years later, Ms. Jalal, then 16, finished her studies at the
American high school in Islamabad, the capital city. She spent much
of her senior year in Pakistan trying to persuade her mother to
allow her to return to the United States for college.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, it was very unusual for Pakistani women to come
to America to study,'' she said. ``The vast majority of women in
Pakistan don't take to reading.'' But when Wellesley College
offered her a full scholarship, she finally persuaded her mother to
let her go.
</P>
<P>
   From Wellesley, she went on to pursue a Ph.D. in South Asian
history at Cambridge University, where she wrote the dissertation
that would provide the foundation for ``The Sole Spokesman.'' That
the individual who had set out to puncture the iconic grandeur of
Jinnah was a woman played no small role in the book's chilly
reception in Pakistan. ``There is still a great deal of resentment
there about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jalal credits her father with inspiring her to rethink the
partition. As a child, she would listen raptly as he reminisced
about Muslim friends who had been left behind in India, which is
home to some 120 million Muslims, roughly as many as in Pakistan.
If the division of British India and the resulting creation of the
Muslim state of Pakistan were really events for Pakistanis to
celebrate, he wondered, why were so many Muslims, including many of
his dearest friends, still stuck in the predominantly Hindu India?
</P>
<P>
   Jinnah's ``Pakistan had to remain part of a larger all-India
whole in order to raise some safeguards for Muslims in the minority
areas or those who would invariably be left in India,'' said Ms.
Jalal, who studied the Koran in Arabic as a child and characterizes
herself as a secular Muslim with a religiously informed identity.
</P>
<P>
   Jinnah died of tuberculosis and lung cancer only a few days
after the first anniversary of independence, leaving a leadership
vacuum in Pakistan that is often blamed for many of the country's
subsequent political and financial woes. To Ms. Jalal, though, most
of those problems can be traced right back to 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to India, she argues, has put Pakistan in the
untenable position of trying to square its considerable security
costs with its limited economic resources, an imbalance that has in
turn taken a toll on the democratic process in Pakistan. Years ago,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, father of the country's former prime minister,
Benazir Bhutto, predicted that if India got the bomb, Pakistan
would too, ``even if we have to eat grass.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, he wasn't far off. With the sanctions slapped
on Pakistan after the recent nuclear blasts, the flow of
international capital into the country has slowed markedly. The
country now stands on the brink of bankruptcy, unable to pay the
reservicing costs on some $26 billion in external debt incurred
largely for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has paid a hefty price to fend off India,'' Ms.
Jalal said, ``and the price has been Pakistan's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 1995 book, ``Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia,''
also irked partisans of India and Bangladesh, the Muslim nation
that splintered off from Pakistan in a bloody civil war in 1971. In
the book, she argued that military nationalism has undermined
democracy not just in the two Muslim states but in India, which is
generally considered the world's most populous democracy. And
indeed, many Indians are now concerned that the Hindu nationalist
government, run by the Bharatiya Janata party, represents a threat
to traditional democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, scholars of India have criticized Ms. Jalal for
underestimating the country's representative government. ``The
comparison makes me uncomfortable,'' said Francine Frankel,
director of the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``I do feel that India has accomplished
what Pakistan could not accomplish through an authoritarian system:
It has brought politics to the majority of impoverished humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jalal remains unmoved: ``Either you're giving a Pakistani
line or you're giving an Indian line, which I think is very
problematic in an academic environment.''

IRAQI CHRISTIANS PRAY FOR PEACE ON CHRISTMAS DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Probably no priest or pastor outside Iraq opened
a Christmas sermon on Friday the way the Rev. Gabriel Marie did at
the Church of Our Lady of Assumption here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks be to God that we have survived the bombing,'' Marie
told Catholic parishioners who filled his church to overflowing for
two Masses on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to lament modern technology that allows warriors ``to
push a button on a computer and kill people,'' and said it was the
duty of all Christians ``to build a new world full of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqi Christians gathered for Christmas services Friday, the
sounds of the U.S. and British bombing raids last week were still
echoing in their heads. Their spiritual leaders used the occasion
to remind them that, as Marie said, ``no bomb is powerful enough to
kill the spirit of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners at Our Lady of Assumption joined loudly in singing
hymns, and listened attentively to Bible readings that told the
age-old story of the Nativity. As they were filing out into the
midday sunshine, the choir of about 35 young people, evidently
unable to restrain their exuberance, broke spontaneously into an
Arabic-language version of ``Jingle Bells.'' When it was finished,
members of the choir hugged and kissed one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Christmas, I am very happy,'' said Anman George,
19, who was among the most enthusiastic singers. ``We believe in
Jesus, and that his spirit will prevail to resolve these
difficulties. His teachings are the way to peace in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians who attended Catholic and Protestant services in
Baghdad on Friday said in interviews that they live and worship
freely here. The Chaldean Catholic community, by far the largest
Christian denomination in Iraq, has roots in the earliest days of
Christianity and is widely accepted as part of this country's
spiritual heritage. Perhaps its most prominent member is Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Muslims with backward minds don't like Christians,'' said
Wasan Wadia, 28, who attended a Catholic Mass with her family on
Friday. ``But most of them, especially the more educated, are
friendly to us or even envy us, because our tradition is very
open-minded. They like talking and mixing with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 20 years ago, Christians constituted nearly 10
percent of the Iraqi population. Many worked for foreign companies,
however, and began emigrating in the 1980s as the companies shut
down after the outbreak of war with Iran. Today they make up about
6 percent of the country's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's Christian academies, run by Jesuits and Presbyterians
from the United States, were shut down when the government expelled
most foreign missionaries in the late 1960s. Many young Christians
now attend selected public schools where the history of
Christianity is taught alongside that of Islam. Their community is
known as highly educated and relatively prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Christian denominations here have issued statements
condemning last week's bombing and the economic sanctions that the
United Nations imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait eight
years ago. The bombing and sanctions are intended to force changes
in the Iraqi government and curb what the United States describes
as Iraq's threat to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the friendly ties between the government and
Christian denominations here, Minister of Religious Affairs
Abdul-Munim Ahmad Salih visited several churches on Friday. At the
Baghdad National Presbyterian Church, founded by American
missionaries in the 19th century, he told the parish council that
Christians ``are not a minority, but an integral part of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian pastor, the Rev. Ikram Ibrahim, referred
obliquely to the country's troubles in his sermon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus, we are praying to you,'' he said. ``You are the prince
of peace, and you are the one who can lift the sanctions from our
country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later the chairman of the parish council, Georges Hormis Sada,
said Iraqi Christians share the widespread anger and puzzlement
here over the West's hostility to their country. Sada is a retired
military officer who fondly recalls his two years of pilot training
at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas during the 1960s, when
Iraqi-American relations were still friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say anything about politics, but when we see
aggression against children, women and old people, we think this
should not be,'' he said. ``We don't think Jesus would like it. We
feel sad that Christian countries are doing this to us. Christians
should be able to solve these problems in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sada said the council had decided to cancel traditional church
parties celebrating Christmas and New Year. There will be prayer
services instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be very happy when people are being killed, when
people are depressed and suffering,'' he said. ``How can you have
parties and sing and dance? We feel we should share the sadness of
our people, and only worship.''

BRINGING AUTHENTICITY, OR THE ILLUSION OF IT, TO THE BIG SCREEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In an age when advanced technology and generous
budgets are giving filmmakers the ability to create images and
scenes they once could only dream of, they are also creating a
growing burden: the pressure for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, even the most fanciful, need not be real, but they
generally must be believable. So whether they are delving into
outer space, history or pure legend, Hollywood's fiction spinners
are increasingly turning not just to marketing wizards but to
scholars and other experts as well to help sell their ideas. Movies
ranging from holiday releases like ``The Prince of Egypt'' and
``Shakespeare in Love'' to blockbusters like ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``Deep Impact'' have relied on experts to help create
the sense of verisimilitude that filmmakers regard as an essential
ingredient of success.
</P>
<P>
   For the hired brains? Tinseltown can make a dream or break it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own little director's chair with my name on it,''
said Gerry Griffin, a retired flight director at NASA who worked on
``Contact,'' in which an astronomer played by Jodie Foster enters
an alien-designed vessel that travels to another galaxy. He said he
had worked almost every day with the director, Robert Zemeckis, to
get dozens of details right. ``We were almost literally attached at
the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   David N. Freedman, a biblical scholar at the University of
California at San Diego, has a more skeptical view. A leading
expert on the Book of Exodus, Freedman was one of scores of
biblical experts consulted for the animated ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me are the window dressing,'' he said. ``They
invite us to come in to look and they don't really listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no trouble lending them my name and I recommend the
movie,'' he added. ``I found the characters generally well done.
The crossing of the Red Sea was sensational. But I'm a movie
addict. I could hardly name you three movies I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, which produced the movie, has said it listened
carefully to the experts it consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars are not entertainers, and filmmakers make no pretense
at being scholars, which is why there can be friction in the
relationship between Hollywood and academia. The crucial need,
several filmmakers explained, is the appearance of reality. That
means that they rely on advisers mainly to provide signposts or
shortcuts, not truths to which they must remain wholly faithful.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Apollo 13,'' his movie about a real crisis in space, the
director Ron Howard consulted former astronauts and other experts,
including Griffin. They provided, he said, an overwhelming amount
of detail about the way NASA worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while I had to say, `I just can't show
that,''' Howard said. ``With the director, the buck stops. I had to
make the decisions. I cut myself some slack fairly early on and put
my focus on the audience's reaction to things, not just getting
every detail right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Griffin said he influenced numerous details,
particularly the terse dialogue between flight control and the
astronauts. He also said he quieted down the activity in the
flight-control center in the movie. ``One of the things about a
control room is it's a little like watching grass grow,'' Griffin
said. ``He had his looking like a fire drill or something with so
much motion. I just tried to get him to tone it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he felt the effort paid off in several respects.
``Audiences really liked the lingo and enjoyed catching on to the
lingo,'' said the director, who added that the actors also felt
they could perform better when they were going through genuine
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors became so engrossed in getting it right that they
would go through the whole procedure sometimes even if we were only
filming a small portion,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a flight of fancy that supposes that
the playwright transformed ``Romeo and Juliet'' from a mediocre
play to one of genius under the influence of a love affair, a
Harvard professor is said to have played a tiny, but critical part.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Norman, one of the screenwriters, said he consulted Stephen
Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar, to make sure that at least the
framework of his story followed what was known about Shakespeare's
life. ``I needed some sort of firm ground, some confidence,''
Norman said. ``The great thing about writing about Shakespeare is
that everyone in the world knows him and there are about five
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman added that he was after an appearance of reality
only: ``I would say the semblance of authenticity was more
important than authenticity. I would like to think there is a
creative truth in the picture that we adhere to, not historical
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation between life and fiction can be tantalizing. The
horror picture ``Urban Legends,'' for instance, is about a murderer
who kills by fulfilling everyday fables passed by word of mouth.
These include everything from tales of women getting drugged in
bars and then waking up in strange apartments with their kidneys
stolen to one that eating a certain fizzy candy while drinking soda
can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the whole background to the story is, `Is it true or
not?,' it was really important that the movie be as true to the
folklore as we could be,'' said Gina Matthews, the producer of
``Urban Legends.'' ``That's what gave the movie credibility and
ultimately made it so frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the movie had to seem real or it would just have
been a farce,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So the filmmakers consulted Peter Takofsky, a professor of
folklore at the University of California at Los Angeles, to make
sure that they got their legends right rather than ask if the
legends were rooted in any truths.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of authenticity also can become a weapon in
competition between films. This year there were two movies about a
collision between Earth and a celestial object. ``Deep Impact''
involves an approaching comet and ``Armageddon'' has an asteroid
careering calamitously toward Earth. In both movies manned
spacecraft intercept these huge masses and blow them apart with
nuclear bombs, a trick that several experts said was probably
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started from hard facts,'' said Joan Bradshaw, one of the
executive producers of ``Deep Impact.'' ``We wanted to make science
fact as opposed to science fiction.'' Josh Colwell, an astronomer
at the University of Colorado, said he told the ``Deep Impact''
team that it would take far longer than depicted in the movie's
time frame to determine if a comet was on a collision course with
Earth _ particularly because the paths of comets are difficult to
predict. He also said that any effort to intercept a comet would
rely on unmanned rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Colwell added that the size of the tidal wave caused by the
impact of the comet with Earth, as conceived by the filmmakers, was
too big and that he urged them to make it smaller, which they did.
Still, he said, if a comet was broken up so close to Earth, its
impact over all would be far more catastrophic than the one
depicted in the movie because of the velocity and energy involved.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it is only a movie.

`HURRICANE' CARTER GETS THE ULTIMATE VINDICATION: A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had done time in jail and been through the Army and he was
closing in on the middleweight boxing crown when race riots
convulsed the nation. He ran afoul of police and was railroaded
into prison for life for a triple murder he did not commit. (And
that's only the back story.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, 13 years after he was freed through dedicated sleuthing and
lawyering, Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter is reaping the ultimate
vindication. They are making a movie about him.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million feature, filmed on location in his former haunts
in Paterson, N.J., and Rahway State Prison and in Toronto where
Carter, 61, now works to free others as wrongly convicted, is being
directed by Norman Jewison and stars Denzel Washington as the
ferocious fighter who became a testament to corrupted justice and
unquenchable faith. The cast so far also includes Dan Hedaya,
Deborah Unger and David Paymer.
</P>
<P>
   With no shortage of action to film, the movie has an unusual
focus: the relationship of the imprisoned fighter and a 16-year-old
youth from the Brooklyn slums who, 14 years into Carter's
captivity, came across a book the fighter had written in prison and
ended up mobilizing a group of Canadian social activists on
Carter's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   How fully and accurately the film will portray the gritty life
of Carter and the broader-based struggle to free him from the grip
of a Javert-like police lieutenant will not be known, of course,
until its release by Universal late next year or early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the miracle of this piece, and the excitement and
connective tissue, is Rubin and this young man,'' Jewison said
during a break in the filming recently in Paterson. Himself a
Canadian who directed such powerful race-themed films as ``A
Soldier's Story,'' also with Denzel Washington, and ``In the Heat
of the Night,'' Jewison said he had been captivated by Carter's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Armyan Bernstein, the film's co-producer, whose credits include
``The Commitments'' and ``A Thousand Acres,'' said he too had been
instantly gripped by ``the second half of the story,'' and about
five years ago paid another producer more than $1 million for the
film rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Langlais, an executive producer, said the film would not
gloss over Carter's violent life.
</P>
<P>
   To see the fighter now, still limber, solidly built and
laugh-ready, is to glimpse little of the tormented yet defiant
figure who spent 19 unnecessary years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting recently in the Manhattan office of his chief
constitutional lawyer, Leon Friedman, Carter said he was ``honored
and proud'' to be the subject of a movie. ``Yes, I was bitter when
I was kidnapped from my family,'' he said. ``Yes, when my career
was torn apart. But bitterness only consumes the vessel that
protects it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his jokes have a sardonic edge and one eye is glass, the
legacy of botched prison care. ``I have one eye that sees out and
the other that sees in, and you can't imagine what's in there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's turbulent life would seem to afford material for many
movies. ``The kindest thing that I can say about my childhood is
that I survived it,'' he wrote in his 1974 prison autobiography,
``The 16th Round: From Number 1 Contender to Number 45472.'' At age
11, after nearly stabbing to death a white man who he said had
tried to sodomize him, he was sent to a state home for boys.
Halfway through his 10-year sentence, he escaped and joined an Army
paratroop unit, where he put his fearsome street-fighting skills to
work as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Barely out of the service, he landed in prison again for purse
snatching. But by early 1964, having turned pro with only three
losses in 23 bouts, he had become the leading middleweight
challenger, renowned for the fury of his assaults that earned him
the nickname Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   With racial tensions at a boil around the country, off-the-cuff
remarks to a reporter that turned up later in The Saturday Evening
Post cast him as violently anti-police.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of June 17, 1966, two black gunmen invaded a
Paterson night spot, killing the bartender and a patron and fatally
wounding a second patron. Carter, out driving with friends, was
stopped for questioning but released when witnesses did not connect
him to the shootings. He voluntarily took and passed a lie-detector
test.
</P>
<P>
   Yet four months later, exploiting the accounts of two career
thieves who said they were witnesses, a relentless police
lieutenant charged Carter and a driving companion, John Artis, with
the slayings. Despite many discrepancies in the six-week trial,
both were quickly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, in 1974, the two crucial witnesses recanted,
telling a reporter for The New York Times, Selwyn Rabb, that police
had pressured them to frame Carter and Artis. Justice for the two
became a cause celebre, mobilized by a Bob Dylan anthem,
``Hurricane.'' A new trial in Paterson was ordered, but the two
witnesses changed their stories again, and Carter and Artis were
re-convicted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, as Carter continued to maintain his innocence, shunning
prison food and garb, a group of Canadians doing anti-pollution
research at a laboratory in Brooklyn met 15-year-old Lesra Martin
in a summer job program. The Canadians persuaded Lesra's family in
Bushwick to let them take him to Toronto for schooling. His real
name was Lazarus, but pronounced with a Southern inflection that
became Lesra, and Lesra he remained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at a library book sale, Lesra discovered a copy of
``The 16th Round'' and, identifying with the fighter, wrote Carter
in prison and became his first visitor in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found my bottle floating in the ocean of life and got the
message,'' Carter said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, too, rallied to Carter's cause, as two of them,
Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, later recounted in a 1991 book,
``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' which became a basis (and the
working title) for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with new exculpatory evidence tracked down by the
lawyers Friedman and Myron Beldock and the Canadians, the lawyers
decided, riskily, not to try to present the new evidence to New
Jersey courts, but rather to re-argue the old record to a federal
judge for a writ of habeas corpus to compel New Jersey authorities
to explain why they were holding Carter.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, 1985, U.S. Judge H. Lee Sarokin in Newark ruled that
the case had indeed been fatally tainted by corrupted evidence and
appeals to racial prejudice and ordered Carter released. (Artis had
already served his sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even say sorry,'' Carter said. ``But they didn't
make a mistake. They knew what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter subsequently resettled in Toronto and married one of the
women in the Canadian group, Lisa Peters, his earlier marriage
having dissolved while he was in prison. He also became executive
director of a Toronto group called the Association in Defense of
the Wrongly Convicted.
</P>
<P>
   For the filming in Paterson in November, the clock was turned
back to the '60s and some chronology was rearranged. A scene in the
film takes place in the cocktail lounge where Carter actually
hobnobbed the night of the murders. A black and white television
set flickers over the bar, the announcer's voice cutting through
the smoky fog: ``When police moved in to quell the unrest, a riot
broke out in Harlem and is now spreading to other cities in the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bar, a black-clad Carter (Washington) with a
smooth-shaven skull and a circle of whiskers around his mouth and
chin, glowers at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they expect?'' he mutters. ``Of course a riot broke
out. Every time a black man tries to protect his own neighborhood,
they come in and bust our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   A white reporter goads him on: ``If you feel so strongly about
all this, Hurricane, then why aren't you out there instead of
sitting in here drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter regards him with contempt and says: ``Maybe you're right;
maybe I should go grab my gun and get me some of them nigger-hating
cops. I know I could probably get four or five, six, of 'em before
they get me. What do you think? You want to join us?''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter blanches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's a no, huh?'' Carter gibes. ``That's off the
record, man. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter is quick to agree, but his face hides a smirk.
``Sure, champ, sure,'' he promises.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bar, Jewison, in a black turtleneck and black
baseball cap, looks up exultantly from a video screen. ``Print
it!'' he orders.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Humidors in fancy oiled-wood bars may be packed
this winter with $10 and $25 hand-rolled cigars from the Caribbean,
but to appreciate the degree of America's new passion for cigars,
one must stand beside Tho Henricksen, a Vietnamese immigrant, who
is feeding shredded tobacco, vegetable paste, rolls of brown tape
and birchwood tips into eight machines at Havatampa Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Clanking, hissing, crimping and slicing, her bevy of faded green
machines, joined by dozens of others on the factory floor, are
turning out 1.75 million cigars a day. Described on their Havatampa
and Phillies packs as ``predominately tobacco,'' they are sold
five-for-a-dollar at stores like 7-Eleven and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of those cigars, and of brands like Swisher Sweets, White
Owl and Dutch Masters, have long dominated the market and have
surged in the last five years on the coattails of the cigar craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a trickle-down effect from the premiums,'' said Tom
Arthur, chief executive of Havatampa. ``We made lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the boom has already peaked, people in the industry say,
with a glut at the upper end of the market. Retail sales of cigars
in the United States rose to $1.4 billion in 1997 from $192 million
in 1992, but growth is expected to be flat this year, according to
Cigar Insider, an industry newsletter. Even Marvin Shanken,
publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine, who helped to stoke the
craze, acknowledges that the days of 70 percent growth are over.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the boom reversed a 30-year decline in the business, and
the current shake-out has left the survivors richer and wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the market is four times bigger than
four years ago,'' said Tom Ryan, executive vice president of
Swisher International Group Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., the
second-biggest cigar maker. ``There is the opportunity to make very
impressive profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans will buy 4 billion machine-made cigars this year _ 10
times as many as hand-rolled premiums _ a 33 percent increase in
five years, according to the Cigar Association of America, an
industry group. In terms of dollars, however, the pricier
hand-rolled imports now account for roughly half the revenue
growth. Premium imports quadrupled to 400 million in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a demographical divide in the cigar market. The
hand-rolled imports have been a fad among a young, professional
urban set, fostered in part by Shanken's magazine and its covers of
Demi Moore, Claudia Schiffer and other celebrities and by his ``Big
Smoke'' parties that draw thousands who pay $150 to sample premium
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers of the machine-made cigars appear to be much older and
less affluent. Havatampa, for example, says its mail indicates that
many of its customers are fixed-income retirees.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Havatampa's machines are running full-tilt with holiday
back orders. Havatampa, a subsidiary of Tabacalera SA of Spain, is
the only cigar company with no premium cigars, and is the No. 4
cigar maker.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tampa plant, 800 workers _ who earn $6 to 9 an hour _
take less-than-premium tobacco, clean feathers and other debris
from it, shred it, add saccharine, beer, rum and vanilla _
depending on the brand _ and dump it from dented waste baskets into
the gullet of machines that wrap it in a paper-and-tobacco
homogenized wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business was not as robust during the boom as the
premiums,'' Arthur, the company's chief executive, said. ``But the
silver lining is so many people got in with so many brands there is
now a big shake-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Tampa's cigar-making district of Ybor City, the boom and
slowdown is just a chapter in a long history.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing from Spanish-controlled Cuba in 1886, Vincent-Martinez
Ybor set up factories that imported Cuban tobacco until Fidel
Castro came to power. There used to be 10,000 immigrants rolling
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-rolling moved overseas after men like Armando Garcia, now
73, installed machines that turned out 4,500 cigars a day,
displacing 15 rollers. Those same machines are still wrapping cigar
parts at Havatampa, where Garcia's son and daughter-in-law keep
them running.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar sales spiked at an all-time high of 9 billion cigars in
1963 before the surgeon general warned about the health dangers of
smoking cigarettes. But for the next 30 years the industry counted
on an annual 4 to 6 percent decline in sales, Ryan of Swisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Ybor City's hand-rolled brands moved overseas in the
1980s, as imports settled at around 100 million cigars and
machine-made cigars at 3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Arthur, an investment banker, bought the once-proud
name of Havatampa and housed its old machines in a modern business
park in East Tampa and a former cotton mill in Selma, Ala. He later
bought the Phillies brand, distributed in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur said he was the only cigar company with growth before the
boom. Indeed, executives at other cigar companies acknowledge that
they were caught flat-footed in the early 1990s by the new tastes
of affluent martini-drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us saw it coming,'' said Theo Folz, chairman and chief
executive of Consolidated Cigar Holdings Inc., the largest company
with $299 million in sales last year. (On Dec. 16, Seita SA,
France's largest tobacco company and the maker of Gauloises and
Gitanes, agreed to acquire Consolidated for $531 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to fill the market, Consolidated, General Cigar
Holdings Inc. and Swisher bought up imported brands, planted
tobacco and opened overseas rolling factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove the industry was shortages,'' said Eric Newman,
president of J.C. Newman Cigar Co., a 105-year-old family operation
that produces the machine-made Rigoletto brand here and imports 16
million hand-made Cuesta-Rey and Arturo Fuente brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was hoarding,'' Newman said. ``Prices doubled every six
months. Then we overshipped.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic and Honduras, where Newman's offshore
partner, Carlos Fuente, produced the cigars, 100 cigar rolling
operations opened in 1997. Needing little capital, the competitors
bought tobacco at any price, set up shop in sheds and lured trained
rollers with signing bonuses of $1,500 _ a half-year's pay _ and
gifts of mopeds and houses, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Miami's Little Havana, small hand-rolling shops, called
chinchales, sprang into existence, producing brands with exotic
names _ what established manufacturers call Don Nobodies _ that
were sold through telephone mail orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 20 people you can make 20,000 cigars a month,'' said Don
Barco, a cigar retailer who set up his own chinchal with 30 people
in Ybor City. ``There were people who got in the business and made
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own shop he saw the number of cigar brands increase to
1,200 from 250. ``It was confusing,'' he recalled. ``A customer
would come in and ask for brands I'd never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the boom, General, Swisher and Consolidated
sold stock to the public and forecast 30 percent growth. But their
production was so high that this year they imported 500 million
cigars _ 100 million too many _ according to Folz of Consolidated
and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chinchales closed, brands disappeared and millions of cigars
were dumped for cents on the dollar. It may take two years for the
premium glut to disappear, said Jack Maxwell, a leading tobacco
analyst, who calls cigars a fad that will grow at a rate of 2 to 3
percent in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much greed,'' said Bob Saitta of El Sol Cigars,
whose modest shop on Ybor City's main drag sells a family brand
made by 15 rollers in Central America. ``It was a disservice to
loyal customers. Ten years ago it was a nice little backwater. The
whole world changed. The whole thing was very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind a large glass window at his shop, Saitta has leased a
space to recent Cuban refugees Cira Rodriguez and Felix Huelga Jr.
who roll 400 fat cigars a day and sell them for $4. The tourists
who come to the historic district like to watch their hand-rolling,
said Saitta.
</P>
<P>
   Huelga, a former Cuban army sharpshooter who was imprisoned and
then deported for resisting Fidel Castro, stands in front of an
enlarged photo of cigar rollers from another era and says history
is repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I make for me,'' he said. ``In three years I will
have five people.'' He waves a cigar at the photo. ``They are my
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is likely to stay the same in the volatile world of
cigars. Cuba may eventually open, touching off battles over
trademarks and tobacco supplies. And the boom has aroused
government regulators and antismoking advocates who had pretty much
left cigars alone. A National Institute of Health study this year
found that cigar smoke is just as toxic as cigarette smoke, said
Dr. John Slade, the study's editor.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that children can afford and more easily obtain
machine-made brands.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Connolly of the Massachusetts tobacco-control office,
another author of the NIH report, predicted that Massachusetts and
other states would begin requiring cigar testing for tar and
nicotine levels. Ultimately the issue will be forced into Congress
where anti-tobacco advocates hope to trade a uniform warning label
for restrictions on advertising and marketing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials maintain that other than to experiment,
children do not smoke cigars. In reports to the Federal Trade
Commission, the five top cigar companies reported $40 million in
advertising and promotion in 1997, said Norman Sharp, president of
the Cigar Association of America. The industry also has created a
program with retailers to stop underage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the health concerns and a poor performance on Wall
Street, executives emphasize that their business is stronger than
it has been for decades, with thousands of new cigar-friendly bars
and restaurants and a different attitude toward cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in general and women in particular are more tolerant of
cigars and cigar smoking than ever before,'' Shanken, the cigar
magazine publisher, said. Women ``are allowing husband and
boyfriends to smoke in their presence,'' he noted. ``That has had a
big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Arthur of Havatampa, ``Overall, people feel better
about smoking cigars. There's less social stigma.''

ST. STEPHEN, ANOTHER KIND OF MARTYR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.
</P>
<P>
   Feast of Stephen?
</P>
<P>
   Those lines from a Christmas carol exhaust what most of us know
about the feast of St. Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   In the church calendar followed by Roman Catholics, Anglicans
and some other branches of Western Christianity, the feast falls
Saturday, the day after Christmas. In the Eastern Orthodox
churches, St. Stephen's day is Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   About Stephen himself, it is easy to know a lot more. His story
is told in great detail in chapters 6 and 7 of the New Testament's
Book of Acts. He is considered the first Christian martyr, a
follower of Jesus who, like his departed master, was accused of
blasphemy and stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   But why celebrate his memory now, in conjunction with the story
of the baby born in Bethlehem?
</P>
<P>
   Going by the account in Acts, it would be logical to place his
feast sometime after Pentecost, when the Jewish followers of Jesus
first began to preach and organize the embryonic movement that
would break with the Judaism of their day and form a distinct body
of Christian believers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the story of Stephen is filled with lessons about the
divisions that afflicted that body from the very first. No sooner
had the number of believers in Jesus begun to grow than, Acts
reports, ``the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hellenists were Jewish converts to the Jesus movement who
spoke Greek and were attached to the wider Hellenistic culture. The
Hebrews were the Aramaic-speaking majority.
</P>
<P>
   The division was possibly theological as well as cultural,
reflecting a division among Jews at that time between those
insisting on the Temple as the sole place of Jewish sacrifice and
those challenging the Temple's centrality. The division also was
practical and financial: the Hellenist Christians did not think
that their needy were getting a fair share of the new community's
common goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ejecting the complaining Hellenist minority, they
chose ``seven men of good standing, full of the Spirit and of
wisdom'' _ Stephen most prominent among them _ to assure that the
needs of the Hellenist minority were met. In other words, the first
Christians recognized that preserving a united community required
admitting pluralism. Cultural differences and even theological
differences about Temple worship could be subordinated to a more
basic belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Stephen's story illustrates another division that
had a far less happy ending, the split between the incipient Jesus
movement and the Jewish milieu from which it emerged.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Stephen's aggressive preaching inflamed Jewish
ire, and the tolerance toward the new sect previously urged by the
Pharisee Gamiliel gave way to active persecution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Stephen's demise contributed to Christian
anti-Judaism. Tragically, his dying prayer of forgiveness for those
who stoned him, as recorded in Acts, had less resonance in
Christian tradition than the earlier passages in which he echoes
biblical rebukes of a ``stiff-necked people'' that had persecuted
its own prophets, rebukes Stephen applied to the death of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this explains why Stephen's feast occurs Dec. 26.
Some people might latch onto the fact that in the Middle Ages,
according to ``The Oxford Dictionary of Saints,'' St. Stephen ``was
invoked against headaches.'' That explanation turns out to be
circular. Was the healer of hangovers appropriately commemorated in
the wake of Christmas revelry? Or did the saint then commemorated
become the help of the hung over?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Legend,'' a medieval compilation of lore about
Christian saints and feasts, had a lot to say not only about St.
Stephen's martyrdom and miracles but also about the recovery of his
body. Early in the 5th century, a priest near Jerusalem claimed to
have been directed by a vision to Stephen's tomb and the remains
found there were ceremoniously transported to the city
</P>
<P>
   With remarkable precision, the compiler of ``The Golden
Legend,'' Jacobus de Voragine, a 13th-century Dominican friar who
became archbishop of Genoa, recorded that St. Stephen was martyred
on the morning of Aug. 3 in the year of Jesus' death and that the
saint's remains were recovered (almost four centuries later) on the
very same day.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed Jacobus, as he has been known since being beatified in
1816 by Pope Pius VII, offers several reasons why the church set
the saint's feast in Christmas week rather than Aug. 3, William
Granger Ryan noted in his translation of ``The Golden Legend''
(Princeton University Press, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   None of them is truly convincing but one is at least memorable.
It links St. Stephen's day with the two feast days that follow it,
first of St. John the Evangelist and then of the Holy Innocents
slain by King Herod.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Jacobus says, is to be found in a line of the Song of
Songs, ``My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.''
In one of those imaginative interpretations of sacred texts that
only medievals and French post-structuralists can fathom, Jacobus
explains that ``white'' refers to John the Evangelist, whom
tradition considered not only Jesus' beloved apostle but the only
apostle not to die a martyr, while ``ruddy'' refers to the martyred
Stephen and ``thousands'' refers to the multitude of Holy
Innocents!
</P>
<P>
   By grouping these three feasts together and associating them
with Christ's birth, he continues, the church is marking three
kinds of martyrdom: those like Stephen who choose to die for a
cause and so meet their death; those like John who choose to die
for a cause but never actually do so; and those like the Holy
Innocents who die for a cause without a choice.
</P>
<P>
   That grouping really does provoke reflection. Not only about
religious martyrdom, very much a reality in today's world, but
about bravery and sacrifice of all sorts: men and women who risk
their lives for others and pay the ultimate price, men and women
who risk their lives but fortunately survive, men, women and
children whose lives are risked and lost in the course of worthy
struggles but without their own consent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should all come to mind as the world looks out on
this strangely dated feast of Stephen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOLO, Indonesia _ It was a day of healing and cautious hope in
this ancient Javanese town, a town that ``almost died,'' in the
words of one resident, when it suffered the worst damage anywhere
in the riots that swept Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
   On this day of hope, a recent Saturday, hundreds of people
flocked to the grand opening of a modest two-story Matahari
department store, the first to reopen since all three of the city's
Matahari stores were burned down seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Noisy columns of motorbikes buzzed back and forth through the
streets in a new weekly ritual, the riders cheering and waving the
banners of a welter of political parties in what amounts to the
unofficial start of a campaign for national elections next June.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimism of that sunny Saturday was short-lived. Half a
year after the riots and the resignation of President Suharto,
Indonesia is a nation heading down two diverging paths: toward
stability and a democratic future, and toward chaos, violence and
social disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   With the unexpected resignation of Suharto in May, during a
tumult of riots, demonstrations, political defections and military
feuds, Indonesia was suddenly released, rudderless, from the grip
of the strongman who had ruled for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a hated political structure that no longer
commanded the respect or fear of the public, desperately trying to
reform itself as the country heaved and quaked around it.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight fell in Solo a few hours after the parades ended,
the darker side of Indonesia's perilous future reasserted itself.
</P>
<P>
   As they had for several weeks, scores of youngsters staged
late-night motorbike races up and down the main streets. On this
night, responding to the complaints of neighbors and perhaps to the
euphoria of the day's events, the police made the mistake of
asserting their authority: They ordered the youngsters to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The result, in retrospect, was predictable: a riot, the first in
Solo since May.
</P>
<P>
   It was a painfully familiar scene in today's Indonesia: police
posts were burned, telephone booths and stop lights were smashed,
ornamental plants were uprooted, cars were overturned and set on
fire, and windows and storefronts were vandalized. One person died;
dozens were hospitalized, including four police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Only by firing warning shots into the air did security forces
prevent the mob from burning down the newly opened Matahari store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian situation is very fragile,'' said Mulyanto
Utomo, the young editor of the daily newspaper Solopos. ``We are
vulnerable to unrest. Indonesian people have been in chains for 30
years and now everyone wants to shout. Nobody is in control, nobody
obeys the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight grip of Indonesia's strongman has been replaced by a
fever of ``reformasi,'' a shapeless term for reform that leaves
room for everything from nation-building to ruin here, in the
fourth-most-populous nation, with more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Soehardi, who heads the anthropology department at the
University of Gadja Mata in nearby Jogjakarta, described the
national mood as anomie: the disorientation and disorder that
follow the collapse of standards of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are more chaotic,'' he said. ``People don't care
whether what they do disturbs other people. Even the traffic has
become more chaotic. Things used to be controlled from the top
down. People never learned to impose their own internal controls.
Nobody knows the limits anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the coming year will see the country's first
free election since the 1950s, leading to an electoral assembly
that will name a new president, with the flourishing new political
freedom reported by a free press. The main political figures who
have emerged this year have generally embraced this process and are
committed to a democratic future.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Indonesia appears to be facing one of the most
dangerous years in its history, more unstable and more volatile
than it has been in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is shrinking faster than it ever has, giving rise to
anger and outbursts of violence. Crime is rising, along with a
general sense of lawlessness and fear. Continuing student
demonstrations in the capital are threatening the peace and testing
the patience of a weakened and resentful military. In recent weeks
the country has seen the first eruptions of what could grow into
violent religious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   A host of issues remain unresolved, each carrying with it a
threat of violence: the political role of Islam in this
overwhelmingly Muslim nation; the role of the ethnic Chinese, who
control much of the wealth and have been the targets of much of the
violence, and the issue of whether to try Suharto and how to clean
up the tangled mess of corruption he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts now say Indonesia could ride out the economic
crisis, which has brought a wave of joblessness, inflation,
bankruptcies and bank closings. Though prices have risen, the
widespread food shortages that were predicted earlier this year
have not materialized. There has not so far been an explosion of
food riots or riots by unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
   But an epidemic of violence has shaken the country, touched off,
as in Solo, by an unsettling variety of causes. Many riots are
spontaneous, but some seem, at least in part, to have been fomented
by competing forces whose goals often remain obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who want to keep the situation unstable, but
we don't know who they are,'' said Mulyanto, the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Most fearful are the ethnic Chinese, who often face abuse in the
streets. Many wealthy families have fled Indonesia this year.
Others have barricaded their neighborhoods and formed armed
patrols.
</P>
<P>
   One young Chinese resident is constantly asked, here in her own
hometown, where she comes from. ``I wish I could have an operation
on my face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the loosening of the grip of the central government, many
in Indonesia have come to fear the unpredictable violence of the
masses. Echoing the comments of some editors in Jakarta, Mulyanto
said newspapers now tread carefully so as not to offend a restive
readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very cautious about what we write,'' he said.
``There are some things we decide not to publish. For example, if
we offend a village chief he may send some men to us to complain.
Sometimes they bring machetes with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the dangers is the push toward democracy itself and the
power struggles that will accompany the year of political
transition. The slow pace and uncertainties of the process almost
invite turmoil in a nation that has no tradition of electoral
winners and losers, only of winners.

   ``Things are surely going to get dangerous before the
election,'' said Herman Untoro, the owner of a tiny hardware store.
``I'm afraid of the campaign, afraid we'll have May all over again.
People in Solo are frightened and confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others here, he said, he has learned the habit of hoarding
staples in anticipation of unrest: rice, noodles, cooking oil,
soap, detergent. And he was reminded on this recent Saturday night
that just about anything can set off a riot. He said he pulls down
his metal shutters whenever the election campaigners come by on
their motorcycles, whenever there is a public holiday, and even on
junior high school graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Indonesia is trying to move forward
while dragging its past along with it. As if in a political science
experiment, the dictator was plucked from the tip of the pyramid,
but his power structure remained intact and was given the task of
reforming itself.
</P>
<P>
   The new election laws, aimed at opening the political system to
free competition, are being drawn up by legislators who owe their
own seats to Suharto's monopoly on power. The painful withdrawal of
the military from its dominant role in politics can come only with
the cooperation of the military itself. Suharto's corrupt wealth is
being investigated by people who grew wealthy along with him.
</P>
<P>
   And the man overseeing this destruction of Suharto's political
legacy is the former president's hand-picked former deputy and best
friend, President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the tension in the streets today comes from this
paradox. Student demonstrators, carrying the banner of the
country's idealists, are refusing to accept a new order built on
the foundations of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot wash a dirty shirt in dirty water,'' said Chrisma
Albandjar, a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, which have led to repeated violent clashes
in Jakarta, have begun to exasperate some middle-class Indonesians,
who see them now as a destabilizing factor. The exasperation is
fueled by the fact that the students have no clear agenda and seem
motivated more by the enthusiasms of youth than by reason.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is their continuing pressure _ along with an
aggressive new free press that broadly reflects public opinion _
that is forcing Suharto's heirs to move forward with reforms, like
it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by the extent to which the students continue to be
almost the only impetus for change,'' said David Timberman,
director of the Jakarta office of the National Democratic
Institute. ``It is interesting to think that what is sustaining
this process, as halting and fragile as it is, still has such a
small base.''
</P>
<P>
   The students' power seems to come from the fact that they
represent the desire of Indonesians for change, vague as that
notion is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the students as long as they are not violent,''
said Dono, 33, who sells T-shirts in the Klewer Market in Solo and
who like many Indonesians uses just one name. ``It was the students
who forced Suharto to resign. Now they want clean government and
also the rule of law and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Suharto wrung out politics from the daily lives of
his citizens, barring political activity except for rare and
carefully controlled places and times. But a passion for reform
seems to have built among his people as they grew better informed.
</P>
<P>
   If Suharto's men thought they were making a tactical retreat
when they embraced reformasi in the early days after his
resignation, they have been forced by an overwhelming national will
to proceed with real reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of reformasi fever are everywhere in Solo, a slogan
spray-painted on storefronts all around town by merchants hoping to
save their shops from vandals and rioters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want Freedom,'' reads a full-page announcement, embellished
with a clenched fist, on the back page of a newspaper. It is an
advertisement for Djarum cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The same vendor who sells Solopos offers a fistful of slim
paperbacks, each bearing a different caricature of Suharto on the
cover. Their titles are ``Suharto's 10 Biggest Sins,'' ``Suharto's
20 Biggest Stupidities'' and ``Suharto's 30 Biggest Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   All along the batik stalls in the Klewer Market, people study a
questionnaire in the newspaper Bangkit. ``Name the most corrupt
ministers in Suharto's cabinet,'' the newspaper commands. ``The
first 75 respondents will win valuable prizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangkit said 18,549 people had responded to the previous
questionnaire, ``Does Habibie have the guts to put Suharto on
trial?'' The respondents were not optimistic: 85.6 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is heady stuff in a population that grew up being treated
by their leaders like children, seen but not heard. Now they are
raising their voices, and for most of the people in Solo, from poor
laborers to middle-class shoppers, reformasi really means economic
revival.
</P>
<P>
   It was the economic crisis, after all, that roused this nation
to push Suharto from office. It was the destruction and reopening
of the Matahari store that symbolized the near-death and rebirth of
Solo.
</P>
<P>
   For Sutarni, 37, who lives in a Solo slum where people sort
garbage for resale, the meaning of reformasi is simple: lower
prices. She wants to be able to continue sending her only son,
Mulyadi, 13, to school. Asked what she would do if she had to feed
three or four children, like her neighbors, she responded, ``Yah!
Stress!''
</P>
<P>
   For Supardyo, 62, who has farmed the same fields near here since
he was a boy, ``the most important thing is the price of
fertilizer.'' Climbing down from a breadfruit tree where he was
hacking off leaves to feed his goats, Supardyo said the issues of
corruption, democracy and reform are city issues. ``In the village,
nothing changes,'' he said. ``We go to the fields, we plant rice,
we plant cassava, we go home, we wait for the harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   But in these hard times, other farmers said, people have been
stealing harvested rice from sheds and pulling cassava plants right
out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even among some students here, personal livelihood takes
precedence over politics. ``I have a bigger challenge,'' said
Engel, 25, an anthropology student. ``Job, money. I'm going to have
to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the newly opened Matahari store the subject was, of
course, shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I like to buy a lot of lipstick, and since Matahari
burned down I haven't been able to get any Revlon,'' said Siahaan,
55, the wife of a retired government official. ``It's so important
to have it back, so important, because we need it. But it's so
small! No designer clothes! The one we had before was complete,
complete, complete-plete-plete.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether, or for how long, the window of democratic
freedoms will remain open. Many reforms, like freedom of assembly
and freedom of the press, are flourishing only because of the mood
of the government; no laws have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   Already one of Habibie's ministers, Juwono Sudarsono, has
suggested that Indonesia may be reforming too much, too fast for
its own good.
</P>
<P>
   And Habibie himself has shown some anti-democratic tendencies,
arresting respected former generals and other officials who
criticized him, and backing a tentative plan to raise a civilian
security force of 40,000, an idea that makes human rights advocates
shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a war,'' Andreas Harsono, a local journalist, said,
speaking of the reform movement and the need to build new
institutions. ``You have soldiers winning battle by battle or
losing battle by battle. But if these fighting soldiers have
already occupied territory, you need another unit to secure the
territory you have taken. This is not happening.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are the 25 rules for impeachment
proceedings adopted by the Senate on March 2, 1868, to govern the
trial of President Andrew Johnson:
</P>
<P>
   Rule I  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whensoever the Senate shall receive notice from the House of
Representatives that managers are appointed on their part to
conduct an impeachment against any person and are directed to carry
articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate
shall immediately inform the House of Representatives that the
Senate is ready to receive the managers for the purpose of
exhibiting such articles of impeachment agreeably to said notice.
</P>
<P>
   Rule II  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the managers of an impeachment shall be introduced at the
bar of the Senate and shall signify that they are ready to exhibit
articles of impeachment against any person, the presiding officer
of the Senate shall direct the sergeant-at-arms to make
proclamation, who shall, after making proclamation, repeat the
following words, viz:
</P>
<P>
   All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of
imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to
the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against
/name of the accused/, after which the articles shall be exhibited;
and then the presiding officer of the Senate shall inform the
managers that the Senate will take proper order on the subject of
the impeachment, of which due notice shall be given to the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Rule III  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon such articles being presented to the Senate, the Senate
shall, at 1 o'clock afternoon of the day (Sunday excepted)
following such presentation, or sooner if so ordered by the Senate,
proceed to the consideration of such articles, and shall continue
in session from day to day (Sundays excepted) after the trial shall
commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final
judgment shall be rendered, and so much longer as may in its
judgment be needful. Before proceeding to the consideration of the
articles of impeachment the presiding officer shall administer the
oath hereinafter provided to the members of the Senate then
present, and to the other members of the Senate as they shall
appear, whose duty it shall be to take the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rule IV  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the President of the United States, or the Vice President
of the United States upon whom the powers and duties of the office
of President shall have devolved, shall be impeached, the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall preside;
and in a case requiring the said Chief Justice to preside notice
shall be given to him by the presiding officer of the Senate of the
time and place fixed for the consideration of the articles of
impeachment as aforesaid, with a request to attend; and the said
Chief Justice shall preside over the Senate during the
consideration of said articles and upon the trial of the person
impeached therein.
</P>
<P>
   Rule V  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The presiding officer shall have power to make and issue, by
himself or by the secretary of the Senate, all orders, mandates,
writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and
to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the
premises as the Senate may authorize or provide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rule VI  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of
witnesses, to enforce obedience to its order, mandates, writs,
precepts and judgments, to preserve order, and to punish in a
summary way contempts of and disobedience to its authority, orders,
mandates, writs, precepts or judgments, and to make all lawful
orders, rules and regulations which it may deem essential or
conducive to the ends of justice; and the sergeant-at-arms, under
the direction of the Senate, may employ such aid and assistance as
may be necessary to enforce, execute, and carry into effect the
lawful orders, mandates, writs, and precepts of the Senate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rule VII  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The presiding officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary
preparations in the Senate chamber, and the presiding officer upon
the trial shall direct all the forms of proceeding while the Senate
are sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment and all forms
during the trial not otherwise specially provided for. The
presiding officer may, in the first instance, submit to the Senate,
without a division, all questions of evidence and incidental
questions; but the same shall, on the demand of one-fifth of the
members present, be decided by yeas and nays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rule VIII  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon the presentation of articles of impeachment and the
organization of the Senate as hereinbefore provided, a writ of
summons shall issue to the accused, reciting said articles and
notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place
to be fixed by the Senate, and named in such writ, and file his
answer to said articles of impeachment, and to stand to and abide
the orders and judgments of the Senate thereon, which writ shall be
served by such officer or person as shall be named in the precept
thereof such number of days prior to the day fixed for such
appearance as shall be named in such precept, either by the
delivery of an attested copy thereof to the person accused or, if
that can not conveniently be done, by leaving such copy at the last
known place of abode of such person or at his usual place of
business, in some conspicuous place therein; or, if such service
shall be, in the judgment of the Senate, impracticable, notice to
the accused to appear shall be given in such other manner, by
publication or otherwise, as shall be deemed just; and if the writ
aforesaid shall fail of service in the manner aforesaid, the
proceedings shall not thereby abate, but further service may be
made in such manner as the Senate shall direct. If the accused,
after service, shall fail to appear, either in person or by
attorney, on the day so fixed therefor as aforesaid, or, appearing,
shall fail to file his answer to such articles of impeachment, the
trial shall proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty. If
a plea of guilty shall be entered, judgment may be entered thereon
without further proceedings.  &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   I, /name/, do solemnly swear that the return made by me upon the
process issued on the /blank/ day of /blank/ by the Senate of the

<P>
   The person impeached shall then be called to appear and answer
the articles of impeachment against him. If he appear, or any
person for him, the appearance shall be recorded, stating

be recorded.  &QL;
</P>

   Rule XI  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 12 o'clock and 30 minutes after noon of the day appointed for
the trial of an impeachment the legislative and executive business
of the Senate shall be suspended and the secretary shall give

   Rule XII  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hour of the day at which the Senate shall sit upon the trial
of an impeachment shall be (unless otherwise ordered) 12 o'clock

officer of the Senate shall so announce; and thereupon the
presiding officer upon such trial shall cause proclamation to be
made, and the business of the trial shall proceed. The adjournment

IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE WEATHER STRIKES BACK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ A year ago South Africa was gloating. El Nino was
raging from Somalia to California, but this little corner of the
globe was enjoying some of its mildest weather in years.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the stormy season. Some say La Nina brought it on.
Some say hubris. But the weather had, at last, struck back. It even
seemed to be taking aim.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious attempt on President Nelson Mandela's life was
made _ by a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Spencer, the brother of the late Princess of Wales and one
of the few overseas celebrities who lives in South Africa, saw
lightning burn down his thatched house.
</P>
<P>
   Half a popular soccer team was taken to the hospital, after
having been struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four other tornadoes this year, besides the one
that just missed Mandela. That one killed 18 people, injured 184
and led to the town of Umtata's being declared a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   The country is about as far south of the Equator as Florida is
north of it, and the climate is generally Mediterranean. Snowstorms
usually stay in the Drakensberg Mountains. There are intermittent
droughts, but the country has built many dams to cope with them.
There are hailstorms, but generally they do less crop damage than
the pretty little quelea birds that descend like a plague of
locusts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Southern Hemisphere so there are hot spells in
January and cold spells in July but they do not kill as many people
as heat and cold regularly do in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that it's a milquetoast of a country. There
is a hot semidesert in the middle called the Karoo and a real
desert in the west called the Kalahari. Parts of the eastern coast
qualify as jungle, though much of that has been cut down for sugar
cane.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, South Africa does have one weather distinction. It
is one of the spots in the world that lightning finds remarkably
attractive. The Johannesburg region receives an average of 18 bolts
a square mile per year.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho and Swaziland, two tiny countries inside South Africa,
and the Drakensberg Mountains that join them, receive even more, an
average of 28 bolts. About 20 South Africans a year die from
lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The storm season starts in October, and electronics stores
always enjoy a brisk business in replacing fried telephones and
modems and in selling lightning protectors to the formerly
penny-wise.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning problem is so extensive that the national power
company, Eskom, spent millions to build a network of receivers that
records the location and strength of every bolt that hits the
country by detecting disturbances in the AM radio band.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year for lightning since the system was built was
1996. There were more than 650,000 strokes that year, versus about
400,000 in 1995, Jan Coetzer, an Eskom technologist, said then. But
there were relatively few deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, lightning killed six elephants huddled together in the
Kruger National Park.
</P>
<P>
   This year has seen an average amount of lighting, but it has
caused an extraordinary amount of havoc.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, a bolt struck a tent where 11 forestry workers were
sleeping near the town of Ermelo. Five were killed outright, and
five badly burned, some by lightning and some by the blazing tent.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26, a soccer championship match in Johannesburg between
the Moroka Swallows and the Jomo Cosmos was called off when
lightning struck the field, injuring six Swallows, who were behind
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Only two days later an entire team in a village in central Congo
had been killed by lightning. Its opponents were unhurt, but 30
spectators were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The two back-to-back reports, in each case with only one team
hurt, only added credence to a common belief that lightning is
caused by witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   But lightning has not been the worst of the problems this year.
Tornadoes have.
</P>
<P>
   They are rare here, but there have been five so far this season,
all in a belt inland from the east coast. Last week a cabinet-level
committee on disaster management held an emergency meeting to
evaluate the country's response.
</P>
<P>
   The worst, in Umtata on Dec. 15, knocked a wall down on a row of
street hawkers and sent corrugated roofs through the air like
flying razor blades. Part of the roof of the pharmacy that Mandela
was in collapsed, and his bodyguards threw themselves on him. The
words he chose later to laud their dedication were effusive, but
macabre. Even if the storm had killed all of them, Mandela said,
``their corpses would have dragged me to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 deaths in Umtata were the highest on record for a tornado
here, said Mike Edwards, deputy director of forecasting for the
South African Weather Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other storms have drowned about a dozen more people.
Flash floods washed cars off roads when nearly six inches of rain
fell in 24 hours in the Welkom area. While lightning has ignited
large vacation homes on the south coast, rain has washed away whole
groups of shacks in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year seems more terrific than previous years,'' said
Edwards, who was not implying that he enjoyed the chance to ply his
trade, but was using the word ``terrific'' in its classic sense _
terror.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to predict the rest of the season, he said he expected
above-average rainfall for January and February. The likelihood of
lightning and tornadoes should decrease, he said _ at least until
March, which is typically another terrific month.

   WHITEHOUSE-CHRISTMAS (Washington) _ Once one of Washington's

the press corps had become on Monday night a mobbed jamboree,
catering more to the Nickelodeon set than to ``Meet the Press''
pundits. By Marian Burros.

   NAPPY-HAIR (Undated) _ For black women, the quality of their
hair and the way it is styled have always been a sensitive issue.
The way it is worn _ straight or not _ has all kinds of social and

recently in the tempest over the book ``Nappy Hair'' in a
third-grade class at a New York school. By Lola Ogunnaike. (With

Something About Mary'' _ the trend is very real. By Frank DeCaro.

<P>
   FASHION-INTELLECTUAL (Undated) _ As a young art historian, the
author squirreled away her fashion magazines beneath a pile of
Artforums, buying the latest Vogue in newsstands in the depths of
the New York subway system. But gradually, a series of experiences

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 AN INTELLECTUAL FINALLY ACCEPTS HER LOVE OF FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Dec. 27)  
(mk) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A couple of years back, I was invited to a party for
a conceptual artist and decided to dress in theme. Because the
artist does the kind of work that leaves most people scratching
their heads, I wore a Moschino dress with the neckline
appropriately configured as a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing myself to an unshaven guy in a beat-up motorcycle
jacket whom I recognized, I assumed he would know my name because
we were both art critics for many of the same magazines. Instead,
he gave me the once-over and snarled, ``You must be in fashion,''
before abruptly turning his back.
</P>
<P>
   His disdain was typical of many in my field, that is to say, art
history, and it is one of the reasons that I long kept my love for
clothes where many think it belongs _ in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout my childhood, I was indoctrinated into the belief
that fashion was frivolous. As a girl, I would doodle ball gowns in
the margins of my notebook, shielding them with a hand so my
parents and teachers wouldn't discover my forbidden desire.
</P>
<P>
   When I professed a wish to dress the mannequins in Bergdorf
Goodman's windows, my mother would say, ``Fashion is too
tinselly.''
</P>
<P>
   In my house, no one was more revered than my paternal
grandmother, who had put herself through law school working as a
maid. The legend inspiring the greatest awe was that her wardrobe
consisted of a mere four housedresses, and that she never noticed
when her long red locks turned gray, because she was above such
superficialities as makeup and hair color.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a lot of time twirling in front of mirrors, imagining
myself being transformed by a dress or hat into someone far
grander. But when I confessed a desire to be in the fashion
business, my mother intervened. ``You drive down Seventh Avenue and
see racks of clothes being pushed down the street,'' she said.
``Where is the intellectual part? I see you behind a pushcart and
think, what will happen to your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   So I chose art history as a career. Now that was something Mom
could be proud of. She herself is an artist. Not only could she add
a bit of polish to her own calling by having a daughter as an art
historian, she could also boast, ``My child is going to Rome to
study the Sistine ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to graduate school at New York University's Institute of
Fine Arts, an ivory tower situated in the James Biddle Duke mansion
on Fifth Avenue at 78th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the oak paneling, marble floors and crystal chandeliers, I
dedicated myself to lofty interpretations of high culture. But
clothes were always on my mind. I devoted equal effort to studying
for an exam about post-Impressionism and deciding what to wear to
it (something low-cut and flouncy with black stockings, very Moulin
Rouge).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that my repressed desires were obvious, I
suffered from the same prejudice that afflicts so many art
historians. Valerie Steele, chief curator of the museum at the
Fashion Institute of Technology, calls it fear of ``fashion _ which
most academics see as anti-intellectual, sexist, bourgeois and
materialist.''
</P>
<P>
   The art historian Ann Hollander, who has devoted her career to
studying clothing in art, says the problem is much deeper. ``The
idea that a serious woman is not interested in earrings is a
pernicious one afflicting our puritanical society, and others
before ours,'' she said. ``It is a tradition going back to the
Bible. It starts with the whole idea that the material world and
our bodies are bad. Clothes and the body are ephemeral. They don't
last. This makes people think that fashion is on the surface of it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, as a young art historian, I squirreled away my
fashion magazines beneath a pile of Artforums, buying the latest
Vogue in newsstands in the depths of the New York subway system.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually, a series of experiences convinced me I had to own
up to the truth _ that how I looked was as important to me as what
I was looking at.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Museum of Modern Art retrospective of Willem de
Kooning, I was one of the art historians hired to lecture for a
corporate event. Banana Republic, the sponsors of the evening,
insisted we wear store-issued pants, a white shirt and black
sweater around our shoulders. While my colleagues didn't seem to
mind, I was mortified. You couldn't trade me one of the de Koonings
to sport something as conformist as chinos. But at the last minute,
I was let off the hook. The dress code was modified to all-black,
an acceptable alternative that I was able to accent with a pair of
red velvet Manolo Blahniks.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering other like-minded art historians helped me to come
clean about my sartorial longings. ``I have always adored bold
fashion,'' said Linda Nochlin, Lila Acheson Wallace professor of
modern art at the Institute of Fine Arts, who favors Yohji Yamamoto
outfits with Oilily socks. ``I'm interested in the sensual,
artistic and gorgeous part of it. Since I'm not a painter, I'm a
clothes person. It's a creative expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nochlin sees no contradiction between her reputation as a
feminist academic and her passion for clothes. ``I wore miniskirts
before I had tenure'' she exclaimed. ``What is contradictory to
feminism is standard, nice-lady mall fashion. I hate little suits.
Excessive fashion breaks through the domineering sameness of
fashion. Understatement is not my cup of tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Fine Collins, who has been called a muse to Geoffrey Beene,
started as a scholar of American impressionism before writing about
fashion for Vanity Fair. ``It's a secret society, art historians
who love fashion,'' she said. ``Academics are so fearful of things
that are useful or pleasurable. But I'm simply mad for clothes. My
conversion occurred after the Geoffrey Beene retrospective at the
National Academy of Design in 1988. I date my life from that time
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, I started making timid forays into a career in
fashion writing, extolling a scarf here, a shoe there. Recently,
after going to Europe to interview a designer, there was no turning
back. At the Guy Laroche showroom, I met the creative director
Alber Elbaz (who has since been named the designer for Yves Saint
Laurent ready-to-wear). I marveled at the details of his designs. I
found myself standing ogling a hibiscus-colored dress. Mesmerized,
I ran my finger along the trompe l'oeil stem of a flower
constructed out of a seam. That someone could care so much about
something so small as a stitch was overwhelming. That I was in his
very presence was too much for me. I started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   That was the moment I knew I was where I belonged. To be in
Paris, the capital of haute couture, in a designer's studio, in a
room filled with his radiant dresses was not only exhilarating, it
was liberating. I called my mother to tell her all about it,
announcing I'd given up my double life. All these years I had been
a secret cross dresser, a lover of finery posing as an
intellectual. It was time to burst out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   She sounded slightly worried. ``Maybe you'd like to take up
sewing,'' she said.

HORRIBLY HIP: WHEN DEAD GERBILS ARE FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Dec. 27)  
(rl) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a television commercial for an online computer warehouse,
gerbils appear to be shot out of a cannon smack into a wall. In an
advertisement hawking doughnuts, an off-screen cat cries in pain
after being stepped on. A spot for a video game shows a goldfish
wriggling on the floor amid the shards of a shattered aquarium.
Meanwhile, in some of the year's most talked about movies, dogs are
drugged, spray-painted and maltreated, all for comic effect.
</P>
<P>
   You thought wearing fur was bad?
</P>
<P>
   As both Madison Avenue and Hollywood searched for laughs in 1998
_ finding fun in the grossest gags and the most bleepable language
_ animal abuse somehow got humorously hip. From ``There's Something
About Mary'' to ``Enemy of the State'' and ``Very Bad Things,''
pets were treated in ways that you shouldn't treat a dog. Although
the cruelty was make-believe _ that border terrier didn't really
end up in a full-body cast in ``Mary'' _ the trend is very real.
</P>
<P>
   When even the G-rated ``Babe: Pig in the City'' is filled with
disturbing animal violence _ one scene had a pit bull nearly hanged
by his own chain _ it's open season.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the tabloids had a field day with the disclosure
that some inexpensively priced coats were trimmed in dog fur and
were being recalled by Burlington Coat Factory. But the mass media
do not seem to mind animal suffering as humor.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the flying gerbils
commercial for Outpost.com ``one standout spot'' and reported last
week that feedback on the spot has been 65 percent positive.
``Whether you find it hilarious or horrid, the airborne pets manage
to shock even in today's seen-it-all era,'' the magazine decided.
</P>
<P>
   Dead-animal jokes aren't new, as anyone who saw ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' the 1988 Kevin Kline comedy, knows. Who didn't giggle as
Kline swallowed a man's prized goldfish? But 10 years ago, that
kind of comedy was the exception _ the taboo-breaking province of
Monty Python's Flying Circus and ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, it was still considered shocking when a dinosaur
ate a dog but spat out the doghouse in ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park.'' Before that, Hollywood animals usually survived in disaster
movies _ often laughably overcoming the slimmest of odds, as in
``Independence Day,'' when Vivica A. Fox's dog miraculously outran
an explosion. But when a dog ended up as an hors d'oeuvre in ``The
Lost World,'' it ushered in a new era.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oscar-winning ``As Good as It Gets,'' for instance, a
Brussels griffon was sent down a garbage chute, and people howled.
He lived. Yet somehow, today's audiences don't care to distinguish
between Wile E. Coyote's being hit on the head with a falling anvil
in a Looney Tunes cartoon and a simulation of cruelty to a pet in a
live-action adult comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no animals were harmed in the production of these films
and commercials, the idea that it's funny to hurt an animal is
dangerous. It is particularly so because today's movies are not
like the old cartoons, or the dead parrots and exploding cats in
Monty Python vehicles. That was absurdist humor. This is just mean.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening? Maybe advertising agencies and artists
are fed up with those of us who treat our dogs as children by
spoiling them with luxurious Gucci leather beds, rubber bones from
Paul Smith and hand-knit sweaters nicer than most people will ever
wear. When I started signing my dog's name to my Christmas cards in
a childlike scrawl with the ``e'' backward and a tiny paw print
next to it, even I worried that I'd gone too far. But it's no
excuse for creative minds to start acting like Glenn Close's
maniacal character in ``Fatal Attraction'' and gleefully taking it
out on pets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's all part of the backlash against political
correctness that has characterized the 1990s. Or maybe it's a jaded
byproduct of the arrogance that goes with fast money earned in a
booming economy. Fashion magazines and many of the most respected
designers in the world have decided that fur is no longer a sign of
boorishness. But what about dead-dog jokes? Where do we draw the
line? Are the Farrelly brothers any better than Fendi?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people aren't treated very well in movies these days,
either. The human beings in ``There's Something About Mary,'' for
instance, suffer plenty of indignities. And in the new ``Psycho,''
one still shouldn't shower at the Bates Motel. But when ants and
moths _ those spoilers of Bryant Park picnics and Banana Republic
cashmere sweaters _ are considered cute in animated films, it is
strange that pets can meet savage ends in live-action movies and
that audiences laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Literature from animal rights organizations quotes the old
dictum that you can judge a society by the way it treats its
animals. If that's true, we come up lacking. We've become way too
cynical for our own good. Maybe we shouldn't treat animals as our
offspring, but they're not disposable either. At the end of the
Outpost.com commercial, a title card taunts viewers, goading them
to write in their complaints. Even gerbils deserve better.

HOW DICKENS ADDED BAH! TO HUMBUG! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD E. MOONEY 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Dickens dashed off ``A Christmas Carol'' in six weeks in
the fall of 1843. He needed money quickly because sales of his
serialized ``Martin Chuzzlewit'' were slack and the demands of his
growing family (eventually 10) were not. The Christmas story netted
far less than he had hoped, but it remains his best known and best
selling. Today there are no fewer than 60 English-language editions
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens, then 31, had already written ``Oliver Twist,''
``Nicholas Nickleby'' and ``The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick
Club.'' He was midway through the 19 monthly installments of
``Chuzzlewit'' and told a friend that he thought it ``immeasurably
the best of my stories.'' The public did not agree. He blamed his
publisher and soon got another.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, Dickens went up to Manchester to visit one of
the free Ragged schools for poor children at the request of his
wealthy friend Angela Burdett-Coutts, with whom he frequently
collaborated on charitable works. His biographer, Edgar Johnson,
reports that Dickens came away with ``the inspiration for a
cheerful, glowing, heart-moving story.''
</P>
<P>
   He started writing in mid-October and finished in late November.
As he would do with other stories, he borrowed generously from an
earlier work, in this case ``Pickwick.'' Those ``papers'' tell of
one Gabriel Grub, church sexton, an ``ill-conditioned,
cross-grained, surly fellow _ a morose and lonely man, who
consorted with nobody but himself.'' In ``A Christmas Carol''
Ebenezer Scrooge is cut from the same chilly cloth: ``hard and
sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous
fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.''
</P>
<P>
   Grub is set upon by goblins in the church graveyard one night
and, like Scrooge, made to see what a wretch he is and persuaded to
repent. In ``A Christmas Carol'' the goblins become ghosts of
Christmases past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierport Morgan Library owns Dickens' 68-page manuscript of
``A Christmas Carol'' and puts it on display every year, this time
through Jan. 3. It shows the hand of a man writing quickly but with
the polishing touches, insertions and deletions of someone taking
care with every word. For instance, Dickens originally wrote that
Scrooge growled ``Humbug!'' when his nephew wished him ``a merry
Christmas, uncle!'' He later inserted ``Bah!'' and thus etched
``Bah! Humbug!'' into the language of scorn. Later on he introduces
Bob Cratchit's boy as Little Fred, then inks it out and writes in
Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' handwriting inside the front cover says, ``My own, and
only MS of the Book.'' It is bound in red morocco and stamped with
the name of his lawyer, Thomas Mitton. Dickens gave it to Mitton,
from whom he appears to have borrowed money that year. The first
printing of ``A Christmas Carol,'' 6,000 copies, started coming off
the press a week before Christmas and sold out as fast as the books
were available.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ``A Christmas Carol'' to make much money for its
author was largely his own doing. He insisted on a fine product _
four full-page hand-colored etchings, four woodcuts, a gilt design
on the cover and gilt on the trimmed edges. Yet he wanted it priced
inexpensively, to reach a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the disappointing profit from the book itself, pirated
printings and theater stagings rarely paid him anything at all.
Within two months of the original publication, there were eight
theatrical adaptations. Dickens had sanctioned only one. In the
150-odd years since there have been who-knows-how-many more, and at
least 11 films.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one hugely profitable spinoff, Dickens'
readings to paying audiences. On the night of Dec. 27, 1853, he
read ``A Christmas Carol'' to an audience of 2,000 in Birmingham
Town Hall for the benefit of the Birmingham and Manchester
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   At first the readings took three hours, even though he pared the
story. Eventually he got it down to less than two hours. The New
York Public Library owns the book from which he read for 12 years,
with cues to himself scribbled in the margins: ``cheerful'' when
Scrooge's nephew burst into the office on Christmas Eve, ``tone to
mystery'' when Scrooge takes his ``melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern'' and ``pathos'' when the Ghost of Christmas Yet
to Come takes him to ``poor Bob Cratchit's house.''
</P>
<P>
   In some 470 public readings, all but 27 for money, he most often
did excerpts from ``Pickwick'' and ``A Christmas Carol,'' so often
that he knew them by heart. Sometimes he improvised. After a
performance in Paris he wrote to a friend, ``I got things out of
the old `Carol' _ effects, I mean _ so entirely new and so very
strong, that I quite amazed myself and wondered where I was going
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences loved him in his bright red vest and gold chains, even
in the United States, where he had stirred some resentment with his
critical ``American Notes.'' Scalpers were said to get as much as
$26 for a $2 ticket to hear him. In New York City, his hotel near
Gramercy Park reserved a stairway for him and posted a guard
outside his door. The New York Times' critic called him ``one of
the best living actors,'' citing his ``free use of gesticulation''
when Mrs. Cratchit stirred gravy, mashed potatoes and sniffed the
Christmas pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1870, exhausted by the
strenuous regimen of readings. He was 58. For his final performance
he did the ``Pickwick'' excerpt and ``A Christmas Carol'' one more
time. At the end he told the audience, ``From these garish lights I
vanish now forevermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful and
affectionate farewell.'' He died three months later and was laid to
rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, attended by 12
people instructed by him in his will to wear no black bow, long
hatband or other ``revolting absurdity'' of Victorian mourning. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ What James Edward Brighton knows for sure is that
sometime after midnight on Oct. 12 he awoke in a Montreal parking
lot, naked, dazed and without a clue to who he was or how he got
there.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to Montreal General Hospital. After hypnosis and
injections of a ``truth serum,'' he told doctors that he thought he
was from Morristown, N.J.; he thought his name was James Edward
Brighton; he thought he was about 28 years old, and he thought he
was gay.
</P>
<P>
   But without identification papers, he is afraid to cross the
border into the United States to find out more about his
background.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal police have contacted the FBI and Interpol, but to no
avail. Police in Morristown were also asked to help. Detective Sgt.
Mark Slockbower said the young man's description of the green in
Morristown's center was accurate enough to lend his account
credibility. But all leads have turned up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we've exhausted all our possibilities in terms of
trying to put him together with somewhere specific,'' Slockbower
said in a telephone interview. ``This is a small city, but lots of
people come through here.''
</P>
<P>
   Slockbower said police had checked everything from the records
of homeless shelters to high school yearbooks looking for clues,
and had come up empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   For Brighton, the past two months have been a nightmare. ``It's
been frustrating and lonely,'' he said from the Montreal home of
Greg Blachford, a worker at the Gay Line crisis center who took in
Brighton after he was discharged from the hospital. ``I can be
around other people who are talking about their experiences in life
and then I realize that even though I think I'm 28, I can't
remember what sort of experiences I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Montoro, a psychiatrist at Montreal General who
examined and treated Brighton, said he was convinced that the young
man was not trying to deliberately hide his past. Police have found
no evidence of a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   When Brighton was examined by doctors he had no head bruises or
other evidence of physical injuries that could have caused the loss
of memory. His blood showed no evidence of alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Montoro thinks Brighton has a rare condition known as
dissociative amnesia, which was probably caused by some
psychological trauma. ``It appears he was assaulted by two thieves
in his home a few weeks before he came to Montreal,'' Montoro said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of traumatic event that could have triggered
the amnesia, but Montoro said that uncovering it has not helped
Brighton retrieve more than just scrambled parts of his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts, like his birth date, came firmly into his mind,
Brighton said. During one of the sessions with doctors, he turned
his head when someone called out the name James. A slight British
accent supports his thought that he came to the United States from
England when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But it is through the use of sodium amytal, a ``truth serum,''
that Brighton made the link to Morristown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor asked if I could think of any city in particular
and I mentioned Morristown and without looking at a map I said it
was directly off Highway 287,'' Brighton said. The description is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later they showed me pictures of the old courthouse in town
and I knew exactly what it was,'' he said. He also remembered the
town green, and the train station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered that I would drive a short distance, park and
then take the train,'' he said. He thinks he worked in the
television or film industry in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Brighton said that when the doctors were examining him after he
first entered the hospital in October, they asked if he was gay.
``Without even thinking I said yes,'' he said. Montreal police
theorized that he might have gone to Montreal for the annual
``Black and Blue'' celebration, a large party drawing thousands of
people from all over North America.
</P>
<P>
   But a check of ticket purchases and credit card records did not
turn up any useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Montoro said that if Brighton does not recover his full memory
within six months, it is not likely that he will. He would then
have to assume a new legal identity and apply for citizenship in
Canada, where he can stay for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Brighton said that because he does not have any identification,
he is afraid to try crossing the border into the United States to
visit Morristown personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with two officers from Immigration Canada and they said
that because I don't have papers, American immigration would not
allow me in,'' he said. ``Then I checked with U.S. immigration one
time and they told me not to try crossing if I don't have
identification.''

SMALL AD AGENCY FOCUSES ON IRONY TO SELL GOOD CAUSES  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ADS   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A close-up of dead fish lying cheek by jowl stares dully from
the BART station wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get stuck on the Bay Bridge and suddenly being trapped in an
elevator sounds like fun,'' reads the ad. ``Take BART on your night
out instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip and edgy aren't the first words that come to mind when
thinking of  &LR; BART, a bureaucratic agency that until recently ran
yesterday's news on its in-station monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's ads, though, are eye-catching and irreverent. They
have also helped boost off-peak ridership 15 percent in the three
years they've been running, said Gale Moses, BART marketing
projects manager.
</P>
<P>
   The BART ads are the work of Underground Advertising, a tiny San
Francisco agency whose client roster consists mainly of nonprofit
groups and other service organizations looking for support.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't find posters of doe-eyed children holding empty
rice bowls coming out of Underground's small office on Pier 9.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Walbridge and Chuck Cardillo, the agency's co-creative
directors, have replaced heart-tugging sentimentality, a mainstay
of public interest advertising, with irony _ a device more often
seen in commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try never to pull a tear, although most of our issues are
heavy,'' said Walbridge. ``People's instinct is to turn the page if
they perceive something as being too negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground's five-person office created its first do-gooder ad
two years ago for the Environmental Protection Information Center,
a redwoods conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The ad _ which featured the headline ``We're not trying to save
all the redwoods; 96 percent of them are already gone'' _ was ``the
most fun we'd had in five years,'' said Walbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hang out in the woods on the weekend and then come
back and sell people crap that ruins the woods, there's just too
much of a disconnect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Walbridge and Cardillo have taken on mostly nonprofit
clients and other organizations, like BART, whose goals they
approve of. (Public transit cuts down on auto  &LR; air pollution.)
</P>
<P>
   Other clients include the Rainforest Action Network, Mother
Jones magazine and the Breast Cancer Fund as well as companies such
as Glencoe Foods, which makes healthful soups, and Parasound
Products, a stereo equipment maker. Underground's annual billings
reached about $3 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Walbridge and Cardillo's salaries are half as high as a few
years ago, when they mostly free-lanced for other agencies on large
corporate accounts such as Microsoft. But their work day is
incomparably more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings Cardillo, who writes copy, and Walbridge, who
handles art, bike from their San Francisco homes to a coffee shop
(always an independent) where they brainstorm about creative
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoons are spent in the office and evenings are spent at
home with their wives and children. Cardillo said he hasn't worn a
tie in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two partners took off every other Friday, a
schedule their work load has not allowed this year. But they hope
to return to a similar routine in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than the way they work is the satisfaction
of promoting causes instead of corporations, Underground executives
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, trying to sell shoes or sell booze seems really petty,''
said Lori Warren, Underground director of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have to rationalize what I was doing by saying `it's
moving the economy' or `it's helping my client,''' said Warren.
``Now we don't have to rationalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground is trying to drum up business by convincing
traditional nonprofit advertisers that its edgy style works better.
Warren recently sent a pitch letter to Save the Children, a charity
whose ads for many years have featured sad-looking children and the
ever-earnest spokeswoman, Sally Struthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see the same sappy ad over and over for 10 years you
become immune to it,'' said Warren. ``It probably works for
75-year-old grandparents, but not for this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground's standard layout for issue-oriented ads also
borrows from commercial advertising. More than 50 percent of each
issue ad is devoted to images and the headline, while the problem
and recommended action are distilled into a few paragraphs of
smaller text.
</P>
<P>
   Ads that employ guilt-inducing headlines and are packed with
lengthy discussions assume that the reader cares as much about the
cause as the advertiser does, said Cardillo.
</P>
<P>
   Underground attempts to ``consider the point of view of the
target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But an executive at San Francisco's other public interest ad
agency said it is a mistake to apply commercial strategies to
charitable ads. ``You're not selling widgets,'' said Herbert Chao
Gunther, president of the Public Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther said his organization recently completed an ad for Food
First that features a photo of ``a hungry-looking kid'' and
develops three points over  &LR; from more than 1,500 words of text. The
headline contrasts the number of millionaires in the United States
(3.5 million) with the number of hungry people (30 million).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike commercial advertising, ``You're really trying to reach a
few folks, you're not trying to reach everyone'' said Gunther,
whose agency bills about $25 million per year, mostly from the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Kover, the editor of the Journal of Advertising Research,
said both approaches can work.
</P>
<P>
   Public Media Center's ad would appeal to people who are already
``deeply concerned and are looking for a way to channel their
interests,'' Kover said.
</P>
<P>
   Underground's ads, meanwhile, would ``grab (readers) and change
the behavior of people who aren't necessarily looking for this kind
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground clients interviewed for this article said
Underground's ads met or exceeded their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a big budget so it's important that we break
through the clutter,'' said BART's Moses. ``We must create very
noticeable advertising and I think Underground has done that in a
superb way.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is a full-blown
Senate trial of President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight existence of the Supreme
Court into the glare of the public spotlight. This raises the the
intriguing prospect of watching a man accustomed to being very much
in charge of a very controllable environment navigate in a realm
where normal expectations don't apply. By Linda Greenhouse. WITH
PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SOUTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ The impeachments of Presidents
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, 130 years apart, both show how
potent the North-South divide can be. With Johnson, it reflected
the aftermath of the Civil War. With Clinton, it comes at a time
when conservative Southerners hold virtually all of the Republican
leadership positions in Congress. Southerners have also been the
prime advocates of impeachment. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ However it's defined, adultery and
its lies have generated a vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in
many cultures, an almost universal body of common law. A look at
some examples.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Millions of American students
still study French, despite the fading significance of France and
its language. French has ceded to English its longtime standing as
the first language of diplomacy. It has fewer speakers worldwide
than many other languages. So is French being taught out of
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global
economy? By Jacques Steinber. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Almost every state has raised
its highway speed limit in what has become an unofficial test of
the long-held belief that speed kills. Three years into the test,
the answer is still unclear. By Matthew Wald.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-BEGINNINGS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Research indicates that
the AIDS virus came into existence in the 1940s or '50s in Africa.
If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could the
virus, which now threatens to kill a quarter of Africa, have gone
virtually unnoticed for decades _ and then emerged in America,
decimating gays and hemophiliacs in the early '80s before starting
on a ruthless march around the world? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. officials from President
Clinton on down are taking the threat of germ warfare very
seriously, with thousands of people and billions of dollars in
motion to address it. Is this prudence or paranoia? By William J.
Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the U.S. bombing of Iraq, the
stalemate continues. The U.S. has used one of the pillars of its
containment policy _ the threat of force _ but not used it
thoroughly. And the other pillars of U.S. policy toward Iraq are
now wobbling. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSIDENTS-REVIEW (Beijing) _ China's recent crackdowns on
dissidents came at the end of a year when China's rigid political
system had seemed to be relaxing its grip, and dashed hopes that
China was poised for change. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is a full-blown
Senate trial of President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight existence of the Supreme
Court into the glare of the public spotlight. This raises the the
intriguing prospect of watching a man accustomed to being very much
in charge of a very controllable environment navigate in a realm
where normal expectations don't apply. By Linda Greenhouse. WITH
PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SOUTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ The impeachments of Presidents
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, 130 years apart, both show how
potent the North-South divide can be. With Johnson, it reflected
the aftermath of the Civil War. With Clinton, it comes at a time
when conservative Southerners hold virtually all of the Republican
leadership positions in Congress. Southerners have also been the
prime advocates of impeachment. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ However it's defined, adultery and
its lies have generated a vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in
many cultures, an almost universal body of common law. A look at
some examples.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Millions of American students
still study French, despite the fading significance of France and
its language. French has ceded to English its longtime standing as
the first language of diplomacy. It has fewer speakers worldwide
than many other languages. So is French being taught out of
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global
economy? By Jacques Steinber. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Almost every state has raised
its highway speed limit in what has become an unofficial test of
the long-held belief that speed kills. Three years into the test,
the answer is still unclear. By Matthew Wald.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-BEGINNINGS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Research indicates that
the AIDS virus came into existence in the 1940s or '50s in Africa.
If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could the
virus, which now threatens to kill a quarter of Africa, have gone
virtually unnoticed for decades _ and then emerged in America,
decimating gays and hemophiliacs in the early '80s before starting
on a ruthless march around the world? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. officials from President
Clinton on down are taking the threat of germ warfare very
seriously, with thousands of people and billions of dollars in
motion to address it. Is this prudence or paranoia? By William J.
Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the U.S. bombing of Iraq, the
stalemate continues. The U.S. has used one of the pillars of its
containment policy _ the threat of force _ but not used it
thoroughly. And the other pillars of U.S. policy toward Iraq are
now wobbling. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSIDENTS-REVIEW (Beijing) _ China's recent crackdowns on
dissidents came at the end of a year when China's rigid political
system had seemed to be relaxing its grip, and dashed hopes that
China was poised for change. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

VACATION SPOTS CASHING IN ON FAMILY HOLIDAY GET-TOGETHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Hawaii, Kan., N.M., R.I., Tenn., Texas, Va., Wash.)  (rl) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holidays are a time for family gatherings, but as many
families are discovering, togetherness at Christmas does not have
to be confined to the home. In fact, because they are determined to
preserve family ties, a growing number of Americans can be found
huddling around Christmas trees in the lobbies of distant hotels,
or on cruise ships sailing the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the bright lights and holiday decorations in cities
like New York, Boston and Chicago have long lured vacationers at
Christmas time. But now hundreds of smaller cities are also eagerly
trying to lure tourist dollars, and hotels are seeking to fill
rooms during what has traditionally been a slow season by
assembling packages tied to Christmas travel.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many families have long celebrated the holidays on
ski trails or palm-fringed beaches, especially families with both
cash and time on their hands. But these days, those of modest means
and tight schedules are also vacationing during the holiday period
from Hanukkah through New Year's, not to be alone but to spend time
with older children, parents or grandparents. This holiday season,
cruise bookings are up 15 percent over last year, to a record
218,000, while hotels nationwide report more guests _ and more
families _ than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 18 years my wife and I spent Christmas at my
daughter's house here in town,'' said Al Skrede, a retired National
Weather Service meteorologist in Overland Park, Kan. This year,
Skrede, a widower, is spending Christmas and seven other days in
Hawaii with his daughter, Barbara Jenkins, her husband, Ralph, and
their three daughters. ``Everybody agreed there would be no
Christmas presents,'' he said, ``except for Hawaii itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Others travel but still manage to get home to gather around the
living room tree. ``This is about the only way all of us can spend
time together as a family,'' said Stacey Williams of Maypearl,
Texas, shortly after arriving in Carlsbad, N.M., a week ago. She
was traveling with her husband, Larry, a welder, their two young
sons, and her parents, Stanley and Pam Bates, also from Maypearl.
They spent two days in Carlsbad, viewing its ``Christmas on the
Pecos River'' celebration, before driving to Ski Cloudcroft, a
resort near Alamogordo, N.M., then headed home in time for
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Don Carroll of Knoxville, Tenn., recently spent four
days in Williamsburg, Va., with their two children. ``We're
combining shopping and Santa,'' said Mrs. Carroll, who managed to
take time off from the auto parts warehouse where she works. ``And
we want to show the kids a part of their history, now that they're
old enough to be interested. That's why we don't feel guilty about
taking them out of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Williams and Carroll families are part of another trend
_ shorter but more frequent vacations, a consequence of the rise of
two-earner households, and the difficulty of coordinating
schedules. And lots of industrial plants that once shut down to
retool, giving workers time to plan a week or two of vacation well
in advance, no longer employ so many people.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the time squeeze is not likely to get better.
Last month a study for the business council of the World Tourism
Organization, conducted in the United States and 17 other
industrial nations that together represent 73 percent of the
world's spending on tourism, found that economic pressures are
likely to lead to a global decline in leisure time. ``The effect of
this squeeze on leisure time,'' a business council official said,
``will be to accelerate the trend to shorter, more frequent
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller cities are vying for those holiday travelers. Each year,
about a half-million people visit Carlsbad to explore parts of the
30-mile-long Carslbad Cavern, 75 stories below ground. But tourism
essentially went into hibernation during the winter, until 1992,
when the chamber of commerce came up with ``Christmas on the
Pecos,'' a celebration highlighted by cruises up the Pecos River on
pontoon boats while viewing the Christmas lights of riverside
residents.
</P>
<P>
   During that monthlong event, 14,000 visitors _ an estimated 70
percent of them from out of town _ bought cruise tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Williamsburg has been a popular Christmas destination for years.
During their recent visit, the Carroll family stayed at the Days
Inn Historic Area motel, not only because it is less expensive than
Colonial Williamsburg, but also because the motel goes all out at
Christmas, putting candles in all 120 rooms, wreaths on the door,
Christmas trees in some rooms, lining the staircase with red
poinsettias and stringing the property with 30,000 lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes six to eight weeks to decorate it,'' said Nonie
Kellogg, the manager, ``but it pays off. Our Christmas occupancy
has doubled in the past five years, and it pays off for our guests.
Lots of them even bring their presents and have Christmas in our
lobby, under the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Another relative newcomer to the Christmas visitor sweepstakes
is Leavenworth, Wash., a onetime logging town at the base of the
Cascade mountains. When logging played out and Front Street was
left with more than 100 boarded-up shops, the 2,200 residents
transformed the town into a faux-Bavarian village.
</P>
<P>
   Today it draws 1.1 million visitors a year, many of them for a
monthlong Christmas celebration that includes lights, sleigh rides,
handbell ringers, choirs and concerts. Retail and lodging taxes
brought in almost $856,000 last year, $103,000 of that in December,
compared with $478,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Nine towns and villages in the Blackstone River Valley of Rhode
Island banded together a dozen years ago to promote themselves as a
region. Now the fastest-growing tourist destination in the state,
its listing of Christmas events has grown from a four-page brochure
to a 28-page newspaper insert. And a 103-year-old historic carousel
in Pawtucket drew more than 3,000 riders on Dec. 5, the only day it
was open after closing for the season in October.
</P>
<P>
   Minden, a town of 3,000 residents in southern Kansas, bills
itself as ``The Christmas City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had visitors this month from Colorado, Iowa and
South Dakota,'' said Marvin Mangers, manager of the Pioneer Village
there.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other hotels, Denver's 103-year-old Brown Palace also
has Christmas packages, going out of its way to accommodate
families.
</P>
<P>
   One such guest is Eda Brannan of Denver, who for years had
Christmas dinner in her home for as many as 16 friends and
relatives. But after the death six years ago of her husband,
Charles, who had been agriculture secretary under President Truman,
she said, ``the dinner got too much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to remain in touch during the holidays, Mrs. Brannan
started inviting nieces, nephews and friends for Christmas dinner
at the Brown Palace. At least 10 were coming this year, including a
couple from Montana. Gifts were to be opened under a Christmas tree
in the hotel, followed by a traditional turkey dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brannan does not deny that she is sometimes nostalgic for
when she and her husband had Christmas at home, and she invariably
topped off the meal with her own creme brulee, which Bess Truman
raved about the time Mrs. Brannan invited her to lunch at the
Brannans' Washington apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, Mrs. Brannan said, ``It's a wonderful way to
spend Christmas with family and friends.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After Noliwe Rooks' grandmother suffered a stroke in
church, the family gathered around her in the hospital, worried
that she might not recover. Ms. Rooks had not seen her aged
grandmother in almost a year, and she leaned close to whisper
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Grandma, I'm here,'' Ms. Rooks recalls saying. ``Her eyes
got really big. The first words out of her mouth in 24 hours were:
`Oh, my Lord! What did you do to your hair!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rooks, a visiting professor of history and African-American
studies at Princeton University, had taken to wearing dreadlocks
since her last visit to her grandmother, who preferred that she
wear her hair straight. For black women, the quality of their hair,
and how it is styled, has always been a sensitive issue. The way it
is worn _ straight or not _ has all kinds of social and political
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hot button'' was pushed again recently in the tempest over
the book ``Nappy Hair'' in a third-grade class at a Brooklyn public
school. Although the book, by Carolivia Herron, is meant to be a
celebration of the naturally kinky hair of a little girl named
Brenda, parents of some students at the school expressed outrage at
its use. Eventually, the teacher who was using it transferred to
another school.
</P>
<P>
   While the controversy was complex, the issue was the
implications of the word ``nappy,'' which some blacks find
derogatory. Others are trying to reclaim the word as a positive, or
at least neutral, expression describing black hair in its natural
state.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: The word can offend, reflecting the fact
that black women who don't wear their hair straightened have long
faced unsettling and unpleasant reactions, including tormenting
comments by strangers, ostracism by relatives, prejudgments that
they are somehow combative, even dismissal from jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, more and more black women are finding happiness, not
horror, in the tight curl of their hair. Far from unacceptable, in
the eyes of many African-Americans, nappy hair worn in a variety of
styles is in vogue. From the boardroom to the beauty pages, black
women are forsaking chemical straighteners, or relaxers, and
wearing their hair in dreadlocks, braids, twists and variations on
the Afro that celebrate the stylish possibilities of black hair in
its natural state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nappy hair is definitely in,'' said Derrick Scurry, a hair
stylist whose clients include more than 400 black women with
natural hair.
</P>
<P>
   Alek Wek, one of fashion's most sought-after models, wears her
hair in a close-cropped, chemical-free Caesar cut. The hip-hop star
Lauryn Hill wears dreadlocks _ uncombed or twisted locks that were
popularized by Rastafarians. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas,
wears thick braids in the style known as casama. And the tennis
stars Venus and Serena Williams display their hair in cornrow
braids with beads.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward nappy hair has not gone unnoticed by
advertisers. Retailers including Kenneth Cole and Banana Republic,
J.Crew and Levi Strauss, are using black models, both male and
female, with natural hair styles. In a Levi's ad, a black man with
dreadlocks to his shoulders holds a sign saying, ``Conformity leads
to mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No chemical is good for the hair, and black women are tired of
their hair breaking off and falling out,'' said Ademola Mandella,
the owner of Locks-n-Chops, one of several New York salons
specializing in hair styles that do not involve chemical
straightening and that report an increase in business over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that natural-hair salons are providing women with
attractive and healthier hair alternatives, they're realizing that
nappy hair is as beautiful and as acceptable as any other hair
style,'' said Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   The history of black hair in the United States has often had its
painful aspects, tracing to slavery. One way that blacks were made
to feel inferior to whites was denigration of them for the texture
of their hair, said Ms. Rooks of Princeton, whose book ``Hair
Raising: The Roots of a Black Dilemma,'' chronicles the history of
hair among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was believed that civilized people had straight hair and
black people weren't even human, because their hair was kinky,''
Ms. Rooks said. ``The closer one looked to whites in appearance,
the more deserving they were of rights and privileges of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this grew a caste system in which light skin and ``good
hair'' _ hair that was nearly straight _ were prized, and dark skin
and ``bad hair,'' often referred to as ``nappy,'' were held in
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, Madame C.J. Walker capitalized on this apprehension and
became the first black American woman to become a self-made
millionaire, selling hot combs for hair-straightening. Other
companies followed suit, and so began the efforts of black people
to hot-comb, conk, process, jheri curl, relax and do anything else
just short of burning their tightly curled hair, or ``naps,'' into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century after the official end of slavery, many
attitudes about ``good'' and ``bad'' hair persist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Dorothy Reed, a television anchor in the San Francisco
Bay area, was suspended for wearing braids on the air, and she
subsequently switched to radio. In 1993, Barbara Cooper, an
American Airlines attendant, was suspended when she showed up for
work with her hair in cornrow braids. After a lawsuit, the airline
revised its policy and now permits braids drawn back in a bun.
</P>
<P>
   And last month in Raleigh, N.C., Michelle Barskile, 17, a
student at Garner High School, withdrew from a debutante ball after
its sponsor, the local chapter of a predominantly black sorority,
Alpha Kappa Alpha, required that she pin up her dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   The value placed on good hair among blacks themselves led Jill
Nelson, the author of ``Straight, No Chaser: How I Became a
Grown-Up Black Woman'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1997), to cut off
nearly all her hair 15 years ago. ``I was tired of people placing a
premium on something that doesn't matter, and I didn't want to get
more or less points because of the texture of my hair,'' she said.
Today she wears her hair longer, but still natural.
</P>
<P>
   The late-1990s trend for nappy hair styles has been compared to
the black power movement of the 1960s, when the Afro style was a
symbol of militancy or rebellion. But most women who wear natural
hair say politics is less important than personal style. A black
woman with natural hair is not necessarily making a political
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a time when you could make reasonable
assumptions about people's politics from their hair style,'' said
Ms. Nelson, who remembered having to wash her hair in Tide to get
an Angela Davis-esque Afro. ``But hair is increasingly becoming
depoliticized. Now it's more style than statement.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   According to Scurry, the stylist, women are seeing the wide
variety of different looks that can be created with natural hair.
``Before, people heard `natural hair' and thought `Afro,' and now
they're seeing you can corn-braid it, lock it, flat-twist it, twist
it up when it's wet and unravel it for a textured look when it's
dry,'' said Scurry, who was part of the team that gave John
Galliano and his models dreadlocks for a Paris runway show in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Natural styles like dreadlocks (today, ``locks'' is the
preferred term), braids (in which strands of hair are braided
together or synthetic hair is braided into real hair) and twists
(hair that is twisted from the root to the end) often take two to
eight hours to create in a salon, but they can last six weeks to
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The natural styles take less time than maintaining chemically
relaxed, or permed, hair, which must be treated every four to six
weeks (for $40 to $70 at a salon), styled every week ($25 to $50 at
a salon) and groomed every morning for 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a perm was just too difficult for me to manage,
timewise and financially,'' said Ngwah-Mbo Nkweti, 25, a licensed
practical nurse in New Jersey who is also studying political
science at Rutgers University. ``I got tired of pulling out the
curling irons every morning and worrying about my hair breaking
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nkweti wears her hair in braids that hang down her back.
``Now I can just get up and go, and my braids are stylish and very
versatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Shereece Holman, 28, an aspiring actress who used to work at a
manufacturing company, said, ``I could never have walked into my
old job with this hairdo.'' She wears an Afro weave, the '90s
version of the '60s style in which extensions are woven into the
hair, which is then allowed to grow out evenly all around. At
Afrigenix, a salon in Manhattan, the Afro weave, at $250, is the
most popular style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I got tired of my relaxer and my `bouncing and
behaving' weaves, I felt like I had to keep up that look in order
to fit in,'' Ms. Holman said. But after beginning a regime of
exercise and taking up a healthier diet, she decided it was time to
do away with the chemicals. ``Growing my perm out is part of a
holistic change I'm going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as some embrace nappy hairdos, they still have the power to
provoke strong reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayn Catto, 35, learned this three years ago when he decided to
lock his hair: He was initially ostracized by both whites and
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My white peers thought I was out of my mind, and my black
peers thought I was a disappointment and an embarrassment,'' said
Catto, who saw the new style as a way to prove to himself and
others that he didn't have to conform to succeed. ``Corporate
America will tolerate a yarmulke or even a turban, but the
Afrocentric hair styles freak people out. People are always waiting
to see if you're an angry black man.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearance can be a bigger issue in the workplace when you are a
television personality. A 20-year veteran of television journalism,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, wears her hair in twists
and braids off camera, but covers them with a wig while on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think American society is still very confused about this
type of hair,'' said the woman, toying with her cheek-length
twists. ``I think it's a distracting look on camera, and I don't
want my hair to be the only thing people focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the case of Farai Chideya, an ABC News
correspondent, who before joining the network let her bosses know
that the $300 silky dread look that she has done four times a year
is an immutable part of her appearance. ``I'm happy to be nappy,
and I'm lucky to have benefited from those who broke down
barriers,'' Ms. Chideya said. ``I would never have had the jobs
I've had, had things not gotten more relaxed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday, 4 p.m. Games
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (7-8) at EAGLES (3-12)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Giants _ 3 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Eagles _ 14.8 (Points per game)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Giants can clinch a playoff berth with a
victory, and losses by Arizona and Tampa Bay. A long shot, sure,
but strange things have happened before. The Eagles will play hard,
in part because of inspiration from wide receiver Irving Fryar, who
is retiring after the game. But a player on the Giants will be
inspired as well _ defensive end Michael Strahan. He leads the team
with 14 sacks and needs just half a sack for a career high. Watch
out, quarterback Koy Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-3
</P>
<P>
   RAMS (4-11) at 49ERS (11-4)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Rams _ 60 (Amp Lee's receptions)
</P>
<P>
   49ers _ 16 (Consecutive home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: One of the most incredible streaks in the NFL: the
49ers have not lost in 15 home games under coach Steve Mariucci.
But the 49ers could be vulnerable. Steve Young will probably play,
but his knee is no doubt still very sore from a bruising hit he
took last week against New England. And the 49ers' secondary is
still banged up _ there isn't a part of safety Tim McDonald's body
that isn't hurting.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 38-28
</P>
<P>
   CHARGERS (5-10) at CARDINALS (8-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Chargers _ 5 (Terrell Fletcher's touchdown runs, last 6 games)
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals _ 3 (Adrian Murrell's consecutive 1,000-yard seasons)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: So now come reports that Ryan Leaf, who has had one
of the worst seasons, on and off the field, of any rookie
quarterback this decade, has been showing up late to meetings and
sleeping through some of them. Players are beginning to doubt if he
will ever be a leader. That may be why coach June Jones decided to
start Craig Whelihan instead of Leaf, though Leaf will get
significant playing time. Arizona is fighting for its life because
a victory gets it into the playoffs. Who do you think will win this
one _ a hungry Jake Plummer, who just signed a new contract that
included a league-record $15 million signing bonus? Or a
sleepy-headed Leaf?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 40-21
</P>
<P>
   SEAHAWKS (8-7) at BRONCOS (13-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks _ 4-1 (Jon Kitna's record as starter)
</P>
<P>
   Broncos _ 2 (Consecutive losses)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: What's wrong with the Broncos? That's the question
Denver is being asked again and again, almost as much as it was
asked about going undefeated. What's wrong is that Mike Shanahan
teams don't do well in December _ the Broncos lost two straight
last year at this time, and under Shanahan the last four years they
are 6-8 in December. Denver lost its last two games on the road. At
Mile High Stadium this week, the losing will end. Denver has scored
at least 30 points in 12 of its last 14 games at home. The Broncos
are also 29-2 at home under Shanahan. Nothing like home cooking to
erase a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 38-14
</P>
<P>
   REDSKINS (6-9) at COWBOYS (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Redskins _ 4 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys _ 7-0 (Record vs. NFC East)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Redskins are one of the most curious teams in
the league. They have won six of their last eight games and five of
their last six. At one point, coach Norv Turner was fighting for
his job; now he has the team fighting for him. Since the Cowboys
have nothing to fight for in this game _ they are already in the
playoffs _ they lose by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 16-9
</P>
<P>
   Monday 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   STEELERS (7-8) at JAGUARS (10-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Steelers _ 1,046 (Jerome Bettis' rushing yards)
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars _ 20 of last 23 (Home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Jacksonville's crushing 50-10 loss to Minnesota came
on the same day the Jaguars won the AFC Central, a longtime goal.
The starter at quarterback against Pittsburgh is uncertain, but it
definitely won't be Mark Brunell, out with an ailing knee. There is
even some doubt _ albeit small _ about Brunell's return for the
first round of the playoffs. The way Pittsburgh's offense is
playing right now, the Jaguars don't need Brunell. The key to this
normally intense series is that the home team has won each of the
seven meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 21-14

YEAR-END REFLECTIONS ON SUCCESSES AND FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CASS PETERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime during the year, when I was intent on picking tomatoes
or trying to stay ahead of the weeds in the annual flower beds, the
mountain ash died.
</P>
<P>
   It had seemed healthy going into summer, fully leafed out and
looking sturdy on its spot above the foundation of an old ``bank
barn.'' The barn had burned to the ground decades ago, leaving a
partly collapsed stone wall holding back a mound of earth that had
been banked up to permit access to its upper level.
</P>
<P>
   The earthen mound was a scenic overlook for much of the farm,
and the ash tree was planted there more than a decade ago with the
idea that one day it would provide shade and something to lean
against while contemplating the scenery. It was ready to do that,
having reached a height of 20 feet, with a beautifully symmetrical
framework of branches.
</P>
<P>
   Borers, I decided, after dejectedly digging around the tree's
base. Ash trees are susceptible to the destructive insects, which
do their work out of the gardener's sight. Moths lay eggs at the
base of the trunk and larvae burrow into the wood, creating tunnels
that interrupt the flow of nutrients and weaken the tree. If the
larvae are numerous enough, or there are other stresses, the tree
can die.
</P>
<P>
   I might not have been able to destroy the borers, which requires
chemical weapons that I don't use, but I could have helped the tree
in other ways. Wrapping the lower trunk with strips of burlap would
have prevented some egg-laying. Watering the tree during the
summer's drought might have helped it survive. It seemed well
enough established not to make that necessary, but the borers
clearly sapped its ability to fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   So the ash becomes one of the year's disappointments, and a
particularly painful one.
</P>
<P>
   Every gardening season brings a mixed bag of successes and
failures. A stroll through the garden at year's end brings them
back to mind, like the monkshood that finally achieved the glory
envisioned when it was planted three years ago. Its stalks are
blackened now by frost, but to remember those lofty spires of blue
turban-like flowers is to yearn for it to be autumn again.
</P>
<P>
   But not too soon, because skipping ahead to autumn would mean
bypassing spring and the blooming mounds of cheddar pinks,
fortuitously planted in a sandy site that they love. Their
needle-fine blue-green foliage still looks good in December. Behind
them, the inelegantly named pigsqueak (Bergenia cordifolia) is not
as happy with its plot. Drought-tolerant it may be, but tolerance
is not the same as really liking it. So along with the reflections
comes a mental memo: Move the pigsqueak next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The German irises, too, need attention. They should have been
divided after blooming in late June, but I must have been
distracted by something else. The foxgloves, maybe, which were
putting on a spectacular show. The foxgloves' rosettes of foliage
are still green and healthy-looking, and I dare hope for a repeat
performance next year.
</P>
<P>
   But a good year for foxgloves means a cool and rainy spring,
which might not be so good for tomatoes. This year's struggled
early with blight, and were late to ripen. They righted themselves
when spring's rain turned to summer's drought, and developed the
deep flavor that home-grown tomatoes ought to have.
</P>
<P>
   So the tomatoes were flavorful, but at a price. Drought is not
good for the wild asters, jewelweed and goldenrod that decorate
autumn. The ridge behind the farm, usually blazing crimson, orange
and yellow through October, was somber this year. To conserve
moisture, many trees shed their foliage early, or the leaves simply
turned brown and clung despondently until a stiff wind stripped
them away.
</P>
<P>
   It is thus every year. A garden is ruled by the vagaries of
weather as much as by the gardener's ambition or lack of it. Each
year the combination of heat or cold, of moisture or drought, is
perfectly suited to one thing growing in the garden and perfectly
antagonistic to another. This assumes that the entire space has not
been given over to roses or columbines or some other single
species, in which case the season is likely to be an utter disaster
more often than it is a smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   My lavender this year bloomed as never before, and even now the
lower foliage shows no sign of the late-season mildew that forces
me to prune it back heavily each year to encourage new, clean
growth. It could not have felt more at home if I'd had troubadours
singing Provencal melodies to it.
</P>
<P>
   My Japanese primroses, however, slipped quietly into what I hope
is dormancy and not death. Even the perpetually damp spot where the
primroses are planted dried out this year.
</P>
<P>
   There were no catastrophic weather events of the sort that wreak
instant havoc _ no limb-shattering ice storms, no foliage-shredding
hailstorms, no residual hurricane rains that can turn a glorious
bed of zinnias into a patch of fungus-blackened sticks practically
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   For the lack of such disasters, I am grateful, and the year's
reprieve will leave me better able to be philosophical about them
when they happen next year.
</P>
<P>
   But I mourn the mountain ash. It was a fine tree, and I will
miss it.

RUSSIA AND BELARUS MOVE TOWARD ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The presidents of Russia and Belarus said Friday that
they intend to begin unifying their currencies and much of their
economies next year, an action stopping just short of a political
merger that would again extend Russian territory to the border of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a military or political union could occur later was
left unclear. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a fervent
proponent of merging his nation into Russia, said he now hoped that
the two countries would enter the next millennium as one.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials were cooler, with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov calling the agreement ``a declaration, not a treaty.'' The
accord itself specifies that Belarus and Russia would remain
``sovereign and equal members of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said he and Lukashenko had
``raised the issue of uniting our countries into a union state,''
and added, ``One can be proud of such work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its details, the announcement is a victory for
Lukashenko, a charismatic dictator who dreams of someday returning
both Belarus and Russia to socialism _ and, many say, of ruling
them both.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has sought to reunify the two impoverished countries
since he became president of Belarus in 1994. There was talk last
year of an agreement for full integration, but in the end only a
watered-down version was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has been headed off every time by pro-Western
officials in Yeltsin's government, such as the economic adviser
Anatoly Chubais, who saw Lukashenko as a threat to capitalist-style
reforms. U.S. officials have quietly opposed earlier attempts a
greater unity for fear that it would destabilize young democracies
in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais and his allies vanished with the collapse of those
reforms in August. The man now in power _ Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov _ was one of the leading advocates of unification with
Belarus in his previous job as Yeltsin's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was the man who shook hands on Friday's agreement, but
it is commonly assumed that Primakov played a substantial role in
achieving it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accord proposes that officials draft plans by next spring to
unify the Russian and Belarusian rubles, to enact identical customs
regulations, to agree on measures to protect domestic industries
from foreign competition and to standardize regulation of
monopolies such as electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among other plans, the nations also propose to standardize their
labor and securities laws and grant citizens equal access to
educational facilities. A new elected body would oversee these
steps.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the accord's fate would lie with the nations'
Parliaments and with voters, who would consider the measures in a
referendum next summer. Politically, however, those hurdles are
comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament is anxious to rebuild
the old Soviet empire, and the country's fall from superpower
status has brought a strong nationalistic streak to the surface
among many voters. That has only increased with the expansion of
NATO to Eastern Europe and with Russian resentments about its
economic tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus is even less of an obstacle to agreement. Lukashenko
installed his own handpicked Parliament and rewrote the
constitution in 1996 through a voter referendum which international
observers agree was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   A leading expert on Russia, Dimitri Simes, president of the
Nixon Center, in Washington, said in an interview Friday that some
form of integration between Russia and Belarus probably is
inevitable, because Russia has frequently ruled much of the country
in recent centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, however, that Friday's announcement was a
deliberate signal to other nations _ especially the United States _
that Russia can play a transforming role in international affairs.
``It's very difficult to visualize how a union of two paupers can
become strategically more a priority to the Russian leadership,
especially someone as pragmatic as Primakov,'' as opposed to
working with the United States and the IMF, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they do feel they're on their own, that they have
little to lose, one could see important political and strategic
advantages in this,'' Simes said. ``Politically, it would be very
popular if you want to demonstrate to the people that Russia is
still a serious power, and do it on the cheap. Internationally, the
notion that the Russian army, weak as it is, might be going to be
on the Polish border will get a lot of attention.'' 2
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman went out of his way Friday to stress that
nobody on the Russian side of the talks is considering merging the
two nations, armies or even their budgets. Still, the greatest
obstacle to economic unification may well come from Washington,
where both the White House and the International Monetary Fund may
view such a merger with intense skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department declined to comment on the agreement
Friday, the U.S. government has opposed most of which still fear
that Russia has designs on their territory. Friday's action,
limited though it is, is only likely to inflame that fear.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Belarus is barely the size of Kansas and rarely makes
headlines. But it occupies a crucial geographic spot in Europe,
squarely between western Russia and Poland. It was such a vicious
battleground between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War
II that fighting there killed one of every four citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is essentially a proxy for the
United States, which plays the dominant role in deciding how much
and whether to lend to troubled economies. The IMF is considering
whether to proceed with a multibillion-dollar bailout of the
Russian government which even Primakov's advisers see as crucial to
Russia's economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. influence will weigh heavily in that decision, the
IMF would be likely to question an economic merger with Belarus in
any case. By most measures, Belarus is more destitute and far less
interested in capitalist remedies to its problems than Russia, and
unification could saddle Russia's bankrupt government with the
problems of another 10 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third, more remote concern: that with a foot in the
Russian door, Lukashenko may employ his nationalistic charm to
become a serious political force and a powerful enemy of the west.
Asked Friday whether the proposed agreement would allow Lukashenko
to run for president of Russia, Yeltsin's spokesman said only that
the answer lay in the documents that were signed.

AS MORE READERS LISTEN, AUDIO BOOK RENTALS GROW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Texas, Calif., Pa., Wash., Colo., Ore., Mich., Md.)   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL BRICK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the East Coast, truck stops offer detective stories on tape
for drivers to rent at one stop and to return further up the road.
In Blair, Neb., the public library rents audio versions of best
sellers to commuters who want to listen while driving into Omaha.
In Austin, Texas, a retail store that specializes in audio book
rentals caters to joggers elevating their heart rates as they
circle the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, full-length audio books _ as distinct
from two-cassette abridged versions _ have grown in popularity, but
they are expensive, typically $120 for a 12-cassette unabridged
volume, and that has given rise to a new cottage industry: stores
that rent them out. All told, the rental industry takes in $33.5
million in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for renting, instead of buying is that most people
want to hear a book only once, and ``it's not the same appeal as
having a beautiful hardcover book on your shelf,'' said Katrin
Bandhauer, a spokeswoman for Books on Tape Inc., a Costa Mesa,
Calif., company that both rents and sells audio books through the
Internet and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Audio Publishers Association estimates the sales industry's
revenues at $2.1 billion, a number bloated by including self-help
cassettes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The rental industry is in rather a state of disarray, resembling
the early days of video rental, when thousands of stores with names
other than Blockbuster flourished. But unlike the early video
rental companies, the disparate audio rental groups all appeal to
distinct demographics. The Audio Publishers Association plans to
release its first study of the sundry rental markets in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the market comprises two companies that rent to truckers;
two major retail rental chains; three direct mail and Internet
companies that generate at least $1 million each in rental
revenues; two companies that rent audio books directly to
libraries, and about 60 independently operated retail rental stores
responsible for around $150,000 apiece in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1991, when Paul Rush opened his first Earful of
Books store in Austin, a third of the people who walked in the door
thought audio books were only for the blind or visually impaired,
he said. The chain now has eight stores, where customers pay $6 to
rent a 12-hour unabridged audio book for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a life style business,'' Rush said. ``People are looking
for ways to use their time. If you're stuck in traffic, how much
talk radio can one rational person listen to?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, traffic gave rise to the rental concept, which was first
successful with the ultimate commuters _ long-haul truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, John Rishell has been listening to audio
books while he hauls paper products for Milton Transportation of
Milton, Pa. Two companies, Audio Adventures of Boulder, Colo., and
Books in Motion of Spokane, Wash., maintain display racks of
mystery and adventure stories that truck drivers can rent at one
stop and return at another. Both employ Rishell to check their
display cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers are a very captive market for us because they're
on the long haul, they're tired, they're bored with the radio,''
said Don Gruidell, president of Audio Adventures, which also deals
with libraries.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Audio Adventures sold only its unabridged audio books
to libraries. Then Anne Keenan, a librarian in Blair, Neb., told a
salesman that patrons in her town of 6,860 had already heard all of
the books on the shelves, so no one was checking them out. Instead,
commuters were going to truck stops for new audio books. So, Ms.
Keenan arranged to pay $720 every six months for a supply of 80
audio books. Every 90 days, she exchanges around 40 books her
patrons have already heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in and ask, `All right, when are the new ones coming
in?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keenan's practice led to a separate business for Audio
Adventures' Landmark division, which now has similar agreements
with around 1,600 libraries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the founders of several rental businesses are former
traveling salesmen who figured that educated, upper-middle-income
commuters who spend hours a day in their cars must be as bored with
the radio as they were.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Black, founder of Blackstone Audiobooks in Ashland, Ore.,
said he caused three minor car crashes while trying to read and
drive simultaneously before a friend gave him the recorded copy of
George Orwell's ``1984.'' Listening to it inspired him to start his
business.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans jog more and drive more, it may appear there is a
stable future for the rental market. But there is one caveat: Audio
book customers tend to be readers who are pressed for time.
Customers who spend a lot of time in their cars but would not read
a book if they had the time are unlikely to rent audio books.
</P>
<P>
   ``To enjoy audio books you have to be literate by nature,'' said
Henry Trentman, president of Recorded Books Inc., of Prince
Frederick, Md., noting that some people have an attitude of,
``Reading wasn't any fun in school, so why should it be fun now?''
</P>
<P>
   That makes it unlike the home video market, which appealed to a
much broader audience, he said, because more people enjoy movies
and television.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the books on cassettes are growing. As the retail chains
Talking Book World, based in West Bloomfield, Mich., and Earful of
Books expand toward each other's turfs, new Internet and direct
mail companies continue to pop up across the country, and most
major publishing companies are releasing audio versions
concurrently with hardcover books.
</P>
<P>
   While changing technology may soon allow a cheaper way to sell
unabridged audio books, publishing companies are keeping watch on
the rental industry in acknowledgment that unabridged audio books
cost too much and, as Rush flatly said, ``Two-cassette abridgments
are dead.''

A WHITE HOUSE PARTY WITHOUT THE TRIMMINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 27)  
(DW) 
 By MARIAN BURROS  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first clue that the party would be different
was the invitation. Once engraved and formal, this year it was more
like a drugstore Christmas card. The cramped type invited ``you and
three members of your family'' to a ``Winter Holiday Festival'' to
be held on the South Lawn of the White House. The dress: casual
attire.
</P>
<P>
   The annual White House Christmas bash for the press corps on
Monday night became a mobbed jamboree, catering more to the
Nickelodeon set than to ``Meet the Press'' pundits.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which in happier days had seen several hundred
journalists with White House credentials (plus their bosses)
lavishly entertained in the state rooms, had been moved to a tent.
The cast of hundreds had become a cast of thousands. Surrounded by
children, many who had attended the affair in the past were
incensed, not to mention hungry: The once sumptuous buffet had been
reduced to cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster,'' said Mary McGrory, the longtime
political columnist for The Washington Post, as she surveyed the
crush of strangers. ``Look at these people. There are more of them
than journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The indignity of it all _ members of the press corps having to
share their White House with at least 4,000 others, most of whom
had never attended a news conference in their lives. ``It's
big-time payback time,'' echoed through the throng.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the White House insists that no snub was intended.
Hillary Clinton's press secretary, Marsha Berry, said a heavy
travel schedule and a shortage of time were the only reasons for
the change in format.
</P>
<P>
   But journalists are accustomed to reading symbolism into White
House gestures. If President Clinton did set out to wreak revenge,
he chose an effective way _ through demolishing their sense of
pampered exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting in lines and being herded past roped-off rooms,
the guests were hustled outside, in two groups, into a tent
designed for half their number. Within sight of the banquet table
with an elaborate gingerbread castle in the State Dining Room, the
crowd waited to be ushered outside. ``That's where they used to put
the food when they liked us,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the extravagant feast that once included roast beef
perfectly carved by White House butlers. Gone were the elegant
mousses and handsome tarts served with coffee in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, was an opportunity to mingle with the president and
first lady and have a picture taken with them. Mrs. Clinton did not
attend at all (she was laid up with a bad back) and the president
appeared for a few minutes to make a short speech.
</P>
<P>
   There were face painters, ribbon-tying demonstrations, singing
groups, a storyteller and a booth showing a film for children on
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much waiting,'' Chris Sesno, 11, said. His father, Frank
Sesno, Washington bureau chief of CNN, was more sympathetic. He
said he always had thought it was a terrible imposition to force
the president and first lady to smile in photographs with
journalists who are their avowed enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year particularly, I would think it was too much to
bear,'' he said. Bill Plante of CBS News put the best possible face
on the new jamboree format. ``There was entirely too much pushing
and shoving to get on the list,'' he said. ``This party will never
again be celebrated for its snob appeal, and I think that's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his prerogative, the president had the last word _ on
Monday night, at least. Speaking of the families crowding into this
year's party, he said, ``I hope this night is as much fun for them
as it has been for me seeing them.''

THE 13 IMPEACHMENT `MANAGERS' MUST LEARN AS THEY GO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Ill., Fla., Ohio, Ga., Tenn., Ind., Pa., S.C., Ark.,
Calif., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All 13 are lawyers, with legal degrees from
universities as diverse as Yale and Brigham Young. More than half
have worked as prosecutors, targeting people ranging from street
punks to soldiers, militia members to elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that breadth of knowledge and experience, the
Republican congressmen appointed as managers of President Clinton's
impeachment trial in the Senate have as many questions as answers
about the historic roles they are set to play.
</P>
<P>
   It is their job to argue and present the case for removing the
president from office, but they have yet to decide how best to do
that, in part because they are still dusting off the rules and
rummaging through history for relevant guideposts. The only Senate
trial of a president was 130 years ago, when President Andrew
Johnson was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much precedent,'' Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah,
one of the managers, said. ``I think we're all trying to figure it
out as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers, all from the group of 21 Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee who voted on Dec. 11 to send articles of
impeachment against Clinton to the full House, plan to return to
Washington from their home districts on Tuesday, a week before most
other lawmakers come back, for their first meeting to discuss trial
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with six of them over the last few days, it became
clear that if a trial does take place, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, would essentially be the lead
lawyer, and that each of the other 12 managers might focus on a
given witness or area of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I had Vernon Jordan, I'd have him all the way through,''
said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., referring to a close friend of
Clinton's who tried to help Monica Lewinsky find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, envisioned a similar allocation of
responsibilities, saying he expected that ``each of us will become
an expert on a given aspect of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have somebody who focuses on perjury and somebody who
focuses on obstruction of justice,'' Chabot added, referring to the
two articles of impeachment that were voted by the House last
Saturday. ``You may have one focus on the history of `high crimes
and misdemeanors,' what the historical basis of that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers said there would be outside lawyers helping them to
prepare the case, and that David Schippers, who served as chief
investigative counsel for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee,
would be among them. But they added that the congressmen themselves
would probably be the only members of the management team to make
oral remarks in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment managers, in addition to Hyde, Cannon, McCollum
and Chabot, are Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia, Ed Bryant of Tennessee,
Steve Buyer of Indiana, Charles Canady of Florida, George Gekas of
Pennsylvania, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, James Rogan of California and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.
of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   While the fact that all belong to the same political party
distinguishes this group of managers from the groups that
prosecuted the most recent judicial impeachment trials in the
Senate, those prosecutions were bipartisan from the start. Trial
managers usually comprise only House members who supported
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed said they were chosen from the pool of
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee because they expressed an
interest in serving. Like that pool, they are generally more
conservative than a random sampling of Republicans in the House,
particularly on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, a Republican political consultant,
characterized them as ``ideologically driven conservatives with a
legalistic background.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all white, all men and, as a group, they are relatively
new to Congress, reflecting the surge of conservative Republicans
in the House in the 1990s. Only four of the 13 _ Hyde,
Sensenbrenner, McCollum and Gekas _ have served in the House for
more than six years. Seven have served less than four.
</P>
<P>
   Two managers _ Rogan and Canady _ began their political careers
as Democrats, then switched parties. Four of them _ McCollum,
Buyer, Bryant and Graham _ have worked as military lawyers. And
three of them _ Barr, Bryant and Hutchinson _ are former U.S.
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, Sensenbrenner and Gekas participated in Senate trials of
impeached judges in the 1980s, but those cases were argued mainly
in front of small Senate committees. It is presumed that the
president's trial would be argued in its entirety before the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But because they are moving into unexplored territory, the trial
managers are still trying to determine such basic matters as the
procedure for calling witnesses and the proper way to divide tasks
among different members of the team. In some instances the rules
are fuzzy; in others, it is up to the Senate to tell the managers
how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that perhaps the most important decision they face
is how much direct testimony to present. The Judiciary Committee
itself did not call witnesses directly involved in the case,
relying instead on evidence gathered by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, as well as constitutional scholars and other legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The trial managers could choose not to call many witnesses and
to rely instead on the existing record of depositions and other
materials, as long as either the president's lawyers agreed or the
Senate ruled to admit that record as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The managers said they were cognizant of the limited public
appetite for a prolonged proceeding. ``We do not want to circus-ize
this, to coin a word,'' Gekas said.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon added that from a tactical perspective, it could be in
the managers' best interests to show the senators a succinct
itinerary. ``If we go in there with an eight-month prosecution plan
and witnesses they find offensive,'' he said, ``that will
strengthen the hand of those who don't want to deal with this and
want a censure.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the managers interviewed noted that one of the many
oddities of this process, which casts them as prosecuting attorneys
of sorts, is that a deal or plea bargain could be struck without
their consent, by a simple majority vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the managers, Hutchinson finds himself in a particularly
interesting situation that has prompted some Democrats to complain
that he should not be a manager. His brother, Tim, is a Republican
senator from Arkansas who will sit in judgment of the president,
should the case come to the point of a Senate vote on a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson said that this coincidence was only one of many
ways in which a Senate trial is exempt from the rules and norms of
a usual legal proceeding, and noted that three of the newly elected
senators who will act as jurors had already cast votes on
impeachment as members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has deliberately avoided talking with his
brother about the evidence against Clinton, and would continue to
do so when he sees his brother over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other things to talk about,'' Hutchinson
said. ``You can talk about the politics of it without talking about
the facts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the managers said they would be able to purge impeachment
from their minds until their first team meeting; all left town
after the impeachment vote carrying research materials on Senate
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said in a telephone interview that he planned to devote
some time in the coming days to reading ``Grand Inquest,'' a 1992
book about two Senate trials written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist of the Supreme Court, who would preside over Clinton's
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said he would also root for his wife, who is due to have
a child on Jan. 19, to push up the schedule. ``It would be a
blessing if this child came a bit early, like this year,'' Canady
said.

   LANGLEY, Va. _ The mostly empty parking lots, corridors and
offices were a concession to the holiday, but the operations center
of the nation's spying apparatus was fully staffed Friday except
for one worker who phoned in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the eyes and ears of the director,'' said Phillip
Glover, the senior duty officer, speaking of his boss, George
Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence. ``We are sort of the
watchdog, after hours, 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cities people spend holidays away from their families
because their jobs never stop _ police officers, firefighters,
hospital nurses and the like. Washington has these, too, but it
also has full-timers unique to a capital, like those who handle
foreign intelligence at the CIA and the domestic equivalent at the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Glover several television sets and clocks gave the times
at various places around the world. On his desk computer monitors
hummed quietly but secure telephones did not ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never say it's a slow day because there's always something
happening,'' Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence has been on a special alert since the bombings
earlier this year at two United States embassies in Africa, and
particular attention is being paid to trouble spots like Iraq and
Kosovo. The CIA also has a special interest in Osama bin Laden, the
suspected terrorist who recently denied any role in the embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small fraction of the employees were on the job Friday,
said Mark Mansfield, the CIA's deputy director of public affairs.
But he would not disclose the number of people who worked at the
agency's huge headquarters in Langley, a series of modern buildings
on a campuslike setting across the Potomac River from Washington in
the Virginia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   One working Friday was Wayne Myers, the duty officer of the
Foreign Broadcast Information Service, which is part of the
operations center and continuously monitors foreign news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Friday's priorities, he mentioned bin Laden, Iraq
and world opinion on the recent attacks on Iraq by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As Myers spoke, the information service, which is popularly
known by its acronyn Fibis and is widely available, reported on
optimistic local accounts on the health of two foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian newspaper Al-'Arab al-Yawn related that the
country's ambassador to the United States had said that King
Hussein, who has been treated for cancer in the United States, ``is
in excellent shape and will leave the hospital within the next two
days.''
</P>
<P>
   That came in at 12:14 p.m. Five minutes later, a report came in
from the Interfax news agency in Russia quoting the leader of
Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, as having said that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin ``is in excellent physical shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had heart bypass surgery two years ago and has been
hospitalized five times since then, most recently because of
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Glover noted that there had been recent reports in Russia that
Yeltsin was planning to make some trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Another broadcast service report came in. A leader of the
Palestinian militant group Hamas had been released from house
arrest and he used the occasion to denounce the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much have the world at this desk,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the cubicle of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency,
its officer, Carl Brennan, dealt with selecting subjects to be put
under the lens of U.S. spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what images were acquired, he answered: ``It's what's
interesting. You can assume that there's a lot of interest about
Iraq and also Serbia. Last week was very busy _ bomb damage in
Iraq. We are interested today in activity in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   The last reference was to a civil war in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's calmer now, thankfully,'' Brennan said. ``Last week
was not a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover and his colleagues were putting in just another long day
(they work 12 hours on and 12 hours off, three or four days a week)
as most of the nation unwrapped gifts, ate big dinners or watched
football games.
</P>
<P>
   No holiday at the CIA? Glover was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answered. ``We're here _ whenever.''  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Arctic air will continue to lessen its influence on the nation's
weather. The jet stream will blow more from the west to east across
the country allowing a mixture of polar and Pacific air masses to
dominate. Moisture will be limited east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of disturbances will move in tandem toward the Eastern
Seaboard. Low pressure will be induced off the Virginia coast as a
southern disturbance acts on an old front offshore. Clouds will
linger over much of the Southeast, but precipitation will be
confined to the immediate shore during the morning. The northern
disturbance will bring a cold front across the eastern Great Lakes
with scattered snow showers. In between, a slice of dry and
not-as-cold air will be found from the central Appalachians to the
New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Gulf States will sponsor dry and milder
weather. Readings will rise above seasonal levels in the western
Plains. The milder air will encourage thorough mixing of the lower
atmosphere near the Rockies. This will lead to blustery conditions
with fitful, powerful wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with a retreating polar air mass over the Middle
West will become active with clouds and patches of light snow in
the northern Plains. Snow will also fall mainly on the west slopes
of the northern Rockies. A potent disturbance will approach
southern Oregon causing heavy showers and more widespread mountain
snows into northern Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and warmer conditions are expected in the Southwest, but
high clouds will arrive later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Christmas Snow
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a fresh coating of white blanketed Buffalo, N.Y., as
a band of snow formed over upstream Lake Erie and hovered over the
city. Close to one foot of snow fell in a narrow strip on the
southeast side of the city. This marked the third time in the last
four years that significant snow fell in Buffalo on Christmas. Much
of Buffalo's snow occurs when cold winds crossing Lake Erie gather
moisture, causing clouds and snow to form over and downwind of the
lake. Despite the city's snowy reputation, records indicate that
only a little more than half of all Christmases in the city have
been white.

   MOSCOW _ The presidents of Russia and Belarus said Friday that
they intend to begin unifying their currencies and much of their
economies next year, an action stopping just short of a political
merger that would again extend Russian territory to the border of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a military or political union could occur later was
left unclear. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a fervent
proponent of merging his nation into Russia, said he now hoped that
the two countries would enter the next millennium as one.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials were cooler, with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov calling the agreement ``a declaration, not a treaty.'' The
accord itself specifies that Belarus and Russia would remain
``sovereign and equal members of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said he and Lukashenko had
``raised the issue of uniting our countries into a union state,''
and added, ``One can be proud of such work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its details, the announcement is a victory for
Lukashenko, a charismatic dictator who dreams of someday returning
both Belarus and Russia to socialism _ and, many say, of ruling
them both.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has sought to reunify the two impoverished countries
since he became president of Belarus in 1994. There was talk last
year of an agreement for full integration, but in the end only a
watered-down version was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has been headed off every time by pro-Western
officials in Yeltsin's government, such as the economic adviser
Anatoly Chubais, who saw Lukashenko as a threat to capitalist-style
reforms. U.S. officials have quietly opposed earlier attempts a
greater unity for fear that it would destabilize young democracies
in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais and his allies vanished with the collapse of those
reforms in August. The man now in power _ Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov _ was one of the leading advocates of unification with
Belarus in his previous job as Yeltsin's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was the man who shook hands on Friday's agreement, but
it is commonly assumed that Primakov played a substantial role in
achieving it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accord proposes that officials draft plans by next spring to
unify the Russian and Belarusian rubles, to enact identical customs
regulations, to agree on measures to protect domestic industries
from foreign competition and to standardize regulation of
monopolies such as electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among other plans, the nations also propose to standardize their
labor and securities laws and grant citizens equal access to
educational facilities. A new elected body would oversee these
steps.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the accord's fate would lie with the nations'
Parliaments and with voters, who would consider the measures in a
referendum next summer. Politically, however, those hurdles are
comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament is anxious to rebuild
the old Soviet empire, and the country's fall from superpower
status has brought a strong nationalistic streak to the surface
among many voters. That has only increased with the expansion of
NATO to Eastern Europe and with Russian resentments about its
economic tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus is even less of an obstacle to agreement. Lukashenko
installed his own handpicked Parliament and rewrote the
constitution in 1996 through a voter referendum which international
observers agree was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   A leading expert on Russia, Dimitri Simes, president of the
Nixon Center, in Washington, said in an interview Friday that some
form of integration between Russia and Belarus probably is
inevitable, because Russia has frequently ruled much of the country
in recent centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, however, that Friday's announcement was a
deliberate signal to other nations _ especially the United States _
that Russia can play a transforming role in international affairs.
``It's very difficult to visualize how a union of two paupers can
become strategically more a priority to the Russian leadership,
especially someone as pragmatic as Primakov,'' as opposed to
working with the United States and the IMF, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they do feel they're on their own, that they have
little to lose, one could see important political and strategic
advantages in this,'' Simes said. ``Politically, it would be very
popular if you want to demonstrate to the people that Russia is
still a serious power, and do it on the cheap. Internationally, the
notion that the Russian army, weak as it is, might be going to be
on the Polish border will get a lot of attention.'' 2
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman went out of his way Friday to stress that
nobody on the Russian side of the talks is considering merging the
two nations, armies or even their budgets. Still, the greatest
obstacle to economic unification may well come from Washington,
where both the White House and the International Monetary Fund may
view such a merger with intense skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the State Department declined to comment, the U.S.
government has opposed greater unity between Russia and Belarus, in
large part because most of the young democracies in Eastern Europe
continue to fear that Russia has designs on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Belarus is barely the size of Kansas and rarely makes
headlines. But it occupies a crucial geographic spot in Europe,
squarely between western Russia and Poland. It was such a vicious
battleground between Germany and the Soviet Union during World War
II that fighting there killed one of every four citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is essentially a proxy for the
United States, which plays the dominant role in deciding how much
and whether to lend to troubled economies. The IMF is considering
whether to proceed with a multibillion-dollar bailout of the
Russian government which even Primakov's advisers see as crucial to
Russia's economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. influence will weigh heavily in that decision, the
IMF would be likely to question an economic merger with Belarus in
any case. By most measures, Belarus is more destitute and far less
interested in capitalist remedies to its problems than Russia, and
unification could saddle Russia's bankrupt government with the
problems of another 10 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third, more remote concern: that with a foot in the
Russian door, Lukashenko may employ his nationalistic charm to
become a serious political force and a powerful enemy of the west.
Asked Friday whether the proposed agreement would allow Lukashenko
to run for president of Russia, Yeltsin's spokesman said only that
the answer lay in the documents that were signed.

FLORIDA SEEKS TO  CURB  WILDFIRES WITH CONTROLLED   BURNING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Faced with more long-range drought conditions in
Florida, state officials are seeking $35 million for an aggressive
controlled-burning program to prevent a repetition of last summer's
fires, which destroyed more than 500,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The state Agriculture Department, criticized by agriculture
groups and timber landowners for not being aggressive enough in
using controlled burning before last summer's fires, said it
planned to burn considerably more than the 2 million acres of
public and private land that were burned in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   State Agriculture Secretary Robert Crawford said the fires
``demonstrated that we must do more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never be able to eliminate wildfires, but we can
minimize their impact,'' said Crawford, who has asked the state
legislature for the money for more people and equipment to fight
fires.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed mandatory controlled burning in buffer zones
around towns and subdivisions, aided by state firefighting crews,
and is considering expanding the time to prohibit burning from one
hour before sunset to one hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   A public meeting is scheduled for Jan. 20 in Gainesville to
explain the program to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's actions follow a recent report by the governor's
Wildfire Response and Mitigation Review Committee, which said the
state must strengthen its authority to do more controlled burning
despite protests from some property owners who object to smoke
hanging over their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the state becomes more populated, people not familiar with
controlled burning don't like to smell smoke,'' said Jim Handley,
executive vice president of the Florida Cattlemen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled burning, in which fires are set to burn off highly
combustible brush in forested areas, eliminates fuels, enhances the
growth of desirable forages and improves rangeland, Handley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cattlemen and farmers want the state to ease its strict laws on
controlled burning. Handley was among critics who told Crawford
last summer that the fires could have been prevented with more
controlled burning.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that some controlled burning permits were
denied earlier this year, Earl Peterson, director of the Florida
Division of Forestry, said, ``I don't think it can be shown many
people were denied authorizations to burn to the effect it would
have made any appreciable difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of fires last summer, 2,300, caused an estimated $400
million in losses to timber and destroyed 300 homes. The cost of
fighting the fires was estimated at $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   More dry weather is forecast for the state for the next two
months.

UNDATED: Bay, 12-7. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday, 4 p.m. Games
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (7-8) at EAGLES (3-12)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Giants _ 3 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Eagles _ 14.8 (Points per game)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Giants can clinch a playoff berth with a
victory, and losses by Arizona and Tampa Bay. A long shot, sure,
but strange things have happened before. The Eagles will play hard,
in part because of inspiration from wide receiver Irving Fryar, who
is retiring after the game. But a player on the Giants will be
inspired as well _ defensive end Michael Strahan. He leads the team
with 14 sacks and needs just half a sack for a career high. Watch
out, quarterback Koy Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-3
</P>
<P>
   RAMS (4-11) at 49ERS (11-4)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Rams _ 60 (Amp Lee's receptions)
</P>
<P>
   49ers _ 16 (Consecutive home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: One of the most incredible streaks in the NFL: the
49ers have not lost in 15 home games under coach Steve Mariucci.
But the 49ers could be vulnerable. Steve Young will probably play,
but his knee is no doubt still very sore from a bruising hit he
took last week against New England. And the 49ers' secondary is
still banged up _ there isn't a part of safety Tim McDonald's body
that isn't hurting.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 38-28
</P>
<P>
   CHARGERS (5-10) at CARDINALS (8-7)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Chargers _ 5 (Terrell Fletcher's touchdown runs, last 6 games)
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals _ 3 (Adrian Murrell's consecutive 1,000-yard seasons)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: So now come reports that Ryan Leaf, who has had one
of the worst seasons, on and off the field, of any rookie
quarterback this decade, has been showing up late to meetings and
sleeping through some of them. Players are beginning to doubt if he
will ever be a leader. That may be why coach June Jones decided to
start Craig Whelihan instead of Leaf, though Leaf will get
significant playing time. Arizona is fighting for its life because
a victory gets it into the playoffs. Who do you think will win this
one _ a hungry Jake Plummer, who just signed a new contract that
included a league-record $15 million signing bonus? Or a
sleepy-headed Leaf?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 40-21
</P>
<P>
   SEAHAWKS (8-7) at BRONCOS (13-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks _ 4-1 (Jon Kitna's record as starter)
</P>
<P>
   Broncos _ 2 (Consecutive losses)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: What's wrong with the Broncos? That's the question
Denver is being asked again and again, almost as much as it was
asked about going undefeated. What's wrong is that Mike Shanahan
teams don't do well in December _ the Broncos lost two straight
last year at this time, and under Shanahan the last four years they
are 6-8 in December. Denver lost its last two games on the road. At
Mile High Stadium this week, the losing will end. Denver has scored
at least 30 points in 12 of its last 14 games at home. The Broncos
are also 29-2 at home under Shanahan. Nothing like home cooking to
erase a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 38-14
</P>
<P>
   REDSKINS (6-9) at COWBOYS (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Redskins _ 4 (Consecutive victories)
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys _ 7-0 (Record vs. NFC East)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: The Redskins are one of the most curious teams in
the league. They have won six of their last eight games and five of
their last six. At one point, coach Norv Turner was fighting for
his job; now he has the team fighting for him. Since the Cowboys
have nothing to fight for in this game _ they are already in the
playoffs _ they lose by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 16-9
</P>
<P>
   Monday 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   STEELERS (7-8) at JAGUARS (10-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats:
</P>
<P>
   Steelers _ 1,046 (Jerome Bettis' rushing yards)
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars _ 20 of last 23 (Home victories)
</P>
<P>
   Commentary: Jacksonville's crushing 50-10 loss to Minnesota came
on the same day the Jaguars won the AFC Central, a longtime goal.
The starter at quarterback against Pittsburgh is uncertain, but it
definitely won't be Mark Brunell, out with an ailing knee. There is
even some doubt _ albeit small _ about Brunell's return for the
first round of the playoffs. The way Pittsburgh's offense is
playing right now, the Jaguars don't need Brunell. The key to this
normally intense series is that the home team has won each of the
seven meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 21-14

`A CIVIL ACTION' _ BOOK AND LAWSUIT _ IS CHANGING THE WAY LAW IS
TAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Md., Mass., Wash.)  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The best-seller ``A Civil Action'' tells the true
story of a battle between a bold but flawed plaintiffs' lawyer
named Jan Schlichtmann and two big corporations over whether they
polluted the drinking water of Woburn, Mass. In the movie that is
opening in theaters now, John Travolta portrays Schlichtmann as, if
anything, bolder and more flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But in professor Lewis Grossman's class at American University's
law school here _ and at law schools across the country _
Schlichtmann is already a star, foibles and all.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Harr's 1995 book about the lawsuit over the leukemia
deaths of Woburn children is playing an extraordinary role in what
some legal educators describe as a movement to modernize the
training of lawyers in America. Across the country, ``A Civil
Action'' is required reading in courses in at least 50 law schools,
including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown and here at American
University, where it is read in some civil procedures classes, one
of the most important an aspiring lawyer will take.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of Harr's book illustrates how extensively
legal educators have been searching for ways to modify the
traditional method of teaching law, made famous in the 1973 movie
``The Paper Chase.'' For most of this century, ``case method'' has
dominated the training of lawyers. It requires students to read
scores of appeals court decisions _ and little else _ and then fend
off withering questions from professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Paper Chase' is dead,'' said Zygmunt Plater, a professor
at Boston College Law School who uses Harr's book in his courses.
``The old war-of-attrition-game-of-wits where the teacher was
saying `I'm smarter than anybody' was shown to be a foolish waste.
What you want to do is engage students actively and this book does
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of ``The Paper Chase,'' most students at law schools
across the country took only courses based on the traditional case
method and it was common for students to graduate from law school
without having ever seen a real legal pleading document, met a
client or learned much about the real-world workings of the legal
system other than through pronouncements of appeals courts
reprinted in their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The case method is still prevalent. But even the courses using
it now often include other approaches, such as the study of
documents from litigation. And by the time they graduate after
three years, most students have taken several courses experimenting
with new teaching methods. At graduation, many students have not
only seen legal documents, many have drafted them for real clients
in clinical courses. Proponents of the traditional method say it
teaches students to think like lawyers. But critics have said for
years that it left young lawyers with little appreciation of how to
deal with people who become entangled in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Harr's book, said Grossman, arrived just when legal educators
were developing an appetite for something like it. ``The top down,
principle-heavy way of teaching law was starting to crumble and
professors were starting to question whether it was working
anymore,'' he said. ``You can view this as a revolution in law
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of some traditional educators, law schools
recently have tried other new approaches, like computer simulations
of cases and role playing.
</P>
<P>
   Some law schools have even introduced classes on literature in
which students read books like Herman Melville's ``Billy Budd'' and
``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee and then discuss the legal
and ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``A Civil Action,'' some professors had used other books
about lawsuits. But few of those books had drawn anywhere near as
much attention in law schools as Harr's book. Some legal educators
say Harr's vivid portrait of the innards of a lawsuit is providing
a model of how to teach legal principles through narratives that
show students the effect of the law on people, like the anguished
Woburn families of ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' said Carrie Menkel-Meadow, a professor at Georgetown
University Law Center who uses the book in her classes, ``It is
putting flesh on the bones of what practicing law is all about: the
people in cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Harr also described the real-world complexities of lawyers'
motivations. Schlichtmann was portrayed as an ambitious lawyer who
wanted to profit handsomely by doing good works. Harr's narrative
dwells on the expensive Porsche Schlichtmann drove and the
exclusive restaurants he frequented.
</P>
<P>
   In Grossman's civil procedure class at American University's
Washington College of Law, the students referred to the
participants in the Woburn case by name, as if they knew them. They
giggled at the mention of some of the players in the legal drama.
</P>
<P>
   During the class, Grossman referred in detail to a series of
moves by Schlichtmann and his adversaries. Why, for example, he
asked his students, had Schlichtmann chosen the two corporate
defendants, W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods, to sue when there were
many industrial polluters in Woburn?
</P>
<P>
   A student raised his hand. ``Money. Money,'' he said. ``They had
deep pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   After class one student, Jackie Hershkowitz, said: ```A Civil
Action' shows the best and the worst of the legal profession,
Schlichtmann himself represents those two extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal educators, like Richard Hausler, a professor at the
University of Miami Law School for the last 51 years, say they
worry that the new teaching methods might turn out lawyers who do
not understand legal principles thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't have them go out and be sociologists and all that jazz
unless they have learned the fundamentals,'' Hausler said.
</P>
<P>
   At law schools from coast to coast, though, the fascination with
the Woburn case goes far beyond simply reading the book. Students
study original legal filings from the case. There are Internet
sites filled with the scientific evidence from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman and a colleague from the law school here, Robert
Vaughn, went to a federal document center near Boston to retrieve
scores of the original documents from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The two professors are now working on a legal textbook dealing
entirely with the Woburn case to be published by one of the major
law text publishers, Foundation Press. For the last two years, both
professors have been assigning the original legal documents as well
as Harr's book as required reading in courses on the rules of civil
law practice that they structure entirely around the Woburn case.
What is striking about this is that this class, in law schools, is
one of a handful of core courses.

 WASHINGTON: a handful of core courses. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Law schools hold conferences to discuss the case, which was
settled for $8 million from only one of the corporate defendants,
W.R. Grace, in 1986. Harr described some Woburn residents as
bitterly disappointed by the settlement. Beatrice had won a jury
verdict that it was not liable to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some law professors who ask students to read the book say they
otherwise teach their classes as usual. But some say it is a device
for an entirely new way of teaching. A professor at Seattle
University School of Law, Marilyn Berger, traveled to Massachusetts
and videotaped interviews with the judge and lawyers in the case.
She and other professors use the interviews to show students the
thinking of real lawyers confronted with the moral and legal issues
Harr's book brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert Percival at the University of Maryland School
of Law held a symposium last year that included a rare appearance
by Anne Anderson, the Woburn resident who lost a son to leukemia
and was described by Harr as the driving force behind the lawsuit.
At the meeting, Mrs. Anderson described Schlichtmann as ``slick.''
On a videotape that is now used in law school classes, she added:
``I think his motivation was not concerned so much with us as with
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann, who has spoken at more than two dozen law schools,
said in an interview that he has grown used to the sometimes harsh
assessment of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has accepted some of the criticism, saying the
case had changed his life and his approach to the law. His message
to law students, he said, is that the lessons of the Woburn case
should be used to reform the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Students, Schlichtmann said, are fascinated by the way the
Woburn litigation became a bruising legal battle. But Schlichtmann,
who is now 47, said he tells law students that such legal
conflagrations waste time and people. ``Woburn was a war, a
nine-year war,'' he said, ``and all wars, no matter how necessary,
are evil.''

<P>
   After flying more than half way around the world and skirting
storms, mountain ranges and hostile airspace, three veteran
balloonists aboard the ICO Global Challenge were forced to ditch
Friday in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Their landing at sea, 10 miles north of Kahuku Point, Oahu, in
the Hawaiian islands, marked the end of the most nearly successful
attempt by any balloonist to achieve the sport's last great goal _
a nonstop trip around the world. More than 20 attempts have been
made during the last two decades, and at least seven other balloons
currently await launching. While it did not set a distance record,
this flight had a notable success in crossing Asia from one end to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The big ICO Global Challenge and its sturdy and waterproof crew
capsule splashed down gently, and within minutes the three-man crew
was picked up by a Coast Guard team that included two helicopters,
an airplane and a cutter. There were no injuries, and the aeronauts
smiled and waved at onlookers when they arrived on land.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon's crew, Richard Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve
Fossett, chose to end their flight Friday after their meteorology
team in England told them that an impenetrable low-pressure trough
that was stalling them would continue to block the winds they had
hoped would carry them to America's west coast and beyond. The
balloon could have remained in the air for another week, but would
only have had to ditch in the open sea later, nowhere near land,
according to the team's operations center in England.
</P>
<P>
   Ditching was nothing new for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   All three men were forced down at sea in previous attempts at
setting distance records. In the most recent of these, Steve
Fossett, piloting his Solo Spirit last August, was blown down into
the Coral Sea in the South Pacific by a storm that ripped open his
balloon. Fossett was nearly killed but was rescued by a yacht that
providentially happened to be in the area. He had flown 14,232
miles from Mendoza, Argentina _ a distance that remains the world
record.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sea landing was piloted by Lindstrand, the most
experienced balloonist in the group. His company, Lindstrand
Balloons Ltd., built the ICO Global Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Until early Friday, the 160-foot-high balloon had been traveling
at 200 miles an hour and the crew had high hopes of defying the
odds and reaching the United States, crossing the Atlantic, and
completing its global circumnavigation north of the starting point,
in England, before New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The termination of the flight came as a bitter blow to the
balloonists and their supporters. In his last message from the
balloon capsule, Branson said, ``I'm sorry that it's now all over.
We raced across the Pacific in winds up to 200 miles an hour, but
ended up hitting a solid trough from one end to the other. It has
been like hitting up against a solid brick wall. All day and all
night we battled to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the balloon's fans around the world, Branson added:
``We are sorry to let you down. We've had a fascinating journey and
will now try to be back with our family and friends for the rest of
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the interest the balloon flight aroused was the
number of Internet connections made to the team's Web site. By
Thursday the site had received more than 40 million hits.
</P>
<P>
   Branson recognized years ago that one of the main obstacles to
long-distance ballooning is the closed airspace that bars balloon
flights over the some North African and Middle Eastern countries,
as well as Russia and parts of Asia, including China. To smooth the
way in recent years Branson's team has included protocol experts
who have brought diplomatic persuasion to bear on inhospitable
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But this has had only limited success. During his latest flight,
which began eight days ago at Marrakech, Morocco, Branson's team
was initially denied permission to fly over Libya. After Libya was
persuaded to let the balloon pass, it had to avoid storms over
Turkey, and then had to steer a difficult course avoiding Iraq,
Iran and Russia. Finally, after the balloon had already begun its
crossing of the Himalayas from Nepal to Tibet, China withdrew it
overflight permission and ordered the balloon to land at Lhasa,
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the balloon was past any place where it could safely
land, and China reluctantly gave permission to proceed. But on
Thursday the Beijing government announced that it would permit no
more balloon overflights. The ban brought protests from balloon
teams waiting to join the round-the-world race, including the Swiss
Breitling Orbiter 3, Britain's Cable and Wireless Balloon, and
America's J. Renee and Spirit of Peace balloons.
</P>
<P>
   China's refusal to grant overflight permissions may have ended
further round-the-world attempts in the northern hemisphere,
because China stands athwart virtually all usable jet stream winds.
However, three other balloon teams hope to circle the world next
July by flying routes confined to the southern hemisphere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ICO Global Challenge represented a high level of technology.
With a pressurized, heated crew capsule, it was easily capable of
cruising above 30,000 feet in jet-stream winds. Like all the latest
long-duration balloon types, it was a Rozier balloon _ a hybrid
using both helium gas and hot air for lift. The balloon could gain
extra lift, particularly during the cool of the night, by turning
on its big propane burners to warm the air in its hot-air
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon, which was estimated to cost $1 million, was
equipped with the latest satellite navigation and communication
systems and many technical devices for improving safety and
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to circle the globe in recent years have all used
balloons made by two rival British companies _ Lindstrand's company
and Cameron Balloons Ltd. These companies have jealously concealed
their technical secrets, including the cost of their long-distance
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Ballooning has been compared with yacht racing, in that it is
primarily a rich man's sport. Branson, who has flown or financed
many long flights, is the billionaire chairman of the Virgin Group
of Companies, which include Virgin Atlantic Airways. Fossett, a
millionaire commodities broker who lives in Beaver Creek, Colo.,
races ocean sailing yachts and dog sleds, and competes in swimming
and mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Ballooning is extremely dangerous. Since the first manned
balloon took to the air in 1783 hundreds of aeronauts have
disappeared or been killed, but attempts to achieve record
altitudes and distances have never flagged.

SHOOTING STOPS IN KOSOVO, BUT TRUCE IS FRAGILE

   GORNJA LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia _ Western efforts to rescue a
crumbling cease-fire in Kosovo province achieved modest success
Friday when U.S. diplomats persuaded ethnic Albanian rebel
commanders and Yugoslav Army officers to pull back some of their
forces from what had seemed certain combat.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in the worst fighting since a cease-fire was called
two months ago, government forces mounted a ferocious assault on a
rebel stronghold here. The rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting for independence for the Serbian province,
repelled the attack and foreign diplomats had predicted the
government would hit again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The shaky cease-fire _ and the difficult negotiations that
started only because the shooting stopped _ were both seriously
hurt by the fighting on Thursday. It was feared that should combat
resume here it would spread quickly throughout Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, who brokered Friday's arrangement, cautioned
that it was very fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone lets off a sniper bullet or a mortar round the
whole thing unravels, it is not a done deal yet,'' a senior monitor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the negotiations concluded late Friday, the
government was reinforcing troops in the area, Western officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the KLA rebels remained very confident. The
local rebel commander said he does not believe that yielding ground
to the government is necessary because he has the complete support
of ethnic Albanians, who make up the great majority of Kosovo's
population, and has the forces needed to defend his territory.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed combat could mean that the unarmed international
observers, who are in Kosovo to monitor the cease-fire and are
considered essential in creating a climate of stability, would be
in so much jeopardy that they would leave.
</P>
<P>
   A team of the observers came under fire near here Friday as
fighting continued sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the observer mission, the U.S. diplomat William
Walker, and European diplomats have said they will not put the
monitors between two military forces that insist on fighting.
</P>
<P>
   However, senior U.S. diplomats said Washington is insisting that
the observers will stay even if the danger increases substantially.
``Our position is that no one in Kosovo is going to make us leave
just by intimidating us. There is too much at stake there for
that,'' an American diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations that may have stopped the fighting here began
in earnest early Friday when a team of international monitors set
out for this village to talk to the rebel commander. Throughout the
day, other diplomats were talking by telephone to rebel leaders in
Kosovo and in Europe. In Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia,
Western diplomats were consulting with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Near the village, paramilitary police, draped with weapons,
ammunition and heavy coats, were packed around wood-burning stoves
dotted among their armored personnel carriers when the
international monitors' two Chevrolet Suburbans drove up to the
most forward of the government positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Suburbans, painted a bright orange to make them unmistakably
part of the observer mission, were marked with American flags.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the KLA commander in this region lay across
a valley left smooth and white by snow broken only by the tracks of
dogs, and leafless trees.
</P>
<P>
   The police were at the position to which government forces had
fallen back late Thursday after rebels repulsed their assault on
the headquarters. The attack, with some 40 tanks and armored
vehicles, violated the government's commitment not to initiate
actions against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A blue armored car, dripping icicles and frozen mud, was moved
from where it blocked the road and the orange Suburbans set out for
the rebel headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The scene around the headquarters gave evidence of why the
rebels are so defiant, both of the government and international
efforts to induce them to be more flexible in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   KLA fighters, who belong to a force that was best described as
ragtag a few months ago, Friday seemed organized, disciplined and
well armed. They had beaten back the Yugoslav Army and police on
Thursday and they were glorying in that.
</P>
<P>
   One small group of rebels carried a sniper rifle that can
penetrate armor from a mile away, a British army assault rifle and
a new rocket-propelled grenade launcher with Chinese-made rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the headquarters, the regional commander, a 27-year-old
ethnic Albanian of slight build wearing a U.S. Army camouflage
uniform, sat at a desk with two walkie-talkie radios and a
satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Commander Remi,'' he said. ``I command all our forces in
this area, including Pristina,'' the capital of Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem the least concerned that government forces were
less than two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready for anything, peace or war,'' he said blithely.
</P>
<P>
   International efforts to make a cease-fire hold are based on the
notion that both sides want peace enough that they are willing to
negotiate and give something up. But the rebel commander said he
saw no reason to give up anything.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he insisted, could not take his headquarters or
win the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stop them here and we will have our victory,'' he
said. ``We have the Albanians from Macedonia, and all of Albania,
and we have ourselves. We didn't start this war for it to last six
months, and then lose through negotiations. We started this war to
liberate our country, `` he said. ``We will win or we will turn to
dust.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top floor of the two-story house that is his
headquarters, the reasons for the government's eagerness to take
this village were evident.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles to the west the main road out of Kosovo is visible
behind a screen of bare trees. Rebels have bunkers and trenches
near the road and could attack civilian vehicles as well as
military supply convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Just a bit to the northwest, the town of Podujevo stands out
against a panorama of snow and thick fog. Rebels have fortified
positions less than one mile from the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander called these positions ``defensive'' and
they may well be intended only to keep government forces out of his
territory. But government officials consider them extremely
threatening and want them removed, even if this means by force.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute about rebel positions here is the kind of obstacle
to peace that is repeated in dozens of ways across Kosovo. Although
international monitors may have stopped renewed fighting in this
area for now, they were not optimistic that they will have the same
success everywhere.

PROFOUND ECONOMIC CHANGES SEEN WITH ADVENT OF EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It has all the trappings of a gold rush: the lure of
riches, the frisson of risk, the headlong dash to stake the claims.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, Europe's single currency, makes its debut in just a
week, creating a vast currency zone from the Arctic Circle to the
Mediterranean. And to listen to the most optimistic of those
seeking profit there, the currency's birth will unlock a mother
lode of wealth that has set American investment banks competing to
export more of Wall Street's ways to Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While these great expectations may be overblown, there is no
doubt that for investors and fund managers, the euro's arrival one
week from now will mean an unparalleled transformation. Trading in
11 separate currencies will disappear, creating a single financial
bloc with an economic output greater than that of the United
States. Many financial specialists forecast profound changes in the
way Continental European markets operate _ and increasing pressure
on Europeans to emulate the ways of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this wall of money waiting to come into the market,''
said Jeremy Isaacs, head of European equity business at the Lehman
Brothers office here. ``Do I think European investors are going to
become more like U.S. investors? The answer is: absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not as if Continental European countries have
been slouches in positioning themselves for the coming euro zone:
Think only of megamergers like DaimlerChrysler, the Deutsche Bank
takeover of Bankers Trust or the pharmaceutical fusion of Hoechst
and Rhone-Poulenc.
</P>
<P>
   And the world's economic spiral and low growth forecasts for
Europe as a whole have muted some of the more bullish voices
forecasting a euro bonanza. ``I don't think you are going to have a
revolution,'' Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to have an evolution,'' he said. ``The question
is when, not if.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and notes will not be introduced for two more years,
but all transactions between banks in the 11 participating
countries and all operations involving equities and bonds will be
denominated in euros starting next week. With only one currency in
play, European companies will increasingly be evaluated by equity
investors and fund managers across a broad field of competition
where pricing and performance are no longer disguised by national
currencies or local scales of importance.
</P>
<P>
   The euro zone ``redefines what is a blue chip,'' said David
Bowers, European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., arguing
that, for instance, a company regarded as a heavyweight in one of
the 11 countries would not necessarily make it into a euro index of
top companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 11 separate government bond markets will be
replaced by a single euro debt market in which the divergent yields
of the past will be replaced by far more subtle calculations of
razor-thin spreads between, say, euro-denominated bonds issued by
Italy and euro bonds issued by Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border acquisitions will be simplified by the euro, which
will eliminate currency risk within the zone because it will have
an immutable value against national currencies until they are
phased out altogether in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies in the 11 euro countries alone have around
$1 trillion invested in their own governments' bonds, according to
Crispin Southgate, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Pension funds have
a further $350 billion in the same bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Both those amounts are set to mushroom as fund managers look for
higher yields in the low-interest euro zone and strapped
governments place an ever-larger part of the burden for pension
provision on private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   These prospects have sharpened competition among the big
American investment banks that have their European headquarters
here and see themselves as best placed to deploy expertise won in
the United States. That has set alarm bells ringing for big
European institutions, which have been scrambling to acquire some
of the same skills _ and the same reach _ as the introduction of
the euro nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we have been seeing in the mergers in
European banking groups is European banks trying to get the
critical mass and the expertise to compete globally,'' said
Madeleine Hall, a European fund manager at Schroders.
</P>
<P>
   They have not always been successful. For all its size, the
giant UBS AG, born of Union Bank of Switzerland's merger with Swiss
Bank Corp., lost out badly in this year's meltdown of emerging and
speculative markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big European banks such as Paribas, Deutsche Bank,
ABN-Amro and Barclays are all hoping to translate strong local ties
and cultural affiliations into thriving business. ``These firms are
pretty powerful in their own markets,'' said Robert Morris, a
managing director at Barclay Capital. While American banks would
seek to expand corporate bond and other business in Europe, he
added, ``it doesn't mean to say that they are quickly going to
steal the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is particularly fierce in the creation of new
indices for bonds denominated in euros _ a dry-sounding business
redolent of number-crunching that will still play a central role
both in the evaluation of fund managers' performance in a changing
market-place and, more gradually, in the way businesses raise money
to finance their operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, American financial institutions including
Morgan Stanley Capital International, Salomon Smith Barney, Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Bear, Stearns and J.P. Morgan have devised
eurobond indices in anticipation of a new, performance driven
approach to investment in the 11 euro countries.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only Barclays among the European banks has devised
a similar index, and that one is narrowly based on government bond
performance. In the last 18 months, the overall number of
benchmarks has risen to 14 from two _ a proliferation some bankers
view as excessive. Such has been the rush to new indices that 1998
has become known as the year of ``the battle of the benchmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The institutions offering benchmarks are hoping not only for the
adoption of their indices as gauges for managers' and portfolios'
performance but also the business that comes with it. ``What
distinguishes one index provider from another is the reach of
services,'' said Richard Pagan of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new euro indices are now heavily weighted toward
government bonds because corporate-bond issuance, though it has
grown rapidly over the last year, is still only a fraction of the
U.S. level.
</P>
<P>
   Government bonds in Lehman Brothers' U.S. aggregate bond index,
for example, take up 47 percent of the index while corporate debt
accounts for 21 percent. The same bank's euro bond index is
composed of 67 percent government and 12 percent corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to Anant Patel, a managing director at Bear, Stearns,
the government bond market in the euro zone is currently worth some
2.25 trillion euros _ more than $2.6 trillion _ compared with a
corporate bond market now valued at some 690 billion euros, roughly
$800 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation among fund managers is that those proportions
will change radically as Continental European banks re-examine
corporate loans and companies wean themselves away from reliance on
banks for financing.
</P>
<P>
   At present, said Merrill Lynch's Southgate, 90 percent of
corporate financing in Continental Europe is provided by bank
loans, compared with 50 percent in the United States. By some
estimates, fewer than 10 percent of Continental Europe's 1,700
investment-grade companies _ many of them in Germany _ have issued
public debt. That is set to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``European banks are looking more closely at how much money they
make,'' said David Munves, credit market strategist at Lehman
Brothers. ``Corporate loans are coming under scrutiny, due to
shareholder value in general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major opportunity for new index providers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the likely shift toward corporate issuance is
the prospect of stepped-up activity by ratings agencies _ still an
unfamiliar concept to many European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eric de Bodard, managing director for corporate finance in
Europe at Moody's Investor Services, said the number of European
companies to which Moody's ratings had been assigned grew by 100 to
more than 300 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the signs point to at least as active a year'' in 1999, he
said. ``Investors are going to be looking for more yield and are
going to diversify their portfolios without foreign exchange
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Patel at Bear, Stearns, with the advent of a single
currency for financial transactions, the nature of portfolio
management will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally in Europe, the way in which portfolio managers
have been able to deliver performance is to take views on relative
currency performance and the performance of spread relationships
between markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the euro, though, ``the currency component
will disappear, which was one of the biggest components,'' while
interest rate spreads will shrivel. ``And now all of a sudden, you
ask the question: Where do I get value enhancement?''
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, will be ``a very new investment dynamic for
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks see their indices playing into a European transformation
whose precise course is still unclear and may, indeed, face many
regulatory hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Many fund managers are hoping, for instance, that a boom in
private pensions will introduce vast new sums to the market, as
happened in Britain, whose pension fund industry is bigger than all
of Continental Europe's combined.
</P>
<P>
   Against that, Continental pensions are a ticking political time
bomb. Many Europeans regard a comfortable state pension as an
inalienable birthright and are uncomfortable with the notion of a
private pension provision familiar to an increasing number of
Americans. Moreover, European private pension funds, like European
mutual funds, face regulatory restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Russia's meltdown has dampened appetites for
corporate bonds, particularly high-yield bonds. That has made some
assessments more cautious. Corporate bonds, said Bowers at Merrill
Lynch, will provide ``one of the most exciting challenges that the
euro will bring about.'' But this year's financial problems, he
said, ``have left people a little nervous about rushing into
this.''

   When Lyudmila Petrova of Russia developed a nosebleed during the

   When Jon Brown, a star distance runner from Britain, sees
spectacular times achieved in track and field, his first reaction
is not amazement, but suspicion. ``I don't like to say it, but you
see someone run a great time and you say he's on drugs,'' said
Brown, the British record-holder in the 10,000-meter run. Drug
testing is so inadequate and distrust so rampant, he said,
``speculation is out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Doping scandals have become so commonplace in international
sports that fewer and fewer people trust either the athletes or the
officials charged with guarding against cheating. Many athletes,
coaches, administrators and scientists say that these sports have
become so disfigured by doubts, anger and fatalism over the
question of cheating through drug use that a widespread cynicism
about sport's basic integrity has taken hold. It is a skepticism
deepened by the fact that no tests even exist to detect some of the
most potent drugs that athletes are suspected of using.
</P>
<P>
   This year has produced an unprecedented spate of doping
scandals. The world's best cycling team was disqualified from the
Tour de France. Five Chinese swimmers were suspended from the world
championships. Michelle Smith de Bruin, the swimmer and three-time
Olympic gold medalist from Ireland, was banned for tampering with a
urine sample meant for drug testing. Track and field stars Randy
Barnes and Uta Pippig were punished for drug cheating. And the
president of the Italian Olympic Committee resigned under fire for
failure to police drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these incidents have only contributed to a crisis of
confidence in international sports.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to say definitely how many of the world's top
athletes _ marathoners, swimmers, sprinters, cyclists, weight
lifters _ are using or have used drugs to improve their
performances. Olympic officials estimate the number at 10 percent,
while some veteran athletes put the figure at 30 percent or higher.
Among some athletes and others, there is the belief that the
problem is epidemic and that it is becoming increasingly difficult
to win without cheating.
</P>
<P>
   And so many people involved in international athletics say that
if the International Olympic Committee does not take decisive and
convincing action against drug cheating at a summit scheduled for
February, much may be jeopardized: spectator interest, the desire
of disillusioned athletes to continue competing, the continued
willingness of corporate sponsors to spend billions of dollars on
the Olympics and other sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for many of those involved in world-class athletics,
the current environment _ big money is being chased by athletes
with easy access to drugs combined with a wholesale disregard for
the capability and competence of the officials trying to police the
problem _ has raised a disturbing question. If results cannot be
trusted, has a central tenet of sports _ that its records are
legitimate history _ been irreparably damaged?
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's got to change or the Olympics won't be what they
are,'' said Amy Van Dyken of the United States, who won four gold
medals at the Atlanta Olympics. ``There's going to be warfare at
the pool and the track. People are going to become completely
bitter about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Digel, the president of the German track and field
association, has gone so far as to propose wiping clean all world
records in the sport at the end of 1999 and starting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to bulldoze it and start new; it's not working,''
Anne Marie Lauck of the United States, who finished 10th in the
women's Olympic marathon in Atlanta, said of the current
drug-testing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And so there exists a sense of grim urgency that the drug
problem be attacked now with the necessary resources or not be
attacked at all, said Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the Olympic
drug-testing lab at the University of California at Los Angeles and
is a member of the IOC's medical committee on doping. While he
remains optimistic, Catlin said, ``Sport as we now know it is
finished if nothing happens.''

<P>
   A Worsening Situation: Tests Can't Keep Pace With Drugs
</P>
<P>
   While cheating in sports through drug use has been a problem for
decades, it has become clear to many in Olympic sports that things
have got profoundly worse. Advancements in the sophistication of
certain performance-enhancing drugs, as well as an increasing
brazenness and cleverness on the part of athletes inclined to use
them, has left honest athletes and official drug monitors
struggling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous experts argue that the international effort to fight
drug use lacks comprehensive testing and uniform enforcement and is
short of research funding by tens of millions of dollars. This has
had the effect, athletes, coaches and drug experts say, of leaving
many athletes not only angry at each other, but also feeling
betrayed by those who are supposed to be policing their sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is difficult to win without cheating,'' said Arnold
Beckett, a British pharmacologist who was a member of the IOC's
medical commission for 25 years and who is now one of its harshest
critics. ``Anyone with a decent lab can use all the drugs they want
and never be caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, when no-notice, out-of-competition drug
testing began in earnest, most athletes were tested only during
competitions. Under those terms, according to athletes and
administrators, athletes learned to beat the system using
increasingly sophisticated gels, creams, patches and injections to
deliver drugs that were quickly flushed from the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the dumb get caught'' at competitions, said Dick Schultz,
executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Unannounced testing, where athletes answer a knock at the door
and are subjected to a urine sample, is considered the only
effective way to catch cheaters in this age of high-tech drug use.
However, only 10 of the 34 international sports federations under
the Olympic umbrella conduct such testing, said Dr. Arne Ljungqvist
of Sweden, a member of the IOC's medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply finding athletes for these tests can prove futile. If 150
athletes are chosen for random testing each month by the United
States Olympic Committee, about 50 cannot be found because of
address changes and other reasons, said Dr. Wade Exum, the head of
the USOC's doping program.
</P>
<P>
   But current testing, the experts say, suffers from an even more
elementary problem. Even when athletes are tested, scientists are
unable to tell synthetic versions of hormones from those that exist
naturally in the body. These include two substances that athletes
are suspected of using widely _ erythropoietin, or EPO, which is
used by athletes to increase oxygen-carrying capacity and was at
the center of the Tour de France scandal, and human growth hormone,
or hGH, which is used by athletes to increase explosive strength.
</P>
<P>
   Coogan, the American who finished 41st in the men's Olympic
marathon in Atlanta, said he was convinced that rampant EPO use had
factored significantly in the searing marathon times run in recent
years. From 1989 through 1993, there were 41 marathon performances
under 2 hours 10 minutes. As of early November, there were 52
sub-2:10 marathons this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you want to quit running,'' Coogan said.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, Coogan and others said, the lack of adequate testing
for EPO and hGH produces a kind of destructive uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambiguity can also prevent possibly innocent athletes from
effectively clearing their names of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner, who won three gold medals
at the 1988 Summer Olympics and set world records that year at 100
and 200 meters, was widely suspected of using performance-enhancing
drugs because of the dramatic improvements in her times and her
muscularity. She was publicly accused by another athlete of using
hGH, but Griffith Joyner denied ever using banned substances, and
she never failed a drug test. Because no test exists for hGH,
however, the skepticism never went away.
</P>
<P>
   When she died in September of suffocation related to an
epileptic seizure, questions were renewed about the legitimacy of
her performances. A more comprehensive drug-testing system could
have caught her or cleared her name for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sure that most athletes are clean, but there is no
scientific proof that they are clean,'' said Dr. Patrick Schamasch,
a French surgeon who is medical director of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   In another troubling episode, the president of the Italian
Olympic Committee, Mario Pescante, resigned last September over
allegations that players in Italy's soccer league were rarely
tested for steroids and that positive tests were covered up and
documents were destroyed. Rome's drug-testing lab also was
suspended for three months by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Sandro Donati, a researcher and former coach who heads the
scientific center of the Italian Olympic Committee, later charged
that in the mid-1980s, the Rome lab was used to make sure that
steroid levels of Italian track and field stars and weight lifters
were kept below punishable limits. He said that Primo Nebiolo, an
Italian who is now president of track and field's world governing
body, knew of the manipulation, which Nebiolo vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   Donati, who has been working with prosecutors and the police,
has estimated that as many as 700 doctors in Italy are aiding
athletes in their doping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very bad history, but I am afraid in many
other countries the situation is similar,'' Donati said in an
interview. ``This is the history of modern sport. But this is not
sport. This is another thing, like gladiators.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the experts assert, some current drug tests have the
unintended effect of encouraging cheating.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in sports such as cycling and cross-country
skiing, athletes can be suspended if they have a hematocrit, or
percentage of red blood cells in whole blood, above 50 percent. But
since the average person has a hematocrit level of 38 to 42,
considerable boosting with a drug like EPO is possible with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set a speed limit of 50, everyone is going to rise to
49,'' Catlin said. ``That, to me, promotes doping.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, two elite German swimmers, Chris-Carol Bremer and
Mark Warnecke, said that the use of EPO and testosterone was
widespread in their sport and that doctors easily kept hormone
levels below limits considered to be cheating.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash of protest and denial followed, and a disappointed
Bremer, a bronze medalist at the 1994 world championships, told
German reporters: ``Nothing will change in my active career. This
will go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   This thick sense of suspicion engulfed the U.S. track and field
championships last summer in New Orleans, where Jon Drummond, one
of the world's top 100-meter sprinters, strained a groin muscle
during a preliminary round of the 100 meters. Another sprinter at
the event, Jeff Laynes, made an oblique reference to doping,
telling Drummond, ``That's what you get for taking that stuff,''
and insinuating that Drummond had used drugs for an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond, who has never failed a drug test and has been an
outspoken anti-drug advocate, confronted Laynes, told him the
unfounded remarks were destructive and even invited Laynes to live
with him to check on his training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of stuff has got to stop,'' Drummond said. ``It's
killing our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, he claims it has killed something essential
inside himself _ his desire to do his best. He thinks that the
faster he runs, the more people will suspect him of using
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind, there's the fear of breaking the world
record and everybody saying I'm dirty,'' Drummond said. ``I'm
afraid to be successful because I don't want to be considered a bad
person.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A Flawed System: Wrong Athletes May Be Caught
</P>
<P>
   The full reach of the confusion and despair provoked by
widespread drug cheating, and the badly flawed policing of it, can
be appreciated in the person of Doriane Lambelet Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, once a world-class runner and now a lawyer, has lost
races to runners she thought benefited from drugs, most memorably
an 800-meter race in Munich 15 years ago when Jarmila Kratochvilova
of Czechoslovakia set a world record of 1 minute 53.28 seconds that
has not been approached since. Coleman has prosecuted cases against
athletes charged with drug use. And she has defended athletes she
thinks were falsely accused of drug use as a result of flawed
testing.
</P>
<P>
   So now, she says, she talks with her two young sons and wonders
whether she should discourage them from even trying to compete at
the top levels of international sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have despair on both sides,'' Coleman said. ``As an athlete,
there's so much cheating, you wonder why you're competing. On the
other side, the system to protect the innocent is devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Coleman, while able to produce no proof, said she used
to be told before races by officials that she would be selected for
``random'' tests afterward. She said she believed she was given the
unusual notification because officials knew she would pass the test
and thus avoid embarrassment for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sacrificed me and the others who were clean, rendered
moot our work and our dreams, all for the greater glory of the
enterprise,'' said Coleman, who is now a professor of law at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said her lack of faith in the ability of international
sports organizations to fairly and effectively limit cheating had
not lessened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the near certainty among athletes and sports officials
that large percentages of athletes are using performance-enhancing
drugs, only two athletes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta were
caught using something as serious as steroids. Further, the IOC has
allowed coaches implicated in drug scandals in East Germany to
coach in Australia and China without sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   And when athletes are caught, Coleman wonders whether they are
often the wrong athletes. The test to detect the use of
testosterone, the male sex hormone, as a steroid has encountered
strong challenges because of its imprecision. Female athletes such
as Pippig, the German marathoner, and the American star Mary Slaney
have contended that the test is not reliable for women because of
hormonal fluctuations caused by menstruation, birth control pills
and the drinking of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman represents Slaney, whose disputed drug test at the 1996
Olympic trials remains unresolved two years later. Track and
field's world governing body will not say exactly what substance it
believes Slaney took, Coleman said. Meanwhile, her reputation has
suffered, as has that of Dennis Mitchell, the three-time Olympic
sprint medalist who was suspended for a similarly suspicious test
last summer by track's world governing body, only to be cleared
this month by the American track and field federation.
</P>
<P>
   While Coleman said she wanted a strong drug-testing program, she
feared that a new rush to catch athletes might result in a sort of
athletic McCarthyism. She would not encourage her two young sons to
become Olympic athletes, Coleman said, because ``I don't want their
dreams crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Changing Landscape: Fuzziness on What Is Really Cheating
</P>
<P>
   The praise heaped on Mark McGwire for his 70-home run season,
despite his admission that he used a nutritional supplement banned
in many other sports, has created further disgruntlement and anger
among athletes in international sport who are struggling with the
increasingly thorny question of just what constitutes cheating.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire has been hailed as a savior for baseball, Randy
Barnes, the 1996 Olympic shot put champion, faces a lifetime ban
for using the same supplement, androstenedione, known as andro.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' case has forced athletes and officials to examine the
blurred line along which performance enhancement becomes cheating.
Should an over-the-counter supplement like andro, legally available
to the public, be considered doping? A banana enhances performance
because it contains potassium, said Greg Duplantis, who is Barnes'
lawyer. Is eating a banana cheating? he asked. Or lifting weights?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Alice in Wonderland,'' said Duplantis, who was an
alternate on the 1996 Olympic team as a pole vaulter. ``Cheating is
what they say it is today. If baseball bans andro, is McGwire now a
cheater?''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's anti-doping conference in February will attempt to
establish an independent agency to direct a worldwide control
effort, a uniform drug policy for international sports and a
research fund to develop a more comprehensive testing program. The
White House has promised $1 million to aid in drug research, and
the IOC may augment that with $25 million from television rights
fees, although scientists believe a fund two to four times that
amount is needed if the drug police are to draw even with the
cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cries for doping reform, a few voices for the
legalization of performance-enhancing drugs have made themselves
heard. The rationale for accepting doping is that the current
system is unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about what is fair and doable when it comes to drug
testing will only grow more complex for the next generation of
athletes. Officials with the IOC have already said that they are
struggling to confront the testing presented by a dangerous form of
synthetic blood they believe is being used by cyclists and
cross-country skiers. And ethicists and experts are wondering about
the future of sports in a world in which genetic engineering is
increasingly commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, certain experts suspect that the eventual acceptance of
doping may be inevitable because of disillusionment, the inability
to spend infinite dollars on the current system and the
increasingly sophisticated development and use of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread public use of such nutritional supplements as
androstenedione and creatine, and the therapeutic use of
testosterone to boost sex drive and prevent wasting in AIDS
patients, the punishment of athletes for using the same substances
will eventually come to be viewed as selective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm predicting that within 10 or 20 years, they will have no
choice but to accept what I call soft doping,'' said John Hoberman,
a professor at the University of Texas and author of the book
``Mortal Engines: The Science of Performance and the Dehumanization
of Sport.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that is not something the IOC is likely to
consider. And so frustration and ambivalence will most likely
prevail for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the guilty and innocent are presumed guilty,'' said Rich
Young, general counsel for the United States swimming federation.
``If you do something extraordinary, you're really guilty.''

 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All 13 are lawyers, with legal degrees from
universities as diverse as Yale and Brigham Young. More than half
have worked as prosecutors, targeting people ranging from street
punks to soldiers, militia members to elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that breadth of knowledge and experience, the
Republican congressmen appointed as managers of President Clinton's
impeachment trial in the Senate have as many questions as answers
about the historic roles they are set to play.
</P>
<P>
   It is their job to argue and present the case for removing the
president from office, but they have yet to decide how best to do
that, in part because they are still dusting off the rules and
rummaging through history for relevant guideposts. The only Senate
trial of a president was 130 years ago, when President Andrew
Johnson was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much precedent,'' Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah,
one of the managers, said. ``I think we're all trying to figure it
out as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers, all from the group of 21 Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee who voted on Dec. 11 to send articles of
impeachment against Clinton to the full House, plan to return to
Washington from their home districts on Tuesday, a week before most
other lawmakers come back, for their first meeting to discuss trial
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with six of them over the last few days, it became
clear that if a trial does take place, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, would essentially be the lead
lawyer, and that each of the other 12 managers might focus on a
given witness or area of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I had Vernon Jordan, I'd have him all the way through,''
said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., referring to a close friend of
Clinton's who tried to help Monica Lewinsky find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, envisioned a similar allocation of
responsibilities, saying he expected that ``each of us will become
an expert on a given aspect of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have somebody who focuses on perjury and somebody who
focuses on obstruction of justice,'' Chabot added, referring to the
two articles of impeachment that were voted by the House last
Saturday. ``You may have one focus on the history of `high crimes
and misdemeanors,' what the historical basis of that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers said there would be outside lawyers helping them to
prepare the case, and that David Schippers, who served as chief
investigative counsel for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee,
would be among them. But they added that the congressmen themselves
would probably be the only members of the management team to make
oral remarks in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment managers, in addition to Hyde, Cannon, McCollum
and Chabot, are Reps. Bob Barr of Georgia, Ed Bryant of Tennessee,
Steve Buyer of Indiana, Charles Canady of Florida, George Gekas of
Pennsylvania, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, James Rogan of California and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.
of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   While the fact that all belong to the same political party
distinguishes this group of managers from the groups that
prosecuted the most recent judicial impeachment trials in the
Senate, those prosecutions were bipartisan from the start. Trial
managers usually comprise only House members who supported
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed said they were chosen from the pool of
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee because they expressed an
interest in serving. Like that pool, they are generally more
conservative than a random sampling of Republicans in the House,
particularly on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, a Republican political consultant,
characterized them as ``ideologically driven conservatives with a
legalistic background.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all white, all men and, as a group, they are relatively
new to Congress, reflecting the surge of conservative Republicans
in the House in the 1990s. Only four of the 13 _ Hyde,
Sensenbrenner, McCollum and Gekas _ have served in the House for
more than six years. Seven have served less than four.
</P>
<P>
   Two managers _ Rogan and Canady _ began their political careers
as Democrats, then switched parties. Four of them _ McCollum,
Buyer, Bryant and Graham _ have worked as military lawyers. And
three of them _ Barr, Bryant and Hutchinson _ are former U.S.
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, Sensenbrenner and Gekas participated in Senate trials of
impeached judges in the 1980s, but those cases were argued mainly
in front of small Senate committees. It is presumed that the
president's trial would be argued in its entirety before the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But because they are moving into unexplored territory, the trial
managers are still trying to determine such basic matters as the
procedure for calling witnesses and the proper way to divide tasks
among different members of the team. In some instances the rules
are fuzzy; in others, it is up to the Senate to tell the managers
how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that perhaps the most important decision they face
is how much direct testimony to present. The Judiciary Committee
itself did not call witnesses directly involved in the case,
relying instead on evidence gathered by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, as well as constitutional scholars and other legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The trial managers could choose not to call many witnesses and
to rely instead on the existing record of depositions and other
materials, as long as either the president's lawyers agreed or the
Senate ruled to admit that record as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The managers said they were cognizant of the limited public
appetite for a prolonged proceeding. ``We do not want to circus-ize
this, to coin a word,'' Gekas said.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon added that from a tactical perspective, it could be in
the managers' best interests to show the senators a succinct
itinerary. ``If we go in there with an eight-month prosecution plan
and witnesses they find offensive,'' he said, ``that will
strengthen the hand of those who don't want to deal with this and
want a censure.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the managers interviewed noted that one of the many
oddities of this process, which casts them as prosecuting attorneys
of sorts, is that a deal or plea bargain could be struck without
their consent, by a simple majority vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the managers, Hutchinson finds himself in a particularly
interesting situation that has prompted some Democrats to complain
that he should not be a manager. His brother, Tim, is a Republican
senator from Arkansas who will sit in judgment of the president,
should the case come to the point of a Senate vote on a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson said that this coincidence was only one of many
ways in which a Senate trial is exempt from the rules and norms of
a usual legal proceeding, and noted that three of the newly elected
senators who will act as jurors had already cast votes on
impeachment as members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has deliberately avoided talking with his
brother about the evidence against Clinton, and would continue to
do so when he sees his brother over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other things to talk about,'' Hutchinson
said. ``You can talk about the politics of it without talking about
the facts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the managers said they would be able to purge impeachment
from their minds until their first team meeting; all left town
after the impeachment vote carrying research materials on Senate
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said in a telephone interview that he planned to devote
some time in the coming days to reading ``Grand Inquest,'' a 1992
book about two Senate trials written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist of the Supreme Court, who would preside over Clinton's
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said he would also root for his wife, who is due to have
a child on Jan. 19, to push up the schedule. ``It would be a
blessing if this child came a bit early, like this year,'' Canady
said.

   LOS ANGELES _ The shower for the older boys is available after
dinner, and those few minutes under the falling water are William
Foster's favorite part of the long day.
</P>
<P>
   For when he gets out, dries himself and strikes a muscle-man
pose or two in front of the steamed-up mirror, William, a skinny
14-year-old, knows he can escape into sleep soon. Lights out at
10:30.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then his dreams will carry him away from where he lives
with his mother, his little brother and sister, and on some nights
as many as 38 other children and their families in an emergency
homeless shelter on Skid Row.
</P>
<P>
   Skid Row is a bottom-of-the-barrel district on the edge of
downtown to which Los Angeles has consigned its derelicts and
homeless and many of the agencies that serve them. Here depression,
despair and wasted human potential flow through the streets. It is
a place no child should have to walk through, let alone live in.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many shelters in Los Angeles where a family can
stay together; even fewer will take in a boy like William, over age
13. On a typical night there might be 20 or 30 children among the
crowds of single men and women at the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come here,'' William said recently. ``I
thought there would be just a bunch of dirty, nasty adults. But my
mom said it wouldn't be so bad. She said there would be a lot of
other kids around. She was right. There are a lot of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hundreds who stay at Union Rescue every night are
single adult men and women. But last year, Union Rescue provided
beds for 10 to 12 children and their families, even though on
crowded nights some families had to sleep on mats. This year the
mission opened an expanded space for families.
</P>
<P>
   William's 16-year-old brother, Steve, lasted one night at the
mission before finding a spot on a friend's couch, a two-hour bus
ride from the rest of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the neighborhood was hell on earth,'' William
recalled. ``Then he left.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeless families are typically headed by a single woman, like
William's 37-year-old mother, Janice.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Foster's nightmare of being homeless was set in motion last
winter when she lost her welfare check and papers that she needed
to stay on welfare. She quickly began to fall behind her rent, and
in July she was evicted.
</P>
<P>
   At different times, various members of the family lived with
friends or relatives, and for a few days they were all together in
a hotel, but by August, Mrs. Foster said, she had no choice but
Union Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any time William leaves the security of the mission,
holding on tightly to his little brother, Deon, 3, and his sister,
Shayla, 4, and walking beside his mother, he can see men smoking
crack in dank doorways or using other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has to step around people sleeping in boxes or
under sheets of plastic, ``like the stuff they throw over dead
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day he smelled something funny. He looked around and
saw that it was human waste splashed on a wall. He hurried Deon
along and told him not to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's my responsibility to protect my little brother and
sister,'' he said. ``I feel I got to be a man.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not a man. He spent most of the other day playing with
a green yo-yo, trying to master a ``cat's cradle'' and talking
about how tough he was and how Skid Row did not scare him, unless
it was dark, and then ``I'd probably be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 151 programs in Los Angeles County that serve homeless
families, 69 do not accept boys over 13, and 39 have even lower age
cutoffs, said Ruth Schwartz, executive director of the nonprofit
Shelter Partnership. Ms. Schwartz said that the county had 4,890
beds for families but that on any given night there were about
12,400 homeless family members, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of children on Skid Row has raised some eyebrows in
social service agencies, and some criticism of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women and children are being sent from all over Los Angeles to
Skid Row, which is unconscionable,'' said Alice Callaghan, who runs
an after-school program in the Skid Row neighborhood. ``If you're
going to serve homeless women and children, why would anyone put
those services in Skid Row?''
</P>
<P>
   And for years, any time a mother and her children showed up on
the row, looking for a place to stay, social service workers moved
quickly to relocate them as far away as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The row, everyone agreed, was no place for children.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run Union Rescue agree. Skid Row is an awful
place, they say. But that is the point. What better place is there
for a mission to be to help relieve suffering, what better place
for a mission to open its doors to say, ``Welcome, brothers and
sisters and your children,'' even if they are 14-year-old boys?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not created this need by opening the family shelter,''
said Marty Annette Hill, superintendent of the mission's women and
family ministries. ``The need was there and we are simply
responding to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women and children stay at the mission only for a
week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, William's friend David, 13, moved out of the
mission with his family to a hotel for the homeless. William felt
good for David and thought to himself, ``I hope it's my turn
next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids accept being homeless,'' William said. ``They
act like it's no big deal. Not me. I don't feel I'll be living this
lifestyle much longer. It's too negative.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as he stays at the mission, William and his family
can spend their mornings in the new ``Mommy and Me'' room on the
fourth floor. It is a large playroom, full of toys, stuffed animals
and the sound of gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know you're in Skid Row when you're in here,'' said
Bridget Wilson, a supervisor at the mission. ``You don't know the
devastation right outside these walls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the room is open for only a few hours each day. The rest of
the day, William and his family wander the streets, walking a dozen
blocks to the library or a fast-food restaurant. They do not go to
the nearby park, a gathering place for drug dealers and their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   William does not go to school, though he says he wants to be a
marine biologist. When the family goes to the library, he tends to
play computer games rather than read.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes William catches a bus and returns to the family's old
neighborhood in the Van Nuys section to spend a night or two with
his aunt. He tries to recapture his old life, to pretend Skid Row
is just a dream. He plays basketball or hits the streets to sell
candy and coloring books as part of an anti-gang youth program.
</P>
<P>
   But he returns to the mission to be with his mother and his
little brother and sister, not just to protect them but to be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His mother stepped outside to talk with a friend in front of the
mission recently and William did not know where she was. He
panicked and almost cried when she walked back a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   At night, after a long day of homelessness, William's mother
listens to her children sleep on bunk beds in a room they share
with other families. As she lies there in the dark, her mind is
flooded with if-onlys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I could, I would have done things differently,'' she
said. ``I would have saved more money, but really I didn't have any
money to save.''
</P>
<P>
   William listened quietly to his mother's if-onlys. He listened
to her say that she felt terrible, that she felt she had let her
children down and now the older ones were angry with her and that
was breaking her heart even more than being homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, she said, do not adjust well to change. He heard her
say that once she got back on her feet, she was going to get two
jobs and even though she might not have time to see her children as
much, at least they would have economic security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to dwell on what happened,'' William said when
his mother fell silent. ``I just want us to get a place. I just
want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, William and his family left Skid Row. With the help
of Beyond Shelter, an organization that provides vouchers for
homeless families to stay in hotels until they can be moved into
permanent housing, the Fosters moved into The Deluxe Inn, several
miles from the row.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Foster said she had to return to Skid Row soon. Some
of the missions, including Union Rescue, were giving away toys for
Christmas. ``It's going to be crowded down there,'' she said.

STORM SHELLACS SOUTH FOR THE HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Tenn., Miss., La., N.C., S.C., Ala.)  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first national storm of the winter covered
southeastern Virginia on Thursday with freezing rain that toppled
hundreds of utility poles and countless trees, bringing down miles
of power lines and depriving 240,000 residents of electricity and
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The same weather system that disrupted power through Virginia
also disrupted Christmas celebrations across the South. While power
was restored to 60,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee by
Christmas night, at least 156,000 remained without electricity in
Mississippi, 93,000 in Louisiana and 106,000 in North Carolina, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Virginia Power Co. said Friday that some power
had been restored but the entire process could take repair efforts
well into next week. Similar predictions were made by utility
officials in the other affected states.
</P>
<P>
   Although skies turned sunny in some parts of the South,
temperature remained low and some roads remained closed and icy.
</P>
<P>
   Slick conditions were blamed for many deaths in recent days,
including six in Alabama, six in Virginia and two in South
Carolina, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of wrecks,'' said a dispatcher at state police
headquarters in Richmond who refused to give his name. ``More in an
hour than we usually get in a day.'' The dispatcher also said that
many streets were still blocked by fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
   In Providence Forge, a small community east of Richmond, calls
to the volunteer rescue squad have increased sharply in the last
two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going crazy, answering calls,'' said George Pankey, a
volunteer, attributing the increased activity in large measure to
the storm. ``We're responding to everything in the book, from a
couple of heart attacks to a boy today who spilled some stuff on
himself and got burned. A lot of this is because of the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly ruined my Christmas, I can tell you that,'' said
Maj. Michael Nicely of the Gloucester County Sheriff's Office.
`'The power is down in most of the county, and operations are going
real slow because of all the ice. It's going to take some time,
maybe three or four days, before everything is back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The areas hardest hit by the storm were Richmond and counties to
the south and east. Dan Genest, the power company spokesman, said
that at the peak of the power failure, through Christmas Eve,
62,000 customers in Richmond had no power, 61,000 in Petersburg,
28,000 in Williamsburg and 26,000 in Gloucester, a rural district
on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the lack of electricity had prompted many
residents to seek shelter in municipal buildings and in hotels and
motels that had power.

THE JETS' PEPPER JOHNSON: AN ELDER STATESMAN WITH FEELINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.E.) (ART ADV: A photo of Pepper Johnson is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
1-888-603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the only linebacker still playing from that 1986 Giants
Super Bowl team. Indeed, he is the only current Jet who was with
Bill Parcells on both of his championship outfits.
</P>
<P>
   That, says the 34-year-old Pepper Johnson, means something this
week as he gets ready for one more installment in the stretch run
that has gone so well and will continue into January. Perhaps there
is also some nostalgia on Johnson's part, for Sunday could be his
final regular-season game as a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing guys have to be conscious of right now,''
he says, in his role as elder statesman, ``it's don't get anxiety
attacks. Don't go out there too excited running around.''
</P>
<P>
   He contradicts himself, though, when he thinks of the
regular-season finale _ against the New England Patriots. To
players like Johnson _ who never played for the Patriots _ this
game is stirring emotions. Just the sort of emotions, he claims he
is trying to calm on the younger players.
</P>
<P>
   He wants them ready for the playoffs and behaving in a certain
way.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just this week he was looking at Giant films from the 1980s, and
reminiscing about that great linebacker crew and how it was the
backbone of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reliving Harry and George and L.T. and Banks,'' he said
of Harry Carson and George Martin and Lawrence Taylor and Carl
Banks, all of them linebackers except Martin, who played on the
defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a luxury going to the Giants,'' Johnson said of the team
he joined as a rookie in 1986, after being drafted in the second
round out of Ohio State. ``I took Harry's mentality when he played
NFC East teams _ he wore elbow pads to stop the runners _ as
opposed to playing passive teams. I saw how Lawrence willed himself
to make big plays, how Carl ran over everything in his way.'' He
recalled how Steve DeOssie, another Giants linebacker, felt ``no
one could beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I credit all these guys with the mentality I have right now,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But these days on the field, he alternates quarters with a
younger player, Dwayne Gordon. Although Johnson has told everyone
who will listen that he should be a full-time player, he doesn't
allow those emotions to affect his thoughts about the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game in which victory provides no immediate benefits
to the Jets, who _ win or lose _ will finish with the second-best
record in the American Football Conference and get a first-round
playoff bye. But there are other factors involved _ such as the
chance to produce the first 12-victory season in Jets history, the
chance to finish the season with a six-game victory streak, the
chance to earn incentive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, outweighing everything else is the continuing
rivalry between the Jets and the Patriots, a rivalry that has
everything to do with Bill Parcells bolting New England to come
back to the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's personal,'' he says of the Jets' approach to Sunday.
``It's a pride thing. There's going to be a lot of trash-talking,
pushing after plays, holding.'' Not by him, you understand, but by
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The split,'' he explains, referring to Parcells' controversial
departure from the Patriots after the 1996 season. ``They have the
majority of players from the Parcells era. We have the coaches.''
But the Jets also have eight players who played for Parcells on the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feelings players have in this locker room for Coach
Parcells and Coach Belichick, they're going to play harder,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was part of the two Super Bowl defenses that Bill
Belichick _ the master defensive coordinator _ put together for
Parcells on the Giants, but Johnson missed out on 1996, when the
two coaches joined forces again in New England and took the
Patriots all the way to Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent that season in Detroit, starting 12 games at
middle linebacker. But after Parcells took over the Jets, with
Belichick as his main assistant, Johnson came aboard as a free
agent and then started the first eight games last season before a
torn quadriceps tendon sidelined him for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this past summer, Johnson made a pre-retirement
locker-room announcement. This was going to be it, he claimed. He
would come back only if Parcells or Belichick want him back.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells always has been fond of Johnson. It is not merely the
three charities Johnson is involved with back in Detroit. Parcells
describes Johnson as the sort of person who is always helping
others _ friends, family, strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' says the coach, ``he tries to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells, for all the respect he has for Johnson, for all
the times they shared, did not even think he would be back this
year. Or did he? Parcells announced to reporters before the season
began that Johnson ought to consider that the train might be
pulling into the station for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to his office over the summer,'' Johnson recalled,
``and he was talking like I might not be able to make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   But did Parcells want Johnson to pack it in, or was he just
trying to motivate him?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson smiled. ``With Bill,'' he said, ``you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Johnson did return and Parcells decided to give him
breathers. ``I want to keep him alive,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has fumed, though, at sharing time with Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, asked whether he will return, Johnson says, ``I'm almost
banking it on how Coach Parcells feels _ if he wants me back.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if he's not a Jet, he will retire?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that,'' he said. ``If somebody else gives me a
call, that's a different story.''

THE GIANTS' AMANI TOOMER: DANCING IN THE END ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo of Amani Toomer is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
1-888-603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you seen Amani Toomer's post-touchdown celebration moves?
</P>
<P>
   Toomer, the Giants' surging star at wide receiver, has. He
watches them on videotape and covers his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look and say: `Oh, no. I can't believe I did that,''' Toomer
said this week at Giants Stadium, demonstrating how he throws his
hands to his face. ``I go into a zone when I score and I don't even
know what I'm doing. I just sort of do anything. But I hope I keep
getting in there and keep looking stupid. I'll be happy with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer's moves in the end zone are eclectic, a half dance, half
jump with a nervous, excited hop _ a player having fun but
certainly not in an orchestrated way. No one could have practiced
those maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   One could add that until this season, when Toomer has scored a
team-leading five touchdowns, he had little reason to practice his
touchdown celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Toomer, 24, was a little-used wide receiver and
punt return specialist. In two seasons with the Giants, he had
scored one touchdown as a receiver. He had returned three punts for
touchdowns, two in his first six games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a year ago, the Giants were headed to the playoffs but
Toomer felt like something of an adjunct to the core of the team.
Toomer, a second-round pick in the 1996 draft out of Michigan, had
once had much bigger plans for the 1997 season. Recovering from a
serious knee injury after his splashy Giants debut early in 1996,
Toomer was intent on cracking the starting lineup as a wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the rookie Ike Hilliard beat him out for the flanker's
job, and when Hilliard was injured, Thomas Lewis won the job. When
Lewis was hurt, Kevin Alexander, an undrafted free agent, took
over. When Alexander was later sidelined by injury, David Patten, a
free agent signed out of the Arena League, was promoted over
Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating for a lot of reasons but it was no time to
rock the boat,'' Toomer said at his Giants Stadium locker this
week. ``The team was winning and I was happy about that. I was just
trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, with his role recently increased, Toomer is in the
news and in the end zone and a key to the Giants' attack. He caught
the game-winning touchdown in the Giants' stirring victory over the
Denver Broncos and made another touchdown reception in last week's
rout of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' starter at quarterback, Kent Graham, has long been a
Toomer supporter, marveling at the receiver's skills when the two
worked together as second-stringers. Graham likes to throw the ball
long and Toomer's best attribute might be his ability to get down
the field in a hurry and then use his 6-foot-3-inch frame and
athleticism to win any battles for the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven he can be a big-play guy,'' Giants Coach Jim
Fassel said. ``He's a smooth runner but he's learned to be
aggressive. He can slither around guys and get to the ball first.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five weeks, since Graham took over at quarterback
for Danny Kanell, Toomer has caught 10 passes for 144 yards. For
the season, Toomer has 25 catches and 337 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer will become a restricted free agent after this season,
which means the Giants can match any offer Toomer might receive
from another team.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials have indicated they have no plans to let Toomer
get away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Toomer is enjoying his newly expanded role and
enduring some gentle ribbing about his post-touchdown histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to start rehearsing,'' he said with a mixture of
embarrassment and excitement. ``I'm just going to go with it.''  &QL;

   NEW LOAN LOSSES FOUND AT JAPAN'S 17 LARGEST BANKS
</P>
<P>
   Japan's 17 biggest banks had $427 billion in problem loans as of
March, 12 percent more than they had reported, a Government audit
has found. The Financial Supervisory Agency said it had found 49.5
trillion yen, or $427 billion, in problem loans, 5.4 trillion yen
more than the banks had calculated.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem uncovered in the audit was that some banks
applied more lenient write-off rules for loans to their financial
affiliates than to other borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN OIL OUTPUT STABLE
</P>
<P>
   Russian oil production fell 1 percent this year, less than
expected, as the ruble's plunge offset low world oil prices and
provided producers with cash to maintain output, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
   NIKKEI CLOSES 91 POINTS HIGHER
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stocks closed higher for the first time this week as a
rise in government bonds lessened worries that bank profits would
shrink further. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks rose
91.22 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 13,797.95. That left
the benchmark index 10 percent below its level of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINES EXPECT LOWER EARNING
</P>
<P>
   Several major airlines, including UAL Corp.'s United Airlines,
US Airways Group and Continental Airlines, are expected to report
lower earnings for the fourth quarter because of competition from
discount carriers, a reduction in corporate travel budgets and an
increase in the number of seats they had to fill.
</P>
<P>
   OIL INDUSTRY'S ANNUS HORRIBILIS
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry has unexpectedly suffering through a year that
some are calling a ``blood bath.'' Oil prices averaged $13.13 in
the fourth quarter, down 34 percent from a year earlier. The
biggest American oil companies are expected to report earnings
declines of between 32 percent and 90 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   HITACHI SIGNALS STRATEGY SHIFT
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest electronics manufacturer, may have
signaled an effort to speed up its decision-making process when it
appointed a new president, Etsuhiko Shoyama. Unlike many previous
presidents of Hitachi, Shoyama has worked extensively in
audiovisual products and in the company's information and media
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   GROWTH SLOWS AT REAL ESTATE TRUSTS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's real estate investment trusts are expected to
report that earnings growth slowed to about 11 percent in the
fourth quarter as slumping stock prices made it harder to finance
property acquisitions. The share prices of REITs have fallen this
year because of concern about a slowing economy and a rise in
construction.

PIERRE VALLIERES, 60, QUEBEC SEPARATIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note language in 5th graf.) 
(lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Pierre Vallieres, a writer and political advocate
whose raw, emotional manifesto on injustice and violence became the
intellectual foundation of the early Quebec separatist movement,
died on Tuesday in Montreal. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres never fully recovered from a heart attack last year
and slipped into a coma last week. A friend, Philippe Duhamel, told
reporters that Vallieres had died in a hospital surrounded by
friends.
</P>
<P>
   While in custody in a prison in New York awaiting extradition to
Montreal on manslaughter charges in the 1960s, Vallieres wrote
``Les Negres Blancs d'Amerique,'' which was published in English
under the title ``White Niggers of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, a collection of personal essays and memoirs that
expressed pent-up anger at the dominant English-speaking class in
Quebec and the Roman Catholic Church, became a call to arms for the
fledgling Front for the Liberation of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a nigger in America is to be not a man but someone's
slave,'' Vallieres wrote in his book, which was published in French
in 1968. He and the movement clearly identified with the struggles
of blacks in the American South, although he was criticized for
comparing the history of the blacks to the less burdensome travails
of French-Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the organization said it was responsible for
bombings throughout Quebec, but mostly in Montreal, as it attempted
to nurture a revolution to split the French-speaking province from
the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The early movement also bore a distinct socialist tint, and a
goal of many of its most influential members, including Vallieres,
was to create an anti-capitalist society as much as to form an
independent Quebec. Divisions appeared in the movement as those
goals diverged.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres was a revolutionary who personally experienced the
inequality that he believed crippled capitalist societies. He was
born in the Montreal slums in 1938, the son of an exhausted
railroad employee and a doting mother who came to resent his
efforts to read and write and to avoid finding a regular job to
help the family.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres entered a Franciscan seminary. But he left after a few
years, with an open antagonism toward the church. After traveling
to France for a brief and disillusioning brush with French
bureaucracy, he returned to Montreal and tried journalism.
Vallieres wrote for the largest French-language newspaper in the
city, La Presse, and was co-editor of a liberal magazine, Cite
Libre, which Pierre Trudeau and others had founded.
</P>
<P>
   In his book Vallieres said that from the magazine he was easily
led ``to the picket lines, the protests against the war in Vietnam
... and the FLQ.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of ``White Niggers of America'' by Laurier L. LaPierre,
in The New York Times Book Review, on its publication in English in
1971, referred to Vallieres as ``Canada's Eldridge Cleaver and
Malcolm X.'' The reviewer found the book, in some sections,
``profound in its assessment of men and events.''
</P>
<P>
   The book challenged Quebecers to take up arms and toss gasoline
bombs in their campaign for independence. Vallieres wrote it after
he was arrested in 1966 at a demonstration in front of the United
Nations. He was held at the Tombs prison in New York until January
1967, awaiting deportation to Canada on charges related to the
bombing of a shoe factory in Montreal in the early '60s that killed
a secretary at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres was convicted of manslaughter in late 1969. He was
released pending appeal, and the conviction was overturned in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting the appeal, Vallieres returned to Montreal and
soon became involved in the separatist movement's most violent
offensive. On Oct. 5, 1970, the British trade commissioner in
Montreal, James Richard Cross, was kidnapped. Five days later four
armed men abducted Pierre Laporte, the Quebec labor minister.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappings intensified the insecurity created by bombings
and threats of violence by the front. At 4 a.m. on Oct. 16,
Trudeau, the prime minister, invoking the War Measures Act for the
first time in peace, called the army into Montreal. Under the law
the police had the power to round up and detain anyone suspected of
involvement in the violence without bringing formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres was one of 450 arrested. A few days later, acting on a
tip from the kidnappers, the police found Laporte's body in the
trunk of a car. The Front for the Liberation of Quebec claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres was released without being charged, although he was
later accused of seditious conspiracy because of remarks in his
book. In 1973 he was cleared of those charges, and the manslaughter
conviction related to the factory bombing was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declarations in his book, he turned his back on
violence and dissociated himself from his organization, calling it
a ``terrorist menace.'' He then threw his support to the political
wing of the separatist movement, the Parti Quebecois, which had
just been formed by Rene Levesque, a former journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Vallieres eventually grew disenchanted with the Parti Quebecois
and did not even vote in the separation referendum in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of a second separation referendum in 1995, Vallieres
had grown distant from the movement to which his writing had helped
give intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Vallieres took up many causes, including gay
rights, native self-government and mental health. He was a founder
of the Quebec-Bosnia Solidarity Committee and traveled to Sarajevo
in 1995.

COMMENTARY: A PRIEST TRIES TO SAVE A GENERATION, ONE PERSON AT A
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. John Flynn wore a cap emblazoned with the
phrase ``Save A Generation'' _ an odd comment, since he was
oblivious to his own safety while crossing East 180th Street with
hardly a glance. Halfway across, he realized it might be a good
idea to look around just in case a bus, truck or livery cab was
bearing down on him. All clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at traffic,'' he said with an embarrassed
chuckle. ``I just go out there. The cars go zoom, and I just keep
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Words to live by, at least when there's no traffic. Since Flynn
arrived in the Crotona neighborhood in the Bronx as pastor of St.
Martin of Tours Roman Catholic Church, he has always ambled around
his parish. It's the best way he knows to show people he's
available for anything. The walks also help him insure that the
unity people feel in church on Sunday doesn't vanish once they go
back to the block.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that going out on the streets around here was akin
to going out on a limb. Crack, guns and death were common. It's
calmer now, even though this neighborhood has not had a decrease in
murders, as others in the city have.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the year winds down, Flynn is grateful for the many
mercies, small and large, that came his way. He talked a man from
jumping off a roof. A new playground was built down the block from
his rectory. Even the drug dealing that went on across the street
from the church has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk around and find an ease with people,'' he said. ``I
don't think people are extremely afraid. I don't hear people
telling me they're going to move.''
</P>
<P>
   It was bitterly cold Wednesday afternoon, so he tugged his cap
snugly over his tousled silver hair before taking a stroll. He
walked to 182nd Street and Prospect Avenue, not too far from where
Dion DiMucci once sang doo-wop with the Belmonts back in the 1950s.
Flynn remembers it more for the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the first guy, Boogaloo, was murdered,'' he said.
``His mother lived in the projects. He played basketball. That goes
back 10 years, when I first got here.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man walked by that utterly ordinary-looking spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the good news?'' Flynn shouted.``Not much,'' the boy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing pretty good,'' Flynn said as he watched the boy
walk away. ``His mother was worried about him. But he's back in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   One fewer person for him to worry about. During his time at St.
Martin's, Flynn has tried nearly anything to reach the youths
hanging out on the corner or eyeing it with curiosity. He started
``Save A Generation,'' a program to give high-school dropouts an
education and job training. To reach others, he would walk the
streets a few nights each week offering to trade a crucifix for a
gun. All he ever got was a box cutter, although his forays made his
face familiar, inspiring trust even among the knuckleheads. Well,
most of them. One teen-ager was stunned when Flynn suggested that a
$7 crucifix was a fair trade for a $100 gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go on to explain the symbolism,'' he said. ``He just
wasn't in the mood for that little talk. He just laughed at me like
I was out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have to be a little crazy to stick around and not give
up. On Mapes Avenue, Flynn grimaced when he saw houses with porches
encased in thick bars and gates, making it look as if the Santa and
snowmen dolls within them were doing time. But down the block, he
shared a laugh and an embrace with a parishioner who has lived on
the block _ without bars _ for 50 years. Later, he helped another
parishioner haul bags of bread to a corner where the man fed the
pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped at a community center, where a young girl re-enacted
her role in the church's holiday pageant. She boomed something
about prophets. He smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are so without guile,'' he said. ``We've got to
keep them innocent. They lose it so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Back out on 180th Street, he recalled his own childhood in
Yonkers. He used to work at the kind of jobs that some of his
parishioners now take to make ends meet. ``When I was a teen-ager I
worked in an A&AMP;P,'' he said. ``We ate lunch downstairs with all the
canned goods and boxes. The men there were nice enough guys, but
they were so bitter. It was awful they were doing something they
couldn't stand. Isn't it great to do something you love?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what keeps him walking. It even keeps the cars away.
Crazy? Sure _ crazy love.

Honesty, clarity, brevity necessary to good resume 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's face it: We're all suckers for good
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with two or more products of comparable quality,
buyers are drawn to the one with the well-crafted advertisement,
while also-rans get passed over like so many bruised tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   A resume is your 30-second plug to a prospective employer. By
highlighting your experience, skills and talent, it identifies you
as someone who can do a job and do it well. It's not meant to be
the final word on who you are, but if successful, it will lead to
the next step in the job-search process, the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really your first introduction to a prospective employer
and the only thing they're going to see before talking to you _ if
they talk to you,'' said Joyce Underdown, owner of The Resume
Connection in Tarzana, which prepares resumes for job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the truth is, there is no one correct way to write a
resume. Indeed, how and what you say will depend on the job you're
after. But a few common denominators exist for all successful
resumes: honesty, clarity and conciseness. No matter how impressive
your accomplishments, a muddled resume can be the kiss of death to
your prospects.
</P>
<P>
   1. Personal data _ Your name, complete address, telephone number
and e-mail address. It's hard to be creative with this, so don't
even try.
</P>
<P>
   2. Objective _ A one-sentence (keep it focused!) description of
the type of job you're after, tailored to the position you want.
Good: A senior management position in a public relations firm
serving Los Angeles' entertainment industry. Bad: A job that will
allow me to use my extensive management, writing and creative
skills in public relations and marketing, ideally serving Southern
California clients in the music and/or film business.
</P>
<P>
   3. Experience _ Here's where you can brag _ in an understated
way _ about how much tail you've kicked at past jobs. In reverse
chronological order, list your work history, providing the name of
the employer, the position you held, the dates, skills involved and
one or two of your significant accomplishments, such as landing a
big, new client or being singled out by the boss for your
outstanding work. If your job involved supervising others, be sure
to mention the head count.
</P>
<P>
   4. Education _ List your highest degree or certificate first,
the name of the school and dates you attended. If you went to
college, don't bother mentioning your high school. But if you hold
an advanced university degree such as a master's or Ph.D., list
that and your bachelor's degree and the schools that issued them.
</P>
<P>
   5. Related skills _ Include information on any foreign languages
you speak, computer skills (including programming languages and
specific software appropriate to the job), talents for
presentations or public speaking, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   6. References _ It doesn't hurt to include a list on a separate
sheet of paper of three people who know you in a professional
capacity. But you can also simply state that references are
available upon request.

HOCKEY'S HASEK AND BRODEUR: AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT MEETS AN IMMOVABLE
OBJECT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey's best goaltenders in this decade will be at opposite
ends of the rink Saturday night when the Devils and the Sabres play
in East Rutherford, N.J., at Continental Arena. It will be the
first meeting of the season between Martin Brodeur and Dominik
Hasek, who have had a remarkable series of duels over the years.
</P>
<P>
   None of their previous confrontations stands out more than the
sixth game of their first-round 1994 playoff series, which went
into a fourth overtime with neither team having scored. Hasek
turned aside all 70 shots he faced in that epic game on March 27,
1994, in Buffalo, while Brodeur made 49 saves before Dave Hannah
beat him on Buffalo's 50th shot after 65 minutes 43 seconds of
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur lost that battle, but he won the war as the Devils
eliminated the Sabres in the seventh game and he became the first
goaltender in Devils history to win all four games in a playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur came back a year later to help New Jersey capture the
Stanley Cup, a trophy that has eluded Hasek, known to hockey people
as the Dominator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is the best,'' Brodeur said after Hasek led his native
Czech Republic to the gold medal in the Olympics last February.
``They don't come any better than him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Hasek won the Hart Trophy, as the league's most
valuable player, for the second straight time last season, becoming
the first goalie to gain that honor in consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek leads the league's goalies in virtually every important
statistic this season. His reputation weighs heavily on opponents,
shooters often being intimidated by his very presence. Dr. Cal
Botterill, a Canadian sports psychologist who has worked as a
consultant for several teams in the league, said that Hasek could
make even the most gifted goal scorers stop and think before
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he even makes a save flat on his back, without a
stick or a glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Dave Andreychuk, who played with Hasek in Buffalo in
Hasek's first season with the Sabres, 1992-93, was asked to
describe Hasek's style the other day. ``He has no style,''
Andreychuk said. ``He just stops the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has done that more effectively than anyone else this
season. He leads the league in victories (18), goals against
average (1.66), save percentage (.945) and shutouts (6).
</P>
<P>
   Five of Hasek's career shutouts have come against the Rangers,
his latest earlier this month, but a game in which he faced only
two shots in the first period. ``I could have had a cigar and glass
of wine,'' he said after the 2-0 victory over the Rangers on Dec.
11 game at Buffalo. ``It was maybe the easiest shutout I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek is the primary reason that Buffalo comes into its game
with New Jersey at 18-6-5, just about the same as the Devils'
19-8-4. These two teams should be playing deep into the spring,
making it a strong possibility that they could meet each other in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur (two shutouts, .901 save percentage, 2.35 goals against
average) is not far behind Hasek in a season in which the Devils,
under Coach Robbie Ftorek, are starting to take risks offensively
for the first time in six years. Their new style has left the
defense more vulnerable and, as a result, Brodeur's statistics are
not as impressive as in previous years under Coach Jacques Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur feels particularly proud about last season's
accomplishment, when he joined Terry Sawchuk and Harry Lumley as
the only NHL goalies to have back-to-back seasons with a goals
against average below 2.00. He had a 1.88 goals against mark two
seasons ago, followed by 1.89 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek and Brodeur, who has been bothered by discomfort in his
ribs, will probably face each other again Monday night in Buffalo
in the return game of the home-and-home series that will give the
teams a good idea how they measure up against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur will face Hasek Saturday night without a loss in his
last eight games. Hasek comes into the game having registered his
39th career shutout three days ago, when he had 38 saves in
stopping Tampa Bay. That prompted Jacques Demers, the Lightning
coach, to say: ``This guy is God. He's on a different planet.''

SPORTS COLUMN: 40 YEARS LATER, A DIFFERENT SUDDEN DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a frigid, gray December 28th in 1958, Alan Ameche, the
Baltimore Colts 6-foot 222-pound fullback, blasted 1 yard over
right tackle to score a dramatic overtime touchdown in the 1958
National Football League championship game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Horse's 1-yard run pulled the entire NFL into the end zone
with him. Baltimore's dramatic 23-17 overtime victory against the
New York Giants, which was televised nationally for the first time,
was the first sudden-death overtime game in NFL history and
generally is credited with catapulting the appeal of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, the new Giants, now working out of New Jersey
in Giants Stadium, face a different kind of sudden death. On the
final week of a bittersweet season, the Giants travel to
Philadelphia for a game that may be instant elimination or that
could be slow, torturous agony. Or, it may not be a death at all,
but a rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants go to Philadelphia needing one victory and two
miracles to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Giants need to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. And that
won't be easy on a day that's sure to be filled with emotion.
Sunday may well be Ray Rhodes' final game as head coach of the
Eagles (3-12). He expects to be dismissed after the season. Sunday
will also be the final game in the meandering 15-year career of
Irving Fryar, an Eagles wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants need help. They need Cincinnati to beat Tampa
Bay, then they need the lowly Chargers to upset the Cardinals, who
are looking for their first playoff appearance in a non-strike
season since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said, ``It feels good to be
in the playoff hunt, compared to a couple of weeks ago. Only
problem is, our fate not only rests in our hands, but in other
teams' hands, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one pair of hands are injured. Bengals quarterback Jeff
Blake fractured his wrist in last week's victory over Pittsburgh
and won't play in Tampa Bay. But that may not be as bleak as it
appears. The Bengals haven't had a winning record since 1990, but
they have won their final home game in each of the last 5 years and
in 9 of the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the issue of cold weather. Tampa Bay is 0-16 when
the temperature is under 40 degrees at kickoff. The Bucs have won
only six road games in December in franchise history. A cold spell
hit Cincinnati last week, sending wind chills below zero just in
time for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Bengals win, the Giants need yet another
miracle: they need San Diego to upset the surging Cardinals in
Arizona. Given the spiritual morass of the Chargers, this might be
a greater stretch than the Bengals defeating Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Back in September, the Arizona-San Diego game was scripted as a
battle between a pair of wealthy, high-gloss young quarterbacks:
Jake Plummer and Ryan Leaf. Plummer is the NFL's second-richest
player, and Leaf has been called a $31.25 million mistake. Plummer
has been on fire, Leaf has been like a fire raging out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf cursed a TV cameraman in the locker room after a dismal
performance early in the season, then went into a tirade at a
reporter for writing the story. Leaf threw a football at the head
of the same reporter, but, like most of his passes this season,
that one missed its mark.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, who went to the University of Washington, went to Pullman,
Wash., and was accused of throwing beer on two students, spitting
on the outside window of one place and then saying, ``I can buy you
all.''
</P>
<P>
   That bravado was in contrast to his reaction after a horrific
game against the Giants when he threw four interceptions.
Afterward, he wondered whether he was good enough to play in the
NFL. ``It kind of feels like someone ripped my heart out of me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 28, 1958, is regarded as the day that professional football
took a major step toward becoming the signature sport in the United
States. It was the day that pro football and network television
were married. Leaf, sadly, typifies the character of so many of the
grandchildren of that union: spoiled, brash, reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the relative glory of 1958 _ when players were
underpaid, shackled to the team and thankful for it _ the young
players' only frame of reference is the sort of payment-first,
performance-later, if ever, attitude embodied by Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' season, in many ways, is a byproduct of that
attitude: a great season in 1997 followed by unfounded
overconfidence in 1998. Now, humility has finally set in as a young
generation of Giants faces another Sudden Death scenario 40 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   The season could miraculously continue or it could come to a
screeching halt. What a way to celebrate an anniversary.

MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE STILL LAGS, DESPITE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Minn., N.J., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Insurance companies and employers have found ways
to get around a 1996 law that requires them to offer health-care
coverage for mental illness that is comparable to that for physical
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the Mental Health Parity Act, was expected to make
mental health care more readily available to millions of Americans,
but, experts on employee benefits and health policy say, it has not
done so.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, which took effect last January, group health
plans may not set annual or lifetime dollar limits on a member's
mental health care that are less than any such limits for general
medical and surgical services.
</P>
<P>
   So, many group plans, fearing higher costs, have simply replaced
the dollar limits for mental health care with numerical limits on
outpatient visits, treatment sessions or days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day and visit limits wind up being more restrictive in
some cases than the dollar limits for which they substituted,''
said Ronald Bachman, an actuary at the accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``The net impact in these cases is to have
less mental health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Newman, director of clinical practice issues at the
American Psychological Association, said this was ``definitely an
unintended consequence'' of the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of the law,'' Newman said, ``was to stop
discrimination against mental health services and against people
who need those services.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation, led by Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., had hoped that it would
curb coverage disparities between mental and physical illnesses.
They said they would fight to broaden and strengthen the law next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The mental health law is one of several recent health-care
initiatives that have fallen short of the sponsors' expectations.
Another 1996 law was intended to guarantee health insurance
coverage for people who change or lose their jobs. But people
trying to exercise their rights have often been stymied as insurers
skirt the law by charging them premiums of $10,000 to $15,000 a
year _ far more than the standard rates for healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health care was long relegated to second-class status
under private insurance policies, but in the last few years it has
received more attention from employers, insurers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the stigma of mental illness is being erased as
scientists find physiological causes for a number of mental
disorders. In addition, some employers now consider spending on
mental health care a smart investment, on the ground that it
fosters a productive work force.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that 6 million people have severe mental
disorders and that the nation spends $70 billion a year to treat
mental illness of all kinds, not counting outlays for alcohol and
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of mental health care is considered a reasonably good
indicator of the overall quality of a health insurance plan.
Studies in several states suggest that the cost of ``parity'' for
mental health services is minimal, increasing total health care
costs by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But group health plans _ the benefits for which may be designed
by the employer, the insurer or both _ are typically distrustful of
government mandates in general and apprehensive about the costs for
a kind of care that they consider particularly vulnerable to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Adams Jr., an expert on health benefits at Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a consulting concern that advises many large businesses,
said: ``Many companies have converted the dollar limits on mental
health benefits into limits on the number of visits or days that
will be covered. If they had a $1,000 annual limit on outpatient
visits, it may be replaced with a limit of 20 visits. If there was
a $10,000 annual maximum for inpatient mental health benefits,
employers may convert it to a limit of 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Esnayra, a 34-year-old graduate student with manic
depressive disorder, said her insurance plan previously had a limit
of $750 a year on outpatient mental health services but recently
replaced it with an annual limit of 15 visits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Esnayra, a former teaching assistant who receives her
coverage through the University of California at San Diego, said
this limit could make her new coverage just as inadequate as the
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness can flare up unpredictably,'' she said. ``A
person with major mental illness may need more than 15 visits with
a doctor just to find the right mix of medications, and for the
most effective treatment you often need talk therapy as well as
pharmaceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clark Jordan, a health benefits consultant at Hewitt
Associates, said, ``The average consumer would be hard pressed to
find an improvement in mental health benefits as a result of the
changes'' since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said: ``The Mental Health Parity Act
was a significant step in the right direction, but it was not as
comprehensive as we wanted. The experience of the last two years
shows that the law has substantial loopholes and that
discrimination is still practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the change in the nature of the limits, some
health plans set higher co-payments and deductibles for mental
health care than for other medical services, a disparity allowed
under the 1996 law. In an interview, Wellstone said he would push
next year for legislation to require ``full parity,'' covering
co-payments, deductibles and limits on hospital stays and
outpatient visits.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Tipper Gore, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on
mental health issues, said she favored such legislation. Mrs. Gore,
wife of the vice president, has long championed the rights of
people with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Group Health Inc. of New York, like many insurers, has revised
some of its mental health benefits in response to the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annual and lifetime dollar limitations on mental health
benefits will be removed,'' the company said in a notice to
subscribers in its program for New York City government employees.
But it said, ``For outpatient care, the $900 annual maximum and the
$1,800 lifetime maximum will be replaced with a limit of up to 30
visits per year and 60 visits per lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Russo, director of GHI's program for New York City
employees, said the plan's mental health benefits were among the
most comprehensive offered anywhere. But Rep. Carolyn Maloney,
D-N.Y., said, ``While this level of benefits may be in technical
compliance with the Parity Act, it clearly violates the spirit of
the law, which was intended to ensure that physical and mental
illnesses would receive the same level of coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. illustrates another way some businesses have
responded to the law. The company had a lifetime limit of $1
million on medical benefits for any employee or dependent, and no
more than $300,000 of that amount could be spent on mental health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the lifetime ceiling of $1 million,'' said Paula
Wallace, the health benefits manager for Hewlett-Packard, ``but the
$300,000 limit for mental health was eliminated. We now have a
single lifetime limit of $1 million on physical and mental health
benefits combined, with no distinction between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has not experienced the sharp increase in costs
that many employers fear. ``Our mental health costs have been
stable through 1998,'' Ms. Wallace said, in part because the
company uses managed-care techniques to make sure patients receive
appropriate but not excessive services.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Guida Jr., vice president of the National Mental Health
Association, an advocate for people with mental disorders, said the
approach taken by Hewlett-Packard was ``consistent with the intent
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``many insurers and employers are taking steps to bypass the
federal law,'' Guida said, ``changing the structure of their
benefits to impose discriminatory inpatient and outpatient visit
limits in place of the previous spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have laws that require the same or similar
levels of coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Some of the
state laws, going further than the federal law, prohibit insurers
from setting higher deductibles or patient fees for mental health
care than for other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Bachman, the actuary at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said health-care
plans often paid a smaller share of bills for mental treatment than
for other kinds of care. For example, he said, if a psychiatrist
submits a $90 bill for psychotherapy, the plan may count only $50
as an eligible expense and then may pay only 50 percent of that, or
$25. In contrast, Bachman said, if a family practitioner submits a
bill for $90, the insurer may pay 80 percent of that amount, or
$72.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law does not require employers to provide any mental
health benefits, but most companies that offer health insurance to
employees do cover some mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   An employer may obtain an exemption if it can show, with at
least six months of data, that compliance with the 1996 law has
caused an increase of 1 percent or more in the overall cost of its
employee health plan. But Labor Department officials said that only
four companies had requested such exemptions.

INSURER'S DOCUMENTS SOUGHT IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors are investigating $100,900 in
political contributions that a Long Island insurance conglomerate
and its president made to the New York Republican State Committee
before closing an important deal with the state, lawyers involved
in the inquiry say.
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate, the Robert Plan, and its president, Robert
Wallach, gave the money in the summer of 1997 while negotiating
with state insurance regulators to take control of most of the
assets of two nearly bankrupt insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The party received the money in early July, and two months
later, Gov. George Pataki announced that the state was transferring
the assets to the Robert Plan. The conglomerate and Wallach had not
previously donated to the party or the Pataki campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn sent a subpoena to the
Robert Plan last month, seeking documents in an effort to determine
whether the donations were intended to influence the talks with the
State Insurance Department, according to lawyers involved in the
inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The office acted
after The New York Times reported on the timing of the donations in
an article on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena comes as the Brooklyn prosecutor's office is
working on at least three other campaign finance inquiries. One is
examining possible links between donations to the Republican State
Committee and the awarding of a $97 million state transportation
contract. Another focuses on whether contributors to the Pataki
campaign were promised favorable treatment in cases before the
State Parole Board. A third involves donations to the campaign of
outgoing Attorney General Dennis Vacco from an auto-leasing company
that he was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In October, another executive at the Robert Plan, John Reiersen,
said there was no connection between the contributions and the
insurance deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Robert Plan assumed most of the policies
held by two companies, Home Mutual and New York Merchant Bakers of
Binghamton, N.Y., after the state decided that their collapse would
harm policyholders. In return for getting the new policies, the
Robert Plan, based in Bethpage, N.Y., promised to pay some of the
companies' debts and keep most premiums level for a year.

KINGS FACE BIG TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just in the nick of time, the Los Angeles Kings
are showing signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether they can keep it up.
</P>
<P>
   With a home-and-home series against the powerful Phoenix Coyotes
(19-6-4) _ at the Forum tonight and in Phoenix on Monday _ the
answer to this question will come quickly, an answer that may carry
with it any hopes the Kings (10-20-3) have of mounting a serious
playoff pursuit in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In their first two meetings this season with the Coyotes, both
at the Forum, the Kings were outscored 7-0. Tonight, however, the
Coyotes are expected to be without star left wing Keith Tkachuk,
who has a sprained right knee. (Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith
said Tkachuk has a slim chance of playing tonight.) Tkachuk may be
able to play against the Kings on Monday, however.
</P>
<P>
   In their first home game in nine days, the Kings will have a
distinctly different look from the team that blew a third-period
lead on Dec.17 in a 5-4 overtime loss to the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, general manager Dave Taylor traded a 1999
second-round draft choice to Buffalo for the rights to 29-year-old
right wing Donald Audette. In two games as a King, both on the
road, Audette has scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Kings have regained the services of captain
Rob Blake, who has recovered from the broken foot that sidelined
him for 15 games and outlasted the NHL suspension that forced him
to sit out three games, including that dismal loss to the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kings needed to be reminded of Blake's value to
them, but his effect on their performance has never been more
graphic than this season.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Kings are 10 games below .500 this season, scoring
73 goals and allowing 91.
</P>
<P>
   Blake has appeared in 15 games. In those games, the Kings are
7-5-3, outscoring the opposition, 33-27. Without Blake in the
lineup, the Kings are 3-15 and have been outscored 64-40.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have allowed an average of 1.8 goals a game in Blake's
appearances and 3.56 in the games he's missed. Blake has appeared
in three of the Kings' past 21 games. The Kings have won just six
of their past 21 games, but in Blake's three appearances, the Kings
are 3-0 and have outscored opponents 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kings resume play following the NHL's two-day Christmas
hiatus, they have 23 points, the fewest of any of the 13 teams in
the Western Conference. They are seven points behind St. Louis and
Vancouver, the teams that hold the last two playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Kings close that gap in their final 49 games? How they
fare in the two games with Phoenix should provide a strong
indication of whether they are capable of putting together the
streak that will be necessary.

N.Y. STATE MOVES TO RAISE STANDARDS FOR NONPUBLIC SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that New York state has enacted new standards to
improve learning in public-school classrooms, the Education
Department and the Board of Regents are increasing their resolve to
have private and religious schools follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But what the state sees as encouragement, some private and
religious schools are calling pressure. The schools say they worry
that the state is infringing on the independence that allows them
to develop the nontraditional approaches that they maintain are at
the heart of their success.
</P>
<P>
   Private and parochial schools _ from small church-run academies
to prestigious Manhattan prep schools _ educate about 15 percent of
all school-age children in New York State, or 485,453 in 1997.
While state law requires these schools to provide an education at
least equal in quality to that of public schools, they are largely
free to establish their own curriculums and methods and do not have
to administer state assessment tests.
</P>
<P>
   When the regents adopted the new standards in 1996, it exempted
nonpublic schools, with the understanding that the issue would be
discussed later.
</P>
<P>
   But with the state raising the bar for public schools,
particularly in graduation requirements, state Education
Commissioner Richard Mills said private and parochial schools
should also make sure they meet the new standards. Under the new
graduation requirements, public-school students within the next
five years will have to pass five regents exams in English, math,
American history, global studies and one of four sciences.
Previously, only college-bound students took such exams, and other
students took the basic skills competency test to graduate, an
option that will soon no longer be available.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools, too, are pressing the state to include the
nonpublic schools in the new requirements because they fear
students will otherwise leave the public schools for less demanding
private ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has to be joined because the law says students in
nonpublic schools must get an education substantially equivalent to
that in the public schools,'' Mills said this week. ``And if public
schools are increasing their standards and increasing their
performance, `substantial equivalence' means nonpublic schools have
to rise as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents, took the
opportunity in an interview to throw down a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things this discussion can expose is the myth of
high performance among some of the private schools,'' Hayden said.
``That is not to say that many are not operating at or above
regents standard, but many of them get the benefit of the doubt
without ever having to produce evidence. Those that agree to report
results to the community using objective standards will have a
legitimate basis to make the claim of superiority.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But neither Hayden nor Mills felt comfortable predicting how a
compromise might be reached with the nonpublic schools.
</P>
<P>
   The talks among nonpublic schools and the state have intensified
in the past year, and the Board of Regents will devote much of its
January meeting to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he has no intention of trying to require private
school students to take the regents exams (most nonpublic
elementary schools have voluntarily agreed to administer the new
fourth-grade reading test next month). The state has some leverage
in that it could make the exams a condition for private and public
schools to grant diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden would not rule out seeking to force nonpublic schools to
comply with the new standards, but said he doubted the Board of
Regents would take that course: ``I won't say it is totally outside
the realm of possibility but I think it is unlikely. I don't hear a
great push for that and it's certainly not going to emanate from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For private and parochial schools, the issue is less about
standards than about what they perceive as a blow to their
autonomy. If the state forces them to give the regents tests, the
reasoning goes, the next step could be mandating a curriculum or
imposing other controls.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hickey, the superintendent of schools for the
Archdiocese of New York, said most of the 293 archdiocesan schools
have already made the choice to administer various state exams.
``The key word here is `choice,''' she said. ``We have opted.
Schools have chosen willingly. This is the culture we are used to
and the culture we would like to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nondenominational schools, too, have expressed concern about the
state's intentions. Frederick C. Calder, executive director of the
New York State Association of Independent Schools, issued a
bulletin last week to its 144 member schools warning of state
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that the vast majority of private schools in
New York state easily matches the performance of the best public
schools,'' said Calder. ``Yet the regents and the state Education
Department continue to harass the nonpublic school community with
demands for objective assessments _ read mandated state tests or
their equivalents _ to prove what is self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a large number of nonpublic schools voluntarily give
their students state assessment tests, mainly for bragging rights
and, in the case of Regents exams, because many four-year colleges
require them for admission. Of the 657 high-school level nonpublic
schools, 70 percent offer the regents exam, and as a whole their
students do score higher than public-school students, according to
the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 71 percent of nonpublic students who took the regents
English exam passed, compared with 56 percent of public-school
students, according to the state figures. That trend held true for
all eight of the regents exams except for earth science, with 43
percent of public-school students passing compared to 37 percent
for nonpublic-school students.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while 52 percent of public-school students went on
to four-year colleges, the figure was 74 percent of nonpublic
students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the view of the state, the public-school students will
stand at a high academic achievement level as the new standards
take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rogers, associate director of the New York State Council of
School Superintendents, a lobbying group in Albany for
public-school administrators, said his organization would continue
to press the state to hold the nonpublic schools to at least the
same standards as the public ones. The organization contends
public-school students who are unable to meet the new standards
will leave in droves for lesser private and parochial schools that
eschew the standards.
</P>
<P>
   And Mills said he sees their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see independent schools where I have personal experience
where the expectations are high,'' said Mills, who taught at the
prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan in the 1960s. ``And I see
others that are all across the board. There has to be some kind of
appropriate parallel accountability system in nonpublic schools to
match what is happening in public schools.''

 MIKE McALARY, 41, COLUMNIST WITH SWAGGER TO MATCH CITY'S  
(rl) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike McAlary, whose bulletproof swagger and
unyielding reporting about the New York City Police Department made
him the city's dominant tabloid reporter of the last decade, died
Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 41 and,
earlier this year, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary
for a series of columns in The Daily News on the brutalization of
Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said his brother, Kevin McAlary.
</P>
<P>
   McAlary had been a sports reporter in Boston and at The New York
Post before he was hired by New York Newsday in 1985 to cover the
police department. Playing on his Irish roots and whisk-broom
mustache, he quickly developed a powerful rapport with patrol
officers, detectives and department brass, spending night after
night in the bars where they liked to drink, meeting them on
weekends, and writing about both their heroics and their
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   When 13 officers of the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn were charged
in 1986 with a variety of thefts and other felonies in a major
corruption case, McAlary led the journalistic pack by getting
several officers to talk to him directly. One officer, Brian
O'Regan, killed himself a few hours after speaking with McAlary; a
copy of McAlary's Newsday article was found in a hotel room next to
the officer's body. The case became the basis of ``Buddy Boys,''
the first of McAlary's three nonfiction books about police life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cops look down on newspaper reporters, but they didn't
look down on him,'' said John Timoney, the police commissioner in
Philadelphia and formerly the first deputy commissioner in New
York, who had become friends with McAlary. ``I think it was the
toughness. He was a tough guy, physically and mentally, and wasn't
afraid to go into bad neighborhoods or call somebody a dog. And he
looked like a cop himself.''
</P>
<P>
   His byline began to sell newspapers, and he became the subject
of a bidding war between the city's tabloids, who prized a strong,
preferably Irish, voice in the mold of Jimmy Breslin and Pete
Hamill. Like other columnists, McAlary borrowed some of his syntax
and style from Breslin, who had himself adopted it from Damon
Runyon and others. But friends said a more influential model was
his Newsday colleague, the late Murray Kempton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy was a big shadow to Mike, but Murray was more of a
spiritual kin to him,'' said Jim Dwyer, another columnist at The
Daily News who previously worked at New York Newsday. ``He didn't
write like Murray, but he had the same ability to look someone in
the eye and tell the truth about what they had done, understanding
the difference between the sin and the sinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident,
but battled back even as The Daily News and The New York Post
fought over which paper had him under contract.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, since learning he had cancer, McAlary
had undergone surgery and chemotherapy and had cut back his columns
in The Daily News from three a week to one. But during that same
period, he seemed to focus an energy often described as manic,
leaving a chemotherapy session in August 1997 to get the first
interview with Louima, writing a first novel, ``Sore Loser,'' that
was just published by Morrow, and spending more time with his large
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer happens too much,'' he wrote in The Daily News a year
ago, when his youngest son was born, ``but if you are going to
live, you have to take a chance on dying. I changed the life I had
for one I wanted _ fewer bars and newspaper columns, for more
family and novel writing.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlary's bravado, often expressed with a barroom stridency,
made him a host of enemies, and sometimes got him into trouble. In
1995, he wrote that a woman had fabricated an account of being
raped in order to publicize a feminist rally. Women's groups were
furious, and the woman sued him for libel. The case was dismissed
two years later by a judge who ruled that McAlary had accurately
reported a series of inaccurate statements from police officials.
In court, he was forced to admit that several opinions expressed in
his columns were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   McAlary was born in Honolulu when his father was in the Navy,
and moved with the family to Flatbush, Brooklyn, at age 3. Seven
years later, the family moved again to Goffstown, N.H., where he
graduated from high school with several published articles to his
credit in the national magazine Tennis Illustrated. He studied
journalism at Syracuse University before covering sports for both
Boston dailies.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his parents, Jack and Ellen McAlary of
Goffstown; his wife, Alice, and four children, Ryan, Carla, Michael
and Quinn, ranging in age from 1 to 13, all of Bellport, on Long
Island; four brothers and three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   After learning he had cancer, he had hoped to give up writing
about the police. But after getting a tip about the Louima case, in
which four officers were later charged with brutalizing the Haitian
immigrant, he told friends he had one last police story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``After hearing a story that I wanted to be untrue, I was
shaking,'' he wrote in the first of his Pulitzer Prize-winning
columns. ``This is not about the police force. This is about a
group of cops who are sadistic racists. Be afraid, be very afraid
if this story is true, and I am afraid it is.''

NORTH KOREA WARNS U.S. IT CAN LAUNCH ANOTHER MISSILE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea on Friday warned the United States that
it was prepared to launch another medium-range missile. The Clinton
administration had privately told the North that such a step would
jeopardize international aid it was promised in exchange for
freezing its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The latest warning, published by the official Korean Central
News Agency on Friday, said it was ``foolish for the U.S. to expect
any change in our attitude.'' But U.S. officials have said in
recent weeks that they have seen no activity to suggest that a
launching was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   When North Korea launched a three-stage missile over Japan on
Aug. 31, it took the U.S. intelligence community by surprise. Until
then, U.S. officials did not believe that the North possessed the
technology for a three-stage ballistic missile, which gives the
country the ability to reach all of the major U.S. military bases
in South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea maintains that the launching was intended to propel
a small satellite into low earth orbit. While North Korean news
agencies say the satellite now is broadcasting patriotic North
Korea songs, U.S. officials say their review of the evidence
suggests the satellite either failed to get into orbit, or dropped
out of orbit within hours of the launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard a thing,'' one senior administration official
said last week, ``because it's not up there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The political significance of a second launching would likely be
far greater than any marginal technological achievement it might
represent for the North.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been trying to rescue a 1994 accord under
which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for fuel oil and the construction of two civilian nuclear
power plants. The United States committed itself to paying for the
fuel oil; Japan, South Korea and other nations are paying for the
nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery earlier this year of a huge dig under a
mountain, which the United States suspects is intended for nuclear
weapons development, and the missile launchings have cast doubt on
the accord.
</P>
<P>
   This month the North dropped a demand that it be paid in return
for allowing international inspectors to see the new site; instead,
it suggested that it would be willing to allow inspectors in if the
United States provided more food aid. Some aid has already been
sent to alleviate starvation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A second launching would probably derail any chance that
Congress would approve further participation in the nuclear accord,
administration officials fear.
</P>
<P>
   It could also derail Japan's contributions to the program. But
missile launches themselves are not a violation of the nuclear
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The North said in its statement Friday that ``We will never be
frightened by the U.S. warning,'' about further launchings. ``The
U.S. still knows little'' about the North, a statement few U.S.
officials would dispute.

 WASHINGTON: full Senate. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But because they are moving into unexplored territory, the trial
managers are still trying to determine such basic matters as the
procedure for calling witnesses and the proper way to divide tasks
among different members of the team. In some instances the rules
are fuzzy; in others, it is up to the Senate to tell the managers
how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that perhaps the most important decision they face
is how much direct testimony to present. The Judiciary Committee
itself did not call witnesses directly involved in the case,
relying instead on evidence gathered by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, as well as constitutional scholars and other legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The trial managers could choose not to call many witnesses and
to rely instead on the existing record of depositions and other
materials, as long as either the president's lawyers agreed or the
Senate ruled to admit that record as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The managers said they were cognizant of the limited public
appetite for a prolonged proceeding. ``We do not want to circus-ize
this, to coin a word,'' Gekas said.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon added that from a tactical perspective, it could be in
the managers' best interests to show the senators a succinct
itinerary. ``If we go in there with an eight-month prosecution plan
and witnesses they find offensive,'' he said, ``that will
strengthen the hand of those who don't want to deal with this and
want a censure.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the managers interviewed noted that one of the many
oddities of this process, which casts them as prosecuting attorneys
of sorts, is that a deal or plea bargain could be struck without
their consent, by a simple majority vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the managers, Hutchinson finds himself in a particularly
interesting situation that has prompted some Democrats to complain
that he should not be a manager. His brother, Tim, is a Republican
senator from Arkansas who will sit in judgment of the president,
should the case come to the point of a Senate vote on a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson said that this coincidence was only one of many
ways in which a Senate trial is exempt from the rules and norms of
a usual legal proceeding, and noted that three of the newly elected
senators who will act as jurors had already cast votes on
impeachment as members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has deliberately avoided talking with his
brother about the evidence against Clinton, and would continue to
do so when he sees his brother over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other things to talk about,'' Hutchinson
said. ``You can talk about the politics of it without talking about
the facts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the managers said they would be able to purge impeachment
from their minds until their first team meeting; all left town
after the impeachment vote carrying research materials on Senate
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said in a telephone interview that he planned to devote
some time in the coming days to reading ``Grand Inquest,'' a 1992
book about two Senate trials written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist of the Supreme Court, who would preside over Clinton's
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said he would also root for his wife, who is due to have
a child on Jan. 19, to push up the schedule. ``It would be a
blessing if this child came a bit early, like this year,'' Canady
said.

NEW YORK: fancy craziness.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arkadiy Kagan, who immigrated to Brooklyn from Minsk five years
ago and covers the community for a Russian newspaper, said the
casinos in Atlantic City were a novelty to newcomers, to whom the
clang of the nickel slots sounded a lot like the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't available in the Soviet Union, you couldn't attend
casino,'' Kagan said. ``It's a fascination with freedom, with
wealth, which was prohibited in former Soviet Union. It's like
dream wealth. You are wealthy, you can spend money in casino. Even
if you spend $5 in 5-cent coins, it's like self-identification with
wealthy people.''
</P>
<P>
   With just 22 passengers, the bus Thursday was only half-filled,
perhaps because of the coming Christmas holiday. Most, like Murray
Hollander, were retired people who made small-change gambling a
hobby, faces familiar to one another from many trips south.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander, 72, has spent his entire life in Brooklyn. After his
open-heart surgery a quarter-century ago, he stopped working as an
accountant. Never married, siblings dead, Hollander goes to
Atlantic City as often as four times a week, as much to forget
about his gall bladder and prostate problems as in hopes of hitting
it big.
</P>
<P>
   Dice is his game. He plays enough to get complimentary rooms at
some of the casinos. Once, he won a couple thousand bucks. Then,
another time, he lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get away from the city,'' Hollander explained in a telephone
interview from his bed in the critical care unit of Memorial
Medical Center in South Amboy, N.J.. ``I'm all alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hollander had some paperwork to do, and almost stayed
home. But he got bored rattling around in his apartment, so he went
to the corner store where he catches the bus and hopped on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my mind up not to even go yesterday, but like a jerk, I
said, let me get out of here,'' Hollander said. ``If a thing is
going to happen, it happens. You can't regret anything in life. You
might as well say you're not going to go out during the day. I'm
not afraid. I do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said he was sitting in his favorite seat, directly
behind the bus driver, watching a comedian on the video screen,
when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrown, and all of a sudden I was in pain,'' said
Hollander, who was treated for severe chest trauma. ``I called for
help. I don't know who got me out. My mind was all confused. I
didn't know who I was or how I got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he added, ``how I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   But survival itself is bittersweet. The tragedy tore apart four
couples: Rosa Avrutsky, Fred Lewis, Mrs. Tsatskina and Shirley
Weiss were among the dead; their spouses are on the injured list.
Vladimir Avrutsky and Matvey Tsatskin were called upon to identify
the bodies of their wives, a state police officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The other fatalities were Michael Grumet and Paul Ludy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises were photographers, a childless couple who moved
into the large red-brick co-op building a block from Mrs.
Hirschhorn about five years ago and built a darkroom inside. When
they ate in a restaurant, they brought leftovers home for their
neighbors; their extensive collection of Disney paraphernalia
delighted the children of their friends down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time my grandchildren came, they would give them a toy
or little animals,'' said Bernice Geller, who lives in the
apartment next door. ``They brought us things from Atlantic City _
key chains, candies, little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as they began the arduous process of notifying next of
kin that stretched until 3:15 a.m. Friday, police knocked on Mrs.
Geller's door to tell her of the tragedy. Mrs. Geller let the
officers into the Lewis apartment, where they retrieved dozens of
messages off of the answering machine, so they would know which
friends to call. The phone had been ringing all day, Mrs. Geller
said, with people who knew the Lewises go to Atlantic City about
once a month, everyone wondering the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like glitter, like safe glitter,'' Mrs. Geller said to
explain the attraction of the place. ``You're safe there. Even an
older person or even a single person wasn't afraid to go there
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   For Minnie Hirschhorn, who walked with a cane and had an
apartment filled with her needlecrafts, Atlantic City was a
connection to her late husband, Sol, who taught her to play the
slots. In her widowhood, it filled the time when she wasn't sewing,
cooking, crocheting or reading the magazines that she generously
shared with the other elderly women who lived in her building. She
gave one neighbor the newspaper when she was finished; a family
down the hall got her coupon circulars.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Win a million, Minnie,' I'd always tell her. She said if she
won a million, I'd be the first to know,'' said a neighbor of Mrs.
Hirschhorn who declined to give her name. ``She really loved going
to Atlantic City. She died the way she lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leidner teased her about her passion. ``What are you, an
addict?'' she asked. ``If I liked sex that doesn't mean I'd become
a hooker.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jibes were loving, friend to friend. Mrs. Hirschhorn
always told her neighbor when she was going out of town and checked
in when she got home, her telephone call usually coming around 9
o'clock as Mrs. Leidner dozed in front of the television.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the night before the trip, several neighbors begged
her to reconsider. ``Don't you hear the radio, about the snow?''
Mrs. Leidner recalled asking. ``You're flirting with death.'' On
Christmas Day, when the list of fatalities was tallied, she wept at
her own prescience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a witch,'' Mrs. Leidner said. ``It's a terrible
thing. What can I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Hirschhorn and Hollander were especially partial to
the driver who was at the wheel for the deadly ride. Hollander said
that the driver, Russian-born Valentin Viner, always sped down the
Garden State Parkway, giving his passengers more time at the gaming
tables. Mrs. Hirschhorn told friends of his kindness in escorting
her safely into the lobby of her building at the end of the
journey. Once, with a different driver, she had tripped getting off
the bus and injured her foot.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in his hospital bed, Hollander wondered when he might be
back at the crap tables. He was never a high roller, but the
frequent trips to the Hilton and other hotels had earned him some
perquisites. For New Year's Eve, the casino had given him a
complimentary room, plus tickets to a show.
</P>
<P>
   He is not sure whether he will go.

 WASHINGTON: outpatient visits.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aides to Tipper Gore, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on
mental health issues, said she favored such legislation. Mrs. Gore,
wife of the vice president, has long championed the rights of
people with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Group Health Inc. of New York, like many insurers, has revised
some of its mental health benefits in response to the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annual and lifetime dollar limitations on mental health
benefits will be removed,'' the company said in a notice to
subscribers in its program for New York City government employees.
But it said, ``For outpatient care, the $900 annual maximum and the
$1,800 lifetime maximum will be replaced with a limit of up to 30
visits per year and 60 visits per lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Russo, director of GHI's program for New York City
employees, said the plan's mental health benefits were among the
most comprehensive offered anywhere. But Rep. Carolyn Maloney,
D-N.Y., said, ``While this level of benefits may be in technical
compliance with the Parity Act, it clearly violates the spirit of
the law, which was intended to ensure that physical and mental
illnesses would receive the same level of coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. illustrates another way some businesses have
responded to the law. The company had a lifetime limit of $1
million on medical benefits for any employee or dependent, and no
more than $300,000 of that amount could be spent on mental health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the lifetime ceiling of $1 million,'' said Paula
Wallace, the health benefits manager for Hewlett-Packard, ``but the
$300,000 limit for mental health was eliminated. We now have a
single lifetime limit of $1 million on physical and mental health
benefits combined, with no distinction between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has not experienced the sharp increase in costs
that many employers fear. ``Our mental health costs have been
stable through 1998,'' Ms. Wallace said, in part because the
company uses managed-care techniques to make sure patients receive
appropriate but not excessive services.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Guida Jr., vice president of the National Mental Health
Association, an advocate for people with mental disorders, said the
approach taken by Hewlett-Packard was ``consistent with the intent
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``many insurers and employers are taking steps to bypass the
federal law,'' Guida said, ``changing the structure of their
benefits to impose discriminatory inpatient and outpatient visit
limits in place of the previous spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have laws that require the same or similar
levels of coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Some of the
state laws, going further than the federal law, prohibit insurers
from setting higher deductibles or patient fees for mental health
care than for other medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Bachman, the actuary at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said health-care
plans often paid a smaller share of bills for mental treatment than
for other kinds of care. For example, he said, if a psychiatrist
submits a $90 bill for psychotherapy, the plan may count only $50
as an eligible expense and then may pay only 50 percent of that, or
$25. In contrast, Bachman said, if a family practitioner submits a
bill for $90, the insurer may pay 80 percent of that amount, or
$72.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law does not require employers to provide any mental
health benefits, but most companies that offer health insurance to
employees do cover some mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   An employer may obtain an exemption if it can show, with at
least six months of data, that compliance with the 1996 law has
caused an increase of 1 percent or more in the overall cost of its
employee health plan. But Labor Department officials said that only
four companies had requested such exemptions.

   LOS ANGELES _ On the Sunset Strip, the garish center of
Hollywood night life, strivers, dreamers and castaways line up
under the California sun for a show business version of a homespun
tradition, Christmas dinner at a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Laugh Factory's annual free Christmas feast for
budding actors, comedians, musicians, writers and other
entertainers who have come here to stake their claim but have found
themselves alone, unable or unwilling to return home for the
holidays. There's a full turkey dinner, stand-up comedy and the
camaraderie of fellow struggling entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   Charley De La Pena, an actor and comedian who came to the Laugh
Factory on Friday dressed as Santa Claus, said the dinner was a
nice respite from the struggle for success, or even just work. (``I
play 32 to 46,'' he said when asked his age.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays are a lonely time right now,'' said De La Pena,
who has been trying to make it big since he left San Antonio 25
years ago. ``This is a place for all the artists to laugh a little
bit, take a rest from pounding the pavement trying to get an acting
job that will take them to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Moskowitz, 52, of West Hollywood said he has been getting
by as a movie extra and paid audience member since he lost his job
in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice coming here, where you can meet other people in the
same profession as you, starving actors, that sort of thing,''
Moskowitz said. ``L.A. can be a big, plastic place, but at least
here you can meet other people, and they tend to be more open. And
the food's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Masada, the 38-year-old owner of the Laugh Factory, has
been offering the free dinners on Christmas, Thanksgiving and
Jewish holidays for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people come to this town with such big heart and hopes,
and all of a sudden the reality hits them in the face,'' Masada
said of his guests. ``All of a sudden it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Masada said, he served 1,600 people in four seatings.
</P>
<P>
   Masada estimates that the great majority of his Christmas guests
earn little as entertainers, and that a fifth or more are homeless.
Most come only a few times, but others return for years. One woman,
Masada said, came every year for more than a decade, each time
wearing the same holiday dress and bringing a taped-up photograph
of herself as an extra in a Clark Gable movie. Of the thousands who
have passed through his doors for holiday celebrations, perhaps 20
or 30 have achieved some kind of fame, said Masada, who won't name
names.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 1990 census figures, almost three-quarters of the
adults living in the Los Angeles region came from another state,
said Dowell Myers, who teaches demographics at the University of
Southern California. Looking at the diners Friday at the Laugh
Factory, it would seem those numbers could hold true for struggling
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   Elton White, 41, came to Los Angeles from Arkansas seven years
ago with his wife Betty, 72. They perform a song-and-dance routine
on public-access cable television and on the boardwalk in Venice
Beach, Calif., near their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place for people to get together on Christmas,''
White said of the dinner. ``It's a place for people who have no
other place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Laugh Factory, revelers can find a measure of holiday
cheer in one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fortunate but it's unfortunate,'' said Allen Terry, 60, a
former actor from New York who sells employment benefits to people
in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that you lack friends and family, but it's
fortunate you can make friends year after year at the Laugh
Factory.''

STAR OF NO. 1 UCONN PLAYS RECKLESSLY DESPITE CONSTANT PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Tenn.)  (rl) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ See Shea Ralph dive for a pass and land on the
floor. See Shea Ralph grapple for a rebound and land on the floor.
See Shea Ralph rumble in for a layup and land on the floor. The
basketball laugher between Connecticut and St. John's on Dec. 13
was barely 10 minutes old and Ralph had already tumbled to her
knees three times. See a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   Each time Ralph sprawled across the floor, fans at Gampel
Pavilion held onto their breath and their seats. They waited to
make sure Ralph would pop up and keep playing in her frenetic
style. Each time, Ralph jumped up. Each time, the fans exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I have played all my life and I think it makes
the game a lot more fun,'' Ralph said. ``It's more fun for me and
for the fans. I like playing that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's frequent flops and falls cause trepidation for UConn
loyalists because she has torn the anterior cruciate ligament in
her right knee twice in less than six months. The first tear came
in the first round of the NCAA tournament in 1997. Ralph missed
UConn's last three games. Five and a half months later, in a pickup
game, she tore the ligament again and missed all of last season. No
wonder Jerry Rice, another member of the twice-torn ACL club, is
her favorite athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rationalize the first time because it happens,'' said
Geno Auriemma, the Connecticut coach. ``But the amount of effort it
took to get back from the first one, then to have a second one,
what can you say? Some good will come out of this? Most people in
life don't deserve one. Who deserves two?''
</P>
<P>
   No one does. But Ralph, 20, has endured the double dose of
depression and returned after more than a year without basketball
to help guide the Huskies (8-0) to the No. 1 ranking in the
country. Ralph, who plays both shooting guard and small forward, is
second on the team in scoring (16.5 points a game) and is one of
the candidates to switch to point guard to replace Sue Bird, who
tore her ACL last week and will miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph has already counseled Bird about what to expect after she
has surgery next week. She can tell Bird about the six-hour
rehabilitation stints, the uncertainty over whether she will be the
same player and the need to stay mentally strong. She might not
talk about the discomfort, which is more aggravating the second
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got constant pain from it,'' said Marsha Mann Lake,
Ralph's mother, who was an all-American at North Carolina in 1975.
``She has to get up and walk when she's on a plane, and she can't
sit through a movie. People don't know these things. She's going to
have arthritis and some trouble walking when she gets older, but
it's all worth it because she can play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Reckless is the only way Ralph can play. With her blue eyes
bulging, the veins in her neck straining and a bushel of blond hair
bouncing behind her like a tail, Ralph bumps bodies, barrels up and
down the court and grimaces when teammates are out of position. She
treats each possession as if it may be the last before someone
closes the gym. And with one nasty twist of her knee, it might be
for Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate playing a lot more,'' said Ralph, who could only
watch as UConn expired one victory short of the Final Four in each
of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something you love taken away from you and you
have to sit and watch other people do it, that really, really
stinks really bad. That made me realize that I can't take anything
in life for granted. You need to make the best of what you got on
any particular day,'' she said. ``When it's over, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ralph still plays the same after the injuries and works
even harder because she is not as quick, she no longer thinks the
same way. The injuries caused something to happen to the basketball
junkie who averaged 33 points a game in her high school career and
holds 17 state records in North Carolina. Ralph realized that
basketball is not life.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, professional basketball is an attainable goal. And it is
something Ralph has thought about since she was 7 and already had a
crossover dribble. But she has perspective now. She has changed her
major from physical therapy to exercise physiology and wants to
attend medical school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the WNBA is a great opportunity and a great way
to make money,'' said Ralph, who is a sophomore in terms of
athletic eligibility. ``If I were to be offered it, I might play
for a couple of years. But I have plans. I have another life I want
to live. My whole life has been basketball. I want to have a real
job. I want to have a big family, kids and a nice house. Like what
normal people do, that's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph may have changed, but not on the court. She is still one
of the most valuable players on a talented team that is eager to
face Tennessee, the defending national champion, on Jan. 10. She
could still make history with her mother by becoming the first
mother-daughter tandem to be named all-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma said intensity is what sets Ralph apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes Shea so unique and so valuable isn't
necessarily her skill level, although she has some things that she
does that are hard to teach,'' Auriemma said. ``Her ball handling,
her shooting and her ability are not above average in any sense.
But, because of the intensity level she brings and the way she
plays the game, the recklessness and the fearlessness that she
brings, that's what makes her better than most players.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph is a bubbly sort who chewed on a slice of pizza outside
Gampel Pavilion after the 91-51 pasting of St. John's and made fun
of her 24-hour passion for athletics and academics. She said she
has a boyfriend who plays soccer for Connecticut, but called it a
``whacked-out relationship'' because their crammed schedules seldom
allow them to see each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph does not eat meat; she has a tattoo of a basketball inside
a sunflower on her left ankle and she became giddy as she talked
about an Alan Jackson compact disc that she wanted to play in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a way to turn the sunny Ralph sullen. When she was
asked if her knee hurt her constantly, she paused a few seconds, as
if trying to formulate a response that would not sound like a
complaint. Finally, Ralph admitted that it does. She quickly said
that all athletes endure pain.
</P>
<P>
   Not all 20-year-old athletes, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember what it was like before I got injured
because I didn't have any of the pain that I have now,'' Ralph
said. ``I had to teach myself to come in every day and forget
about: `Do my knees hurt? I can't bend them and they're swollen.'
You have to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like people to say I play like I really love the game,''
Ralph said. ``I'm probably never going to be an all-American. The
things I do are not all-American-type things. I'm not a
highlight-film girl. But I do play hard and that's what I want
people to see.''

 &HT;    Chat drives the internet
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the Internet became the world's largest shopping
mall, chat _ live typed conversations in cyberspace _ was driving
its growth.
</P>
<P>
   It still is.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was launched by founder Steve Case with the idea
that people all over the world want to talk to each other, and he's
right. Next to e-mail, chat is still the most popular feature on
AOL. Members regularly chat about politics, books, romance and what
they had for dinner last night. Christmas Day was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter Communications, teens are the largest group
of online chatters. Jupiter reports that more than 42 percent of
wired teens chat regularly, as do 26 per cent of online young
adults. Seniors spend the least time chatting online, with only 10
percent chatting regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers were spending the holiday in a variety of chat rooms
discussing everything from parents to rock music.
</P>
<P>
   The Entertainment Asylum Teen Chat was busy Christmas Day, with
teens typing in all the lyrics to Adam Sandler's Hanukkah song and
talking about what they got for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In AOL's Electra Teen chat area (keyword Electra), an entire
area was devoted to helping teenage girls beat the holiday blues.
Electra's teen area encourages young women to draw pictures and
write stories and poetry to help express their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Electra's ``Dear Santa'' area asked girls to finish the
sentence: ``All I Want for Christmas Is....''
</P>
<P>
   One teen hoped for health and happiness for her grandparents and
her friends in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my parents to be happy and healthy ... And (for) all of
my cousins, aunts and uncles to be happy and healthy in the coming
year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, for herself she had a more immediate wish. She wants a
chance to meet pop group 'NSYNC ``so I can tell Justin how much I
love him. ... Oh yeah, and I want to be healthy and happy in the
coming year. (But) what I want for Christmas is for 'NSYNC to come
to my door and serenade me.That would be the best thing ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were hoping the new year wouldn't be too traumatic. ``I
just want my best friend not to be mad at me and my dad to get the
job proposal but not for us to move,'' typed one teen.
</P>
<P>
   Others had set up two chat areas: ``Family Members I Can't Wait
to See and ``Family Members I'll Be Hiding From.'' And you don't
have to be a teenager to relate to either discussion. Few teens
were looking forward to a swarm of grandparents aunts, uncles and
cousins all asking them how school was. ``Every one of my cousins
hides from (my aunt and uncle), and I'll be joining them this
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Day looked like business as usual in the other AOL
chat rooms. Thirty-one political junkies took time out that
afternoon to log into AOL political chat room ``The Podium,''
continuing to argue about the Clinton impeachment scandal.
Conversation was fast and furious, and nobody stopped to wish
anybody a Merry Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get real and deal with the struggle of everyday
life, there is just an outpouring of emotion,'' says AOL's Jesse
Kornbluth, who describes AOL's chat and message boards as ``a
national water cooler.''

EDITORIAL: THE CHICO MENDES LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Chico Mendes was not an environmentalist in the traditional
sense. It was only three years before his murder, which was 10
years ago this week, that he met environmentalists and learned with
amazement that the Amazon Forest mattered to those far away. As
head of Brazil's National Council of Rubber Tappers, his concerns
were the tappers who were being forced off their land and killed in
disputes with invading ranchers. But Mendes probably did more than
any other person to preserve the Amazon. Although it has been
burning faster than ever since his death, his ideas and
organizational skills have led to new policies and ways of thinking
about the forest that provide the basis for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes was a full-time tapper at 11, the son and grandson of
rubber tappers. He led the local union in his state of Acre at a
time when small farmers and ranchers from Brazil's south were
invading the forest and claiming land, which they burned. Mendes
and a colleague, the anthropologist Mary Allegretti, came up with
the idea of extractive reserves _ forest land set aside by the
government to be managed cooperatively by locals, who kept it
healthy while gathering its rubber, nuts and other products to
sell. Mendes was shot to death by two ranchers who had claimed some
of the land marked for one such reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the disputes over land and the killings have diminished.
The federal government has set aside about 7.5 million acres of the
Amazon as extractive reserves, and some state governments are doing
the same. In the state of Amapa, which has been run for four years
by one of Mendes' colleagues, 30 percent of the territory is
protected and deforestation has virtually stopped. Amapa's
government buys Brazil nuts from the reserves for school lunches
and is helping to finance nut processing plants and other projects
to make the reserves viable. Mendes' allies recently won the
governorship of Acre state, and hold several Senate seats and many
state government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes also created a lasting change in attitudes about the
Amazon, in Brazil and all over the world. He lobbied the World Bank
in a donated, ill-fitting suit, and the bank, which once financed
roads to make the Amazon easier to cut down, is now financing
extractive reserves. Brazil's government has ended its subsidies
for cattle ranchers buying Amazon land. It can now monitor forest
destruction, and has given more powers to the environmental
agencies that can protect the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes' allies are trying to hold back deforestation against
tremendous obstacles. One is globalization, which has brought a
wave of Asian logging companies to the Amazon. Brazilian rubber,
which now must compete on world markets, is too cheap to provide
the tappers with a decent living.
</P>
<P>
   There is also weather. The droughts caused by El Nino _ in turn
intensified by the destruction of the Amazon _ have dried out the
forest, allowing fires to spread uncontrollably. While last year's
rate of deforestation was a sharp drop from previous years, it
remains alarmingly high. In the 1990s, an area that averages the
size of Massachusetts has been burned every year.
</P>
<P>
   The preservationists must also contend with the clout of
ranchers, an important part of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's governing coalition. They have been able to gut many new
laws to improve forest protection and keep ones that have passed
from being fully carried out. According to Brazil's Catholic
Church, Mendes was one of 982 activists murdered in land disputes
in the Amazon between 1964 and 1988, the vast majority by ranchers'
hired guns. Eight people were convicted, all triggermen except in
Mendes' case. Even his killers, Darly Alves and his son Darci
Alves, who have since been recaptured, walked out of prison two
years into their 19-year terms.

<HEADLINE>
COMMENTARY: SCANDALS SANS BIMBOS NEED NOT APPLY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't believe all those year-end lamentations about a divided
nation. As we close the book on 1998, there remains one common
cultural denominator that does unite us all: sex.
</P>
<P>
   We have a sex-addicted president, a sex-obsessed independent
counsel, sex-crazed media and a public so entranced by sex that not
even McGwire and Sosa can entice us to spend more dollars on major
league baseball than we do on videos rated XXX. To each American,
apparently, his or her own home run.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with sex as the reigning national pastime, though,
is that it uses up all our oxygen. A brain fixated on sex _ even to
moralize against it _ has no room for anything else. Non-Monica
news and governance disappeared this year, as did the potentially
grave non-Monica Clinton scandals. Not even lethal wag-the-dogging
of Afghanistan and the Sudan could stand in the way of all flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Sex now rules so completely that politicians may soon become
invisible unless they are exposed having illicit sex or are
fulminating against someone else caught with his pants down. This
month three of President Clinton's foremost adversaries _ Sen.
Trent Lott, Rep. Bob Barr and Rep. Dan Burton _ have been tarred by
scandals that only yesterday would have caused a major public and
media uproar. But G-rated misbehavior now merits only yawns.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Barr have both been revealed as fawning speakers at
events sponsored by the Council of Conservative Citizens, a
white-supremacist, immigrant-bashing organization that even David
Keene, head of the American Conservative Union, has labeled racist.
Among other beliefs, the Council proselytizes that interracial
marriage ``amounts to white genocide'' and that Jews have ``turned
spite into welfare billions for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were outed for their involvement with this group, both
politicians dutifully repudiated its views and then instigated
cover-ups to try to camouflage the extent of their actual
relationships with it. Barr, who gave the keynote address at the
group's June meeting, dismissed his appearance as ``brief''; his
story has since been demolished in excruciating detail by Jason
Zengerle of The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lott vowed he had ``no firsthand knowledge of the
group's views'' _ a denial that became inoperative after Thomas
Edsall of The Washington Post came across a 1992 newsletter in
which the senator is pictured telling its members they ``stand for
the right principles and the right philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's lying about racism compared with lying about sex?
Though two black columnists, Colbert I. King of The Washington Post
and Stanley Crouch of New York's Daily News, have tried to generate
outrage about this story, there are few takers in a market in which
sex is the only currency. No ``indiscretions'' or ``improper
relationship,'' no scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The same neglect may well befall the latest revelations about
Dan Burton, the pit-bull congressman who became an instant
All-Monica news headliner when he revealed a few months ago that he
had fathered a love child. This week in Salon, reporter Russ Baker
alleges that Burton's sexual peccadilloes may be matched by abuse
of the same campaign fund-raising laws that were at the center of
the botched House hearings he held to nail Bill Clinton and Al
Gore. Some of the many Salon findings, drawn from interviews with
more than 120 sources, have been amplified in The Washington Post
and The Indianapolis Star. But the notion that Burton may have
dialed for dollars (and perhaps foreign dollars at that) on federal
premises or put a campaign manager (and part-time clown) on the
House payroll is so far at most a blip on the national radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Christmas Eve edition of USA Today pictures
head shots of four likely presidential candidates _ Lamar
Alexander, John Ashcroft, George W. Bush and Dan Quayle _ who have
already declared their marital fidelity. In the accompanying
article, a religious-right leader favored by the GOP, the Rev. Lou
Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition, promises that he'll
ask all impending candidates if they are now or have ever been
adulterers.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where all values, traditional and otherwise, lead
to sex, why even bother to ask if any aspiring president has been a
bigot or crook?

YEAR IN MEDIA HAD LESS LINGERIE, LESS GIFFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The year 1997 wasn't an especially good one
for some members of the sports media, what with Marv Albert's
dressing, Gary Miller's tinkling and Frank Gifford's groping.
Things were a bit better in 1998, so our year-end sports media
best/worst list is appropriately kinder and gentler.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest TV loss: It came when Keith Jackson announced that this
season would be his last broadcasting college football on ABC.
Somehow, Saturday afternoons in the fall will never be the same.
Imagine anyone else introducing the game of the year with one of
those scene-setting, pregame monologues Jackson made famous.
Imagine anyone else coming up with colorful phrases like, ``Whoa,
Nellie!'', and those ``big uglies'' on the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Best TV comeback: Maybe it's having a new partner, Boomer
Esiason, in the booth. Maybe it's the motivation from having your
job constantly threatened. Whatever it is, Dan Dierdorf has had an
All-Pro season on ``Monday Night Football''. In recent years,
Dierdorf at times has seemed on auto pilot, but this season he
appears rejuvenated. His energy level is up, he seems better
prepared, and his comments and humor both have been far sharper.
Now, if he can only get off those bank-loan commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Most embarrassing TV gig: As noted, last year was a bad one for
former golden boy Gifford. That was mostly because of that ugly
off-the-field incident that got into the tabloids. This year wasn't
a great one on the air. Bounced from the MNF booth to a remote
studio in a Baltimore sports bar as a reporter on ``Monday Night
Blast'', Giff had little to do and he looked uncomfortable doing
it. Left to twist in the wind, he did manage to carry on,
preserving his dignity, if not his career.
</P>
<P>
   Best trend in sports TV: Sports documentaries. This year,
viewers have been treated to riveting specials on subjects ranging
from the CCNY college basketball point-shaving scandal in the
1950s, to the dark side of prize fighter Sugar Ray Robinson, to the
deterioration of Fresno State University's 1997-98 basketball
season. Encore! Encore!
</P>
<P>
   Worst trend in TV sports: The now omnipresent camera shots of
NFL defensive and offensive coordinators working in the booth
during games. What's so informative or entertaining about watching
some grim-faced guy sitting at a desk doodling on a piece of paper?
</P>
<P>
   Biggest I-told-you-so: The second-guessers had a good time when
George Seifert was supplanted on the ``NFL Today'' by CBS
executives in midseason. All along, skeptics had said the taciturn
former San Francisco 49ers coach was a bad fit for a TV show that
requires lots of arm-flapping and blather. They were right. Of
course, it didn't help that his sidemates, fellow rookies Brent
Jones and Marcus Allen, were equally unprepared for their roles.
</P>
<P>
   Most endearing interview of the year: After the Vikings'
Thanksgiving Day thrashing of the Cowboys at Texas Stadium, a print
reporter asked Minnesota star receiver Randy Moss for a comment.
Moss replied that he wouldn't, noting, ``You're not TV.'' So much
for that new, improved image.
</P>
<P>
   Most welcome return: Keith Olbermann, who admitted that he'd
made a move he could no longer live with when he left the field of
sports broadcasting for the world of Monica Lewinsky at MSNBC.
Which is why he has since returned to sports in his new job at Fox
Sports Net, bringing his special brand of sass with him. Olbermann
is on a long-term contract, so don't expect him to move to The
Learning Channel anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Most noteworthy book by a local athlete: ``Power, Money and
Sex'' by Deion Sanders. So it's not great literature. But how can
you resist a book that in its opening chapter leaves you dangling,
literally, on an edge of a cliff? And, really, who's better suited
to write an autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Most ill-advised sports commentary: ``Kansas City Star'' sports
columnist Jason Whitlock, goaded by New England Patriots fans
during a Chiefs' game at Foxboro Stadium in October, displayed
two-handwritten signs from the press box in response. One read:
``It's warm in here _ good-looking women, too.'' The second
included the question: ``Bledsoe gay?''
</P>
<P>
   Second most ill-advised sports commentary: Locked-out NBA
mega-star Karl Malone going on air during his new sports talk radio
gig in Los Angeles and demanding a trade from the Utah Jazz, saying
he felt unappreciated. Some mail, Karl, is best left undelivered.

FROGS' KICKER WORTHY OF GLASS SLIPPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU's football team boards an airplane bound
for El Paso this morning, a journey covering nearly 650 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Dennis Franchione and his Horned Frogs have come much
further to earn a spot in a bowl game. In a span of a single season
and a single coach, TCU has gone from bowl wallflower at 1-10 to
Sun Bowl belle at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have names for turnarounds like TCU's _ Cinderella
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And in a season loaded with feel-good Frog fairy tales, Chris
Kaylakie might best them all.
</P>
<P>
   Only instead of a glass slipper, Kaylakie has a golden toe.
</P>
<P>
   His fairy-tale season includes game-winning field goals and
all-Western Athletic Conference honors as a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Kaylakie's been sort of symbolic of our Cinderella
year,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaylakie came to practice last spring looking for a chance to
try a couple of field goals, a walk-on hardly hopes for anything
more.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione looked around and found he had few options. Mr.
All-World Michael Reeder had graduated, and Kaylakie got his
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew some areas where there were voids, no tight ends, no
kickers,'' Franchione said. ``It was one of the positions where we
were starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kaylakie: ``I was just looking to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring proved to be less than expected for both sides, with
Kaylakie having an up-and-down camp.
</P>
<P>
   He remained TCU's No. 1 option heading into two-a-days because
few options existed.
</P>
<P>
   An ``unknown,'' TCU special-teams coach Mark Tommerdahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect that first game,'' Tommerdahl
said. ``I guess you never know what to expect with a kicker until
you get them out under the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaylakie had a 23-yard field goal in TCU's season-opening
victory against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   In Week 2, he accounted for all of TCU's points in a 10-9 loss
against Oklahoma. He went 3-for-3 on field-goal attempts, including
a long of 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd get pretty nervous, still does,'' Frogs holder Jeff Dover
said. ``I think after Oklahoma, though, he learned that he could do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably, his biggest test came two weeks later against
Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   TCU trailed 13-10 with five seconds remaining. Franchione waved
Kaylakie in for a 50-yard attempt, which he booted through for his
longest field goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird to look at the highlight tape of the season, you
see everybody on the sidelines hands go up before it even gets
there,'' Kaylakie said. ``I knew, or at least I thought I knew, but
until it went through I wasn't sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season 15-for-20 on field goals, earning all-WAC
honors and acclaim from various newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-around unbelievable season,'' Kaylakie said. ``It has
exceeded my wildest expectations and then some. I'm playing, we're
going to a bowl game. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Kaylakie, like all of his teammates, returned from a brief
holiday break, his presents already opened and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Another awaits him, though, when he steps onto TCU's airplane
this morning. A late gift, so to speak _ Franchione plans to tell
him he's earned a scholarship for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rewarding to see a young man who has in and over
considerable odds proceeded to earn the respect of his teammates
and coaches.''

SMITH STILL SEARCHING FOR RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ On the Friday afternoon before the Cowboys went
to Kansas City two weeks ago, public relations director Rich
Dalrymple had a request for running back Emmitt Smith, who needed
one rushing touchdown to break a tie with Marcus Allen for the
all-time career mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV guys want to interview you just in case you break the
record,'' Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case?'' Smith said, laughing. ``I just need one.
Where's your confidence, Rich?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith still needs that one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He has been stuck on 123 career rushing touchdowns since he
rushed for three on Thanksgiving Day against Minnesota. Because
reserve running back Chris Warren is out for the year, Smith will
probably get several opportunities to break the record tomorrow
night in the season finale against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has 11 rushing touchdowns this season, fourth in the NFL
behind Denver's Terrell Davis (21), Atlanta's Jamal Anderson (13),
and Jacksonville rookie Fred Taylor (13). Super Nate The Cowboys
might be long shots to make the Super Bowl, but guard Nate Newton
guarantees he will be in Miami next month.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cowboys don't make Super Bowl XXXIII, Newton said
he'll encourage a lot of his younger teammates to join him in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to know what it's like,'' Newton said. ``I went to
the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay \RJanuary 1991\S. Man, going there,
feeling that atmosphere. It inspired me for the next year. That's
where you want to be. You want to be the only one being watched in
the whole world.'' Garrett due a raise A loss by the Cowboys
tomorrow would void the final year on backup quarterback Jason
Garrett's contract and make him a free agent. A clause in Garrett's
contract gave him the option to become a free agent if he led the
team to a record that was better than the team's record in all
games at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett led the club to a 3-2 record when Troy Aikman was out
with a fractured collarbone. That's a .600 winning percentage. The
Cowboys, at 9-6, are at .600 now. A win would put them at .620, a
loss at .562.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Cowboys win, the club could allow Garrett to
become a free agent and let him shop his services to the highest
bidder next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we end up with a better record based on percentage
points, we'd still consider tearing up his contract,'' team owner
Jerry Jones said.

EDITORIAL: WHAT PRICE DIGITAL TELEVISION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress gave the nation's broadcasters a $70
billion national asset by awarding them, without charge, additional
channels for broadcasting digital signals, including
high-definition television. This huge giveaway barely made a ripple
on the evening news. It was not until the Senate majority leader at
the time, Bob Dole, bravely complained about ``corporate welfare''
to the big media corporations that Congress and the communications
megapowers agreed that yes, of course, the public should indeed get
something back from the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House offered to create a commission named after Vice
President Gore to hash out the possibilities. Unfortunately, that
is what the Gore commission has now returned _ a hash of proposals,
a vague jumble of voluntary suggestions. In effect, the
public-interest advocates on the commission were divided over how
best to pay back the public for handing over these airwaves, and
the broadcasters conquered.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this confusion so disturbing is that without a
committed focus on how they must serve the public trust, these
media companies can all too easily fall into the gravitational
force of ratings, bottom lines and stock prices. Under such
pressures, too many broadcasters could shove political debates or
educational programs into the night-watch hours or drop such
programs altogether. For those looking for solutions, the
commission report must be read as a list of suggestions that need
more debate and detail.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation deserving more investigation would eventually
double the number of public television channels in most
communities. When broadcasters complete the transition to digital,
the law now says they must return their old analog channels over
which they broadcast free now. Although some critics fear that
Congress will eventually allow the broadcasters to stall the return
of these channels, the commission has suggested that when the time
comes to return them, only public television stations should be
able to keep both _ the new digital and the old analog channels.
</P>
<P>
   As this digital system becomes reality, operators are also
learning that instead of one high-definition channel, they can
break the signal into six or more channels. The Federal
Communications Commission should consider a suggestion that if
broadcasters engage in this ``multiplexing,'' they be required to
pay for using all the channels or use some for education or
public-interest programs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the commission suggests a voluntary system of giving
five minutes of free time a night to political candidates in the
month before elections. Five minutes a night would be a major
increase in political coverage for some local stations that turn to
politics only when they run out of crime. But the question is
whether people who resist giving candidates their due _ unless they
pay for ads _ would parcel out even these mite-sized time slots
voluntarily. The FCC should require at least some free air time for
candidates in exchange for all these free channels to broadcasters.

DESPITE RULES CHANGES, DOMINANCE IN THE NET PREVAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the NHL decided this summer to trim two
feet from three sides around its goaltenders, rulemakers were
hoping to alleviate the league's biggest image problem _ a lack of
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of the cutbacks _ which included cutting two
feet from each side of the goal crease and giving goal-scorers two
more feet behind the net _ NHL goalies are finding they have more
than one good leg left to stand on.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 10 weeks of the season, goal-scoring is at 5.2
goals per game, down about .1 goals from last season. What's more,
two-time NHL most valuable player Dominik Hasek is making a run at
a hat trick. The Buffalo Sabres goalie has posted numbers obscene
to fans of offensive hockey. If his 1.72 goals-per-game average and
.945 save percentage hold up throughout the season, it would be the
best posted in the modern-day NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're proving it more than ever this season, the
goalies are the best players in the game right now,'' former Stars
goalie Andy Moog said.
</P>
<P>
   While Moog's assessment comes from the goaltenders' perspective,
it's backed by hard statistics and a few supporters from the
non-goaltender crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the systems obviously play a role, but I think you
have to say the goalies are getting better,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``If you watch games, there are some great scoring
opportunities, and goalies simply stop more of them. That's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the goaltender's job is both easier and more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to some degree because while scoring opportunities
appear good, they often come from the perimeter or as first shots
on odd-man rushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those aren't the best scoring chances,'' Moog said.
``Shots are probably about the same, but I think real, legitimate
scoring chances are down.''
</P>
<P>
   The job is more difficult because the expectations on
goaltenders _ and the corresponding pressure _ is greatly
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting now that one goal is like a mountain, especially
if it's a first goal or a soft goal,'' said Ken Dryden, president
of the Toronto Maple Leafs and a Hall of Fame goalie. ``That's too
much pressure. That's what happened to \Rformer goalie\S Felix
Potvin here. You can't play the game when there's pressure like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, goalies are playing well under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do it, there's several guys waiting to take your
place,'' Moog said.
OLDER AND WISER Patrick Roy led the NHL with a 2.36 goals-against
average in 1991-92, a season before he would lead Montreal to his
second Stanley Cup title with the Canadiens. Ed Belfour led the NHL
with a 2.47 GAA in 1990-91 _ the year he won the Calder Trophy as
rookie of the year and the Vezina Trophy as best NHL goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some eight years later, the goalies who are scheduled to
meet at 8 tonight in a game between Roy's Colorado Avalanche and
Belfour's Stars are punching up better numbers. Roy has a 2.19 GAA
and Belfour a 2.00, yet they aren't considered the best in the game
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way of the NHL goaltending wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a better goalie than I was then,'' said Belfour,
33. ``I think you learn to think the game more, you learn from
experience. And now that I'm injury free, I'd say I'm in as good a
shape as I've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, also 33, is sending a message to those who felt he was
finished. Roy stumbled out of the gate this season, going 1-6-1 and
allowing 30 goals in his first eight starts _ a GAA of almost 4.00.
Since, he has a 1.57 GAA in his past 17 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all feel we're getting better,'' said Maple Leafs
goalie Curtis Joseph, 31. ``Goalies mature at a later age.''
</P>
<P>
   Improved training techniques combined with a better
self-awareness concerning conditioning results in a dangerous mix:
goalies who have the minds of 32-year-olds and the bodies of
25-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real evolution,'' said Moog, who retired last
season at 38 after posting the three top GAAs in his career after
the age of 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in my day, you put the guy in goal who couldn't skate or
was too small to play another position. Goaltending was the last
consideration,'' Moog said. ``But as time progressed, more and more
of the good athletes wanted to play goal. More coaches started
putting their biggest players in goal. And as a result, you have
the goaltenders of today.''
</P>
<P>
   Those players include a nimble Hasek, the 6-foot-2 New Jersey
Devils goalie Martin Brodeur or the 6-3 Washington Capitals goalie
Olaf Kolzig. To keep up with those athletes, goaltenders realized
they had to condition themselves on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have the older goalies who are trying to keep up with
the younger goalies and the younger goalies trying to keep up with
the older goalies,'' Moog said.
</P>
<P>
   And the cycle of competition has improved the goaltender
position as a whole. Add to the mix the fact that the impact of
overseas goaltenders is catching up to the impact of overseas
scorers and you have an even deeper talent pool from which to draw
a netminder.
</P>
<P>
   While Hasek (Czech Republic) has won four of the past five
Vezina Trophies, he had been alone as a European standout in the
NHL. Now, Russia's Nikolai Khabibulin is shining with the Phoenix
Coyotes (13-4-2, 1.88 GAA); Kolzig (Germany) helped the Capitals to
the Stanley Cup Finals last season; and the New York Islanders
Tommy Salo (Sweden) has posted five shutouts this season.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, backup goalies such as the Stars' Roman Turek
(Czech Republic) and the Hurricanes' Arturs Irbe (Latvia) are
pushing the No. 1 goalies to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more opportunities for goaltenders because of
expansion,'' Dryden said. ``And more goaltenders are taking
advantage of their opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The goalies have been so good, the NHL not only took two feet
from each side of the crease, it also started nipping and tucking
at the goalies' equipment. The NHL has tightened measurements on
all pad surfaces, and even pants and jerseys, which goalies were
using to take away precious inches of available net space.
</P>
<P>
   If you take a big guy and hang a big jersey on him, the net can
look awfully small _ something the NHL wants to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was needed,'' Dryden said. ``The equipment had gotten so
big that the shooters were losing confidence and the goalies were
gaining confidence. When that happens, you get a cycle that leads
to less goal-scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   And goalies, at least publicly, are saying they like the harsher
standards, although they're not so keen on the NHL fining teams
$100,000 and suspending goalies for one game without pay if he is
discovered to have cheated and used oversized equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to worry about the shooters improving their
equipment, but I guess that's the game,'' Joseph said. ``Really, I
like the rules. Now, you know that everyone is on the same level.
You don't have to wonder about the guy at the other end of the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   That concern was something Moog, generously listed at 5-9, said
he used to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were some goalies who obviously took advantage
of every opportunity to used bigger equipment,'' Moog said. ``And I
think some of those goalies are struggling now.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy has proven with his recent hot streak that the whispers
about his large pads might have been exaggerated. However, players
such as Kolzig and the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd have
struggled, leading to some speculation that taking away their
bigger pads has resulted in mental adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about any player in particular, but if you had
big pads and you had to go to smaller pads, I think there would be
a mental adjustment,'' Moog said.
</P>
<P>
   But those players are the exception to the rule. Today's
goaltenders are instead eating up the NHL's repeated restrictions
and spitting them out like another puck that couldn't make it to
the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goalies are just good,'' Moog said. ``They spent the past
four years changing the rules and trying to prove otherwise, and
they haven't done it yet. It's not too hard to figure it out.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE, THE TRIAL OF A LIFETIME
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: also see IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW, which will move Saturday
morning)  
 (bl)  
By DOROTHY J. SAMUELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of this holiday season's most sought-after books is an
out-of-print 1992 tome on impeachment called ``Grand Inquests.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas it was the 37th most requested title on
Amazon.com, the online bookstore, and there was a double-digit
waiting list at the midtown branch of the New York Public Library
to check it out. Demand is such that William Morrow's Quill
division plans to re-issue a paperback version of the book next
month.
</P>
<P>
   This interest probably owes less to the timeliness of the book's
subject matter than to the job held by its amateur-historian
author, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But readers looking for
clear signals on how the Supreme Court's conservative leader would
preside over a Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton will
probably be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The book recounts the impeachment trials of Supreme Court
Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 and President Andrew Johnson 63 years
later. Rehnquist sees the acquittals in both cases as major
constitutional events that preserved the separation of powers
between the three branches of government. Had the decisions gone
the other way, he says, it would have undermined the framers'
vision of a strong presidency and an independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   At least implicitly, the chief justice endorses the principle
that impeachment is a momentous act that should be reserved for
grievous abuses of office. But whether he believes that Clinton's
transgressions may fall into that category is unknowable from the
book, and may never be known, given his penchant for
circumspection.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrating aspect of the book is its glancing treatment of
the role played by Salmon Chase, the chief justice who presided
unhappily at the Johnson trial. There were bitter fights over some
of Chase's evidentiary rulings, and he is largely remembered for
helping to steer the Senate to the right conclusion. Rehnquist
observes ``how difficult and unwieldy'' it was to have the trial's
initial procedural questions decided by a 56-member Senate, made up
of lawmakers who were ``by nature loquacious.'' But he does so
without shedding light on how actively he might intervene at the
Clinton trial to resolve procedural and evidentiary questions.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote the court's unanimous 1993 decision in a
judicial removal case confirming that the Senate's ``sole power to
try all impeachments'' includes unreviewable discretion to set the
rules. He therefore seems apt to defer to the Senate on any motion
that touches on the merits of the charges against Clinton or that
calls for dismissing them without further consideration by the
body.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing that any of his rulings can be overridden if a
majority of senators disagrees may temper concerns about intruding
on the Senate's turf and embolden the chief justice to be more
opinionated than his inclination toward minimal judicial
intervention suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Though a genial man, in the courtroom he is brusque, impatient
and a legendary stickler for enforcing time limits, even to the
point of interrupting advocates in mid-syllable and ordering them
to sit down. The Senate chamber and the hybrid political and
judicial impeachment process are a far cry from the controlled
environment of the court.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rehnquist surely knows, this is the case of a lifetime.
He can be expected to move the trial along at a crisp pace. He can
also be expected to use the formidable consensus-building skills he
has displayed in recent years to try to guide the Senate to conduct
itself fairly _ even if as a justice he has not shown much concern
for defendants' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the power he exercises on the court, many Americans do
not even know what Rehnquist looks like. That may be about to
change. As a student of history, he is no doubt energized by the
challenge of running a televised impeachment trial. But as the
person most responsible for preventing television coverage of the
Supreme Court's oral arguments, he cannot relish losing his
cherished ability to walk through crowds unnoticed.

EDITORIAL: THE CHICO MENDES LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to correct header coding. No text changes.)  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Chico Mendes was not an environmentalist in the traditional
sense. It was only three years before his murder, which was 10
years ago this week, that he met environmentalists and learned with
amazement that the Amazon Forest mattered to those far away. As
head of Brazil's National Council of Rubber Tappers, his concerns
were the tappers who were being forced off their land and killed in
disputes with invading ranchers. But Mendes probably did more than
any other person to preserve the Amazon. Although it has been
burning faster than ever since his death, his ideas and
organizational skills have led to new policies and ways of thinking
about the forest that provide the basis for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes was a full-time tapper at 11, the son and grandson of
rubber tappers. He led the local union in his state of Acre at a
time when small farmers and ranchers from Brazil's south were
invading the forest and claiming land, which they burned. Mendes
and a colleague, the anthropologist Mary Allegretti, came up with
the idea of extractive reserves _ forest land set aside by the
government to be managed cooperatively by locals, who kept it
healthy while gathering its rubber, nuts and other products to
sell. Mendes was shot to death by two ranchers who had claimed some
of the land marked for one such reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the disputes over land and the killings have diminished.
The federal government has set aside about 7.5 million acres of the
Amazon as extractive reserves, and some state governments are doing
the same. In the state of Amapa, which has been run for four years
by one of Mendes' colleagues, 30 percent of the territory is
protected and deforestation has virtually stopped. Amapa's
government buys Brazil nuts from the reserves for school lunches
and is helping to finance nut processing plants and other projects
to make the reserves viable. Mendes' allies recently won the
governorship of Acre state, and hold several Senate seats and many
state government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes also created a lasting change in attitudes about the
Amazon, in Brazil and all over the world. He lobbied the World Bank
in a donated, ill-fitting suit, and the bank, which once financed
roads to make the Amazon easier to cut down, is now financing
extractive reserves. Brazil's government has ended its subsidies
for cattle ranchers buying Amazon land. It can now monitor forest
destruction, and has given more powers to the environmental
agencies that can protect the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes' allies are trying to hold back deforestation against
tremendous obstacles. One is globalization, which has brought a
wave of Asian logging companies to the Amazon. Brazilian rubber,
which now must compete on world markets, is too cheap to provide
the tappers with a decent living.
</P>
<P>
   There is also weather. The droughts caused by El Nino _ in turn
intensified by the destruction of the Amazon _ have dried out the
forest, allowing fires to spread uncontrollably. While last year's
rate of deforestation was a sharp drop from previous years, it
remains alarmingly high. In the 1990s, an area that averages the
size of Massachusetts has been burned every year.
</P>
<P>
   The preservationists must also contend with the clout of
ranchers, an important part of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's governing coalition. They have been able to gut many new
laws to improve forest protection and keep ones that have passed
from being fully carried out. According to Brazil's Catholic
Church, Mendes was one of 982 activists murdered in land disputes
in the Amazon between 1964 and 1988, the vast majority by ranchers'
hired guns. Eight people were convicted, all triggermen except in
Mendes' case. Even his killers, Darly Alves and his son Darci
Alves, who have since been recaptured, walked out of prison two
years into their 19-year terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Falcons running back Jamal Anderson tends to fluctuate with the
best of them, at least off the field.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, he's been very consistent this year, with more
than 100 yards in 10 of 15 games. He is the NFL's second-leading
rusher, with a franchise-record 1,743 yards (trailing only Denver's
Terrell Davis, who has 1,830), and can set several more Falcon
marks Sunday vs. the Dolphins (10-5).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also is near the league record for carries in a season.
He has 392, five short of Gerald Riggs' franchise record of 397,
set in '97, and 15 short of the NFL mark of 407, set by Tampa Bay's
James Wilder in '84.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knows the Dolphins limited Davis to a season-low 29
yards on 16 carries Monday night. He doesn't necessarily care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all the records,'' said Anderson, who is averaging 26
carries per game. ``I still want 2,000 yards. They better come to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Anderson early in the week. On Christmas Eve, he had
mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   What about the record, Jamal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I'm going to be pushing (running backs
coach) George (Sefcik) about, saying I need so many carries,'' he
said. ``I'm a player. I do what I'm asked to do. If they want me to
play the whole game, I'll play the whole game. If they want me to
play half I will. It's not that important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   Safety Chris Bayne was named to the early inactive list for the
fourth straight time since he missed team meetings and was late for
a practice prior to the Nov. 29 game at St. Louis. Joining him on
the early inactive list are canter-guard Dave Widell (for the 14th
straight week), cornerback Darren Anderson (for the seventh time in
13 games since joining the team), and tight end Roderick Monroe
(for the second straight week since he was signed off the practice
squad).
</P>
<P>
   Western view
</P>
<P>
   This from the weekly NFL notes column in the L.A. Times, under
the headline, ``Potential Stiff of the Week:''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler. If John Elway couldn't
handle the Dolphins' defense, then how can anyone expect Chandler
to? The first letdown for the Falcons after the illness to coach
Dan Reeves against a team with a chance yet to win a home playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   Incentive aplenty
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Falcons, who cannot improve their playoff position
with a win, the Dolphins can assure themselves of a home field game
in the first round with a win, and that's on the mind of players.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 7-1 at home, losing only to the Jets two weeks ago, but
just 3-4 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know we're in the playoffs, but there's no doubt
we want to be at home,'' quarterback Dan Marino said. ``It's so
much easier to win at home in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Reserve middle linebacker Ruffin Hamilton, the former Tulane
star, leads the Falcons with 15 special-teams tackles (and a forced
fumble), ahead of running back Gary Downs (10), linebacker Craig
Sauer (nine), cornerbacks Randy Fuller and Elijah Williams (eight
each), and reserve linebacker Keith Brooking (seven). ... The
Falcons lead the NFL with 38 takeaways, and have scored 126 of
their 404 points, or 31 percent, off turnovers. ... Team officials
are cautioning fans who attempt to purchase tickets from scalpers
that counterfeit tickets are likely to be plentiful for Sunday's
sellout against the Dolphins. Fans with counterfeits will be
escorted from the stadium, with no refund.
</P>
<P>
   Turnaround
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave up 461 points before Reeves and Brooks showed
up before the 1997 season. Last year they gave up 361. This year
they'll give up 300 if they hold Miami to 17 points Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it differently
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Dolphins signed wide receiver Lamar Thomas and
cornerback Jerry Wilson to contract extensions, meaning that their
undisclosed signing bonuses will be pro-rated over this year and
the remainder of their contracts, reducing each's impact on the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas got a two-year extension, Wilson a four-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who have about $750,000 left under this year's
salary cap, are highly unlikely to follow this course of action,
instead committing that money to incentives earned by players this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Those incentives will far surpass that number, and the team will
carry over whatever excess there is and apply it to next year's
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a six-year veteran, is tied for second on the team with
39 receptions for 524 yards and five touchdowns. He will start
ahead of Oronde Gadsden on Sunday.

TCU'S JAKSIC CAN'T FORGET THOUGHTS, SOUNDS, OF WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ You start with the war. The basketball,
well, that can come later.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in TCU's Daniel-Meyer Coliseum, surrounded by banners
and basketballs, Vladimir Jaksic describes what a grenade really
sounds like when it goes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all like it sounds on TV,'' Jaksic explained. ``In
real life, you can hear it in your whole body.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the things you learn while growing up in Zagreb,
Croatia, a proverbial starting line for bloodshed that has ravaged
that region for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991
began the violence that ended with almost 10,000 deaths that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people die in war, people like me, and that's kind of
sad,'' Jaksic said. ``If I didn't play basketball, I'd go to war
and probably die.''
</P>
<P>
   So you start with the war, and realize sooner or later you will
get to the basketball, because, for Jaksic, both remain irrevocably
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   He's a serious thinker sometimes, creasing his brow as he talks
of religious and political problems that plague Croatia even now.
``It's scary,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said. ``He's tried
to give me a little bit of a geography lesson. I don't understand
who's who over there.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a kid sometimes, too, grinning wildly when Horned Frogs
fans chant ``Vladi, Vladi,'' following his now famous long-distance
shots. ``He's a very, very good shooter,'' TCU guard Prince Fowler
said. ``Sometimes in practice, when he's on, you'll just stand
there and watch him shoot. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The palm forces the ball up, the fingers push it out.
</P>
<P>
   From the second Jaksic lets go, he's watching.
</P>
<P>
   Jaksic likes to watch his shot unfold, standing right where he
was when he released the ball until he sees it bouncing on the
floor beneath the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He watches, bouncing on his toes like a kid, his wrist hanging
loosely above his head, his fingers dangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vladimir is your typical shooter,'' Tubbs said. ``He has yet
to meet a shot he didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a spot on the floor that Jaksic wouldn't shoot from,
although he likes his chances better when his feet dance along the
3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   He has made 36 field goals so far this season, and 27 of them
have been 3-pointers. He has made 44 percent of his 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shot that got Frogs assistant coach Brian Fish to
take notice when Jaksic played for Blinn College, a two-year school
in Brenham. It was the shot that got Blinn to take notice when
Jaksic was playing in Croatia. It was the shot that got the
Croatian national team to take notice when he was growing up in
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   He had a childhood a lot like that of his Horned Frogs
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to play basketball on neighborhood playgrounds. He
opened presents on Christmas Day. He learned English by watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that show ``Dallas'','' Jaksic said, laughing.
``Kind of funny, I end up here.''
</P>
<P>
   He always figured he would be playing for Yugoslavia's national
team by now, a dream held by most kids in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being a member of Dream Team,'' Jaksic said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Yugoslavia had fractured into many tiny nations when he had
gotten big enough and good enough.
</P>
<P>
   He instead played for Croatia. Proof of victory, politicians in
Zagreb like to say.
</P>
<P>
   Jaksic merely shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of people didn't want this war started,''
Jaksic said. ``It was all politicians, and it's all politics. It's
very easy to manipulate people when the economic situation is not
very good. ... But you can't explain to people it's economics. You
have to put in religious things and patriot things, so they tell
you that Croats hate Serbs and Serbs hate Croats. But that's not
really true.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious tensions remain in Croatia and Bosnia, and many say
that prevents the violence in the region from ending.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of normalcy has returned in Zagreb, Croatia, the hometown
listed in the TCU men's basketball media guide under Frog Facts
meant to introduce the transfer from Blinn College.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know, it says, that his hobbies are ``playing tennis,
playing guitar and watching soccer'' or that ``Jaksic is one of two
native Croatian student-athletes enrolled at TCU.'' Anita Lelas of
Croatia plays on the TCU women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't say that Jaksic was 16 when the war began or that he
considers himself lucky to have been in Zagreb, where bombs rained
down maybe 50 times, instead of daily as in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say that to somebody here, they'd be like: `Oooh, 50 times.'
But for me, it was like it was normal, just another day,'' Jaksic
said. ``When you see first time, it seems bad, but then you see
people in Sarajevo, in Bosnia, in other cities in Croatia were
under bombing that went on for two years nonstop and then I think
of myself as fortunate to be in Zagreb.''
</P>
<P>
   In his world, Zagreb seemed like a safe haven, not as much for
what it was but what it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Jaksic says he didn't really understand that until he got to the
United States and saw what Americans saw on the news.
</P>
<P>
   He seems very far away then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, really, in war, everything seems far,'' Jaksic said.
``You think 30 miles away, you think it is far, because you are
still alive, you are surviving. That's good, that's all good and
it's not good at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you are used to people throwing bombs at your city, 200
yards from you, and now it's 30 miles, and you can't really hear
it, so it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   He's farther than that now.
</P>
<P>
   He needs only to look around at the banners and the basketballs
to be reminded of exactly how far.
</P>
<P>
   It's never far enough to forget, though.

NEW SANTA ANITA OWNER PLANS BIG CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Frank Stronach, the industrialist and leading
racehorse owner whose first season at the reins of Santa Anita Park
begins today, lays out his radical plan for revitalizing the old
racetrack with characteristic self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, when the dust settles, it should be a
win for the horsemen ... for the customer ... for Arcadia ... and
naturally it should be a good investment,'' said Stronach, who
became the track's chairman after it was purchased for $126 million
earlier this month by his Magna International Developments.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only certainty is that when the dust settles, there
will be a lot of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach's ideas include uprooting Santa Anita's picturesque
paddock gardens to make room for a Citywalk-style retail,
restaurant and amusement ``village''; eliminating the unique
hillside portion of the turf course and installing a second turf
course; building luxury suites and rebuilding the barns; and _ by
the way _ putting a hotel and condominiums on the fringes of the
320-acre property.
</P>
<P>
   So jarring are the proposed changes that, if they came from
almost anybody except Stronach (pronounced straw-nack), they'd
stand as much chance as a three-legged horse of winning support
from the thoroughbred owners, trainers and jockeys who are known
collectively as ``the horsemen'' in racetrack politics.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the plans for a hotel and condos had come from
Meditrust, the Massachusetts-based medical-care and real estate
company that owned Santa Anita for the past year, they might have
frightened horsemen, who have long feared the track would be plowed
under and its valuable land developed.
</P>
<P>
   But because Stronach is Stronach, the as-yet-sketchy plans are
being cheered as a bold scheme for drawing fans back to the
64-year-old track that saw average daily attendance drop to an
all-time-low 12,251 in 1996-97 before rebounding slightly last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly the best option we have,'' said Brian Sweeney,
a horse owner and trainer, and a former racing executive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is Stronach's self-confidence _ understandable for a
man who claims to have washed dishes in an Ontario, Canada hospital
before building the auto-components company that earned him a $43
million salary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence apparently infected the 30-odd prominent
horsemen who attended a dinner hosted by Stronach in Pasadena 11
days ago. They listened to his plans and, from all reports, left
without their natural skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   And part of it is that Stronach is a horseman himself, an owner
and breeder of hundreds of thoroughbreds and an acquaintance of
many Santa Anita owners and trainers, some of whom have worked for
him. Stronach announced his intention to purchase Santa Anita in a
press conference minutes after his Awesome Again won the Breeders'
Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a little more credibility because he is in
the business and it's obvious he loves horses,'' said trainer Ron
Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a man who's committed to horse racing,'' said trainer
Vladimir Cerin. ``When a man (owns) 300 broodmares, I think he's
looking for places for their offspring to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach demonstrated his commitment to horses and horsemen when
he listed his priorities for improving Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my three priorities are to improve the quality of the
environment for horses on the backside _ that means stabling, etc.;
a better environment for the grooms and people who work back there
_ better dorms; and we have to look after the customer, we have to
make it more pleasant for him,'' said Stronach, 66, who speaks with
the accent of his native Austria (imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger's
rich uncle).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specifics of his ideas may be impractical. If the
saddling paddock is moved in front of the grandstand, as Stronach
has suggested, will there be room for a second turf oval around the
outside of the main track, as he envisions? If an infield chute is
added to the existing turf course, what becomes of the infield
training track?
</P>
<P>
   And can he really do all this for $50 million, the number that's
been floating around?
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Stronach, a first-time track owner in North
American (though he owns a racecourse in Austria), is merely
running ideas up the flagpole now, not expecting to accomplish
everything. Less important than the support of horsemen, in the
end, might be the cooperation of Arcadia city officials, whose
plush community is big on peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged,'' said Deputy City Manager Don Penman, ``by
the concept of creating a really unique use on this site that
interacts well with the track.... He certainly put a lot of
concepts on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Santa Anita, under Stronach's blueprint, would be
transformed from a stately landmark to a lively tourist
destination, with theme park-style rides in an equine motif (take a
ride through the history of horses and horse racing!).
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he said, is to lure the public to the track, where it
will rediscover racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People nowadays have a great choice of entertainment,''
Stronach said on the phone from his Magna International office in
Aurora, Ont. ``So it's got to be more exciting.... I have a concern
that live racing is deteriorating. At every racetrack I go to, it's
just old people, no young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of trying to draw fans back to live racing excites
horsemen who have seen other track owners stake their futures on
the convenience of simulcast and home betting.
</P>
<P>
   If reviving Santa Anita means some of its historic features end
up in a dust bin, that's a price many are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like if you owned a Chevy Nova and somebody offered you a
Rolls Royce,'' said trainer Richard Mandella. ``What are you going
to do .... moan about losing the Chevy Nova?''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach, who doesn't own a home in Southern California, said he
plans to be at Santa Anita about one week of every month during the
meet that runs from noon today to April 19. A pair of lieutenants,
former Ontario Jockey Club general manager Rick Cowan and former
Toronto Argonauts president Brian Cooper, are on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, William Baker, who was Santa Anita's chairman, now is
its president and CEO, and Cliff Goodrich, who was Santa Anita's
president, now is its executive VP and general manager. Stronach
indicated major changes will wait until he gets to ``know where the
good people are.''
</P>
<P>
   No timetable has been announced for any of the changes. The only
difference fans might notice this season is in the admission
prices; Stronach hopes to institute a ``free'' general admission
system in which patrons would pay $6 for parking and entry but get
back a $4 food voucher and a $2 betting credit.
</P>
<P>
   That free $2 bet could be won or lost in two minutes. The result
of Stronach's ambitious plans will take longer to determine _
months, even years.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Sweeney, ``If they were (holding) betting on it, I'd
go bet on him.''

JAN MEYEROWITZ, 85, COMPOSER ON MORAL SUBJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Meyerowitz, a prolific composer whose varied catalog
includes eight operas and many chamber, symphonic and choral works,
died in Colmar, France, on Dec. 15. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerowitz's music, which is lyrical and dramatic, often
combines a neoclassical sense of structure with touches of
chromaticism that gives it a modern sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn to subjects that raised moral or humanistic
questions or that looked at the contemporary world through the
prism of Bible stories. His second opera, ``The Barrier'' (1949),
has a libretto by Langston Hughes, based on his play ``The
Mulatto,'' and looks at racial issues in the South. Hughes also
supplied a libretto for ``Esther'' (1956), about the biblical
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Esther, who saved her people from the genocidal
plans of Haman, clearly fascinated Meyerowitz, who had spent World
War II in hiding with the help of friends in the French and Italian
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the opera, he wrote a symphony, ``Midrash Esther,''
inspired by rabbinical commentary and entirely separate from the
operatic score. Dimitri Mitropoulos led the New York Philharmonic
in the premiere of the work in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerowitz was born in 1913 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw,
Poland), and studied until 1933 at the Hochschule fur Musik in
Berlin. He continued his studies in Rome, where Respighi and
Alfredo Casella were among his teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s he made his way to Belgium and France. When
the war ended, several French musicians _ including the flutist
Jean-Pierre Rampal and the pianist Yvonne Loriod _ performed his
works in concerts and radio broadcasts. He married a French
musician, Marguerite Fricker, who survives him.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerowitz moved to New York in 1946. He worked as an assistant
to Boris Goldovsky at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood,
Mass., and later joined the faculty there and at Brooklyn College
and City College. He also established himself quickly as a
composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barrier'' had its premiere on Broadway in January 1950,
and was revived at several Italian opera houses in the 1970s and at
the Darmstadt Staatsoper in Germany in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Esther,'' his other operas were ``Simoon'' (1949);
``Eastward in Eden'' (1951), later renamed for its subject, Emily
Dickinson; ``Bad Boys in School'' (1952); ``Port Town'' (1960),
also with a libretto by Hughes; ``Godfather Death'' (1961), and
``Winterballade'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   Among Meyerowitz's instrumental works were concertos for flute
and oboe, sonatas for violin and cello, works for small string and
brass ensembles, and several full orchestra works. He also wrote an
ecumenical collection of liturgical works that included Jewish
works, like the ``Hebrew Service'' (1962), and Christian ones, like
the Easter cantata ``The Glory Around His Head'' (1955) and the
``Missa Rachel Plorans'' (1954).

IRENE HERVEY, 89, ACTRESS IN `DESTRY RIDES AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irene Hervey, who secured her place as one of Hollywood's most
beautiful leading ladies after playing Jimmy Stewart's love
interest in the 1939 western ``Destry Rides Again,'' died on Sunday
at the hospital of the Motion Picture and Television Fund in
Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 89 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With her wide-eyed, dimpled good looks, Miss Hervey, who was
born in Venice, Calif., became a contract player at MGM in 1933,
where she played featured roles in movies and short subjects until
she became a free-lance actress in the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   She then joined Universal Pictures from 1938 to 1943, where she
appeared in ``Destry Rides Again'' with Stewart and Marlene
Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   In her prime, Miss Hervey appeared with some of Hollywood's
major names, including Bing Crosby in ``East Side of Heaven,''
Lionel Barrymore in ``The Stranger's Return,'' Alan Ladd in
``Chicago Deadline,'' Raymond Burr in ``A Cry in the Night,''
Burgess Meredith in ``San Francisco Docks'' and William Powell in
``Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hervey also had roles in the films ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' ``Frisco Lil,'' ``Cactus Flower'' and ``Play Misty for
Me.'' She starred in the Broadway production and national company
of ``State of the Union'' in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   She moved into television, appearing in such popular series as
``Family Affair,'' ``Twilight Zone,'' ``Perry Mason,'' ``The Wide
Country,'' ``Richard Diamond, Private Detective'' and ``Charlie's
Angels.'' She starred as Aunt Meg in the hit series ``Honey West''
with Anne Francis and received an Emmy nomination for a guest
appearance on ``My Three Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hervey's marriage to the actor Allan Jones ended in divorce
in 1957. She is survived by a daughter, Gail Christensen of Los
Angeles, and a son, Jack Jones of Indian Wells, Calif.

`DIE FLEDERMAUS': FREUD JOINS A GIDDY BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review) 
(bl)  
By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The seasonal rituals of the music world continue
apace: having come through the weeks of ``Messiah'' performances,
concerts of orchestral and choral carols and secular but
bright-spirited Baroque works, all pointing the way to Christmas,
it is time for the inexorable rush to the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, that means leaving Baroque times behind and leaping
to the late 19th century for a surfeit of waltzes and polkas by
Johann Strauss and his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die Fledermaus,'' with new dialogue by Betty Comden and Adolph
Green, returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Christmas Eve, and its
run includes a New Year's Eve performance. Strauss waltzes will
ring in the New Year at the New York Philharmonic as well.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of this music at a time of the year when one
inevitably ponders both past and future cannot be simply that it is
frothy and light. Perhaps Strauss' evocation of the waning years of
Hapsburg Vienna produce a nostalgia for a moment in Austro-Germanic
culture in which elegance and decadence mingled and in which the
horrors of the 20th century were still unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The catalytic figure in the Comden-Green reconception might find
this nostalgic impulse interesting, in a beard-stroking way. In
this new version, the character heretofore known as Dr. Falke has
become a Dr. Fledermaus, although listeners will recognize him as
Freud long before he adopts the name.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters keep their names but have new occupations.
Rosalinda, formerly a wealthy housewife, is now an opera singer
with a weakness for tenors, a condition for which she was being
treated by Fledermaus. Her husband, Eisenstein, though a friend of
Fledermaus, has maligned the doctor in print as a quack. Prince
Orlovsky remains a melancholy figure at his own glittering party,
but he too is now a patient of Dr. Fledermaus.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Ms. Comden and Green were constrained by the fact that
the original arias were retained, meaning that the major plot
points, characterizations and relationships were already in place.
Still, there is a long tradition of updating the dialogue in
``Fledermaus.'' Ms. Comden and Green join that tradition and uphold
it by filling their text with puns that are good or bad enough to
elicit groans. But they have freshened the work nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Their major innovation, apart from turning Falke into
Fledermaus/Freud, was taking a scalpel to the third act. In their
telling, Frosch, the jailer, is a chronically unemployed actor.
Instead of a drunken scene, he enacts his own pun-filled play,
``The Bell-Ringer of Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   The principals in the cast handled the new dialogue gamely, in
English, and brought considerable charm to most of the arias, which
are sung in German. The Danish baritone Bo Skovhus, making his
company debut as Eisenstein, proved a charismatic actor and sang
with both power and playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   As Rosalinda, Carol Vaness was excessively melodramatic at first
but slipped into the role nicely once she arrived at Orlovsky's
party incognito. Vocally she was in fine shape. It was announced
that Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz was singing Adele with a sore throat,
but her malady seemed to take a toll only on her speaking voice.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's idea of casting a countertenor, Jochen Kowalski, as
Orlovsky is interesting in principal, but it doesn't work. When a
mezzo sings the role, it has an androgynous quality that goes a
long way toward making the Prince's sadness seem touching.
Kowalski's bright, spirited rendering of the role seemed out of
place, as did the occasional breaks between his upper and lower
registers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schade appeared to relish the chance to sing bits of
famous tenor arias (including a couple by Puccini that had not yet
been composed by 1899, the announced setting of this version of
``Fledermaus''). And Earle Patriarco (Fledermaus), John Del Carlo
(Mittelmann, the prison warden previously known as Frank) and Max
Wright (Frosch) contributed to the proceedings amusingly.
</P>
<P>
   The production is essentially the one that Otto Schenk staged in
1986, with sets by Guenther Schneider-Siemssen and costumes by
Peter J. Hall, but it has been restaged by David Kneuss, with new
choreography (a lot of dancing waiters in Act II) by Robert La
Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Summers, who will become the music director of the
Houston Grand Opera next season, made his house debut with a
sparkling, gracefully paced performance that had both the warmth
and rhythmic fluidity that the style demands.

NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA: PERFORMERS OF THE FUTURE WITH WORKS OF
THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Md., Ohio, Pa.)  (rl) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The millennial fever that peaked a year or two ago
with predictions of the death of virtually everything, classical
music pointedly included, seems to have subsided. As bang already
gives way to whimper, by the time the epochal event arrives we'll
be grateful if the 2000-phobic computers work the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Even when prospects were said to be most dire for classical
music, all you had to do to restore your faith in the future was to
hear some of the splendidly talented and spirited performers on
their way up, like the New York String Orchestra, made up of
students from around the nation, in its annual holiday outing at
Carnegie Hall. And its latest edition in its first concert, with a
Mozart program on Thursday evening conducted by Jamie Laredo,
offered nothing but hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Overture to ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' received perhaps as fine
and spirited a performance as this weathered listener has ever
heard. Bubbling and effervescent, it flew by in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Things only got better in the C minor Piano Concerto, with the
brilliant yet unpredictable Peter Serkin as soloist. Serkin seems
to delight in the give and take of collaboration, interacting with
partners in highly specific ways. The results can sometimes seem
perverse, as in a weirdly deconstructionist new RCA recording of
the Brahms violin sonatas with Pamela Frank.
</P>
<P>
   But here Serkin seemed to feel that the best way to communicate
with these young players was on a straightforward level, and the
interpretation may therefore have been all the more profound. He
was willing to be led, but even more tellingly, he led the
orchestra into fulminating depths in the development section of the
first movement. His exchanges with the wind players, drawn mostly
from the Juilliard School in New York and the Curtis Institute in
Philadelphia, were especially eloquent and delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Haffner'' Symphony ended the evening, sounding a
little slack and anticlimactic. This 7 o'clock concert was
performed without intermission, a holdover from the more romantic
days when the Christmas Eve program was performed toward midnight.
But this may have been just too long an uninterrupted sit for these
young performers.
</P>
<P>
   However that may be, they gained valuable experience of another
sort as well, since the concert was the first event in Carnegie
since the death of the hall's beloved executive and artistic
director, Judith Arron, last week. To begin the evening, Laredo led
them in the Air from the Bach Suite in G, a movement played by many
orchestras to honor the memory of a fallen colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play it for her with much love,'' Laredo said, and the
musicians did just that. But he might have done better to suppress
the applause, treating this as something other than a
``performance.'' No matter: that is a lesson these young players
will learn all too often before their careers are well advanced.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, Laredo and the orchestra are to
perform again on Monday with alumni, including the concertmasters
of four orchestras: the Boston and Baltimore Symphonies, the
Cleveland Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

DAVIS HAS NEW KNEE, NEW ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When her phone rang one evening late last March,
Lissa Hodoh thought her kid brother was playing a cruel joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play basketball anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron, stop pulling my leg,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't. Not about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play basketball anymore,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis would play basketball again, of course. A sophomore,
he is UCLA's starting point guard, its best player and its floor
leader. But last March his world of hardwood and gym shorts had
been ripped apart by a torn tendon in his left knee. Life wasn't
over. But it was damned close.
</P>
<P>
   What followed _ reconstructive surgery, a new ligament and a
grueling nine-month recovery _ was the toughest journey of Davis'
life, filled with anguish and despair, frustration and pain, with
nothing much at stake except his future.
</P>
<P>
   But along the road to recovery a funny thing happened. As Davis
rehabilitated his knee, he remodeled his character. As his new
ligament grew stronger, so did his psyche. He became more observant
and more patient _ much, much more patient. He tempered his sense
of humor. He trusted perfect strangers. He re-evaluated
friendships. He matured.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, Davis realized the rehabilitation wasn't about
leg extensions or range-of-motion exercises or agility drills or
wind sprints. It wasn't about his knee at all.
</P>
<P>
   It was about his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rehab is day after day after day, and you have to be real
strong mentally,'' Davis said. ``There were lots of times I broke
down. I had plenty of down days. I had plenty of days I wanted to
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Davis was driving to his knee exam when he heard a radio report
that he'd been cleared to play. A few hours later he was diagnosed
with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, the result
of an awkward landing against Michigan in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Dr. Steve Lombardo replaced Davis' torn ligament with
a graft from his patella tendon, standard procedure in
reconstructive ACL surgeries. Lombardo then turned Davis over to
Judy Seto, a physical therapist and administrator at HealthSouth
Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the early weeks, Seto worked to reduce swelling, pulverize
scar tissue and improve Davis' range-of-motion with leg extensions.
As range-of-motion developed through the summer, endurance became
the focus. Then, in the fall, agility and aerobic conditioning were
priorities. The same items stayed on Davis' menu throughout, just
in different orders.
</P>
<P>
   Davis reacted to his first career-threatening injury with
understandable impatience. Each week seemed like a month, each
month a year. In May, for instance, he asked to do agility drills
that were months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher-caliber athletes are used to having their bodies
respond,'' Seto said. ``They're used to saying, `I can.' When their
body doesn't agree, they don't know how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Baron was hiking a 10-mile trail, and he'd always
say, `Are we there yet?' The first time he did agility drills, he
died. He realized he wasn't ready. But memory fades, and two weeks
later he'd say, `I'm ready.' He had to learn to trust that we knew
what was best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, away from the rehab center, Davis didn't know who
to trust. Sure, he had Hodoh and his grandmother, Lela Nicholson.
UCLA assistant Michael Holton greeted him after surgery. Coach
Steve Lavin and the Bruins stopped by for visits.
</P>
<P>
   But the same people who had latched onto Davis and shared his
rise to stardom at Santa Monica Crossroads School and UCLA suddenly
became his harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never make it back,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're finished,'' they pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship was thick as a patella tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not glad it happened, but it was a humbling experience for
Baron,'' Hodoh said. ``All the people that praised him when he was
a superstar, well, when you get hurt is when you find out who you
really trust, who really loves you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early months, Davis had daily sessions at HealthSouth
lasting 90 minutes to 2{ hours. But as summer arrived and his
strength returned, he was allowed to work out on his own. Out of
Seto's shadow, he drifted. He skipped workouts and gained 30
pounds. He concentrated on the finish line _ returning to action _
but dismissed the steps required to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Although surrounded by friends and family, he was alone against
the challenge of a lifetime _ and it was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that stands out about Baron is the mental challenge
he had to deal with day-to-day,'' Seto said. ``We tried to kick him
in the butt. We all had talks with him. But he was disappointed. He
wanted to be further along than he was, and sometimes he didn't put
in the effort we wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught him a lot of patience, and more than anything it
humbled him. He's not an arrogant kid at all, but he learned that
he had to take a different approach, that he can't have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Seto passed a mediocre progress report to Hodoh and
UCLA assistant coach Steve Spencer. With a one-two punch, they
snapped Davis out of his funk.
</P>
<P>
   First, a livid Spencer cornered him in the basketball office.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, Hodoh called.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really challenged me,'' Davis said. ``She told me to stop
feeling sorry for myself. Those two really had an impact. That's
when I broke through the mental wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice came from all directions, and he devoured every morsel.
His brother-in-law, Dean Hodoh, clipped articles about athletes
recovering from knee injuries, including one about Jerry Rice that
Davis keeps in his bedroom. At HealthSouth, Davis talked to NBA
players A.C. Green, Mario Bennett and Danny Manning _ each living
proof that ACL tears are not career-ending.
</P>
<P>
   After months of thinking no one understood, months of believing
his suffering was unique, Davis realized he wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had surgery one week before Manning, but his rehab went
faster than mine because he worked harder,'' Davis said. ``They
told me I could do it, and they showed me it could be done. Plus, I
saw the season closing in, and that's when I kicked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   He progressed from individual drills to light practices to full
contact in a matter of weeks, dropping 20 pounds along the way.
When Seto tightened the reigns _ when she refused to clear him for
the Puerto Rico Shootout, for instance _ he was disappointed but
not derailed.
</P>
<P>
   Forget 10-mile hikes and finish lines; he cared only about the
next step. There were no distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell Baron has matured,'' Bruins guard Earl Watson
said. ``He used to joke around all the time. Now he only jokes
around half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   So when her phone rang in the early hours of Dec. 2, Lissa Hodoh
knew her kid brother was as serious as he'd ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' he said, ``I'm playing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   His knee healed, his journey complete, Baron Davis was back from
the brink.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, Baron,'' Lissa said. ``When I see you on the
court, I'm going to start crying.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ In the first 106 years of University of Texas football, no
player had done what senior receiver Wane McGarity did in 1998. He
caught more passes (58) for more yards (1,087) than any player in
school history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It also is likely that no player in school history overcame a
greater physical challenge than McGarity did before setting those
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Wane has done is phenomenal,'' said Texas coach Mack
Brown. ``There are a lot of great stories on this team this year
with Ricky Williams winning the Heisman and Major Applewhite's
freshman year at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think there is any story any bigger, better or
more special than Wane's. I think he has been the story of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, 1997, McGarity thought his football career was
over. He suffered a severe knee injury _ for the third time in his
career _ that day at Rice Stadium, and he knew the odds of
returning in 1998 were against him.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee,
something he had done twice in his right knee. Major reconstructive
surgery was required each time.
</P>
<P>
   He also had two arthroscopic surgeries on his knees. No one had
to tell him the sacrifices that must be made to get back on the
football field after reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it statistically, some guys don't come back
after one,'' McGarity said. ``Most guys wouldn't even give it a
shot after two, and a lot of people would hang it up at three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of work to get back to where you once were.
Just the pain and all that you have to endure is tough. I didn't
want to go through all that again.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGarity had someone else to think about _ 3-year-old
daughter Dominique. ``My daughter would watch games with me on TV
(in 1997), and she would say, `Look, Daddy. You're on TV.' And I
would have to tell her that wasn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days of sitting with his daughter were the biggest reason
McGarity decided to give it one more shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That played a big part,'' he said. ``I wanted to do something
special for her. I wanted to be able to show her that if you put in
hard work, anything is possible. You have to keep your mind focused
in the right places.
</P>
<P>
   ``She works hard at what she does, whether it's learning her
ABCs or 1-2-3s. The principle is the same, and that's how I want to
raise her, because that's how my mom raised me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never quit on something that you have your heart into.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity had one other reason for wanting to try to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell there was something special about to happen here
under coach Brown,'' he said. ``I wanted to be a part of it in
every way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one thing that kept running through my mind: `Are they
going to want me? Will they even look at a guy who's had three knee
surgeries?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a senior, and I thought they might say, `That guy might
as well go ahead and give it up.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity said Brown gave him the option to do whatever he felt
was right. ``Coach Brown came to me,'' McGarity said. ``He said: `I
will think no less of you if you decide to quit right now. We will
keep you on scholarship, and you can concentrate on getting your
degree, if that's how you want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity already had decided he wanted to come back. Whether he
could be the same player was less certain.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-9 and 190 pounds, McGarity wasn't a quality player because
of his size. It was blazing speed and cat-like quickness that made
the San Antonio Clark product a top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining those assets after major knee surgery is no easy task.
Rehabilitation is painful and grueling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring, Wane was down and discouraged,'' Brown said.
``His knee was not in great shape then, and there were questions
with him and me whether he could play in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity said the hardest part was the daily grind of rehab, not
knowing if it was going to be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a chance to get my speed back, but how much I
would have to endure to get there,'' McGarity said. ``I told myself
if I wasn't the same player with my speed and agility and the way I
make my cuts, I wouldn't go back out here.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity credits UT doctors with helping him make a quick
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Brown told the doctors not to hold me back,'' McGarity
said. ``It was their work that got me back out here. They got me
back in shape and got my muscles back in condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the main thing was my heart was in it. I took advantage of
the opportunity they gave me and went at it full steam ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   After two-a-day practices in August, McGarity thought he was
ready. But there still was a twinge of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all unsure until the first game,'' McGarity said. ``I
had gone through some good practices, but you still don't know for
sure. I had told myself all along if it wasn't ready by the first
game, I wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day came, and I had a 100-yard game against New Mexico
State. That meant a lot to me. It showed that all the hard work and
all the pain that I went through was going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off in a bigger way than McGarity dreamed was possible.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first player in school history to gain more than
1,000 receiving yards in one season. He set a school record with
four touchdown catches in the Longhorns' 42-35 loss to Texas Tech
and caught the winning TD pass at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wane probably had more big catches this year than any receiver
I've ever seen or been around,'' Brown said. ``Everyone knew we had
Ricky, and everybody was going to load up to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had not had the kind of season we had from Wane, we
would not have been as successful as we were.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity led Big 12 receivers with an average of 98.8 yards per
game and surpassed by two the record Mike Adams set for receptions
in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and it helped McGarity earn all-conference
honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have imagined that,'' McGarity said. ``All I was
hoping for was to come back and be a part of things in some way. No
way did I think I could come back and get the school record in
receptions and be the first 1,000-yard receiver here.''
</P>
<P>
   UT coaches told McGarity he could petition for a sixth season
with the Longhorns as a medical redshirt if he wanted it. But
McGarity has decided to make the Cotton Bowl against Mississippi
State his final college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this school when it went through its low point,
and I've also been here for some major high points,'' McGarity
said. ``I think it's time for me to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I've set an example for the younger guys. I
think I've left something with the younger receivers on this team.
I think I've left my mark.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Brown, who sees McGarity as an inspirational leader he
can point to for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back, and he was voted the co-captain,'' Brown said.
``When Wane walked off the field last year, he didn't know if he
would ever play again. Now, he's going to the Hula Bowl and
probably will be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a dream season for Wane. He's in the record
books and made All-Big 12. I'm so happy for him. Proper attitude
and hard work are why Wane played this year.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Some think it's like being a dancer sharing the
stage with Fred Astaire; you might never miss your mark, but no one
notices.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others say it's more like being former Tonight Show straight man
Ed McMahon _ smooth, professional and witty. But in the end, it was
Mr. Carson who got the applause.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick Holdman is no background dancer or sidekick for the
Texas A&AMP;M linebacking corps. Just watch film of the Wrecking Crew
at work, and you'll see how valuable Holdman is.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Dat Nguyen, a first-team All-America choice, gets
much-deserved praise for his record-breaking tackling prowess. But
A&AMP;M's defense would have a huge void to fill were it not for
Holdman, the playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes plays in the backfield, on the corner, downfield
everywhere,'' said Nguyen, who won the Lombardi Award this season.
``We know we can count on him to make something happen all over the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old senior from Alief Elsik, Holdman shows his
versatility and value in his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the Aggies in passes broken up (eight), quarterback
hurries (four) and forced fumbles (five) and is second in sacks
(seven) and third in tackles (95).
</P>
<P>
   He also is second to Nguyen in tackles for a loss (16 for
minus-59 yards).
</P>
<P>
   But it seems only opponents know how much damage he does. Rest
assured, Ohio State, which the Aggies face in the Sugar Bowl on
Jan. 1, has seen a lot of Holdman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publicity doesn't matter,'' Holdman said. ``I've been
dealing with that for three years now. On my part, I just wanted to
make sure I went out on a good note, have the best year I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach always tells us that the best players always get better
and they end on a good note. To win championships and any kind of
big games, the seniors have to be leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really took that to heart and told myself that I'm going to
do my part, play hard and do what I have to do to help the team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdman had a solid junior season with 81 tackles (13 for
losses) and was stellar as a sophomore as well, finishing second on
the team with 73 stops (nine for losses).
</P>
<P>
   But he was determined to make his senior season stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Holdman says it's hard to single out a particular game he would
measure as his best performance, but the Southern Mississippi game
Sept. 19 was the most memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the game I just totally told myself to just go out
and whatever happens, get after the ball, and I played a great
game, one of the best games of my life,'' Holdman said. ``I was
playing with no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I used to always think, `Be in on the tackle but don't
make a mistake.' That day, I said, `Forget it; just make the
tackle. Worry about the mistakes afterward when you watch the
film.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were few mistakes to worry about, if any. After posting
just two tackles against pass-happy Louisiana Tech the week before,
Holdman had 10 tackles, seven of them solo and three behind the
line, in Texas A&AMP;M's 24-6 win over Southern Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Holdman keyed a dominant performance by the Aggies. Southern
Miss managed just 34 yards rushing on 30 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Holdman said. ``That game jump-started my
season, and it went well from there.''
</P>
<P>
   By regular season's end, A&AMP;M had one of the top-ranked defenses
in the country, and its linebackers were the major reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, Holdman, Cornelius Anthony and Roylin Bradley finished
1-2-3-4 atop the team's tackles-for-losses chart, with Nguyen (147)
and Anthony (100) ahead of Holdman in total tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of talk about Kansas State's linebackers, and
they might be the best in the country, but A&AMP;M's linebackers are
right up there with 'em,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies get one more chance to prove how good they are next
week in New Orleans against one of the country's top offenses in
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone against a lot of good teams and a lot of good
offenses in the last year. They're just another one,'' Holdman
said. ``We showed that we can beat a top team. That was one of the
things about A&AMP;M _ we could never win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat Nebraska, and everybody said we could finally win the
big game, but they (the Cornhuskers) didn't have the season that
Nebraska had last year so everybody was saying they weren't good
this year, so the win was kind of tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we beat K-State. How big can you get? And to come
back the way we did, I felt that it showed the team that if we
stick to it and play and believe in each other, we can beat anybody
in the country. That's what football is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And Holdman has dreamed of how he would like to see it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, to win the game would be the best part of a
dream,'' he said, ``but to go out and play the best defensive game
we've played this year, from all aspects _ tackling, running the
whole defensive game, so that people will say afterward, `The
defense won the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the dream.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Quarterback Jake Plummer is more popular in Arizona than golf, more
precious than shade and more valuable than water.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Plummer means to the Cardinals can't be measured in
statistics. His passer rating of 75.4 ranks 20th in the NFL. He has
thrown 17 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen quarterbacks have more TD passes than Plummer. Only
Indianapolis' Peyton Manning and Green Bay's Brett Favre have more
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   So why in the world did Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill sign
Plummer this week to a four-year contract extension worth $29.5
million? Did the heavily maligned Bidwill finally lose his mind
when he gave a 24-year-old, second-year quarterback an NFL-record
signing bonus of $15 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Christmas present to our fans,'' Bidwill said after
making his second-most popular decision since he moved his
franchise to Phoenix in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was drafting Plummer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who grew up in Idaho and led Arizona State to an 11-0
record as a senior, is a legend in the Valley of the Sun. Now, he
is a highly paid legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making what I was making, I was very happy,'' Plummer said.
``Money has never been a big issue. I've never been one to look at
somebody else and think I should get more because I thought I was
better than him.''
</P>
<P>
   With one game left in his second season, Plummer has become a
master of the come-from-behind victory, following in the footsteps
of such quarterbacks as John Elway, Dan Marino, Joe Montana and
Roger Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals defeat San Diego at Sun Devil Stadium on
Sunday, they will finish 9-7 and earn the last wild-card spot in
the NFC. They would open the playoffs against NFC East rival
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs aren't that big a deal for many teams. Playoffs is
such a foreign word to the Cardinals, it's not even in their
dictionary. Futility and ineptness are.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 1984, and the
last time they went to the playoffs, they played in St. Louis. It
was 1982, a season interrupted by a players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cardinals made the playoffs legitimately was
1975, when Don Coryell was the head coach. The last time they won a
playoff game was 1947.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder fans stood in line for hours Monday to buy 7,000
tickets to Sunday's game against the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona wouldn't be in this position if not for Plummer, who is
known as ``Jake the Snake'' in the Phoenix area. In 24 starts, he
has engineered eight comeback wins, with Sunday's 19-17 conquest of
New Orleans the most recent.
</P>
<P>
   In his late 60s, Bidwill has become magnanimous. He has paid big
bucks to re-sign such veteran Cardinals as defensive tackle Eric
Swann and cornerback Aeneas Williams and such No. 1 picks as
defensive end Andre Wadsworth and defensive end Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we can get on to other player-personnel matters as
quickly as we can,'' Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a method to Bidwill's apparent financial madness. At
this time in his life, he knows he must spend money to win. More
important, he wants a new stadium with public funds. A vote is
scheduled in May.
</P>
<P>
   If voters turn down Bidwill, he might move the team. Nothing
like the hometown hero guiding the team to the playoffs for the
first time in 14 years to get the voters to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, though. The Cardinals just can't blow this
opportunity. They don't even have to beat the Chargers if the New
York Giants lose at Philadelphia. But the Eagles might be the worst
team in the NFL, so Arizona must take care of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what any other team does, and we don't
really care what other teams do,'' receiver Frank Sanders said.
``We have to be responsible for ourselves. We've got to win out.''
</P>
<P>
   The players sound as if they're on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get there,'' offensive tackle Lomas Brown said.
``For the respectability of this organization and for everything
this organization is trying to get done, we want to be the first
playoff team (in Arizona).''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals are going to have their first winning record
since 1984 and make the playoffs for the first time since 1982 and
possibly even win their first playoff game in 51 years, there is no
confusion about who will lead them. It won't be running back Adrian
Murrell, who has rushed for 1,017 yards, or Sanders, who leads the
NFC with 81 receptions (1,039 yards).
</P>
<P>
   It will be the 6-2 quarterback with the bird legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to rely on anybody else,'' Plummer said. ``We
want to rely on our ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1997 draft, former 49ers coach Bill Walsh said
Plummer was the best prospect in the draft. He said Plummer
reminded him of Montana. Like Montana, Plummer is elevating Walsh's
reputation as a genius.
</P>
<P>
   NFL fans have just begun to notice what Arizona fans have known
since Plummer began working late miracles for the Sun Devils: He's
fearless and refuses to accept defeat. That's why he is so
unbelievable when the Cardinals need to come from behind to win in
the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we've been in a lot of them and I am getting used to
it,'' Plummer said of the comeback victories. ``But it's just a
situation where your back is against the wall and you have to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I respond, but I do. There's really nothing
you can do except try as hard as you can and make plays. I've been
able to have some success late in games, and the guys around me
have, under my leadership, bought into the fact that the game's not
over until that clock runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe in me, and they work a little extra hard when we
need a drive to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals are still capable of exasperating
inconsistency. They were swept by the Giants. They almost lost to
the Saints last week. Their fans never feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The players insist they are getting better each week. If they
beat the Chargers, who are out of the playoffs but have the NFL's
No. 1 defense, they will enter the playoffs on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in ourselves,'' Plummer said. ``We know what we
have on our team. You have to think that way or else there is no
chance of it ever happening. There's a lot of us on this team who
believe that we can go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of talent, young talent, and that's part of
being successful _ believing in yourself, believing in the guys
around (you). We've got that feeling around here. It's something
you have to do every day. It takes time. Great leadership by
veterans doesn't happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is completing his second season, but he is acknowledged
as the team leader. One thing that makes him so effective is he
isn't afraid to make a mistake, and when he does, he doesn't let
that mistake bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting used to the system,'' he said. ``Earlier in the
year, I was really pressing and trying to make plays happen. I was
trying to force a few things upfield. Now, I'm more comfortable
with it. I'm more confident reading the defense instead of trying
to remember where my guys are. I'm playing with a free mind and
just having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to have the right kind of people around
you, to remember you're going to have some bad games. Not just when
you're young but even throughout your whole career, it's not going
to be perfect every day. Teams are going to be scheming to shut you
down, and it's very important to keep your head up. If it was an
easy job, everyone would be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, nobody is doing it like Jake the Snake.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR conduct unbecoming a division champion, the Dallas Cowboys have
been roundly scolded and even ridiculed. With a game left, they are
9-6 without beating a team that had a winning record when they
played.
</P>
<P>
   If the 'Boys can slip past the Redskins on Sunday night at Texas
Stadium, they will have won eight games inside their own circle, a
division so puny it has been called the NFL Least.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people might point out the Cowboys didn't pick this
schedule. They played the hand they were dealt, and if they didn't
always play it well, perhaps the critics can cut them a little
slack. We are thinking along the lines of a Christmas amnesty, or
possibly a censure, but short of impeachment. Some fans think the
Cowboys should be punished for calling themselves ``America's
Team'' for at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones, gradually overcoming his shyness, changed
coaches last winter, bringing in Chan Gailey, the offensive brains
of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Jones believed, and he had a huge
amount of company, the 19 points per game the Cowboys averaged
under Barry Switzer would not carry them to the Super Bowl. Of
course, he was on solid ground. What it got them was a 6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the Cowpokes, averaging &UR;  &LR; 11 points over their past
three games and struggling to edge the helpless Eagles. Dallas had
to resort to a fake field goal to score the only TD in a 13-9
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of clinching the division title, the Cowboys
suffered back-to-back penalties when their center, Mike Kiselak,
moved before snapping the football. This is more than a bad omen.
Seeing your center penalized for a false start is like having the
groom blurt out, ``I do,'' before the minister says, ``Dearly
beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Broncos, Chiefs and Saints treated Troy Aikman so
roughly, he had the kind of out-of-body experience similar to that
of Jimmy Stewart in the movie It's a Wonderful Life. You would see
Troy jogging to the sideline, trying to adjust his neck, and
imagining how the Cowboys would fare if he had not been born.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the movie, you suspect the results would be pretty much
the same. After all, they were 3-2 in the games started by backup
Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is no one can be certain what offense the
Cowboys have used lately. We only know it isn't the big-play,
big-risk, high-octane attack that made Aikman famous. They have
suffered a sharp drop-off in speed and talent among their
receivers. Their playmaker is still Michael Irvin, who has caught
one touchdown pass in 15 games. They throw less frequently to Irvin
in the really critical moments because _ you won't believe this _
someone is covering him.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tom Landry, the Cowboys practically invented the multiple
offense. Currently in fashion is the West Coast offense, used with
considerable success by the 49ers and adopted by the Packers and
others. The Cowboys can call theirs pecan fudge swirl, if they
wish, because it has no clear identity. You don't need four wide
receivers when you are throwing for three yards to the tight end
and swinging it out of the backfield to Emmitt Smith or Sherman
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have blitzed Dallas up the middle, forcing Aikman to get
rid of the ball too quickly. This results in gains, if any, that
hardly seem worth the concussions Troy risks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys have a huge advantage Sunday night because
they face the Redskins, who have nothing for which to play except
pride. And, as any cynic can tell you, if they had enough pride
they wouldn't have lost their first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   True, the 'Skins have won six of their past eight, not bad for a
team without an owner and with a coach, Norv Turner, whose job is
in peril. Once one of the league's most bitter rivalries, the teams
despised each other when Landry ruled the Cowboys and George Allen
was the devious coach of the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But both were long gone from the scene when the 'Skins finally
won the Super Bowl, with Joe Gibbs as coach and Joe Theismann at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the attention focused on the Redskins has as much to do
with their next owner as the status of the team. The tangled estate
of Jack Kent Cooke made the ownership an issue, reminding us the
Cowboys often have had more colorful figures at the top than on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cooke, there was Edward Bennett Williams and the crusty,
whimsical George Preston Marshall. All quarterbacks owe a debt to
Marshall, who signed Sammy Baugh out of TCU in 1937, and two years
later forced the NFL to adopt a rule assessing a 15-yard penalty
for roughing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't put in some kind of rule,'' George said, ``we are
going to get them all killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, among many, will tell you the defense still tries. But
some protection is better than none.

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Initial test results on tons of waste
dumped in Cambodia by a Taiwanese company indicate that the mercury
level was thousands of times higher than safety standards permit.
</P>
<P>
   The waste, believed to be compressed industrial ash, was dumped
a few miles outside Sihanoukville, 115 miles southwest of Phnom
Penh, last month and discovered two weeks ago. Villagers living
nearby have complained of exhaustion and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Minister Mok Mareth said the first of three analyses
of the 3,000 tons of waste showed a mercury content of 675 parts
per million.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Fu, a member of the environmentalist Green Formosa Front,
said by telephone from Taipei that Taiwan regulations called for
less than 0.2 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   Mok Mareth said he was waiting for two more tests from foreign
laboratories before drawing conclusions about the Taiwanese waste.
</P>
<P>
   The waste was sent by Taiwan's giant Formosa Plastics Corp., and
fear over possibly toxic content caused a panicked exodus of
residents from the seaport area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of soldiers wearing protective clothing have been
packing the waste into barrels and shipping containers.
Sihanoukville's deputy governor, Khim Bo, whose home was ransacked
by angry citizens in riots over the waste last weekend, said the
cleanup could take three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A dock worker died a few days after cleaning the hold of the
ship that transported the waste, setting off the riots in normally
tranquil Sihanoukville. Thousands fled the resort town, and the
police said four were killed in traffic accidents on the road to
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Chin-chun, general manager of Formosa Plastics, said on
Thursday that the waste had been treated and was not hazardous. He
said the company would take the waste back if asked. Lee denied
Cambodian government reports that $3 million in bribes had been
paid to get the shipment past corrupt officials, but acknowledged
that the Cambodian agent who handled the transport and disposal had
received $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian government has suspended 29 port and customs
officials and arrested the president of the local company that
helped import the waste.

GOLD MINE VS. THE SHAFT: BATTLES OVER BIG STORES' TRAFFIC

 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ For the 10 years that city officials have been
working to lure the superstores Costco, Home Depot and Stew
Leonard's to a complex in the northern corner of this distressed
city, they have been eagerly counting the benefits: new jobs, new
tax revenue and even new exits on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway,
partly paid for by the developers.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody, it seems, ever counted the cars.
</P>
<P>
   With two of the stores opening in the spring in a huge complex
in Yonkers, the city's neighbors are in an uproar, furious that
tens of thousands of cars will soon be clogging their streets. As
the municipalities have become locked in legal battles with the
developers and with one another, all the local roads into the
development have been closed to through traffic. And only at this
late hour have state agencies agreed to step in and conduct a
traffic study.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the only access shoppers will have to the retail
complex is via Exit 6A of the Thruway, which goes directly into the
development. Few of the people involved in the project believe that
this single route can handle the expected traffic: an estimated
19,000 cars a day during the week and 28,000 a day on weekends,
according to one study commissioned by critics of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yonkers has the development; why don't they open their roads
to the traffic?'' said Carol Gardner, one of five homeowners in
Greenburgh who filed suit seeking to keep the developer from
reopening the town's portion of Sprain Road, a long-abandoned road
that runs from the Yonkers development to Greenburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Ardsley, a village within the Town of Greenburgh about three
miles north of the development, is suing to reopen Sprain Road,
saying that if it remains closed all of the local traffic from
central Westchester will crowd onto Ardsley's small winding roads
to get onto the Thruway to go to the development. ``Here we are a
small village several miles away from the site and we don't really
have the clout or the ability to influence decisions,'' said Samuel
J. Abate Jr., the mayor of Ardsley. ``We are really getting dumped
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle in Yonkers is not unique. As so-called big-box stores
lure more and more shoppers, efforts to accommodate the enormous
volume of traffic they generate have led to complications and
acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Port Chester, a struggling village on Long Island Sound, has
been courting Home Depot for more than six years to shore up its
tax base. For just as long, residents of a neighboring city, Rye,
have been fighting the development, saying the traffic to the
megastore will clog its streets. Earlier this month, Port Chester
officials signed a contract with Costco to build a
140,000-square-foot store six blocks from the proposed Home Depot
site, in the middle of its downtown, alarming residents of Rye.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new issue all across America,'' said Joe Chira,
chairman of the Rye Citizens Committee, formed to fight Home Depot.
``Projects are going up on the borders of two different
communities. Community A, where the project is located, gets all
the benefits. Community B, next door, gets all the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, where Costco, Home Depot and Stew Leonard's
stores have been built along a busy stretch of Federal Road from
the City of Danbury to the Town of Brookfield, the state Traffic
Commission stepped in and required the companies to widen the road,
said Charles S. Harlow, a supervising engineer for the state
Department of Transportation. ``It's a statute in state law that
any project over 100,000 square feet or with more than 200 parking
spaces has to go to the state for review,'' Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Yonkers, it's every group for itself. In New York State,
there is no such statewide review of developments. Instead, the
state Environmental Quality Review Act requires that a municipal
agency, like a town planning department or city council, consider
traffic and all other effects of a project before granting or
denying approval to a developer.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the local review was biased, said Abate of
Ardsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that if we had something at the state level long
ago, someone would have considered the impact of traffic outside of
Yonkers and that might have prevented all the problems we are going
through now,'' Abate said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Everything about the development is outsized. The Costco
warehouse will be 135,000 square feet, or almost the size of three
football fields; Home Depot will be 103,000 square feet, and Stew
Leonard's, a Connecticut-based supermarket that has turned grocery
shopping into a new form of entertainment, will be 122,000 square
feet. They are expected to draw an estimated 19,000 cars every
weekday and 28,000 cars a day on weekends, according to a study by
Community Consulting Services, a not-for-profit engineering group
assisting the Greenburgh homeowners who have filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Westchester County and Yonkers went looking
for a developer who could build a project on approximately 100
acres they owned jointly alongside the Thruway. They hoped that the
development would give Yonkers a boost and perhaps help pay for a
pair of new Thruway exits, one southbound leading right into the
development and one northbound leading into the county's garbage
transfer station on the other side of the Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Morris Cos. of Secaucus, N.J., signed a 140-year lease
for the property and planned to build an office park with some
retail and residential components. Exit 6A of the Thruway was built
by the county for $12 million and Morris Cos. agreed to pay an
as-yet-undetermined share of the cost out of its profits. By the
time the exit opened in 1988, however, the office market had dried
up. Morris Cos. turned to retail instead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while the Yonkers City Council was considering the
proposal for warehouse-style big-box stores, homeowners on the two
small streets that led into the development, Austin Avenue and
Prior Place, successfully demanded that their streets be closed to
through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Sprain Road, which runs from Greenburgh to Yonkers, was cut in
half by the development. Yonkers had already closed its portion of
Sprain Road, because it preferred traffic to take the Thruway.
Therefore, the only remaining local access to the development was
from the Greenburgh end of Sprain Road.
</P>
<P>
   Greenburgh officials believed that its half of Sprain Road was
permanently closed, but the developers and Yonkers officials
counted on using it for local access to the development. ``When
they spoke to me about it, asking for my permission, I said no,''
said Paul Feiner, supervisor of Greenburgh, recalling bitter
arguments with the former Yonkers mayor, Terence M. Zaleski.
</P>
<P>
   ``They led me to believe they would go elsewhere,'' Feiner said.
``I was under the impression they would find another access without
going through Greenburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Morris, chief executive of Morris Cos., recalls
things differently. He said Greenburgh officials simply did not
respond in time to notices they had been sent under the State
Environmental Quality Review Act and therefore forfeited their
right to restrict the use of Sprain Road. ``Sprain Road was part of
this development in every one of the environmental studies,''
Morris said. ``Greenburgh was `noticed' and Greenburgh never
contested. It wasn't as if it wasn't in the news and they never
said boo. Now they want to get in the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in 1997. In January of this year, the Town of
Greenburgh sued Yonkers, Westchester County, the Thruway Authority
and Morris Cos. to keep the road closed. In February the parties
settled, agreeing that Sprain Road would be accessible only in
emergencies and enclosed by a gate. But the settlement led to new
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without Sprain Road, Ardsley's mayor reasoned, traffic would
back up to Ardsley. In March, Ardsley sued Greenburgh, Yonkers, the
county, the Thruway Authority and the developers to reopen Sprain
Road. The village lost and is appealing. Shortly thereafter, Ms.
Gardner and the group of homeowners from Clarewood Condominiums, on
Jackson Avenue near the intersection with Sprain Road, filed their
suit to keep the road closed. It was dismissed and they have also
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the construction continues, with Costco and Home
Depot set to open in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek to find an alternative, but there may not be an
alternative, unless somebody wants to build a flyway,'' Morris
said.
