UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- As bells ring worldwide on
New Year's Eve to greet the arrival of the last year in this decade,
also the last one in the outgoing century, guns are still rattling in
Afghanistan, the Balkans, the Great Lake region and West Africa.
</P>
<P>
When consumers in some countries go shopping for Christmas
season and New Year celebrations, many people in other parts of
the world are groaning under the negative impact of the global
economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This is the reality in today's world, signalling the 185-nation
United Nations is facing grave challenges of peace and security, and
economic and social crisis in the new year.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming year, we face a double challenge. There is perennial
challenge of international peace and security. And there is the
challenge of economic and social crisis, which really means the
challenge of globalization and global governance," U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said.
</P>
<P>
None of the crisis in Afghanistan, Africa, the Balkans have been
resolved. In Kosovo, all-out war was avoided for the time being, but
the U.K.-U.S. missile and air strikes on Iraq had dashed popular hope
to see a peaceful exit of the Year 1998.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council, in charge of world peace and
security under the U.N. Charter, is still fighting over how to
formally respond to the just-concluded London-Washington military
action against Iraq, which, launched in the absence of the Council's
authorization, has been seen as a violation of the Charter and norms
of international law.
</P>
<P>
Over the outgoing year, the crises have taken up enormous
amount of the world body's time. It might be tempting to leave the
economic and social issues to others. But the United Nations
cannot afford to do that.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, Annan, with his successful diplomacy,
defused the Iraqi crisis, thus demonstrating that the United Nations
can play a positive role in safeguarding world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Although the cold war was over about a decade ago, the cold war
mentality dies hard. A world run by big powers acting outside the
framework of international relations has subjected itself to a
clear threat of power politics.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Education System Not Meet Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Presidential
Commission of Inquiry into Education and Training said Tuesday
the country's education system is too academic and
examination-oriented, making it difficult for high school
graduates to be absorbed by the formal job market.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers concentrate on whether students have passed the
examinations when in fact the students do not have any skills
required by industries, which makes it difficult for them to find
jobs," said Caiphas Nziramasanga, chairman of the commission,
when he presented the interim report to President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Students should be given a chance to develop non-academic
skills which they could excel in, he said, adding that the
current curriculum should be changed to make it relevant to the
needs of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe set up the 12-member commission on January 2 this year
to revamp the country's education system to meet the demands of
industry.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the 69-page report, the president said it would be
thoroughly studied and discussed by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He said the inputs from several sectors in compiling the
report was a step in the right direction which would benefit the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate the commission for the approach it has taken
to produce such a noble contribution which now stands
accomplished and set to benefit our whole nation," said Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hostages Killed in Rescue Clash in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Three hostages were killed and
three others injured on Tuesday in the rescue operation when
Yemeni security forces stormed the hideout of their Islamic
extremist kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Two British men and an American woman were killed during the
exchange of fire that ensued. The other 13 hostages were freed,
but two British men and an Australian man were wounded, a Yemeni
security official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Two of the kidnappers and a policeman were also killed in the
shootout, while another kidnapper and three policemen were
wounded, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 Westerners -- 12 Britons, six of whom women, two American
women and two Australian men -- were taken hostage on Monday near
the southern Yemeni town of Mawdiyah, 200 kilometers south of
Sanaa, when 18 men ambushed the convoy of the tourists.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who were identified by Yemeni security
officials as members of the extremist Islamic Jihad, demanded the
release of two of their leaders who were arrested during Yemeni
government's recent crackdown on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni authorities began negotiations with the abductors
earlier Tuesday for the release of the tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- On the other hand,
Annan, who described the globalization process as "the dominant
features of our times," said that the global economic and
financial crisis is one of the main challenges facing the world
body in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The connection between the double challenge is too clear.
Unless the United Nations tackles the underlying distortions and
imbalances in the global economy -- unless the Organization starts
to provide the kind of "global governance" which is needed -- the
world must expect conflicts and even more intractable ones.
</P>
<P>
At present, economic and political security are, and always
have been, closely interconnected. When the world is encountering
uncertainties and difficulties in politics and economy, people
will naturally turn their eyes to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, as the only global organization in the
world, bears "special responsibility" in the globalization
process, which has seen the developing countries, the least
developed countries in particular, getting more and more
marginalized in the world economic community.
</P>
<P>
In fact, only few countries benefit from the process of
globalization. Therefore, a lot of developing countries, long
haunted by poor terms of trade and mounting pressure of huge
debts, have been crying out for a more balanced development of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The long-cherished aspiration can only be achieved with the
assistance of the the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The world body, which has the convening power, can bring all
countries into discussion of the issues of global economy, as it
organized a high-level dialogue on the world economy in September
on the sidelines of the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is expected to play a central role in the
world efforts to restore market confidence, to stabilize financial
markets and to provide immediate protection for the most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 months, there are quite a lot of discussions
about the world financial system, or what some people called the
world financial architecture. Some of the discussions were held
under the U.N. auspices in order to find a global solution to the
global problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambitions and capabilities of the United Nations
are very much confined due to a large amount of back dues. The
international community has called on the countries which are in
arrears to make "prompt payment" of their contributions. At
present, the United States is the largest debtor to the United
Nations, and it just saved its voting right in the General
Assembly next year by paying the minimum amount of money the
Charter requires.
</P>
<P>
In order to better deal with the double challenges, the United
Nations will spend much time next year on the preparation of the
Millennium Assembly, to be convened in the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he would spend much of next year on his report
on the U.N. role in the new century. As part of preparations, the
United Nations is going to hold informal events or hearings in
various regional centers, involving Member States as well as
non-governmental organizations and the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
"I hope those events will throw up many new and useful ideas on
the objectives of the United Nations in the decade ahead, in all
five areas of its work, peace and security, economic and social
affairs, development cooperation, humanitarian action, and of
course human rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
In General, the United Nations is in a better position to
answer the global calls for a new world economic and political
order in order to usher a more developed, prosperous and peaceful
world into the new century.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Demand 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harare, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil servants
still demand a 20 percent cost of living adjustment in addition
to the 25 percent salary increase the government awarded them
Monday, the Public Service Association (PSA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
PSA acting executive secretary Charles Chiviru said in a
statement that the PSA considered the 25 percent offer as a
"pre-payment of whatever outcome of the results of the
arbitration between staff associations and government
representatives."
</P>
<P>
He said the civil servants were still demanding the 20 percent
increase that had been given to private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
The increase followed demands by the Zimbabwe Congress Trade
of Unions, which said the adjustment was necessary to cushion
workers against the rising cost of most basic goods.
</P>
<P>
"Since last Wednesday, pressure is mounting on us from our
members who are demanding the 20 percent awarded to the private
sector," Chiviru said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that PSA members might be forced to take action
before the end of January.

PARIS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Eiffel Tower broke the world
record in the number of visitors in 1998 by receiving 6 million
people, said the Societe d'Exploitation of la Tour which runs
tourism of the 110-year-old tower.
</P>
<P>
In France, the Eiffel Tower was followed in the number of
visitors by the Louvre Arts Museum with 3.6 million visitors and
the Chateau de Versailles with 2.3 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of visitors on Eiffel are foreigners, with
North Americans making up 13 percent, British 12 percent, and
Germans 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend of la Toussaint festival last month, the
tower earned 800,000 francs (150,000 U.S. dollars) and it earns
one million francs (170,000 dollars) a day during festival days.
</P>
<P>
The other most visited monuments in the world include the
Empire State Building in New York with 3.6 million visitors and
the Tokyo Tower in Tokyo with 3 million visitors in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's PM Urges to Overcome Difficulties and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minster Phan Van Khai
Tuesday urged Vietnamese people to make greater efforts to
overcome difficulties and challenges as well as weaknesses of the
national economy itself and shortcomings in the state management
of economic activities.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview to Vietnam News Agency, Khai said the
situation in 1999 will be " unpredictable" and Vietnam "will have
to face even greater difficulties and challenges next year."
</P>
<P>
He said complicated developments in the regional financial
crisis in May have "further adverse impact" on Vietnam's economy.
Unpredictable weather conditions have caused severe natural
calamities in Vietnam and other countries in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Khai said his government laid stress on the policy to bring
into full play the people's great potential, care for and develop
the close relations between the party, the state and the people,
and unceasingly strengthen political stability, thus taking the
country forward in any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The declining trend in foreign direct investment will continue
in the future. It will take more time for a number of Vietnam's
major investors to overcome difficulties caused by the crisis and
revitalize their own economies, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In that situation, he said, the domestic capital resources play
a more decisive role in attaining projected economic growth
targets.
</P>
<P>
Khai believed that Vietnam has been able to overcome those
difficulties and challenges by bringing into full play the
people's intellectual and material strength, and expanding
international cooperation for the benefits of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Relying on the people and fully liberalizing their labor,
raising the people's confidence in the party's and state's line
and policies and encouraging them to work for their own benefits
and for the prosperity of the nation, that is the basic solution
to create a new momentum to take the country out of the
difficulties and challenges ahead and advance into the 21st
century with an improved position and strength, Khai concluded.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt to Treat Child Prostitutes as Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Child prostitutes should be
treated as victims rather than criminals, Britain's new Home
Office guidelines recommended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The consultation guidelines, which will be sent to the police,
social services and relevant charities, recommend children working
as prostitutes should be treated like victims to safeguard their
welfare.
</P>
<P>
The consultation guidelines, prepared jointly by the Home
Office and Department of Health, are expected to be generally
welcomed by child welfare groups and the police who have been
campaigning for such a move.
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister Paul Boateng said: "It is a tragedy that
any child becomes involved in prostitution."
</P>
<P>
"It exposes them to abuse and assault and can even threaten
their lives. Child prostitutes are robbed of their self-esteem,
their education, good health and most importantly of their
childhood," he added.
</P>
<P>
Figures for 1995-96 show that 177 children under 17 were
convicted of offenses relating to prostitution. A further 207 --
including a 12-year-old girl -- were cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The Children's Society Chief Executive Ian Sparks said, "By
issuing this guidance the government is taking crucial steps in
helping some of the most abused children in the country and
turning its attention to the violent and abusive adults who commit
these crimes."
</P>
<P>
He added unless child prostitution was decriminalized, children
who were victims of abuse were still liable to being punished.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of homes and
businesses in Britain have gone without power for a third night
until early Tuesday as parts of the country endured another
battering from gale force winds.
</P>
<P>
Over 25,000 homes have had to be reconnected following the
weekend storms which left five dead. But in some parts of the
country, customers were still without electricity, BBC report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Met Office warned on Tuesday of more gale force winds in
the north and west of the UK with winds predicted at 80 miles (125
Kilometers) an hour.
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, power chiefs said they were being hampered by the
weather and problems gaining access to remote areas because of
fallen trees and debris.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Scottish Power said that several thousand
outstanding customers would have their power supplies restored on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And Scottish Hydro-Electric said that around 1,000 of its
customers in the Mull of Kintyre, Arran, Bute and Dunoon areas
would also be reconnected on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beleaguered electricity chiefs in Northern Ireland
faced new pressures as engineers struggled to restore supplies.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 homes were reconnected on Monday while 10,000
more were left without power. Water supplies were also hit because
of electricity failures at pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
About 500 electricity poles were broken by the force of the
fierce Boxing Night storms which also caused millions of pounds of
damage to property.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wants to Slash German Budget Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder wants to slash German budget payments to the European
Union by adding black-market revenue to raise GDP figures for
countries like Italy, the news magazine Stern said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's economics advisor, Klaus Gretschmann, has called
for gross domestic product (GDP) to be calculated with the
inclusion of suspected black-market income, said Stern. This,
Gretschmann argues, would allow Germany to cut its E.U.
contribution.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union (E.U.) uses GDP to calculate much
of the annual budget contribution to Brussels by member states.
States with higher GDP pay more.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has demanded Germany's yearly net E.U. contribution
of 22 billion marks (13.1 billion dollars) be slashed. Decision on
the E.U. budget for the period 2000 to 2006 must be reached next
year given the bloc's current financial arrangements expire at the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany takes over the E.U. presidency for the first half of
1999 and Schroeder has vowed to resolve the budget question and
farm subsidy reform by March.

<HEADLINE> 1998, NO.2 Worst Year for Natural Disasters Since WWII </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- 1998 was one of the worst years
on record for natural disasters, the German Munich
Rueckversicherung (reinsurance) group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 people died as a result of earthquakes,
flooding and storms with the combined damage amounting to more
than 90 billion U.S. dollars, the second highest amount in any one
year since the end of the Second World War, the group said.
</P>
<P>
Munich Rueckversicherung, the world's largest reinsurance
group, said that in 1998 it paid out in more than 700 major cases
of damage, about 100 more than in other recent years.
</P>
<P>
The most common was storm and flood damage, which together
accounted for 85 percent of economic damage caused by natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The company pointed out however that the insurance industry
made good only about 15 percent of the damage because in most
countries where natural catastrophes occurred, insurance coverage
was not widespread.

</P>
<P>
The meeting opened in Kable Town, in southwestern Uganda, on

</P>
<P>
"The meeting between the two heads of states is in the context

are likely to include the Congolese crisis," said presidential

</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with The monitor's allegations that
Rwanda and Uganda are in disagreement about the on-going conflict
in the Congo," he stressed.

According to Bideri, the meeting between Museveni and
Bizimungu was scheduled on Saturday, but was postponed because
the Rwandan president had to attend to other urgent state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in capital Kigali have indicated that
both presidents would discuss the proposed peace deal to end
fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which was
expected to be signed during the aborted Lusaka summit.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Monitor newspaper had alleged that Rwandan troops
in the DRC are not getting along with their Ugandan counterparts.
The paper had reported a battle between the Rwandan Patriotic
Army (RPA) and the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF) in Isiro
and Buta, two towns in northeastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
The paper had indicated that 30 Rwandan soldiers, and eight
Ugandans had perished in the clashes which took place earlier
this month. Rwandan army spokesman Major Emmanuel Ndahiro told
RNA that the reported clashes were a fabrication, saying that
Rwanda and Uganda were not in a disagreement over the support to
the rebels fighting President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that while Rwanda supports the main rebel
group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) chaired by
professor Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba, Uganda was rather favorable to
the newly-born Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) led by Jean
Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
Major Ndahiro disclosed that the incident which took place in
eastern Congo actually involved UPDF soldiers and the RCD rebels,
after the UPDF field officers attempted to pass the RCD recruits
under Bemba's command.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Implement Value Added Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Ghana will join scores of
nations in the world to adopt the value added tax (VAT) system
Wednesday as it tries to broaden the tax base, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, December 30, will mark the re-introduction of VAT
which survived for only three-and-a-half months when it was first
introduced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new tax which has been pegged by the parliament at 10
percent will replace the 15 percent sales and service taxes which
have been in operation since early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Apart from enhancing the country's revenue base, the
implementation of VAT will bring Ghana in line with an Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) protocol that makes it
mandatory for its members to adopt the tax by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the 16-member sub-regional body, especially
in the Francophone zone, have already switched to VAT.
</P>
<P>
However, different internal economic dynamics of member
countries could be the reason why others should be late in
implementing the tax which experts say is more efficient and
broad-based.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, for instance, Ghana's volatile economic factors such
as the fast depreciation of its currency, the Cedi, high
inflation and high prices of goods and services did not favor the
introduction of the tax.
</P>
<P>
"While all these factors have been brought under control and
we are experiencing a stable economic climate, the elaborate
public education will also work to favor the implementation of
the tax this time round," an official of the VAT Secretariat told
the GNA.
</P>
<P>
The optimism of the Secretariat is buoyed by the high number
of traders who have registered to collect VAT.
</P>
<P>
By Monday, 7,376 traders had registered with the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"Even though this is lower than the over 10,000 traders
registered in 1995, it is far higher than what we expected to
register," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the VAT Secretariat anticipated that 6,000 traders
would register while the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
projected that only 2,000 would register.
</P>
<P>
The good turn-out could possibly be attributed to the intense
public education and expanded business environment since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The threshold which is now pegged at 200 million Cedis (about
85,653 Dollars) compared with 25 million Cedis in 1995 may also
explain the shortfall of registered traders from the 1995 number.
</P>
<P>
"The threshold has cut off quite a number of traders who had
problems in computing VAT which led to increase in prices in
1995," the VAT official said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, this has also helped the Secretariat's public
educational team to focus on group on a one-on-one basis to teach
them how to compute the tax.
</P>
<P>
But, public reaction on the re-introduction of VAT, passed by
parliament in February under Act 546, has been quiet and people
appeared to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been enough public education on VAT this
time and it will only be well for us to give it a try," said
Kwame Agyenim Boateng, a trader in Accra who has registered to
collect VAT.
</P>
<P>
A smooth implementation of VAT will be a relief to the
government which has argued that the sales and service taxes are
not wide enough.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the internal hiccups may be, the implementation will
satisfy the requirement of ECOWAS and Ghana will be part of the
larger body of nations which have adopted it.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Plane Wreck Appears "Intact": S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The wreck of a United
Nations chartered aircraft that crashed in eastern Angola
Saturday had been seen and appeared to be reasonably intact, the
South African embassy in Luanda said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials flew over the scene of the crash late Monday
and an SOS in Morse code had been received from the plane, South
African Press Association quoted a spokesman of the embassy as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But he would not speculate on whether anyone survived.
</P>
<P>
The Hercules C130 transport plane, carrying four crew and 10
passengers, apparently went down in flames east of Vila Nova,
about 45 kilometers from Huambo, in central Angola, on Saturday.
Seven of the passengers were members of the U.N. observer mission
in Angola, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the remaining three passengers were employed by a
Danish non-governmental organization, and the other one an
employee of a security company. The pilot was South African.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.N. observer mission in Angola had
requested the Angolan government and the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola to allow them safe entry into
the area to search and rescue the victims.
</P>
<P>
"They are still awaiting a response," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the area, where heavy fighting was reported
recently, was reportedly quiet on Tuesday. "But anything can
change in a minute," he added.

ADDIS ABABA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one people died
and 33 others sustained heavy and light injuries when a
low-capacity truck overturned in southern Ethiopia Monday,
according to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local police as saying that the truck
traveling from Dilla to Chuko was carrying 56 people when it
overturned at a place called Bonkoka, some 360 kilometers south

<HEADLINE> GCC Foreign Ministers to Meet to Coordinate Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will hold a brief meeting Tuesday
in Saudi capital Riyadh to coordinate stance ahead of the coming
Arab foreign ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministerial meeting, designed to discuss a
proposed Arab summit and originally scheduled for Tuesday in
Cairo, was postponed to January 24 due to the rifts among Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in
Cairo Monday that the meeting was put off at the request of the
six-member GCC.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah arrived in Riyadh Tuesday to attend the
brief meeting, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say if the other four foreign ministers of the
GCC, which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates, had arrived.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, Yemen proposed to hold an emergency Arab summit
to discuss the latest developments in the Arab world, especially
those after the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq, and seek ways of
restoring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain bombed Iraqi targets on four successive
nights December 16-19, with a declared aim of punishing Baghdad
for its failure to fully cooperate in U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, which was set
off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to ensure Iraq's
elimination of all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The last GCC summit held in the United Arab Emirates earlier
December had stressed the need to enhance Arab relations and exert
more efforts to restore Arab solidarity on principles and rules of
joint Arab action.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Vow to Help Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have vowed to
put in all they can to help government fight corruption which is
irking the ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Director Chris Bakiza
said this Tuesday afternoon while addressing CID staff of Kampala
Extra Region on the strategies for the year 1999, Radio Uganda
reported in the evening.
</P>
<P>
"We must help government fight corruption," he said while
emphasizing the duties of the police force.
</P>
<P>
Bakiza said integrity committees will be set up where staff
members can freely scrutinize one another and talk about
corruption.
</P>
<P>
He warned police officers who tend to violate human rights to
stop it or resign.
</P>
<P>
CID staff were also urged to be accountable to the people of
Uganda because, he noted, people should know the problems the
department is facing and not be closed out.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is now being gripped by the corruption scandals of some
ministers in the privatization process of parastatals. One
minister has resigned and another is likely to face censure from
Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Government Adopts 1999 Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
Tuesday adopted the 1999 draft state budget during its last
meeting this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft budget, projected revenues for 1999 are likely
to reach 84,756 billion lei (7.8 billion U.S. dollars), and
outlays 90,976 billion lei (8.4 billion U.S. dollars), the deficit
is expected to drop from 3.6 percent of this year to 2 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
State budget allotments will avail of 16,922 billion lei (1.6
billion U.S. dollars) less than they had in 1998, several
ministries being allotted less than the already shoestring 1998
funds, Finance Minister Decebal Traian Remes told the press after
the draft was passed by the government.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the main profit sources for the next year's
budget would be the wage tax, the value added tax, customs duties,
excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was aware nobody would be happy with the
budget, adding he was forced to resort to restrictions due to the
country's currently poor economic level and an overdue foreign
debt worth 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In Romania a budget revival is expected by mid-1999, further
commitments from banks and further access to new financing. I
don't have the impression that Romania is in a deadlock, but it is
true that we must bring our own contribution to improve the
current state of facts," Remes said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope the Permanent Offices of the Parliament's Two
Houses would hold an extraordinary sitting around January 25,
which would make it possible for the draft budget to pass early in
February.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu have
discussed regional situation at a border post in the southwestern
district of Kabale.
</P>
<P>
The four-hour-long talks centered on matters of bilateral and
regional interest, especially the situation in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), a press release from the President's
Office said Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
It said the two leaders reaffirmed that their armed forces
will remain in DRC until there is a political solution that will
create a better environment for the security of their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They expressed appreciation for the efforts being undertaken
by some African leaders such as President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa and President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia to find a
peaceful solution to the five-month-old conflict in the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
They said they are ready to continue cooperation in all these
aspects, dismissing some media rumors that have alleged that
there were conflicts or problems between Ugandan and Rwandan
soldiers deployed in DRC.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Angola, the two leaders regretted the
resumption of fighting in that country and called upon the
international community to ensure that the fighting is brought to
an end in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions and
the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders emphatically denied any involvement by their two
countries in the war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Museveni returned home Monday from his three-day visit to
Tripoli where he held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on

<P>
On the situation of the Commonwealth of Independent States

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Denies Using Relief Food Wrongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Tuesday
refuted reports that some politicians are using relief food to
campaign for local government elections to be held tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretary in the office of the vice-president Austin
Mwemba told the Zambia News Agency ZANA in a telephone interview
here that the distribution of the relief food is an on-going
exercise and that there has never been any political
interference.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd for someone to say that politicians are using
relief food for their campaigns because we started distributing
the food long before these elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwemba said he has not received any report from relief
agencies in the field, adding that even the World Vision Zambia
(WVZ) staff he has talked to could not confirm the allegations.
</P>
<P>
He challenged relief food agencies to report any one harassing
them or using the relief food for their campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
Mwemba assured the nation that the distribution of relief food
is going on well despite some bottlenecks in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Some areas could not be reached due to poor roads and other
conditions which are making some areas inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
The office of the vice-president is doing its best to ensure
that all affected areas in the country are cared for.
</P>
<P>
A charity body warned here Monday that Political interference
has marred the distribution of the relief food in some parts of
Zambia, threatening to throw the whole exercise in disarray.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted WVZ executive assistant Fred Simposya
as saying that a senior government officer last week tried to
force a WVZ worker in Choma, in Southern province, to accompany
him to a political rally to refute claims that the relief food
was distributed by an opposition party and threatened to halt the
distribution when the worker refused.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another politician demanded that WVZ should move
sorghum from a warehouse in Choma belonging to the Food Reserve
Agency to his constituency but the worker again refused.

Washington, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. national
Association of Realtors said Tuesday that sales of existing homes
jumped 2.7 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of
4.9 million-homes per year, as compared with a rate of 4.79
million in October.
</P>
<P>
With last month's strong showing, the Association ratcheted up
its projection for this year to 4.78 million sales, up 13.5
percent from the record 4.22 million set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase has been stimulated by plentiful jobs, big
accumulated stock market gains and low mortgage rates, the
Association said. New homes have also been selling at a record
pace this year. Economists expected strong home sales would
continue into 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to today's survey of the Conference Board, a

consumers were slightly more positive in December about the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Weather Stops No-Fly Zone Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain canceled their patrol on Tuesday over the no-fly zone in
northern Iraq because of weather but will resume flights when
conditions improve, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft for Operation Northern Watch (which monitor the
northern no-fly zone) are not flying today because of the
weather," spokesman Lt. Col. Stephen Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
"But they will continue to fly missions and patrol the
northern no-fly zone as the president said yesterday," he added.
</P>
<P>
The cancellations came one day after U.S. fighter plane opened
fire on an Iraqi air defense battery after U.S. and British
patrolling planes were allegedly targeted by Iraqi missiles in
the most hostile exchange since Operation Desert Fox ended nine
days ago.
</P>
<P>
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said U.S.
determination to enforce the no-fly zones remained strong.
</P>
<P>
"Our pilots will obviously take appropriate action to enforce
the no-fly zone. The no-fly zone prevents Saddam (Hussein) from
using his own aircraft to oppress his people and threaten his
neighbors. This remains a key element of our containment policy
and we will aggressively enforce it," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. attack on the
Iraqi missile battery was appropriate and that the United States
would continue to enforce no-fly zones in the north and south of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said its missiles had downed a Western plane during
the exchange of fire. But both the United States and Britain
denied and said their patrolling planes had returned safely to
their air base in Turkey.

National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) launched
counter-attacks despite government's recovery of strategic areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Simione Mucume, commander for Bie Province, when
several hundred UNITA soldiers started a sneak attack on Cunhinga

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Ministry of Home Affairs
office in western Kigoma Region are screening 74 Burundi refugees
who recently entered Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The screening of the refugees who fled from Kalemie and Moba
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is being carried out
very carefully as some are suspected to be combatants, a refugee
situation report issued by UNHCR Tanzania branch said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, did not mention the date when the
refugees entered Tanzania but said they were transported to
Kigoma from Kirando in Rukwa Region in southwest Tanzania Monday
last week together with 12 other refugees from DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said 428 refugees from DRC and Burundi
entered the country through Kigoma between December 18 and
Monday, bringing the number of refugees from the two countries
currently in Kigoma camps to 22,060, with 17,833 from DRC and
4,227 from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new arrivals from DRC included two severe
malnourishing children, two pregnant women and one person
suffering a chronic disease suspected to be tuberculosis, all of
whom have been admitted to a transit center.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the DRC refugees came from Fizi,
Uvira, and Kalemie. Those from Fizi and Uvira said they fled from
harassment, forced recruitment and looting by both the rebels and
government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Those from Kalemie said there were occasional fightings in
their area between the rebels and the Mayimayi soldiers
supporting the Congolese government.

<HEADLINE> Russian New MIG-29SMT Fighter Put Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The first serial updated
MIG-29SMT fighter was rolled out of the Russian experimental MIG
factory on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new jet will fly to the center of training and re-training
of Russian Air Force personnel in the city of Lipetsk early next
year where its service testing will start, MIG-29 chief designer
Valeri Novikov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry took a decision early this year on
serial overhauling of 150-180 MIG-29 fighters into a MIG-29SMT
version and on armying the Russian Air Force with these jets,
Novikov said.
</P>
<P>
According to the chief designer, only MIG-29 fighters, put out
over the past decade, will be overhauled. This will help to raise
steeply combat capabilities of the Russian Air Force up to the
year of 2020.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the overhauling of the MIG-29 will raise its
combat efficiency eight times.
</P>
<P>
Novikov said the jet has now become a multi-purpose aircraft,
performing the functions of a fighter, interceptor, attack plane,
reconnaissance aircraft or an air command post, cooperating with
the A-50, the Russian counterpart of the U.S. AWACS.
</P>
<P>
It can carry any weapons systems, including "air-to-air" and
"air-to-surface" of both Russian and foreign makes, as well as all
types of weapons, used by NATO countries, the chief designer said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Locates 22,700 Land-mines in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has located 22,737
anti-personnel land-mines this year, over three times the figure
of 6,212 in 1997, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Osorio Mateus, Director of National Land-mine Clearance
Bureau, said that they have also located 30 anti-tank mines, and
70,000 other bombs during the period.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the achievement of 1998's land-mine
clearance work, Mateus said the land mines and bombs were found
along 90-km railways lines, 24-km high-voltage power lines, and a
length of 612-km roads.
</P>
<P>
The land-mine clearance authorities also removed land mines on
1,051 hectares of land this year, compared with the 467 hectares
of land in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government spent about 18.5 million U.S. Dollars on
land-mine clearance in 1998, two million Dollars more than the
figure of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that after land-mine knowledge education in the
country, much fewer land mine disasters were reported this year
than before.
</P>
<P>
So far Mozambique has cleared 53,136 anti-personnel land
mines, 331 anti-tank mines and tens of thousands of bombs ever
since 1993 when it started its land mine clearance plan.
</P>
<P>
About one to two million land mines had been planted in the
country in its 16-year-long civil war.

NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides announced Wednesday night that he has decided not to
deploy the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said in a two-page written statement after a three-hour
session of the National Council that he would negotiate with the
Russian government the possible deployment of the missiles in
Greece's Crete island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides's decision followed his talks with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis in the Greek capital of Athens earlier in
the day on the future of the Russian S-300 missiles ordered by
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Clerides returned to Cyprus for the meeting of
the National Council, the top advisory body to the president on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the surface-to-air missiles in January 1997 in a
bid to cement its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots
in Cyprus, has threatened to launch a preemptive strike on the
missiles if they are deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and Britain have also expressed opposition
to the deployment of the missiles, which they said will increase
tensions on the Mediterranean island.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Retreats From Key S. Leonean Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- ECOMOG, the West African
peace-keeping force in Sierra Leone has retreated from the
strategic town of Makeni in the northeast, after almost a week of
fierce fighting with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted an ECOMOG statement as saying
Tuesday that the retreat is "tactical", adding that a
pro-government militia group is still putting up defense there.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched their offensive on Makeni, about 100
kilometers from Sierra Leonean capital Freetown last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister Sam Banya said Monday that
virtually the entire population of several thousand people had
fled the town.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso
and Ukraine are fighting alongside the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's loss in Makeni came one day after foreign ministers
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) met in
Abidjan Monday to discuss the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting appealed to the rebels to lay down their
arms and seek to solve the crisis through dialog. It also called
for more troops from members countries to defend the elected
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
In the face of intensive rebel attacks in recent weeks,
Nigeria, which already provides the bulk of the 10,000 strong
ECOMOG troops, has sent an additional 1,000 soldiers to Freetown.
Ghana has also sent fresh reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
About 500 soldiers from Mali and Gambia are also expected
within days, while other west African countries have also pledged
troops.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Compromise Solution to Cyprus' Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides Tuesday night made a compromise solution to the
controversial missiles issue by announcing not to deploy the
Russian S-300 missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
After a session of the National Council, the top advisory body
to the president on the Cyprus issue, Clerides said that he would
negotiate with Russia the possible deployment of the missiles in
Greece's southern island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the compromise decision would ease
the situation and ward off the threat of Turkish military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
But the decision is likely to spark a government crisis on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education, and some junior government partners have said that
they will quit the government if Clerides goes back on his
pre-election promise to deploy the missiles in Cyprus. Some
leaders of other parties have asked the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus announced in January 1997 to purchase and deploy the
S-300 surface-to-air missiles in an effort to cement its air
defense capability, a move that sparked bitter crisis with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots
in northern Cyprus, has repeatedly threatened to launch a
preemptive strike if the missiles were installed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, including the United States and Britain,
have warned that the deployment of the missiles could further
destabilize the situation on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union hinted that the deployment of the
missiles might jeopardize Cyprus' accession to the union.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Western concerns arose out of fear that
Moscow would regain influence in the region, and that the deal
would enable Russia to acquire information on the movements of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Even Greece, Cyprus' close ally, is not in favor of installing
the missiles in Cyprus and proposed Crete as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on
December 22, calling on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
intensify efforts towards the settlement of the issue and the
demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the missiles had already been put off on a
number of occasions in the face of mounting international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Aiding S. Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Tuesday
denied the charges that it is aiding rebels trying to topple the
government of neighboring Sierra Leone, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said Liberia is considering withdrawing
from the five-member committee of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up by ECOWAS shortly after the May 1997
coup that ousted elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah with four
members initially. Liberia was included in the committee at the
20th ECOWAS summit held in Nigerian capital Abuja in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sierra Leone has repeatedly accused Liberia
of supporting the rebels, including supply of weapons and direct
involvement of Liberian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The same charges were raised against Liberia in a communique
issued Monday at the end of an ECOWAS meeting in Abidjan, capital
of Cote d'Ivoire, on the situation in Sierra Leone, where rebels
have intensified their offensive in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government said in the statement that it "views
with disappointment and indignation" suggestions that it is
backing the rebels bent on ousting President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
It said it is Liberia that is being destabilized by what it
called the use of Liberian mercenaries by successive regimes in
Sierra Leone, including the Kabbah government, to bolster their
security.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Liberia considers this situation as grave,"
it said, calling on Kabbah to start a dialog with his opponent as
the only guarantee of peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberian government further calls on the United Nations
to establish a commission of inquiry with immediate effect to
establish the circumstances leading to the involvement of foreign
nationals, including Liberians, in the Sierra Leone civil war,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the accusation against Liberia has created
a crisis of confidence compromising its participation in the
regional committee trying to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the situation, Liberia may be prepared to
recluse (exclude) itself from the process until such a time when
the crisis of confidence is resolved," it said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Plan for Combating Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, taking new steps to combat violence against children,
Tuesday proposed defining murder to include the death of a child
resulting from a pattern of abuse.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to send a message through the court that when a man
assaults or kills someone in the presence of a child he has
committed not one horrendous act but two," Clinton said when
speaking at a ceremony with law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
"Time to ask why a bank robber who unintentionally kills an
innocent bystander can be charged with felony murder but a repeat
child abuser who unintentionally kills a child cannot be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that a child who experiences serious violence is
50 percent more likely to be arrested as a juvenile and nearly 40
percent more likely to be arrested as an adult. They also are at
greater risk for substance abuse, mental illness and suicide, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to keep the crime rates going down, you have to do
more to break the cycle of violence to which children are
exposed," the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to White House figures, about one-third of all
victims of violent crime in the U.S. are teen-agers. Also, an
additional 2.8 million children are abused or neglected each year,
and almost 9 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 have witnessed
serious violence.

LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Tuesday that three British hostages had been killed by
kidnappers in Yemen during an operation to free them Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Cook said he was deeply shocked by the deaths.
He told all remaining Britons in Yemen to leave.
</P>
<P>
The three Britons were among 16 foreign tourists being held by
the militant Islamic Jihad group in Yemen. An Australian was also
killed in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government said earlier that all four victims died
when troops attacked the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sorry to confirm that three of the British tourists
have been killed and others injured. Next of kin have been
informed. We understand one Australian has also been killed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of today's events we've revised our travel advice.
British nationals should not attempt to travel to Yemen unless
their business is essential and any British visitors still there
should leave," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how many others were injured in the operation,
which resulted in a shoot-out, said Cook.
</P>
<P>
It was also unknown what the Islamic group's motives are in
kidnapping the foreigners, the foreign secretary added.

<P>
SANAA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A fourth Westerner taken hostage
by militant Islamic tribesmen died in hospital Tuesday, after
being wounded by kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 tourists were abducted by the tribesmen, who
killed three of them in a shoot-out with Yemeni security forces in
a rescue operation earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth one, a Briton, died later in hospital as the other
13 were freed, Yemeni Interior Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The three killed during the exchange of fire were two Britons
and an Australian. Earlier reports said an American woman was
killed, but the U.S. State Department said she was wounded.
</P>
<P>
Two of the kidnappers and a policeman were also killed in the
shoot-out, while another kidnapper and three policemen were
wounded, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 Westerners - 12 Britons, six of whom women, two American
women and two Australian men - were taken hostage on Monday near
the southern Yemeni town of Mawdiyah, 200 kilometers south of the
capital, when 18 men ambushed the convoy of the tourists.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who were identified by Yemeni security
officials as members of the extremist Islamic Jihad, demanded the
release of two of their leaders who were arrested during Yemeni
government's recent crackdown on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni authorities began negotiations with the abductors
earlier Tuesday for the release of the tourists, which apparently
failed.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Supports Cyprus' Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis stressed here Tuesday that his country supported the
decision made by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides regarding the
deployment of Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with Simitis and Cyprus' National Council
of political leaders, Clerides announced in Nicosia later Tuesday
that Cyprus had abandoned its plan to install the S-300 missiles
in the divided island republic and would negotiate their possible
deployment in the southern Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Clerides' decision, Simitis said that it was a
decision which the Greek government fully backed.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was part of the joint defense doctrine
planning, which would boost Cyprus' defense and protection.
</P>
<P>
The responsible decision just taken by Clerides must then be
assessed in the context of a new effort to raise the substance of
the issue through new procedures, the premier said, adding that
the joint Greek-Cypriot effort would now focus on fully exploiting
the dynamics created by these developments.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that military cooperation between the two
countries would continue within the context of the joint defense
pact signed between Athens and Nicosia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Greece guaranteed the right of Greek Cypriots to live in
security and would continue to defend that right by all means
available, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Simitis pledged that Greece would promote Cyprus'
accession toward the European Union (EU) as it had done up to now,
believing that Nicosia's admission into the union would safeguard
unhindered and peaceful development and prosperity of the whole of
Cyprus.

<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The French government Wednesday
called for the trial of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, the two
recently surrendered Khmer Rouge leaders, saying, "Justice must
be done and all those responsible for these crimes must answer for
 their acts."
</P>
<P>
French government spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said,
"France has always condemned the abomination of this genocide.
The genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia between
1975 and 1979 was one of the greatest tragedies of this century."
</P>
<P>
Paris also said that the defection signalled the end of the
Khmer Rouge's last strongholds in western Cambodia. France hoped
that all the bases of guerrillas in this region will be finally
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have also called for the
holding of judicial procedure against the two Khmer Rouge
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-U.S. Relations Seen "Modest Developments" in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Vietnam
and the United States have seen "modest developments" in 1998,
Vietnam news agency (VNA) reported Wednesday, quoting a senior
Vietnamese diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with VNA, Vietnamese ambassador to the U.S. Le
Bang said Vietnam considered the signing of the trade agreement
between the two countries as "the most important task in the
immediate future."
</P>
<P>
"The conditions set by the U.S. side in negotiating a trade
agreement are too difficult for Vietnam" to meet due to the large
gap between the development levels of the two sides, the senior
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is time for both countries to show their willingness
to reach such an agreement by taking into consideration the other
party's practical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Only by trying to understand each other and taking into account
the other side's practical situation can the two parties overcome
obstacles and speed up the negotiations for a trade agreement,
Bang said.
</P>
<P>
He described the visit to the U.S. by Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam last October as "successful." The
visit was the first official visit by a Vietnamese governmental
delegation since the two countries normalized relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Another positive development" was U.S. President Bill
Clinton's decision to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment to
Vietnam, ambassador Bang said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled the achievements in economic-commercial
relations, which included a 20-percent increase in Vietnam's
export value to the U.S., the signing of an agreement on the
Operation of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic) in
Vietnam, and exchange of visits by business people of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in Vietnam totaled 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in
70 projects, ranking the seventh among those countries and regions
investing in Vietnam, Bang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries are trying to boost cooperation
in science, culture, education and humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador stressed that the economic and
commercial ties have not matched both sides' potential, mainly for
want of a trade agreement.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The National Fertilizer
Industry Agency of Ethiopia announced Wednesday that the nation

</P>
<P>
Ethiopia spends an average of over 100 million U.S. Dollars
annually for the purchase of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Zekele said the national fertilizer supply for "belg" (small
rainy season, February-May) and "meher" (big rainy season,
June-October) in current Ethiopian year (Ethiopian Calendar 1991
is from September 11, 1998 to September 11, 1999) is expected to
reach over 497,000 tons, adding that there are 204,000 tons of
fertilizer in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer supply amounted to over 485,000 tons last year, of
which 281,000 tons was utilized up to September 1998, Zekele
said.
</P>
<P>
The general manager noted that despite a marked increase over
the years, the country's fertilizer consumption is still one of
the least by international standards.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's annual fertilizer demand is expected to reach over
600,000 tons after seven years, said Zekele.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Promotion of Arabic on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The use of Arabic on the
Internet must be promoted to change the situation that other
languages and cultures dominate international communications,
according to a leading Arabic software provider.
</P>
<P>
If effective solutions are not found to promote the use of
Arabic on the Internet, the language will lose its international
significance, Hazem Abdelazim, executive director of Egypt's Sakhr
Software, warned in Emirates News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Arabic pages on the Internet is 322,898 out of a
total of 20 million web pages, said Abdelazim.
</P>
<P>
"Failing to create effective international quality solutions
for any language would mean that this language will become less
and less significant as information systems using other languages
take center stage in everyday life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of the Internet reaches new heights with
languages like Arabic, due to its rich and high inflexional
nature, that requires special technologies not provided by Latin
software," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural, socio-economic and political implications of the
Internet is now motivating big companies, institutes and
governments to respond with a competitive Arabic solution," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abdelazim will highlight solutions for Arabic on the Internet
when he delivers the key-note address at the Internet World
Middle East '99 (IWME '99) conference and exhibition scheduled
here on February 22-24, 1999.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United

<HEADLINE> Iraq, U.S. Exchange Missile Attack in "No-fly" Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes fired missiles
and bombs at an Iraqi missile site Wednesday morning after two
British tornado jets came under attack of surface-to-air missiles
in the southern no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was the second such incident in three days. On Monday, an
Iraqi missile battery came into confrontation with U.S. warplanes
policing the northern no-fly zone, and four Iraqi soldiers were
killed and seven wounded after U.S. responded with laser-guided
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's conflict took place at about 9:30 a.m. local time
(6300 GMT), when the two British tornados patroling the southern
no-fly zone stretching from the 33rd latitude southward to the
Gulf were tracked on by Iraqi radar.
</P>
<P>
Western military sources said the Iraqis fired six to eight
SA-2 missiles, an improved version of SA-1 used during the Gulf
War, in which Iraqi troops were defeated by U.S.-led allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes came to the Britons' aid,
retaliating with HARM missiles and several precision-guided bombs
on the Iraqi site, reportedly near Talil in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
All the U.S. and British warplanes returned safely to their
base after the attack.
</P>
<P>
There is no report from the Iraqi side on possible casualties
and damages. Maj Joe LcMarca of the U.S. Central Command told CNN
that "We are in a process of damage assessment" and said he
believed "our ammunitions are accurate."
</P>
<P>
The northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq were imposed by
the U.S. and its allies in 1991 and 1992 respectively, with
claimed aims of protecting Kurds and Shiite Muslims from troops of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has declared that his
government does not recognize the no-fly zones, set up "illegally"
by the U.S. and its allies without U.N. authorization, and
demanded that the U.N. discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are operating normally" in these zones, said Ramadan,
meaning Iraqi planes will defy the fly ban and challenge the
U.S. in the areas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces gathering in the Gulf carried out four
consecutive nights of air strikes against Iraq December 16-19 to
punish Baghdad for not cooperating fully in U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq, U.S. Exchange Missile Attack in "No-fly" Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes fired missiles
and bombs at an Iraqi missile site Wednesday morning after two
British tornado jets came under attack of surface-to-air missiles
in the southern no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was the second such incident in three days. On Monday, an
Iraqi missile battery came into confrontation with U.S. warplanes
policing the northern no-fly zone, and four Iraqi soldiers were
killed and seven wounded after U.S. responded with laser-guided
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's conflict took place at about 9:30 a.m. local time
(6300 GMT), when the two British tornados patroling the southern
no-fly zone stretching from the 33rd latitude southward to the
Gulf were tracked on by Iraqi radar.
</P>
<P>
Western military sources said the Iraqis fired six to eight
SA-2 missiles, an improved version of SA-1 used during the Gulf
War, in which Iraqi troops were defeated by U.S.-led allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes came to the Britons' aid,
retaliating with HARM missiles and several precision-guided bombs
on the Iraqi site, reportedly near Talil in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
All the U.S. and British warplanes returned safely to their
base after the attack.
</P>
<P>
There is no report from the Iraqi side on possible casualties
and damages. Maj Joe LcMarca of the U.S. Central Command told CNN
that "We are in a process of damage assessment" and said he
believed "our ammunitions are accurate."
</P>
<P>
The northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq were imposed by
the U.S. and its allies in 1991 and 1992 respectively, with
claimed aims of protecting Kurds and Shiite Muslims from troops of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has declared that his
government does not recognize the no-fly zones, set up "illegally"
by the U.S. and its allies without U.N. authorization, and
demanded that the U.N. discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are operating normally" in these zones, said Ramadan,
meaning Iraqi planes will defy the fly ban and challenge the
U.S. in the areas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces gathering in the Gulf carried out four
consecutive nights of air strikes against Iraq December 16-19 to
punish Baghdad for not cooperating fully in U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
With their hope for an early lifting of crippling U.N.
sanctions dashed by the air raids, the Iraqis seemed to have
changed their tactics by barring the return of U.N. weapons
inspectors and challenging the U.S. in the no-fly zones.
</P>

This threatens to turn U.S.-Iraq confrontation into a daily

<HEADLINE> Premier Stresses Engineering Quality for Three Gorges Dam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
today urged the builders of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's
largest water conservation and hydropower project, to attach the
utmost importance to engineering quality, and make sure this
gigantic dam will bring no calamity to China's future generations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that when necessary China will invite world famous
engineering-monitoring companies to help control quality.
</P>
<P>
"Quality means the life of the Three Gorges Project, and the
responsibility on your shoulder is heavier than a mountain. Any
carelessness or negligence will bring disaster to our future
generations and cause irretrievable losses," Zhu told dam workers
at the construction site in the city of Yichang in central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
noted that the ongoing second-phase construction of the dam is an
extremely critical stage for the Three Gorges Project, and
expressed the hope that everyone engaged in this work will show a
high sense of historical responsibility and strive for first-class
engineering quality for the dam.
</P>
<P>
"A strict engineering-quality monitoring system must be
introduced into the Three Gorges Project," said Zhu. "When
necessary, we can invite some foreign engineering-monitoring
companies with good reputations and experience to help us monitor
the quality of some critical parts of the dam."

supervision over the use of these funds.
</P>
<P>
"We must establish a strict auditing system and increase
transparency in the use of the funds, to make sure that not a
penny of project funds is misused or diverted," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The premier also underlined the work of relocating the more
than one million residents in the Three Gorges area to make way
for the dam.
</P>
<P>
"A successful relocation is key to the development of the Three
Gorges Project," he said, adding that the period from now until
the year 2003 will be of critical importance for the relocation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Beginning December 28, Zhu inspected the municipality of
Chongqing in southwest China and Hubei Province, both of which are
playing a vital role in the construction of the Three Gorges Dam.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sends New Year Messages to Foreign Counterparts </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
criticized the U.S. air strikes against Iraq, describing them as
"unacceptable", in a New Year message to U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The seasonal greeting was one of a series sent to foreign
leaders, including his counterparts of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, presidential spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his message to Clinton, Yeltsin urged him to continue to
work towards improving bilateral relations, but he criticized the
military action taken against Iraq and called for more
U.S.-Russian diplomatic cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to solve international crises with the aid of
force, moreover circumventing the competent international organ
izations, are unacceptable and not possible," Yeltsin told
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Among others receiving messages were French President Jacques
Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin had told Chirac that Russia and France
enjoyed a "privileged partnership" and the two countries shared
the same opinion on most international issues, including the
recent crisis in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Over 500,000 Angolan Children Registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Official sources in Angola
announced here Wednesday that over 500,000 children under 17
years old had been registered since the launching of free birth
registration in the southern African country in June this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Laurinda Perreira, coordinator for the national
birth registration campaign, the registration aided by the United
Nations Childrens' Foundation, is focused on street boys and war
orphans in a bid to offer better assistance to the children and
have their rights better protected.
</P>
<P>
Due to over two decades of civil war, she said, many residents
became refugees, the highest number being over three million
which was one third of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, most children born at this time were not formally
registered. Even now their nationality are not clear.
</P>
<P>
Perreira referred to the campaign as "positive", however, she
was quick to note that the recent escalation of armed conflicts
in certain areas since the second half of this year have hampered
the registration work so that the campaign could not conclude on
December 31 as originally scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's External Relations Ever Expanding After Handover (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has not only maintained its existing
external contacts, but also expanded its external relations since
its return to China last year.
</P>
<P>
The continued development of the SAR's external relations since
July 1, 1997, is proof of the successful implementation of the
"one country, two systems" principle in the SAR's external
affairs, observers say.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has sent its officials to attend, as
members of Chinese government delegations or on its own in the
name of "Hong Kong, China", more than 80 international
conferences.
</P>
<P>
It has also successfully hosted a number of large-scale
international conferences in Hong Kong. With its unprecedented new
identity, HKSAR has been more active on the arena of multilateral
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign warships have continued to come to Hong Kong for
stopovers and recreations, and foreign VIP planes and military
aircraft have continued to land or fly over the territory. This
shows fully that Hong Kong remains very much the same open city of
self-confidence after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has paid visits to 10 countries,
including Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, the United
Kingdom, France and Australia. Many other senior officials of the
SAR government have also had frequent overseas visits for exchange
of professional opinions.
</P>
<P>
The high-level protocol arrangements they enjoyed and the
importance attached to their visits are something officials of the
British Hong Kong government had never experienced before.
</P>
<P>
After the Sino-British Joint Declaration became effective in
1985, the Chinese and British sides started to discuss, based on
the Chinese government's post-1997 policies towards Hong Kong,
arrangements for the transitional period. It was at that time that
Hong Kong's external relations began to witness major changes.
</P>
<P>
Before July 1, 1997, Hong Kong's external relations were the
direct responsibility of the British government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side agreed subsequently that the British Hong Kong
 government be authorized to negotiate separately bilateral
agreements in such important areas as civil aviation and surrender
of fugitive offenders. These policies pursued by the Chinese
government opened up new areas for Hong Kong's external relations.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have attached great importance to developing
their relations with HKSAR, regarding it as a major part of their
overall relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of the United States, Romania, the
Philippines and Norway, vice-president of South Africa, prime
ministers of Britain and France, and many other foreign
dignitaries have visited Hong Kong or come here to attend
international conferences.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, however, no foreign heads of state or
government, except that of Britain, paid official visits to Hong
Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
An SAR Government official commented that the current status of
the SAR's external relations is "unprecedented."
</P>
<P>
Being responsible for handling foreign affairs relating to the SAR
which are the responsibilities of the Central People's Government,
the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry has
served as a channel of communication between the Central People's
Government and the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, the Commissioner's Office tackled issues
concerning the SAR's external relations "with a prudent and
unconventional approach" on the basis of the actual conditions and
in the best interests of Hong Kong with a view to implementing the
"one country, two countries" concept and promoting Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability, an official at the office
said.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1, 1997, the office has issued exequaturs to
consuls-general and honorary consuls representing 13 countries and
consulted views of the HKSAR Government on 32 consular post
nominations submitted by foreign states.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner's Office has handled and granted, upon the
approval of the Central People's Government, diplomatic clearance
for port-calls to 90 warships and for landing or flying over Hong
Kong to 143 foreign military aircraft and VIP planes.
</P>
<P>
The Office has also coordinated as necessary the arrangements
for overseas visits by the chief executive and other senior
officials of the SAR Government and visits to Hong Kong by foreign
state and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Office broke the conventions by permitting the expatriate
officials to attend international conferences as members of the
Chinese delegations and to speak separately in the name of "Hong
Kong, China." Such flexible arrangements are welcomed both by the
HKSAR government and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Another example is that the Central People's Government has,
based on its confidence and trust in the SAR Government, given the
latter a free hand to decide on the chief executive's overseas
visits and on proposals for visits to Hong Kong by foreign state
and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the overseas visits by the chief executive and other
senior SAR Government officials, the Commissioner's Office and the
Chinese missions abroad have rendered necessary protocol
arrangements and assistance, but have stayed away from official
talks and other formal activities.
</P>
<P>
When U.S. President Clinton visited Hong Kong in early July
this year, Commissioner Ma Yuzhen attended upon invitation the
welcoming banquet and President Clinton's public address and went
to the airport to see Clinton off.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, the commissioner did not participate in any
other activities, neither the meeting between President Clinton
and SAR Government officials, nor the one between Clinton and
members of the Legislative Council. This is yet another
demonstration of the "one country, two systems" principle in
protocol arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Speeding Cameras to Operate for HK Police Next January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A round-the-clock automatic
camera system set up beside the main expressways on some spots in
the New Territories of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) will be operative next January 15 to further strengthen
anti-speeding enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
The "Speed Enforcement Camera System" was launched at a joint
press briefing here on Wednesday by Traffic Police and the
Transport Department.
</P>
<P>
Senior Superintendent, Traffic, New Territories North (T/NTN),
Allan Wong Sak-pang, said a total of 10 designated spots deemed to
be suitable for the installation of the cameras, have been
selected.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the main thrust of the system was a 24-hour radar
speeding detector which worked automatically.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment is more efficient and cost-effective when
compared with manual operation. The all-weather speeding detector
helps remind the drivers to observe the speed limits on respective
roads," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press briefing, Senior Engineer of the
Transport Department Tai Seung-kun said the system consisted of a
total of 10 camera housings which had been installed at
approximate 1.5 to two kilometers interval along the road.
</P>
<P>
Two speed enforcement cameras, each carrying a roll of film with
800 frames, will be mounted on these camera housings on a random
basis. The cameras will record vehicles engaged in a speed
exceeding the limits.
</P>
<P>
New traffic signs bearing the wording 'Enforcement Camera' had
been installed along the road to remind drivers of the system in
advance.
</P>
<P>
And the films will be retrieved daily by traffic police
officers for photo-finishing process. Police will contact the

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Belgian marathon runner and
former track star Vincent Rousseau announced his retirement here
on Wednesday after his absence in the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old, the 1994 European 10,000 meters silver
medallist and who also won the 1994 Rotterdam marathon before
injury forced him out off the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
He decided to retire after he was injured again when making a
comeback in November.
</P>
<P>
"I am retiring because all the injuries have stopped me from
getting my rhythm back and it has exhausted me," Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
His personal best over the marathon, in Berlin in 1995, stood
at two hours seven minutes 20 seconds the second-fastest mark
that year. Rousseau became known as an eccentric who often
refused to run marathons because it was either too hot or too
cold.

BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,300 Iraqi
children under the age of five and nearly 2,600 elderly people

eight-year-old sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued Wednesday by the Iraqi Health Ministry show
that 1,631 children died of diarrhoea, 2,419 of pneumonia and
respiratory diseases and 2,319 of malnutrition.

</P>
<P>
The figures also show that 579 elderly people died of heart
disease and hypertension, 413 of diabetes and 1,592 of malignant

<HEADLINE> China Working on Macao Garrison Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Relevant departments in
China's central government are now drafting a law on stationing
People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops in Macao after China resumes
the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999,
according to a report in a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This law, which will be drafted on the basis of the 'one
country, two systems' principle, and relevant stipulations in the
Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), can
provide a solid legal basis for the central government to send an
army garrison to Macao after its smooth return to the motherland,"
said a signed article published recently in the "China National
Defense Daily."
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "The Return of Macao and the Macao
Garrison", noted that the anticipated Macao garrison law will take
into account the social characteristics of Macao and the necessity
for stationing troops there, drawing experience from the existing
Law on Stationing Troops in the Hong Kong SAR, which came into
effect on July 1, 1997 when China resumed its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The law is expected to make explicit stipulations on issues
such as the duties of the Macao garrison, the relationship between
the garrison and the SAR government, the garrison's liabilities
and discipline, and the judicial administration over the garrison
personnel," the article said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President on Compromise With Marcos Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the government is willing to negotiate
with the Marcos family for a compromise over its alleged
ill-gotten wealth, but such a deal should be truly beneficial to
the Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to pursue its cases against the
Marcoses in court as the proposed negotiations merely aim to speed
up the wealth-recovery process, Estrada told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"Well, as I told you, we'll be willing to negotiate as long as
it will be for the advantage of our government and our people. As
long as it will benefit our people, okay, we will. As long as it
is legal, as long as it is advantageous to the government, we
will," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada said, he has yet to communicate directly with
former First Lady Imelda Marcos, saying he has not seen her "for
several months" now.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said the government is willing to enter into a
compromise agreement with the Marcoses as long as the results of
the deal would prove beneficial to the people, especially the
poor.
</P>
<P>
The former first lady told a press conference Tuesday that she
was ready to strike a compromise deal with the government after
asking the graft court to dismiss the forfeiture case against her
for alleged lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada said that the government is gathering more evidence
to further strengthen its forfeiture case against her.
</P>
<P>
"The government failed to get any solid evidence in the last 12
years, so we will still continue gathering evidence, but we will
also negotiate with them to put on the fast-track the settlement
of this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former president Ferdinand Marcos was toppled in a "people's
Power Revolution" in 1986 and died in Hawaii three years later.
But only part of his alleged ill-gotten wealth has been recovered
by the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
On September 18, during the third plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR, the Chinese government
formally announced its decision to send garrison troops to Macao
after it becomes the country's second SAR.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that stationing PLA troops in Macao will be
an important sign of China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, and a major step for maintaining social stability and
economic prosperity in Macao following its return.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing other than stationing troops can reflect China's
sovereignty over its own territory," it quoted late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao SAR, which calls for the central
government to take charge of Macao's defense affairs, also
provides a direct legal foundation for stationing troops in Macao,
it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, the article said, the PLA Macao
garrison will only be responsible for Macao's defense and will not
intervene in any affairs within the scope of self-government
granted to the SAR. All garrison personnel must abide by both
China's national laws and the laws of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will also clearly stipulate that the central
government shall cover all the expenses of the Macao garrison, it
added.

BEIRUT, December 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
and two others wounded in a friendly fire accident in south
Lebanon overnight.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when two parts of Israeli troops
exchanged fire after they mistook the other side for "terrorists"
near Taibe in the central security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of a split in the troops, the rear part of the
troops saw the front part and mistook them for terrorists,"
according to the Orient radio.
</P>
<P>
The death raised to 24 the number of the Israeli soldiers
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year. Thirty
seven guerrillas, mostly from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, have also been killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Venture Capital Industry Extends in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's venture capital
industry raised 1.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 667 million
U.S dollars) in the first ten months of 1998, surging up 230
percent compared with that of the same period of 1997, the
country's Economic Development Board (EDB) announced in a press
release Wednesday
</P>
<P>
EDB said Singapore's venture capital, with more than 70 active
international and home grown fund management groups involved, now
manages a total of 8.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.3
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to EDB, the Singapore venture capital community in
1998 put in 600 million Singapore dollars (about 364 million U.S.
dollars) for investments, of which Singapore attracted 140 million
Singapore dollars (about 85 million U.S. dollars). The figure
resenting a quarter of the total, is comparable to the amount of
142 million Singapore dollars (about 86 million U.S. dollars)
invested in other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
EDB said companies backed by venture capital accounted for six
out of the 17 companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Singapore
in the first ten months of this year, bringing to almost 60 the
total number of locally listed companies backed by the venture
capital.
</P>
<P>
EDB also noted that start-up companies continued to receive
significant support from the venture capital industry,
constituting almost half of the 35 Singapore companies that
received venture capital funding.
</P>
<P>
Technology oriented companies received the strongest support
from venture capital support, EDB said, adding the information
technology industry received the highest number of investment,
with 13 companies enjoying 16 million Singapore dollars (about 9.7
million U.S. dollars) of the fund invested in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: HK Signs Record Number of Agreements With Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, as authorized by
the Central People's Government, has signed 23 agreements with 17
countries in six areas since its return to China on July 1 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six more bilateral agreements are being negotiated with
42 countries, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
These areas involve air services, surrender of fugitive
offenders, air transit, investment protection, transfer of
sentenced persons and mutual legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hong Kong has concluded accords with foreign states
and made administrative arrangements within the limits of its
autonomy in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"It is unprecedented that Hong Kong has signed so many
agreements with foreign countries in a short span of 500 days,"
said Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"This shows the determination of the Central People's
Government to resolutely implement the principle of 'one country,
two systems' and the Basic Law, and to maintain Hong Kong's broad
contacts with the international community," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, the number of bilateral agreements that
Hong Kong signed with foreign countries averaged less than 10 a
year.
</P>
<P>
As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong
continues to maintain and develop wide-ranging contacts with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant stipulations of the Basic Law, the SAR
government, authorized by the Central People's Government, can
negotiate and sign agreements with foreign countries on the
above-mentioned six areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong is also authorized by the Central People's
Government to negotiate agreements or arrangements with foreign
countries and regions on the granting of visa-free access.
</P>
<P>
Now 56 countries and regions have agreed to grant visa-free
access to HKSAR passport holders.
</P>
<P>
But, in the course of more than 100 years before 1985,
Britain's bilateral agreements were applied to Hong Kong and the
latter had no power to conclude agreements with foreign partners
in these six areas.
</P>
<P>
The situation changed fundamentally only after the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong became effective in
1985.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Chinese government's policies on Hong
Kong to be implemented after 1997, the Chinese side agreed that
Britain could authorize the British Hong Kong government to
negotiate separately bilateral agreements with foreign countries
in such areas as air services and surrender of fugitive
offenders.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Canyon Narrower Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Yarlung Zangbo canyon on
southwest China's Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, claimed by Chinese
scientists as the world's longest and deepest canyon, is narrower
than formerly believed, said several scientists here today, who
have hiked the canyon recently.
</P>
<P>
"The narrowest point, discovered for the first time in the
heart area of the canyon, is only 35 meters wide," said Gao
Dengyi, executive vice-chairman of the China Association of
Scientific Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
"Formerly, it was believed that the narrowest point in the
canyon was 78 meters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he gave no details on the exact length and depth of
the canyon, data which they attempted to obtain during their
expedition from October 19 to December 10.
</P>
<P>
"The width at the narrowest point of the canyon is easy to get,
but the length and depth of the canyon needs further verification
by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese scientists made careful surveys of the
canyon in 1994, and determined its length to be 496.3 kilometers
and its average depth more than 5,000 meters, which would make it
the world's longest and deepest canyon.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States
and the Canyon of Cerro Colca in Peru had been considered the
longest and deepest canyons in the world, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, because of technical problems, the data gathered by
Chinese scientists in the early 1990s are now considered not
completely accurate. So one of the important tasks for the
expedition team this time was measuring the canyon with the Global
Positioning System and other modern scientific methods, and
updating the relevant data.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey soon will be announced by the State
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, according to Gao.

Hong Kong has over the years signed air services agreements
with 34 countries, of which 13 were sealed after Hong Kong
returned to China. The signing of the agreements has provided
convenience for the expansion of ties between Hong Kong and these
countries in the fields of economy, trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has also concluded accords for the promotion and

 the two sides provide for equal treatment of investors and for
the settlement of investment disputes in accordance with
international norms. As a result, the interests of investors are
fully guaranteed and Hong Kong's position as a financial and
trade center has been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hong Kong has signed agreements on the surrender of
fugitive offenders with 11 countries, accords on the transfer of
sentenced persons with two countries, and agreements on mutual
legal assistance in criminal matters with seven countries.
</P>
<P>
These have laid a legal basis for joint crackdown on criminal

pollution levels in the Chinese capital, Beijing Municipal
Government is to issue special environmental protection licences
for autos whose tail gas emissions have reached the set standard
for discharge, said Wang Guotao, vice-mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The new system will be introduced early in 1999 and Wang said
that the authorities will also ban cars which do not meet the
required emission levels especially when air quality exceeds the
normally acceptable pollution ratio.
</P>
<P>
This year the municipal government has taken 18 severe measures
to combat the serious air pollution in China's capital, eight of
which are aimed a reducing tail gas discharges from autos,
considered to be one of the main reasons for air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken so far include:
</P>
<P>
Insisting that all autos which have not reached the national
standards be taken off the road and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Improving the monitoring of tail gas discharges.
</P>
<P>
Extending the areas prohibiting the use of trucks during
daytime.
</P>
<P>
Prohibiting the use of buses, and vehicles involved in
sanitation and waste collection if their tail gases do not reach
the lower standard for discharges.
</P>
<P>
As an ongoing regulation, from now on automobile manufacturers
selling products in Beijing will have to establish tail gas
control stations using national standards.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will also improve the monitoring of
new vehicles for anti-pollution features from January 1 1999 as
well.

</P>
<P>
Under her leadership, Dazhai Village has given up the extensive
"self-sufficient" economy for which it was famous and prosperous
and set up manufacturing businesses. The 52-year-old Guo Fenglian
is now chairman of the board and general manager of the Dazhai
Economic Development Company.
</P>
<P>
But many Dazhai villagers are not keen to discuss their past
and many seem to be disillusioned by it.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason may be that when China introduced the reform
and opening-up policy in 1978, the people of Dazhai were not too
impressed and were slow to adapt to the new system. The household
responsibility system was introduced to Dazhai late in 1983, thus
putting an end to the communal activities they had been used to.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining years of the 1980s and the beginning of the
1990s, Dazhai was out of the public eye. It wasn't until 1991,
when Guo Fenglian returned to Dazhai after working away for many
years in a local fruit-tree research institute, that the village
began to catch up with both China and the world's development.
</P>
<P>
Guo has proved her worth as a good business woman . In 1992, when
she attended the 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party in Beijing as a delegate, she took along dozens of sweaters
made by the Dazhai Sweater Mill and gave them as gifts to many
delegates. This has helped market and promote the sweaters across
China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Dazhai Village took over the Xiyang County Distillery
and formed the Dazhai Distillery Co. Ltd., signing a contract with
the Laojiao Distillery of Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region to employ experts to show them how to run it. The new
company soon began making the "Dazhai Chun" brand of clear liquor
and has so far sold more than 1,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
Now, most of the residents say that they are more content with
their new life styles, as they are not only prosperous but also can
speak their minds without fear of being punished, as they were in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Even though young people riding around on motorcycles or
watching television are not so familiar with the ways of their
elders, they do admire the spirit of the older generation which
helped build the modern day Dazhai which they now enjoy.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rejects MILF Demand for Islamic State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday rejected any compromise deal with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) over its demand for a separate
Islamic republic in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here, Estrada said that his
administration would exhaust all means in seeking peace agreements
with MILF and other rebel groups, provided such negotiations are
held within the framework of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a peaceful settlement... but if they insist on
having their own state, that will be a different story because we
have to defend our constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no compromise. We have to protect our
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, President Estrada said his administration wants
to go back to the negotiation table with the Muslim rebel group in
January 1999 after the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of
daily fasting.
</P>
<P>
In response, the MILF reaffirmed its demand Tuesday for the
establishment of a separate state in Mindanao, the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that his administration will never
accept this MILF demand because it would contravene the 1987
Charter, which he has sworn to "defend at all times" when he
assumed the presidency in July.
</P>
<P>
Thus, any resumption of peace talks with the MILF or other
rebel groups should be held within the framework of the Philippine
Constitution, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), which entered into a peace agreement with the
Philippine government in 1996. The former leader of the MNLF, Nur
Misuari, is now governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here this evening that China is willing to further
the friendly and cooperative relations with other countries in the
coming new year.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks at the annual New Year reception in honor
of diplomatic envoys, representatives of international
organizations and their wives residing in China.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, his wife Zhou Hanqiong and other
senior Chinese officials attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 is an unusual year for China. In face of the
Asian and the subsequent global economic turbulence, we have
maintained political and social stability and achieved a steady
economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China won a victory over the devastating floods, he
said, adding that the campaign demonstrated the strong will and
great cohesion of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, according to the foreign minister, China also actively
pursued an all-round independent foreign policy for peace and
strengthened and developed cooperation and friendly relations with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said with the arrival of the year 1999, the new century is
to come soon. "At the turning point of the century, the
multi-polarization and economic globalization will develop further
in a world, which is full of hopes and also faced with grave
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China and the resumption
of exercise of sovereignty over Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will continue its reform and opening-up
drive and as always pursue an independent foreign policy for
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, China wished to further
strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with
other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence, and continue its unremitting efforts to safeguard
world peace and promote the common development for mankind.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Telecom Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to
significantly lower telecommunications service fees, according to
a joint hearing held here today by the Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) and the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release from the two-day hearing which
concludes today, the MII has put forward a plan to lower fees for
leased telephone lines and international telephone calls, and
raise fees for local calls and postal services.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the general level of overall charges for
telecommunication and postal services will drop significantly,
the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The public hearing was the first held by the MII since it was
set up in March. Among the more than 50 participants at the
hearing were representatives from users, operators, government
institutes, non-government communities, provincial price and post
and telecommunications administrations, and economists and other
experts.
</P>
<P>
"This hearing is a very positive trial," a MII official said,
adding that it's purpose is to upgrade the payment system of
China's post and telecommunications industry to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
China has repeatedly adjusted this payment system over the past
few years, and in December 1996 it lowered the fees for telephone
installation, leased lines and international telephone calls and
integrated fee scales for long distance call within the
country. At the same time, fees for postal services and local
telephone calls have been raised.
</P>
<P>
The MII will amend the fee adjustment plan after the hearing,
and hand it's decision over to the State Council for approval in
the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress
(NLC) has announced the suspension of its 12-day ultimatum,
saying that it was satisfied with the government's assurance of
reviewing oil price increase.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a meeting between government
officials and labor leaders in capital Abuja Tuesday, The
Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A decision was made at the meeting to set up two committees
which will discuss and make recommendations on the increase
in oil pump price and the issue of minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the NLC issued the ultimatum which expires on
January 4, 1999, urging the Nigerian government to reverse the
price increase of petroleum products or face the wrath of workers
nationwide after oil marketers increased the official price of
petroleum from 11 Naira (about 0.13 U.S. Dollars) to 25 Naira per
liter.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Nigerian Labor and Productivity Minister
Emmanuel Udogu told reporters in Abuja that the government has
asked the workers in the country to look at their demands with
national interest.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that low revenue expected from
the 1999 budget pegged on nine Dollars per barrel of oil, was
cited by the government as the reason for the inevitable oil
price hike last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China now leads the world in
the growing and output of grapefruit, producing 920,000 tons in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, China has developed several varieties of
grapefruit and set up six centers for growing the sweet fruit in
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as in Guangdong, Hunan,
and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
The county of Jiangyong in Hunan Province, south of the
Yangtze River, is considered the country's best growing area for
citrus fruits generally. It aims to generate 1.6 billion yuan in
annual grapefruit sales by increasing its planting areas from the
current 6,600 ha. to 13,300 ha. by the early part of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at the 5th national grapefruit scientific
and research cooperation meeting held recently in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Grapefruit is now native to China, and other countries and
regions in Southeast Asia, having been introduced as long as 4,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential to exploit the export of grapefruit in
China, according to experts, as it only accounted for 7.47 percent
of the country's total citrus fruit output in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Industrial Polluters in Taihu Lake Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China has shut down 143
factories with serious pollution problems in the Taihu Lake valley
because of their tardiness in introducing anti-pollution measures.
</P>
<P>
All factories with a daily waste water emission of 100 tons
have to meet state standards before January 1, 1999, the State
Council has decreed.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that 878 factories, or nearly 85 percent
of the 1,035 major polluters in the region have installed water
treatment facilities and met the standards.
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen factories are still installing the safeguards," said
an official with the State Environmental Protection Administration
(SEPA). "However, they will be forced to stop production if they
fail to finish within the next two days.
</P>
<P>
"All polluters have to meet emission standards before the
deadline, or be shut down," said Xie Zhenhua, director of the SEPA.
</P>
<P>
Key SEPA officials are working in the Taihu Lake valley
supervising the fight against pollution and carrying out round the
clock spot checks.
</P>
<P>
A number of factories have been severely penalized in the past
few days for stopping the waste water treatment.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA has asked environmental departments in the region to
strictly enforce the law and cut water and electricity supplies to
closed factories.
</P>
<P>
The administration will carry out a major inspection around the
valley on the New Year's eve, joining forces with officials from
the State Development Planning Commission, the State Economic and
Trade Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Tough measures will be taken against offenders on the night,
officials insist pointing out that the results of the checks will
also be publicized.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Additional Funding for Ethiopia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU),
which is funding Ethiopia's 266-km-long Addis Ababa-Modjo-Awassa
road project, has approved an additional cost of 3.96 million
U.S. Dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
To fulfil the new strategy of the road project, EU has agreed
an additional commitment of 9.55 percent on the original
contract, bringing the new total cost of the project to 45.42
million U.S. Dollars, Ethiopian English weekly The Reporter
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy to completely reconstruct the Addis
Ababa-Modjo section of the Addis Ababa-Modjo-Awassa road project
was suggested by the Ethiopian Road Authority.
</P>
<P>
In line with the new strategy, the existing pavement is being
milled to a depth of 20 centimeters and reshaped and compacted to
provide a sub-base for the new pavement.
</P>
<P>
Under the original project contract which was singed in September
1997, the work for the Addis Ababa-Modjo section of the road
concerned mainly the repair of the existing pavement.
</P>
<P>
The contract includes repairs of distressed areas and potholes
as well as the reconstruction of areas with base failure
conditions, filling of cracks and the provision of an overlay.
</P>
<P>
A detailed road condition survey carried out by the Ethiopian
Road Authority in March/April 1998 showed that the condition of
the road was so bad that it needed a complete reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The EU-financed Addis Ababa-Modjo-Awassa road is the most
important highway in Ethiopia, connecting the southern and
eastern regions and the ports of Assab and Djibouti to the
capital and the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The project includes the rehabilitation of 266-km asphalt road
to be undertaken in two sections. The first section involves the
reconstruction of a 61-km road from Addis Ababa to
Modjo, while the second section covers the rehabilitation of the
205-km road from Modjo to Awassa.
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed in 40 months under the new
strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province continues
to retain its position as China's most attractive target for
investments in spite of emerging unfavorable factors such as
rising land and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
The south China province, the pioneer of the nation's reform
and opening policies, approved more than 13,000 overseas-funded
projects during the January-October period this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 the year the country introduced the reform and
opening-up policy, Guangdong has taken full advantage of the
reform and opening policies, as well as its favorable geographical
location.
</P>
<P>
The province has consummated over 200,000 contract for overseas
investments worth 81.1 billion US dollars over the past two
decades, or close to 36 percent of the national total for the
period.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide deepening of the reform and opening has helped
the province to extend great effort to improve its market system
and accelerate the introduction of international standards for
local business activities, according to Cai Fuchun, director of
the Guangdong Foreign Economic and Trade Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
William Bowles, president of IBM China, attributes the
company's expansion in Guangdong to the strong local material and
technological base, export-oriented economy, vast market potential
and large contingent of professionals.

<P>
Bowles expressed satisfaction with the investment environment
in the province and noted that IBM built a second plant earlier
this year at a cost of 20 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province has spent over 190 billion yuan on highway,
railway, airport, and telecommunications construction over the
past two decades. The province's transportation and
telecommunications network includes railways stretching over 2,000
km and highways running 90,000 km, as well as 10 airports and 14
million telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Cai predicted that Guangdong will continue to witness
sustained, stable and rapid economic development which will
increase the influx of overseas investments in coming years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the local economic growth rate will quite likely
edge down to 10 percent over the next few years, but added that
province still expects to attract annual overseas investments of
10 billion US dollars. The per capita income for urbanites will
continue to grow by six percent annually, with the growth rate for
rural residents leveling off at around five percent, according to
Cai.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will place priority on attracting investments and
advanced management expertise from multinationals and
international consortiums.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will continue to pursue comprehensive policies to
encourage overseas investments in basic industries, agricultural
modernization and the hi-tech sectors in particular.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Greatly Increase Aquatic Export to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- With the European Union
opening up its market from January 31, 1999, Mozambican aquatic
exports to Europe will see a great increase, Mozambican Minister
of Agriculture and Fisheries Carlos do Rosario has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said here Tuesday that a European Union
delegation to Mozambique early this month conducted a on-the-spot
investigation and was satisfied with the quality of the aquatic
products of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Carlos do Rosario said that his country is
expected to become one of the major exporters of fresh fish to
Europe in 1999.
</P>
<P>
From January to September in 1998, Mozambique earned some 62
million U.S. Dollars from its export of fish, shrimps and prawns
and 60 percent of the export went to Europe, Wednesday's Noticias
newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the aquatic exports earned Mozambique some 99.1
million Dollars, accounting for about 44 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The E.U. decided to ban import of aquatic products from the
poor southern African country after cholera broke out in
Mozambique in the late half of last year and early this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the E.U. lifted the ban in June, it did not fully
open its markets to the Mozambican fishery products.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government took measures in August to
strengthen monitoring and inspection on fishery products and
hygienic situation and meanwhile demanded that the E.U. remove
its ban on the Mozambican products.

<HEADLINE> Warm Winter Pushes Up Death Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The warmest winter in Beijing
for 50 years has taken a heavy toll amongst the old resulting in a
record number of deaths, mostly due to a flu epidemic which has
raged in the capital and around northern China for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics reveal that more than 1800 people have been
cremated in Beijing's Babaoshan Crematorium since December 5th, a
40 percent increase over the same period last year with often more
than 130 bodies a day being handled.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent were aged above 60, most of whom died of
pneumonia, respiratory and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is enjoying unusually mild winter weather and since
mid-December the temperature was a full three degrees higher over
ten consecutive days than last year. But it has helped fuel the
flu outbreak which has seen hospitals crowded with four times the
number of patients than is usual for this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
The freak weather has also threatened plans for an ice lantern
festival in the mountainous Yanqing County in Northern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Its a traditional winter must-see in Beijing when ice blocks
are carved into lanterns with light bulbs fitted inside.
</P>
<P>
But sculptors have been forced to work after dusk to take
advantage of the colder temperature and organizers now say the
festival will have to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
However, they are confident of the weather returning to its
normal cold spell in the New Year when the festival will be held.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Into Law 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday signed into law the 1999 General Appropriations
Act (GAA), authorizing the government to spend the
579.5-billion-peso (145 billion U.S. dollars) pro-poor budget.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before signing the budget into law here, Estrada
said that the early enactment of the budget measure will enable
the Philippine economy to register a real growth rate of 3-3.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He called for prudence and judiciousness in the use of
government financial resources in order to respond to the people's
demand for the most productive and beneficial services.
</P>
<P>
Of the 579.5 billion pesos, nearly 68 percent are dedicated to
key social services, the development of agriculture and priority
infrastructure for rural areas, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
With the approved expenditure program, he said, his
administration will be able to give the economy the push it needs
to get it out of the danger zone of the Asian economic crisis and
set firm the path of steady growth.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the government will play a more active role
in the economy by introducing a number of budgetary reforms in the
coming year in order to make the implementation of the budget more
transparent and potent for stirring economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The budget was approved by the House of Representatives and the
Senate earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Australian Businesses Urged to Solve Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian businesses were
Wednesday urged by an official group to make New Year resolutions
to eliminate the Y2K, or millennium bug, which potentially poses
the biggest threat to their survival.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Inchley, chief executive officer of the Australian
federal government initiated Y2K Industry Program, said not enough
businesses were taking the bug seriously even though there was
only a year to go before it struck.
</P>
<P>
His group has compiled a 10-point checklist of New Year
resolutions for businesses to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Results from recent Australian Bureau of Statistics research
indicate that over 40 percent of businesses have yet to undertake
any preparation for the year 2000 date change program; this number
is far too high," Inchley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Inchley echoed concerns earlier this year of Australian
Communications Minister Richard Alston that many small businesses
saw Y2K as a problem for larger concerns.
</P>
<P>
"A company with only five employees has a high risk of failure
if its critical systems are not checked for year 2000 compliance,"
he warned.
</P>
<P>
The checklist urges businesses to ensure they are prepared for
the bug by taking preparations, including contingency plans for
systems failure, checks on suppliers to ensure their systems were
sound, and sharing information with other companies.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests businesses check the Y2K register on the
Internet to find Y2K compliant vendor products and services, check
with the Australian Taxation Office about tax deductions for Y2K
preparations and lobby industry groups for help.

There had been another telecom blast in Galle of Southern Sri
Lanka early Tuesday. A telecommunications facility at the Galle
junction was extensively damaged in a bomb attack by suspected
Tamil rebels.

<HEADLINE> New Entry-Exit Permit More Convenient for HK, Macao Compatriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A new type of entry-exit
permit will be issued to Hong Kong and Macao compatriots starting
from January 15, 1999, an official from the Exit and Entry
Administration under the Ministry of Public Security announced
today.
</P>
<P>
It will be much more convenient and easy to use and has
in-built anti-forgery functions.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the "Return-Home Certificate for Hong
Kong and Macao Compatriots", which was introduced in 1978, has not
kept pace with technology since China began its opening-up policy
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new entry-exit inspection departments will have electronic
scanners, instead of relying on manual checks, to identify the new
permits and record all the information needed.
</P>
<P>
The credit card size certificate has a ten-year validity period.
</P>
<P>
According to China's laws, all Hong Kong and Macao residents,
whether in possession of foreign passports and tourist
certificates or not, are entitled to apply for the new entry-exit
permit, as long as they do not apply to the Chinese authorities
for foreign registration.
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong and Macao compatriots under the age of 18 are
entitled to apply for a permit with a validity period of three
years, and those 18 and above for a ten year permit.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Ministry of Public Security will
stop issuing the old Return-Home Certificates from January 1st,
1999, but that all existing permits issued before this date can be
used up to the expiry period.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security has authorized the Hong Kong
and Macao branches of the China Travel Service to provide
information about the new permits for applicants.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Lifts Ban on External Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to lift the ban on external borrowing imposed last year
by the former administration of Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of General Staff of the Nigerian armed forces,
Okhari Akhigbe made the remarks Tuesday in Abuja while briefing
reporters on the outcome of a joint meeting of the Provisional
Ruling Council and the National Council of State at which the
1999 budget was approved.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha government announced last July that it would not
borrow from any foreign countries or organizations until it had
paid all its external debt.
</P>
<P>
"We want to remove all barriers that would not allow for the
flexibility in government even now that we are moving to
democratic government," Akhigbe said.
</P>
<P>
"If government finds the need to borrow, then it should be
able to do so," Akhigbe said, adding that "if there is a reason
for you to borrow money to provide water, this is a capital
project. This is part of the things you can never run away from."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the government will control any situation
that will lead to excessive external borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's current external debt stands between 28 to 34
billion U.S. Dollars, according to the estimate of different
sources.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1999 Budget Pegs Oil Price at $9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved the 1999 budget, pegging it on a benchmark of between
nine and 10 U.S. Dollars per barrel of crude oil, about eight
Dollars less than 1998 budget's 17 Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Following a joint meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council
and the National Council of States held in capital Abuja Tuesday,
Chief of General Staff of the armed forces, Mike Akhigbe, said
that the budget will reduce some capital projects and cut down on
the expected expenditure for the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the difficult issues, particularly the problems
of deficit, were adequately discussed by the two councils which
met twice last week, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to reduce it (deficit) to a manageable
level," said Akhigbe, adding that in this regard, "we tried to
avoid a situation whereby we create problem of dwindling
economy."
</P>
<P>
The nine to 10 Dollars oil peg is based on the fact that the
falling international crude oil price will not slide below nine
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the crude oil price slid below nine Dollars, Akhigbe said,
the government has put in place a contingency plan to ensure that
it will not compromise the living standards of Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar is expected
to brief the press ahead of the budget broadcast which is
probably on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of the major oil producing countries in the
world, exporting about two million barrels of crude oil every day
and about 70 percent of its budget revenue depends on oil export.
</P>
<P>
In view of the falling price of crude oil in the international
market, Nigeria can be expected to realize 7.45 billion Dollars
this year from oil export, as against 10.89 billion and 11.99
billion Dollars in 1996 and 1997 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Former Model Village Prospers Under Market Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- For almost twenty years in the
1960s and 70s, Dazhai Village in north China's Shanxi Province was
held up as one of the country's key model communities and was
visited by more than 25,000 foreigners from 134 countries and
regions including heads of state.
</P>
<P>
After the late chairman Mao Zedong in 1964 urged the whole
country to follow Dazhai's example as a working agricultural
unit, more than nine million Chinese visited it to get ideas and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, the villagers of Dazhai relied on their
collective actions to move mountains, fill in gullies and create
farmland from the hills and copses of their region, turning it
into a prosperous place.
</P>
<P>
Today, Dazhai appears very tranquil on the surface and only a
museum at the foot of the hill reminds people of their agrarian
past.
</P>
<P>
Jia Haiwen, the village's 37-year-old accountant, explained
that it seems quiet because most abled-bodied people now work in
village-run industrial enterprises or are engaged in a wide range
of working activities in places outside the village, leaving only
the old and the young at home.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 500, Dazhai Village now boasts seven
enterprises, including a garment-making company, a cement company,
and a distillery, with fixed assets of 54 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Our village-run enterprises also employ quite a number of
people from neighboring villages," said Jia.
</P>
<P>
Adults now only spend their spare time tending the fields which
are easily tilled and maintained mechanically, and are charged 150
yuan (about 18 U.S. dollars) service commission by the village
administration for one hectare of land worked.
</P>
<P>
The net income of local residents has increased from the 700
yuan of a decade ago to today's 2,700 yuan. Leisure goods such as
radios and hi-fis as well as VCD players, are common in many
homes, bringing modern ways to the once rural, mountainous village
life. Old people also receive monthly pensions ranging from 50
yuan to 90 yuan from village funds.
</P>
<P>
This transformation was led by Guo Fenglian, who can be seen in
photographs of the time wearing a Mao-suit and wearing her hair in
two plaits at the back. In others she is depicted as a
militia woman and holds a rifle.

<HEADLINE> Oil Refinery to Be Built in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANNOI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government gave
license to a Vietnamese-Russian joint-venture to build and run an
oil refinery, the English daily Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture, established on November 19 this year, is
called Vietross Refinery. The 25-year joint-venture has a
projected investment capital of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, funded
equally by its two partners -- Vietnam's sole oil and gas
operator, Petro Vietnam, and Russia's External Economic
Federation, Zarubeznheft.
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture should be able to refine 6.5 million tons of
crude oil per year. A major source of material for the Dung Quat
oil refinery will be Vietnam's crude oil.
</P>
<P>
This is the second oil joint-venture between Vietnam and
Russia. The first oil production joint-venture between Vietnam and
Russia was Vietsovpetro, which was established in 1986. It has
been Vietnam's major crude oil producer ever since -- its crude
oil volume accounts for about 80 percent of Vietnam's total
output.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has produced 12.6 million tons of crude oil this year
and all most of all the crude oil has been exported.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Employers Try to Solve Housing Problem in Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Employers of high-tech
companies in the Silicon Valley of the United States have
established a new trust fund to help the homeless and those with
low income find places to live in, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Silicon Valley's housing problem has arisen along with
high-tech boom, said Carl Guardino, president of Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, who represents employers of about 250,000
high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
A median priced home sold for 320,000 U.S. dollars in 1996 in
the area, nearly tripled the average.
</P>
<P>
Rents have jumped 30 percent in the past two years in Silicon
Valley. Only about one third of the area's families can afford a
house while about 1,200 poor people sleep outside every night
because shelters are filled.
</P>
<P>
"The fund is a good example of the spirit of Silicon Valley.
We don't just whine about the problem. We work together to solve
it," Guardino said, adding that the companies plan to raise 20
million dollars in two years for their new Housing Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
Those funds will be leveraged to bring in another 80 million
dollars in government grants and loans, according to Leslee
Coleman,executive director of the American Electronics
Association's Bay Area Council.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, organizers announced they had just received
150,000 dollars from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation,
while the Packard Foundation recently donated 180,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local government, Santa Clara County, has also contributed 2
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Community Foundation development director Susan Luenberger
said their challenge now is to get the highly paid executives in
the region to share their wealth.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the top 100 executives in Silicon Valley earned
an average of 6.9 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The money is like funny money to them, and they often are
quite young and don't have much experience with philanthropy,"
said Luenberger.

<HEADLINE> Hydropower Plant in Southwest China Goes on Stream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The first 300,000-kw
generating unit installed at Tianshengqiao first-tier hydropower
station on the Hongshui River was connected to the local power
grid in southwest China's Guizhou Province Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the second 500-kv super high-voltage power
transmission line from Tianshengqiao to Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, also came into service.
</P>
<P>
The Tianshengqiao hydropower station is one of a series planned
to be built on the Hongshui River. It is jointly financed between
the State, Guangdong and Guizhou provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region with a total investment of 10.352 billion yuan,
including the use of 19.6 billion Japanese yen from the
International Cooperation Fund of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Four 300,000-kw generating units will be installed at the
station which will be able to generate 5.23 billion kwh of
electricity annually on completion in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
In another development, four 220,000-kw generating units
installed at Tianshengqiao's second-tier hydropower station
downstream have been linked to local power grids. By 2000, two
other 220,000-kw generating units will be added to this station,
making the Tianshengqiao area a major power source for
transmitting electricity from western to eastern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
While stepping up construction of hydropower stations, China
has completed four power transmission lines and has been
constructing two other power transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
The State is also to make further investments in constructing
three new large power stations in cooperation with the local
governments of southwest China.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the power grids of southwestern China will
have reached a power transmission capacity of four million kw, 3.5
million kw of which will be used to transmit power to Guangdong.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Releases More Social Security Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Social Security System
(SSS), the only government agency in the Philippines mandated to
collect and manage insurance funds for private sector workers,
released 25.2 billion pesos (625 million U.S. dollars) in benefits
for its 19 million members in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The amount was 23 percent higher than the previous year's
disbursement of benefit funds, the Philippine News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SSS Chairman Carlos A. Arellano was quoted by the agency as
saying that of the total benefit disbursement, 96 percent went to
social security benefits while 4 percent went to employees'
compensation benefits.
</P>
<P>
The higher disbursement of benefit funds could be attributed to
the strengthening of SSS programs, a move which Arellano
immediately embarked on after he was appointed SSS chief by
President Joseph Estrada, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Supporting the president's pro-poor stance, Arellano moved to
increase the benefits of SSS members without requiring additional
contributions from them, it said.

<HEADLINE> Unions Have Increasing Role in Foreign-Funded Firms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, not all overseas-funded businesses have experienced
the same situation as Mr. Saito.
</P>
<P>
W. Keith Lomason II, general manager of the Shanghai Lomason
Automotive Seating Systems Co., Ltd., confesses that he worried
during the first years of the Sino-U.S. joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"But after three years, I now understand that trade unions in
China are not like those in North America who are always in
confrontation with the management," he said.
</P>
<P>
The American entrepreneur said that in China, the unions
encourage the staff to be enthusiastic and even help develop
production techniques and quotas.
</P>
<P>
The general manager has been personally involved in some union
activities. With his support, the workers have created roof-top
gardens as well as opening their own laundry, gymnasium, library
and meeting room.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade unions have never forgotten their real
responsibilities. For example, union leaders angrily intervened
when two women working at the Hotel Nikko Shanghai, a solely owned
Japanese venture, were given an illegal and rough body-search.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Japanese general manager was forced to publish a
letter regretting the incident and his salary was cut. Three other
lower-ranking Japanese managers were dismissed for their part in
the incident and the two Chinese women were each paid 8,000 yuan
in compensation.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xianglin, a law expert with the Shanghai Federation of
Workers' Unions, said that the unions in overseas-funded
businesses in China do not just look after the welfare of the
workers or engage in struggle with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
"They work to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the
staff, negotiate when differences occur between workers and
management, and help establish a stable relationship between the
two sides; all to help develop the enterprise in a healthy way,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Unions in China have built a bridge for communication,
understanding and cooperation between the two sides in business,
he added.

<HEADLINE> CNPC Producing High Profits, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC) is expected to realize 29.75 billion yuan in profits
and taxes this year despite declining oil prices worldwide and the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNPC source, the corporation is expected to have
turned out more than 100 million tons of crude oil and nearly 14.9
billion cu m of natural gas by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A senior CNPC official noted that China's petroleum industry
has been seriously affected by the Asian financial crisis
and the declining oil markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, the domestic demand for crude oil and
refined oil products was slackening and smuggling rampant.
</P>
<P>
Facing such difficulties, China has reduced imports of crude
oil and related products, increased the domestic supply for
foreign-funded enterprises and made efforts to crack down on oil
smuggling, effectively reducing the effects of falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China has also strengthened
macro-control over crude and related oil products markets and
promoted the rational distribution of crude and related oil
products resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has accelerated its reform of the oil
circulation and pricing systems and reshaped the China National
Petroleum (CNPC) Corp. and the China National Petrochemical Corp
(Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
Under the new oil system, China has combined upstream and
downstream production, in addition to integrating internal and
external trade.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that it discovered three oil and gas
fields this year, each with oil reserves exceeding 100 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, CNPC verified 485 million tons of oil and 223.2
billion cu m of natural gas this year.

<HEADLINE> 95,000 Mozambicans Benefit from Danish Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 95,000 Mozambicans
benefited from a Danish emergency aid program in 1998, according
to an annual report of the office of the Danish People to People
Relief Association in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Noticias newspaper quoted the report as saying
that the 150-ton aid goods it has collected include food, seeds
and used clothes imported from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Danish association Tuesday said
that five provinces, namely Maputo, Gaza, Manica, Sofala and
Tete, are recipients of the aid.
</P>
<P>
The used clothes came from some European countries including
Switzerland, Austria, Spain and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The emergency aid program implemented by the Danish relief
group was designed to help those vulnerable to wars and natural
disasters by donating to them used clothes, food and seeds.
</P>
<P>
The program was also funded by the Austrian government and the
United States Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
The Danish relief group also employs the income from the sales
of the used clothes to offer health care to the victims
traumatized during the 16-year-old civil war in Mozambique and
provide education to the vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 91,000 Mozambicans got 126 tons of used clothes
from the aid program.
</P>
<P>
An aid for children program was implemented by the Danish
relief group in Mozambique's central Manica province. For last
year, children from 2,206 families benefited from the program in
both education and health care.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Expand Development of Township Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Ministry of Agriculture recently told Xinhua that plans have been
worked out to call for accelerating the development of township
enterprises to alleviate poverty in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yongtao, director of the ministry's Township Enterprise
Bureau, said the development of township enterprises will promote
economic growth in the regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will provide training over the
next two years to raise the qualifications of the personnel
working for township enterprises and upgrade the technological
level of local industries.
</P>
<P>
The regions will also enjoy favorable financial policies,
including discounted annual interest on loans of approximately
one billion yuan, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The output value for China's township enterprises currently
accounts for close to a third of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP), with rural enterprises accounting for close to 67
percent of the total rural value-added.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises in central and western China, areas which
are home to 60 percent of the country's total population, account
for 40 percent of the gross output value of township enterprises
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the relatively poor economic performance in
the region to the underdevelopment of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The regions are also home to the bulk of China's
poverty-stricken population. One reason cited for the large
number of needy people is that rural enterprises in western areas
provide only eight percent of total income for farmers, compared
to some 80 percent in east China.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the local governments in central and western
provinces have listed the development of township enterprises
high on their agendas. Northwest China's Gansu Province listed
related efforts as a top priority which will represent a
fundamental step in economic revitalization.

The central government has actively promoted economic
cooperation between rural enterprises in eastern coastal and
midwestern regions since 1995 in order to tap vast potential of
abundant natural and labor resources in the latter. The effort
has also centered on introducing advanced technology and
equipment from eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The regions have drawn investments of over 40 billion yuans
over the past three years, with over 40,000 cooperative projects
involving total investments of 75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises in the regions have also experienced
various problems during the course of rapid development.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the rapid growth of township
enterprises has generated a large demand of capital which cannot
be satisfied simply by the capacity of enterprises to accumulate
funds, central government allocations or investments from eastern
companies.
</P>
<P>
The fact that banks have been reluctant to shoulder the
responsibility has made it difficult for small rural enterprises
to obtain loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outdated management concepts of entrepreneurs
and incompetence of employees have also hindered the development
of rural industry in central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Sun Longshan, a high-ranking official with the Provincial Tow
nship Enterprise Bureau in east China's Jiangsu Province, said
that some cooperative projects have faced difficulties when left
to the management of local enterprises the regions. He noted that
eastern companies have in many cases been forced to dispatch p
ersonnel to solve related problems.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth in poverty-stricken regions will depend on
the training and qualifications of local personnel," according to
Sun.
</P>
<P>
In addition, underdeveloped transportation infrastructure has
caused overseas companies and eastern enterprises to hesitate
when considering investments in the regions. Related companies
unacquainted with the regions have also exhibited uncertainty
about existing economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is fully cognizant of the situation and
has stressed the implementation of all favorable policies. The
government has also introduced measures to attract investment and
train personnel in government branches and enterprises, as well
as to accelerate infrastructure construction in central and
western areas.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Consumer Prices Up 7.5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, this year's inflation rate stood at 7.5 percent and
it was lower than the government expected. In 1997, it was 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Through consultations with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF),the country originally predicted the inflation rate would
reach nine percent in the middle of this year, but it later
revised the downward inflation target.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed this year's high inflation to the
won's steep depreciation in the wake of the financial crisis
caused by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions in late 1997 and on tax increases.
</P>
<P>
Due to the financial turmoil that brought down the won against
the U.S. dollar, consumer prices soared as import prices for
crude oil and other key materials surged.
</P>
<P>
However, consumer prices began stabilizing from the middle of
this year thanks to the won's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
"We expect inflation for the year of 1999 to remain at three
percent on average as both consumption and investment show
continuing stability," said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last November, South Korea and the IMF agreed to
contain the 1999 inflation below five percent.

<HEADLINE> New PBOC Branches to Begin Operation on January 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), China's central bank, announced today that its newly
established branches will be open for business from January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Following a decision by the State Council, the PBOC carried out
a significant reform of its administrative system by establishing
nine regional branches to replace its original branches in
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The new branches are located in Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai,
Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two business administration offices of the PBOC
will be set up in Beijing and Chongqing to replace the original
PBOC branches in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The work of the new branches will be to implement the state's
related laws, regulations, principles and policies, while
comprehensively supervising and administering the business
activities of the financial institutions under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
They will also be responsible for managing the central bank's
monetary and credit policy business including capital, deposited
reserves, interest rates and cash management, as well as analyzing
each region's financial situation and financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also gave details about the establishment of
financial supervisory offices and central sub-branches of the PBOC
in provincial capital cities.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: China Committed to Intellectual Property Protection (1) </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- As certain parts of the world
experience economic chaos as the year draws to a close, China has
again stood out as the protector of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The world's most populous nation did not pay lip service to
this but made substantial progress in ensuring its success, even
though it only introduced the world standard for IP in the last
twenty years.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the China Patent Office was upgraded to the
State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), directly under the
highest executive body -- the State Council. Apart from its former
functions and powers, the SIPO is empowered to coordinate with
other countries on IP issues, such as copyright, inventions,
trademarks and patents.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Chinese government set up the first IP training
center in Beijing. SIPO officials hope that by attracting
international IP experts and scholars it will take the lead in the
Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Attending an international IP symposium in April in Beijing,
Francois Curchod, deputy director-general of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), declared that China has
made "tremendous progress" in protecting intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has promoted a greater awareness of intellectual
property, and the WIPO intends to continue and enhance still close
cooperation with it," Curchod said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: China Committed to Intellectual Property Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1982, the state has introduced trademark, patent and
copyright laws as well as regulations for the protection of
computer software and instituted a law against unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
This year the SIPO also carried out nationwide spot checks on
288 patent agencies, including nine specializing in foreign
business, looking into their business operations, internal
discipline, financial audit and personnel training. It has
announced such checks will be held every two years and that those
agencies which don't reach the pre-set standards will receive a
warning or be banned from operating.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 580 patent agencies, with more than 4,800
authorized agents in China.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the new legislation Chinese enterprises have
also shown a greater awareness of IP protection. According to
statistics released by the SIPO, there has been an average 25
percent yearly growth of patent applications. Most of them have
come from a number of large, efficient and profitable industrial
enterprises. Coastal areas and economically-developed regions have
also taken the lead in these matters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has ensured the success of IP by enforcing
its laws strictly. Over the last six years, courts nationwide
handled 22,860 IP disputes, reaching verdicts on 21,830.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Chinese law, and in agreement with
international procedure, the courts have increased the legal
protection of intellectual property rights for plagiarizism,
illegal copying and forgery as well as for breaches of contract.

<P>
The revised Criminal Law took effect in October 1997 and allows
for a three to seven year prison sentence for offenders.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Supreme People's Court plans to set up a web site
on the Internet, providing information about various court
verdicts in IP cases.
</P>
<P>
In June, Chinese customs began its biggest ever crackdown on
copyright piracy, crushing more than 1.8 million smuggled compact
discs in Guangzhou. Since 1996, the authorities have shut down and
dismantled 64 VCD production lines throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have highly praised China's commitment to IP
protection. Lois Boland, an official with the US Patents and
Trademarks Office, said, "We have been happy with the progress in
China."
</P>
<P>
China did become involved in IP disputes with the United States
some years ago but a new report indicates that last year China had
taken the lead over most other countries in patent applications
and approval. The state has also cracked down heavily on
counterfeit goods and copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese experts, senior U.S. trade officials and
representatives from world IP organizations conducted a live
interactive Worldnet dialogue about IP issues in July.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kirk, executive director of the American Intellectual
Property Law Association, said that the patent system has been in
effect for more than 200 years in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Although China introduced such a system only two decades ago,
it has established a set of fairly good laws and regulations,"
added Kirk, a former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce
and Deputy Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Passage of Securities Law Has Positive Impact on Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Qian Yuhong
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market reacted
poorly to the news of the passage of the nation's first Securities
Law with sliding stock prices and a slim turnover.
</P>
<P>
Although the two bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen edged up
today to close at 1148 and 2952 points respectively, the stock
indices of the two markets had already slid more than ten percent
from six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the poor performance of the market is not apparently
dampening the enthusiasm of investors, who believe that the new
law will have a positive impact on the market in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
The law -- five years in the making and finally approved by the
National People's Congress, China's legislature, on Tuesday --
promises an airtight and comprehensive regulatory framework that
will rule out market irregularities and over-speculation, which
have severely hit individual investors over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The markets have remained sluggish for six weeks in a row,
because the rumor about the passage of the Securities Law has been
driving great amount of illegal funds away from the market,"
explained Chen Jinling, research director with the Guotai
Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Actually the current bearish market promises an easier path to
a rationalized market ruled by law in the future, and the passage
of the Securities Law will prove to be of great benefit in the
long run," stressed Chen.
</P>
<P>
Individual investors, who lost the most as a result of market
irregularities and over-speculation in the past, are expected to
gain a lot from the passage of the law, because such a law - in
any country - makes the interests of the individual investors a
priority to encourage their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 38 million stock investors, and individual
investors comprise more than 90 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Overspeculation, insider trading and the spreading of false
market rumors have long been plaguing China's stock market since
it was launched eight years ago, and sometimes the financial risks
have become so enormous that the government has been forced to
step in to cool the market down.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weimin, 29 years old, said he is a firm believer in blue
chips but has lost more than 10,000 yuan in one year as a result
of the investment rationale.
</P>
<P>
"When blue chips are the favorite son on most mature stock
markets, they are dumped on China's market like hot potatoes,"
said Zhang, who is deeply concerned at the situation and
considering whether to sell his stocks at a loss.
</P>
<P>
Still, Zhang has hopes that the new law will help create fair
opportunities for all investors, promise high returns for
investors in companies with a good performance and potential and
thereby encourage rational stock-investing in the future.
</P>
<P>
Overseas comment about the passage of the Securities Law has
been positive and foreign observers believe it will break the
unending cycle of government intervention brought on by various
froms of trading irregularities and speculation, which has
dominated the eight-year history of the two bourses in Shanghai
and Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Train Fares to Go up Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Railways
Corporation (TRC) will increase its passenger train fares for
first and second class by a margin of 37 to 50 percent from the
beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The fare hike, however, will not affect common people as it
specifically targets at first class and second class (sleeping)
passengers, according to TRC Acting Director General Isaac
Mwakajila.
</P>
<P>
TRC, owner of 1,560-mile Central Railway track, which runs
from Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean to the lakes of Victoria
and Tanganyika, has to hike its fare due to increase in its
operational costs, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mwakajila was quoted as saying that passenger fare for first
class between Dar es Salaam to the Lake Tanganyika town of Kigoma
has been increased to 45,200 Shillings (about 67 U.S. Dollars)
from 30,200 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
First class passengers traveling from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza
town on the southern shore of Lake Victoria will have to pay
44,600 Shillings instead of 29,800 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Fares for second class (sleeping) from
Dar es Salaam to Kigoma and Mwanza have respectively been raised
from 33,100 Shillings from 24,200 Shillings, and 32,600 Shillings
from 23,900 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Third class, second class (sitting) and TRC ship passenger
fares remain unchanged, Mwakajila said.
</P>
<P>
TRC incurred a loss of 20 billion Shillings from devastating
floods caused by El Nino in late 1997 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
The last time TRC raised its fare was in Novermber 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Central Railway was built a century ago when Tanganyika
was still a colony of Germany. The other line Tanzania has is
the Tanzania-Zambia Railway.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Anticipate Increased Prawn Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
optimistic that applications of advanced technology will increase
China's prawn production.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Jianhai, a researcher with the Marine Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, noted that
technicians have helped prawn breeders in Guangdong, Hainan and
Guangxi provinces develop prawn farms which produce 400 kg of
prawns per mu.
</P>
<P>
Plastic film lining the bottom of breeding ponds facilitates
the removal of mud and saltwater is recycled through an enclosed
system.
</P>
<P>
China was the world's largest prawn producer in the late
1980s, with prawn farms covering 2.3 million mu achieving annual
output of between 200,000 and 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, a devastating virus which hit many farms in 1991
reduced the annual output to between 40,000-50,000 tons and China
has since been a major importer of related products.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers have either reduced the density of prawns or
delayed the birthing cycle in recent years to protect prawns from
diseases. However, related actions have dramatically reduced the
per mu output to under 50 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said new technologies such as gender control will be
introduced in the near future and are expected to once again
become one of the world's major prawn producers.
</P>
<P>
Female prawns are bigger than males the same breed when
subjected to the same maturation environment. Scientists are thus
using gender control technology to hatch more female eggs.
</P>
<P>
Xiang pointed out that the female to male birth ratio for
prawns raised by the institute's scientists stands at 4:1, or a
level substantially higher than the 1:1 ratio for prawns bred in
natural environments.

<HEADLINE> New Hollywood Movie Angers S. African Moslems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Moslem community in
South Africa is up in arms about Hollywood's latest movie "The
Siege", The Citizen newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily newspaper, the Moslems are to send a
letter demanding an apology from Ster Kinekor, South Africa's
largest cinema chain, due to its "insensitivity" in distributing
the "anti-Muslim/Islam" film.
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood production, starring Danzil Washington and
Annette Bening, is due for release on the South African circuit
early next year and apparently contains several "anti-Islam bias"
scenes.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Media Review Network, a watchdog
organization dealing with anti-Moslem practices and sentiments in
the media, the movie depicts Moslems as "bad terrorists."
</P>
<P>
"We want the film to be re-edited and all references to the
Koran, Islam and Muslims removed," said Anver Suliman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding an apology to the Moslem community from Ster
Kinekor for its insensitivity," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a script provided to an Islamic advocacy group,
the film is set in Brooklyn, New York, and involves a bombing
campaign by Moslems. This then prompts the American military to
declare martial law and carry out mass arrests of American
Moslems and Arab Americans.
</P>
<P>
"The Moslems see this as a blatant attempt to defame Islam,
the Moslems, once again," said Suliman.
</P>
<P>
Previews of the movie have depicted Moslems at prayer
juxtaposed with acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
He said as recent bombings in Cape Town, Nairobi, Dar es
Salaam, Afghanistan and the Sudan had shown, the constant
repetition of stereotypes and unacknowledged biases inevitably
led to prejudices and and outright violence against a minority
group.
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century Fox, the production company involved in the
making of the film, however, said both the studio and the
filmmakers had had an ongoing and open dialog with representatives
of Arab communities since the production phase.
</P>
<P>
"Although the film was created primarily as entertainment,
another of its intentions was to raise awareness of issues such
as racism and prejudice," said Fox spokesperson, Florence Grace.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the film clearly accomplishes this and regret that
certain organizations have chosen to attack the film because its
antagonist is Muslim, rather than recognizing its broader themes
and positive intentions.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this movie is not anti-Muslim or ant-Arab, but is
rather anti-prejudice and shows the tragic consequences of
racism," Grace said.

<HEADLINE> Unions Have Increasing Role in Overseas-Funded Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 30 (Xinhua) --In many foreign countries,
trade unions are a big headache for management, but for
overseas-funded businesses in China it is a different matter
altogether.
</P>
<P>
Chinese unions work closely with top management to create a
good relationship and even help to promote the products.
</P>
<P>
For example, Lu Xiaomao, vice-chairman of the trade union at
the Shanghai Sharp Electronics Co., Ltd., a Sino-Japanese joint
venture, has been too busy to take a break because the year-end is
approaching.
</P>
<P>
Lu has just submitted to management 50 proposals from staff to
help improve production and now he has to select who will be
rewarded for their ideas.
</P>
<P>
"As a union leader, I have to safeguard the rights and
interests of the workers while helping the management by
encouraging the staff to make useful suggestions about factory
operations," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
"The better the company operates, the better the lifestyle of
the staff," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuo Saito, general manager of Shanghai Sharp, said what has
impressed him most is that the trade union has often mobilized the
workers to promote the firm's products even during holidays. "The
union has become an inseparable part of the company," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Saito, his administration team works on a
fifty-fifty basis with the union to run the company and believes
this gives considerable strength.
</P>
<P>
A regular meeting between the management and the union is now
held once every month, compared with once every three months in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders have succeeded in persuading the management to
offer loans to staff who want to buy their own houses, reduce work
quotas in certain cases, and won additional pension payments for
retirement.

<HEADLINE> Euro to Have Big Impact on Bangladesh: Business Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi economic players are
hopeful of a strong and stable Euro, the single European currency
which will make its debut in the world's financial market on
January 1, 1999, The New Nation daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope while discussing the probable
guidelines and strategy to adjust the country's currency with the
Euro at a meeting of a five-member committee of the Bangladesh
Bank (BB), the central bank of the country, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by the bank's deputy governor, will
submit a report to the bank's governor, suggesting the exchange
rate of the taka, Bangladesh's currency, with the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Since Europe as a region is Bangladesh's biggest trading
partner, the Euro will have a significant impact on the country's
economy and trade, according to committee members.
</P>
<P>
The Euro will be a very strong currency to compete and co-exist
with the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, said President of the
Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries Abdul
Awal Mintoo.
</P>
<P>
The Euro will be a very stable currency, Foreign Investors'
Chamber of Commerce and Industry President A.K.M. Shamsuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry President
Laila R. Kabir said the Euro will make Bangladesh's trade easier
with Europe, the major importer of Bangladesh's garments and
frozen food.
</P>
<P>
While fixing the currency rate of the taka with the Euro,
Bangladesh will have to watch what other regional countries do,
said professor of economics of the Dhaka University Dr. Abu Ahmed,
who is also a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying whether the Euro will be more powerful than the
dollar or not. But I hope it won't be a volatile one," he said,
adding that the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank is
determined to maintain the price stability of the Euro.

<HEADLINE> India Eases Approval of Full FDI in Highways, Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government will
give nod to 100-percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in
highways and ports through an automatic approval route under the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), official sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 100-percent direct investment in the sector is
allowed only on a case-to-case basis by the Foreign Investment
Promotion Board (FIPB), while FDI accounting for only 74 percent
in a project is allowed via the automatic route.
</P>
<P>
The new move is aimed at boosting foreign investment in the
infrastructure sector. In the highways segment alone, the
government is targeting to attract investments of at least 1,250
billion rupees (29.31 billion U.S. dollars) to meet the costs of
expressways that will link all major ports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Surface Transport Ministry has sought to raise 95 billion
rupees (2.23 million dollars) in the ports sector through private
investment.
</P>
<P>
Although the sector was opened in 1996-97, foreign
participation has not really picked up. Foreign investors have
been wary of making direct investment in roads and ports since the
government retains 26 percent equity in the projects, reserving
the power to block resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Disciplines Police Against Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua)-- Tanzania has warned its
police of violation of human rights in the course of exercising their
duty, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Criminal Investigations of the Home Affairs
Ministry, Adadi Rajabu, stressed Tuesday that bestowed with vast powers,
the Police should know their limits.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu told a five-day seminar at the Kurasini Police College here
that the police authorities has launched a nation-wide
campaign against police brutality, vowing to take to book any police
officer violating human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We do not at all condone any abuse of human rights by members of
the police force. We condemn all sorts of such abuses or any form of
police brutality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the Irish government and United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), was attended by more than 30 participants
comprising police trainers, middle rank officers and operational
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said that the police headquarters has a section which deals
with all complaints of police brutality from the citizens by taking
appropriate disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
"Rampant and wanton killings through misuse of firearms, torture
and other forms of harassment have all been reported," he disclosed.
"In some cases, police officers have been discharged from the force
and taken to court to answer criminal charges."
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said that the Tanzanian police force welcomes any
constructive criticism in a bid to mould them into a group of people
who observe the rule of law and uphold human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Endowed with very wide powers including those of arresting,
restraining, remanding and searching people, we are always in direct
confrontation with the rights and liberties of the people. Thus the
necessity of exercising maximum care so as not to infringe upon
peoples' rights unnecessarily," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Director restated the articles 25 to 28 of the Union
Constitution, saying that any policeman and policewoman is not allowed
to claim his or her rights and freedoms by violating their duties and
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that beginning from next year, the police will
introduce special programs on human rights in the television and radio
broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Pioneer of China's Enterprise Reform Never Gives Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 30 (Xinhua) -- One of China's reform
pioneers has now been honored in the northern tourist city of
Qinhuangdao with a huge portrait of himself hung outside the
headquarters of the Bu Xingsheng Clothing Group.
</P>
<P>
Indeed Bu Xingshen is the firm's 65 year-old president and
"Mr. Bu" the trademark attached to all products.
</P>
<P>
He hit the headlines in the 1980s for his bold management
reforms, but because China was not as that time fully prepared for
such reforms, his then business went into decline and Bu was
removed from his post.
</P>
<P>
Opinion has differed about the reasons for his ups and downs,
but business experts speak highly of Bu's pioneering work,
believing that it gave impetus to the first generation involved in
China's reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
"Bu failed initially because the time was not right and now he
has risen once again because a market-driven economy now exists in
China," said Yan Xuruo, a research fellow at the Zhejiang
Provincial Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The story began in 1981, when Bu, an ordinary tailor at the
Haiyan Shirt Factory, in Haiyan City of east China's Zhejiang
Province, was appointed as the factory's director by the city
government.
</P>
<P>
He soon broke decades-old traditions by experimenting with a
series of new management patterns such as the "system of
distribution according to work" and the "production in line with
demand", which were controversial at the time but boosted the
factory's output, resulting in enormous profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
The local media published many stories about his success and
this prompted central and local governments to introduce his
management style nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Soon people would say that it was more difficult to see Bu
Xinsheng than the mayor of the city. And so many people came to
Haiyan to learn his methods that only high-ranking officials were
allowed to visit him in person.
</P>
<P>
Yet the factory soon ran into difficulties, with debts
mounting, resulting in Bu's removal from his post in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Later, he went to work for other clothing factories in
Shanghai, Beijing and Liaoning Province in the northeast. Then in
1993, he was offered his present post by Zhang Bin, the firm's
owner. "I appreciate his initiative, and his popularity, of
course," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bu has increased the capacity of the company by
acquiring several other firms and extending its scope of
operations to include both manufacturing and marketing/sales. Its
assets have surged from four million yuan to 120 million.
</P>
<P>
"It's much easier to run an enterprise nowadays as we have a
better business environment," the reform pioneer said. "I don't
have to waste 70 percent of my effort dealing with various
external interferences as in the past."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Bu has transformed the private
company using modern business methods.
</P>
<P>
Although Bu is now a partner in the firm he declined to
disclose his yearly income. He said he has no plans to retire,
disclosing that his next goal is to turn "Bu Xinsheng" into an
internationally recognized brandname. Bu has also been busy
preparing for his company to go public.

<HEADLINE> 1998: Eventful Year for India's Capital Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Political uncertainty
remained the prime concern for the capital market throughout 1998
in India, The Observer of Business and Politics said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the market showed resilience, the fluid political
and economic situation in India and around the world continued to
throw up surprises, which is something market operators don't
like," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopes of a bullish market were always followed by moments of
despair throughout the year with the sensitive index of the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) touching a high of 4,000 and crashing to as
low as 2,800 ruining small and medium investors," it said.
</P>
<P>
A bombshell was dropped, literally, in May when India exploded
five nuclear devices at Pokhran. Anticipating U.S. economic
sanctions, the market fell sharply by 300 points, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear tests also soured India's relations with Pakistan
and market operators were sure of a sizeable hike in the country's
defense budget," it further said.
</P>
<P>
"The June budget, however, disappointed the market, unleashing
a series of crashes which virtually drove the small investors
out," it said.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of investors are yet to recover from the sudden
crash during June-July which saw many losing their hard-earned
money overnight," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Businesses Permitted to Hold Commodity Exhibitions on Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has decided to allow Taiwan
businesses to sponsor commodity exhibitions on the mainland in
order to improve cross-Straits trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chusheng, a spokesman for the (MOFTEC), announced the
decision on Wednesday. He said the decision was made in response
to increasing trade exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative once again fully demonstrates the mainland's
sincerity in promoting cross-Straits trade relations," said
Hu. "We hope that the Taiwan side will respond positively."
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's management regulations on Taiwan-sponsored economic
and technological exhibitions held on the mainland list five
categories of related events -- cross-Straits economic and
technological exhibitions, export commodities fairs, and
international and national exhibitions involving the participation
of Taiwan businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said promulgation of the regulations is "of great
significance" to mark the forthcoming 20th anniversary of the
Message to Compatriots in Taiwan issued by the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Cross-Straits trade relations have witnessed remarkable
development following issuance of the aforementioned message to
conduct exchanges of mail services, trade, air and shipping
services, and implementation of the principles of peaceful
reunification and "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
To date, the cross-Straits trade volume has hit 134.7 billion
US dollars, including exports of 21.6 billion and imports of 113.1
billion dollars. Taiwan ranks as the mainland's fifth largest
trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Cross-Straits trade exchanges are currently conducted in the
form of trade, as well as Taiwan investments on the mainland and
technological, industrial, fishing and labor cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the mainland sincerely hopes the Taiwan side
should cancel its restrictive policy and initiate direct exchanges
of mail, trade, air and shipping services at the earliest possible
date in order to concretely improve economic and trade
exchanges.

DHAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved a 20-year master plan for the country's second largest
city of Chittagong, said press reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the southeastern part of the country, Chittagong is
also Bangladesh's biggest seaport city with a population of about
six million.
</P>
<P>
Works of formulation of the master plan started in April 1992
with the financial and technical assistance of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and concluded in June 1995.
</P>

The plan, which was finally approved by the Works Ministry this
week, has 76 guidelines including a 10-year urban development
project and two detail area plans aiming at the development of the

<HEADLINE> Thais Rush to Gold as Safe Haven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The survey, conducted recently by the World Gold Council and
made public on Wednesday, said recession-related insecurity has
led to a "gold rush" in Asia as many people, particularly the
Thais, want to swap their unstable currency for the precious
metal.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which examined people's perceptions of gold before
and during the economic crisis, revealed that Asians' affinity for
gold had been significantly enhanced due to the economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
Gold in Thailand has been a traditional medium for investment.
It ranked highest among countries surveyed as the top asset in the
financial portfolios of respondents.
</P>
<P>
Selling of gold took place only as a last resort, with 79
percent of respondents stating they had sold gold to generate
urgent funds for the household. However, 85 percent said they had
no intention of selling more gold during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Pongpan Pongsiribanyat, country manager of World Gold Council,
commented: "Traditionally, gold has always been a safe haven in
times of economic volatility. Thais have had a strong attachment
to gold but now as a result of their experiences of selling during
the crisis, their perception of the asset value of gold is much
stronger."
</P>
<P>
"Because of this combination of sentiment together with a new
awareness of gold's liquidity value, consumers have indicated a
strong intention to buy back most of the gold they 'dis-hoarded'.
Significant purchases are projected in the medium to long-term as
individuals rebuild their assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted across Asian countries including
Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urged to Complete His Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call came as the opposition was stepping up efforts to
launch a no-confidence motion against the coalition government,
coalition sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said earlier that the mission of his term was temporary
and if the economy picked up before 2000, he would dissolve the
House of Representatives and call a general election.
</P>
<P>
But key coalition figures urged Chuan to change his mind,
saying his stay in office would serve the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabaransi, leader of the National Development Party, said
he saw nothing, even the upcoming no-confidence debate, that could
prevent the government from completing its term.
</P>
<P>
Korn, deputy premier and public health minister, said he did
not believe the opposition had enough teeth to make a serious
attack that would lead to major political changes.
</P>
<P>
He reasoned that if the government survived the no-confidence
debate expected in late January, no fresh censure motion could be
filed in the next parliamentary session, which, according to the
constitution, would be reserved for deliberation of bills only.
iversary
of His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej late next year, Korn
expected the political climate would be calm during that time.
</P>
<P>
"That meant we could survive another year so the prime
minister should stay on until 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, meanwhile, said in remarks published by Wednesday's
Bangkok Post that the cabinet ministers should be fully prepared
for the censure, particularly several key figures who were the
main target of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed his ministers could clearly answer
opposition allegations during the censure debate.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Thai people to remain patient and continue
fighting to beat the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan declined to say if the economy would register a growth
next year, but said its recovery would depend on global economic
situations.
</P>
<P>
He cited some positive signs like the stabilization of the baht
and the drop of inflation rate. But he said the liquidity crunch
and bad debts of financial institutions remained unsolved.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said today that China sincerely hopes Japan will strictly
abide by a defense policy limited to its own territory and coastal
waters, and adhere to a peaceful development path.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark today when commenting on the Japanese
government's recent decision to launch four military
reconnaissance satellites in the year 2002, and join the United
States in researching the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program
from 1999.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is deeply concerned about the
political and military connotation of the aforementioned moves, as
well as their possible impact on regional and global security.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that peace and development have been the theme of the
times since the end of the Cold War. He stressed that the
development and spread of a strategic arms system under such
circumstances could possibly spark arms races and harm both the
global strategic balance and stability.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Up 0.9 Percent, Imports Down 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has recorded its worst
annual exports growth rate in a decade, the Vietnam Investment
Review reported in its latest issue, quoting the General
Department of Statistics Data.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 exports growth rate went up just 0.9 percent, while in
the same period, imports in all sectors plunged dramatically due
to tight restrictions on incoming goods, the English-language
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The total value of exports in 1998 was 9.356 billion U.S.
dollars, some 8.3 percent lower than 10.2 billion U.S. dollars
which was officially targeted at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 12 months, Vietnam's imports were valued at 11.39
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of imports restriction policies and
short-term imports substitution measures were clearly demonstrated
by a confirmed 3 percent decline in Vietnam's total imports.
</P>
<P>
The finalized imports and exports figures left Vietnam with a
total end-of-year trade deficit of 2.034 billion U.S. dollars,
considerably lower than last year's deficit of 2.474 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
One Vietnamese trade official said the drop in the trade
deficit figure could lead to a mistaken perception that Vietnam
had begun to benefit from August's dong devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh Casinos Ordered to Be Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Council of
Ministers has approved an order requiring all casinos in Phnom
Penh, capital of Cambodia, to close immediately except two that
have a six-month grace period.
</P>
<P>
The Naga Resorts Floating Casino and the Holiday International
Casino are allowed to operate at their current locations until
June 30, 1999, but after that they must relocate at least 200
kilometers away from Phnom Penh, the Cambodia Daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers also decided that casinos will not be
allowed in Siem Reap town.
</P>
<P>
The order, approved on Monday and effective immediately, also
bans Cambodians from gambling in casinos.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said they hope the ban will help reduce
crime, especially frequent abductions believed to be often related
to gaming debts.
</P>
<P>
"Casinos cause a lot of suffering. They are one of the main
causes of insecurity," a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The order was applauded by government officials as a positive
move in the fight against crime, but some conceded that closing
the casinos will be a difficult task. Some customers at the
Holiday Casino Tuesday said they agreed to the ban, and linked
gambling with crimes.
</P>
<P>
The government passed an anti-gambling law in January 1996,
which imposes maximum fines of 8,000 U.S. dollars and jail terms
of up to five years on owners of illegal gambling clubs.

ensure successful staging of the event.
</P>
<P>
3. At the Winter Olympic Games earlier this year, Germany
returned to the top spot in the medal chart with 12 golds. Norway

Zhang Yuanyuan, a professor of economics at Jinan University,
said the fact that China has already regained sovereignty over
Hong Kong and will witness the return of Macao on December 20,
1999, does not necessarily mean the economic integration in the
south China region will be in place of itself.
</P>
<P>
"Working together to develop the South China Economic Rim and
forging a high-level economic alliance with help from concerned
local governments will not only be in line with the development
trend of economic globalization, but will also fundamentally help
solve existing problems and increase competitive advantages,"
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Guangdong organized a joint cooperation
conference earlier this year to ensure the systemization of
government links. The conference becomes a regular one to be held
in every six months.
</P>
<P>
The development of a transregional network linking local
governments has proceeded smoothly with the installation of a new
fiber optic network serving Guangdong. The transregional network
will become operational in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
High-tech industries in the three areas have increased
cooperation, with related efforts including the establishment of a
Shenzhen-Hong Kong organization specializing in high-tech
industrial parks. Guangdong Governor Lu Ruihua recently noted that
the three areas will focus on high-tech cooperation during 1999.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will allocate 20 billion yuan over the next coming
decade to construct ports of entry needed to facilitate exchanges
with Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on the Lingdingyang Bridge which will link
up Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao is currently in progress. The
proposed project would provide south China with a highly efficient
transportation network of expressways, railways and deepwater
ports.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows 7.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's economy grew 7.8
percent in 1998 despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis,
the National Bureau of Statistics announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The nation has maintained a steady economic growth in the face
of "an extremely complicated international economic situation",
with gross domestic product totaling 7.9748 trillion yuan this
year, Ye Zhen, spokesman for the bureau, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The outcome has basically met the central government's
projection of eight percent, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
China registered an 8.8 percent economic growth last year.
</P>
<P>
A trend of deflation has continued to pose pressure on the
economy this year, with the retail price index falling by 2.6
percent and the consumer price index down by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye, China's exports in 1998 are expected to reach
182 billion U.S. dollars worth, roughly matching last year's
level, while the amount of foreign investment actually used
totaled 54 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the country's imports for 1998 are estimated at
137 billion U.S. dollars worth, down 3.8 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in 1998 will be about 45 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of 4.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's grain output this year reached 490 million
tons, matching last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Cotton output is expected to hit 4.33 million tons in 1998,
down 5.9 percent from last year, while output of oil-bearing crops
is expected to go up by five percent to 22.65 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As China's measures to boost domestic demand began to show
effects, the growth of industrial production picked up in the
middle of this year and sped up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The bureau estimated that the industrial incremental value
increased by 8.8 percent on a yearly basis to 2.012 trillion yuan
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The value produced by state-owned industrial enterprises and
state-controlled firms was up 4.8 percent, while that of
collective industrial enterprises rose 8.8 percent and that of
industrial firms of other types jumped 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ye told that investment in fixed assets in 1998 is expected to
reach 2.868 trillion yuan, up 15 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerated investment has been a major factor spurring
economic expansion," he said, adding that the increased investment
has been designed for infrastructure construction and the
development of basic industries, with priority given to central
and western China.
</P>
<P>
But the consumer market failed to keep pace with the
investment growth. The retail sales of consumer goods expanded by
6.8 percent to 2.9155 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the average per-capita income was 5,454 yuan for
urban residents and 2,150 yuan for rural residents this year, up
6.6 percent and four percent, respectively, in real terms.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the Chinese economy is still confronted with a
number of problems," he said, stressing that further measures
should be taken to overcome the problems such as sluggish
demand, poor performance of many enterprises and increasing
pressures in employment and re-employment.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial enterprises registered an estimated gross
profit of 118.4 billion yuan and a loss of 143.9 billion yuan in
the January-November period.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that China must continue to stimulate domestic demand,
step up the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and strive to
expand exports so as to maintain a sustained, rapid and sound
economic development in the next year.

<HEADLINE> Coach Takes Blame for Women's Doubles Loss in Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian women's badmint
doubles coach Imelda Wiguna Kurniawan Tuesday said she would be
ready to take the blame for Indonesia's loss in the women's team
event at the just-concluded 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"If people think that I alone should be blamed for making a
crucial mistake, I'll have to accept it," she told reporters
before the handing over of bonuses by the State Minister of Youth
Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono here.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia vice chairman Agus
Wirahadikusumah put the blame on Imelda's shoulders as she had
changed the line up of the national women's doubles during the
semifinal match against South Korea. Indonesia finally lost 1-4.)
</P>
<P>
Imelda partnered Elysa Nathanel and Minarti Timur, a mixed
doubles specialist, as the first pairing while Deyana Lomban
teamed up with old partner Indarti Issoliana as the second
doubles pairing. Carmelita, who usually partners Indarti, had to
sit on the bench.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy of changing partners had been discussed before
we left for Bangkok. You can ask my athletes," Imelda was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was not made out of the blue there. After
learning of our draw, we felt relieved that we were to meet South
Korea. I had predicted that one of the new doubles pairings would
win one point for the team. If they lost, that was out of my
control," she added.
</P>
<P>
Elysa, who accompanied Imelda, said that nobody criticized
the policy of changing partnerships when competing in the Uber
Cup championships in Hong Kong in May.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't protest because we won that time. Who could
guarantee that we would win even if we had not split the
pairings?" she said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda said that Agus should have told her first about his
plan to discharge her, instead of telling the press.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that in a team event the first match
determined the composition of the team.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry

in the first 10 months of the year, according to the Chinese

Textile exports normally account for close to one fourth of

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines "has good
prospects in completely getting out of the Asian crisis" through
political will and determination of its people in 1999, said
President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message released here Wednesday, Estrada said
that the past year has been one of the most trying times for the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The currency crisis that hit the Asian region has slowed down
the region's economic progress. While the adverse effects may be
worse in other countries, yet we cannot be more confident than
them with the decline in available jobs and the increase in the
prices of basic commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Estrada said, Filipinos have remained
undaunted.
</P>
<P>
"We shall welcome the new year with high hopes and
determination. As we continue to move forward in 1999, expect us
to undertake more initiatives to attract greater investments from
our overseas friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our strong points lie in our strategic location in Asia, our
large domestic market dominated by a young population base and our
abundant supply of high-trainable, highly-skilled and
English-speaking human resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Estrada said, the Philippines can boast of an
improved peace and order situation in the new year.

The U.S. publication Business Week recently predicted that the
SCER's gross domestic product (GDP) will approximate the level of
France by the first half of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR, an international financial, information and
transportation center, is in pursuit of "one country, two systems"
principle. Macao, which will become China's second special
administrative region in 1999, is a free trade port which enjoys
independent tariff status and extensive export quotas for the
European market. Guangdong has formed a strong contingent of
scientific, technological and research professionals, and enjoys
substantial influence in China's vast inland market,
</P>
<P>
Lin Jiang, director of the Hong Kong, Macao Research Center at
Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province, said the combined
advantages of Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong will make the SCER an
importan force which will promote the integration of the Chinese
and international economies by early next century.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong have cooperated closely since
1978 when China introduced its reform and opening drive. The
cooperative effort includes the fact the a large number of
labor-intensive industrial enterprises have moved from Hong Kong
and Macao to Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation over the past two decades has transformed Hong
Kong and Macao into "front shops" and Guangdong into "backyard
workshop", according to one researcher at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao manufacturing industries with low
production costs have enjoyed new opportunities for expansion,
while Guangdong has gained access to funding, technology and
management expertise. Participation in the division of labor has
promoted development in Guangdong and the province has witnessed
rapid economic expansion. The research fellow, a specialist on the
international economy, noted that Guangdong's gross economic
volume accounts for 10 percent of the national total. He added
that Guangdong is one China's most economically developed
areas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Asiad Medalists Receive Cash Bonuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
has divided a 358 million rupiah (47,700 U.S. dollars) cash bonus
among the country's medalists from the 13th Asian Games in
Bangkok, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono and
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty
Eradication Haryono Suyono presented the bonus for six gold
medalists, 10 silver medalists, 11 bronze medalists and coaches
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gold medalists were the Indonesian men's badminton team and
men's doubles pairing of Ricky Ahmad Subagja and Rexy Mainaky,
Yayuk Basuki (women's tennis singles), Oka Sulaksana (men's
windsurfing), Supriati Sutono (women's 5,000 meters track) and
Arief Taufan Syamsudin (men's karate).
</P>
<P>
Individual gold medalists received 15 million rupiah each.
Ricky and Rexy were awarded 11.5 million rupiah each and members
of the men's badminton team received 5 million rupiah each.
</P>
<P>
Each silver medalist took home 8 million rupiah and each
bronze medalist 5 million rupiah. Twenty-nine coaches were
awarded 2 million rupiah each.
</P>
<P>
Agung expressed satisfaction with the athletes' achievements
in the Asiad, held from December 6 to 20.
</P>
<P>
"Their performance was much better than four years ago when
we only won three golds from badminton. Now we have won six golds
from five sports. However, our ranking among the participating
countries and regions is still out of the top 10," he said after
presenting the bonus.
</P>
<P>
"I think our athletes still need to perform optimally. In the
future we expect them to win a competition by setting a new
record, either Asian or world record", he added.
</P>
<P>
Some of the athletes expressed appreciation for the bonuses.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very thankful to the government who tried hard to
provide bonuses during the economic crisis," said women's tennis

"This is great. I'll save the bonus to pay for my study,"
said Sinta Berliana Heru, who won a silver in taekwondo.
</P>
<P>
Supriati said her money would go to her parents. "I have
almost everything, a house, a family. The money will be used to
help my parents," she said.
</P>
<P>
Supriati, probably Indonesia's most surprising gold medalist,
said she wanted to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I still have no plans about competing in which events next
year, but I hope I can qualify for the Olympics. I plan to retire
after that to have children," said Supriati, an Army sergeant.

<HEADLINE> Trio of Agents Say NBA Should Take Deal or Cancel Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Claiming the union's
current proposal is the best ownership deal in pro sports, three
agnets today implored NBA commissioner David Stern to put it to a
vote -- or cancel the season now.
</P>
<P>
Agents Keith Glass, Steve Kauffman and Jerome Stanley -- all
on the NBA Players Association's agents' advisory committee --
also questioned whether Stern and the 29 NBA owners actually want
any of the 1998-99 season to be played.
</P>
<P>
"There's something going on here," said Glass, who represents
10 players. "It does appear to me when you look at what's been
given by the two sides that they may not want to have a season.
It is their lockout."
</P>
<P>
"I think this lockout has been pre-planned," said Stanley,
who represents five players. "They decided that what they would
do is push the issue to this point. It is well-scripted."
</P>
<P>
Kauffman represents 18 players, including Indiana Pacers
forward Dale Davis. He believes there are more than tactics
involved in the league's hard-line stance.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to get Commissioner Stern to come out of his
palace and come off his condescending attitude," he said. "Things
have gotten a little personal between Stern and the uinon."
</P>
<P>
The lockout is in its 182nd day and the season is on the
verge of being canceled. Stanley said:"If the final offer has
been rejected, then I don't understand why we have to wait for
the 7th. If it is over, then it's over today. If it's not, then
everyone needs to strap up and stop the gamesmanship."

<HEADLINE> Economic Group Boost Foreign Investments in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A rapid increase in foreign
investment has boosted Costa Rica's economic growth, the
Chile-based Latin America Economic Commission (Cepal) said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Costa Rica is now ranked the second fast
est economic growth country in the region, with a 5.5 percent
growth rate, following the Dominican Republic, which registered a
seven percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Cepal attributed the economic growth to a 16.3 percent
increase in foreign investment in 1998 over last year.
</P>
<P>
A Costa Rican state development agency said that 18 new
foreign companies had founded branches in the country this year.
As a result, exports grew by 13 percent this year, Cepal said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism also contributed to the growth with nearly 900 million
dollars channeled to the current account, much more than banana
or coffee exports.
</P>
<P>
Microchip exports for the U.S. company Intel, which started
this year in Costa Rica, also helped boost the trend.
</P>
<P>
Increasing foreign investment enabled the country to raise 80
million dollars to meet losses caused by higher interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy to Grow 2.5 Percent Next Year: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy is
expected to grow 2.5 percent next year despite the ongoing
economic and financial problems in other regions of the globe, a
Canadian bank predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's projected rate of growth is about half a percentage
point higher than that predicted by most other forecasters.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for Canada is relatively positive for 1999, but
the risks are on the downside," Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC) said in its latest economic report.
</P>
<P>
The strong U.S. economy has contributed significantly to the
performance of the Canadian economy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"However, a softer U.S. economy next year will result in
reduced exports and a slowdown in Canada's economic growth," said
Canada's second largest commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The structural problems in the economy, including a lack of
investment in research and development, internal trade barriers
and the need for improvement in education and training, have been
compounded by high government debt and taxes. "This has had a
corrosive effect on Canada's economic performance," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Canada needs to focus on measures to improve productivity
growth and global competitiveness ... Tax reductions and tax
reforms are necessary if Canadians are to see a more productive
economy with a strong dollar and a rising standard of living," it
added.

WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Francois Botha of South
Africa says he will turn into another Evander Holyfield when he
fights Mike Tyson on January 16.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to fight him the way Holyfield fought him," Botha
said. "If you look at Tyson's fights when he gets hurt, it is
when you are the first to punch. You can't stand in front of him
and do nothing and close up and let him pick his shots like a lot
of guys like (Bruce) Seldon and (Frank) Bruno did."
</P>
<P>
Botha will fight Tyson on January 16 at the MGM Grand Hotel

</P>
<P>
"You've got to push him around, wrestle him and hold him like
Holyfield did. That is the way to get him in the later rounds,"
said Botha, who has a 39-1 record with 24 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the public still see him as the baddest man out
there and people who don't know me will think they will never see
Francois Botha alive again. Just imagine after I beat Mike Tyson
what they will say then. My victory will be that much sweeter
because no one gave me a chance. After this fight I will get the

ROME, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading Italian farming
association on Tuesday expressed fears that the nation's switch
to Europe's single currency euro would reduce the real value of
the agriculture assistance distributed to Italy by the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The association, known as Coldiretti, estimated that the
Italian farmer would suffer an average cut of 35,860 lire (21.67
U.S. dollars) in the real value of EU aid next year because of
money conversion.
</P>
<P>
After January 1, 1999, institutional pricing and EU aid for
farmers will no longer be calculated in ECU -- the European
Currency Unit, but in euro, aiming in a long term to make the
European farm price support fairer and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
An ECU is equivalent to 2,030 lire while a euro between 1,930
and 1,950 lire.
</P>
<P>
The association said the most vulnerable sectors would be
grains, olive oil, fruits and vegetables, beef cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
European officials, acknowledging that the switch to euro will
result in aid cuts for some farmers, from 0.6 percent to 15
percent, have announced the establishment of an indirect
mechanism for compensating those hardest hit, which includes an
optional national co-financing equal to 50 percent of the lost
value from euro conversion.

<HEADLINE> Nine District Heads, One Mayor Fired by Indonesian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Home Affairs
Minister Syarwan Hamid Tuesday said nine district heads and a
mayor were recently discharged from their positions for
involvement in corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
The measure was a follow-up to a decree of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) number 11/1998, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Article 4 of the decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The minister said five of the district heads and the mayor of
Tegal in Central Java were servicemen, while the rest were civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
He also said public prosecutor's offices were handling corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices which involved another nine
district heads and mayor of Ujungpandang in South Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Jambi in Sumatera island was interrogated by the Jambi
police and public prosecutor's office, alleging bought votes in
the election of a village head, Hamid was quoted by Antara News
Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southeast Maluku district head was strongly believed
to have embezzled 4 billion rupiah (one U.S. dollars equals 8,000
rupiah), and involved in collusive practices and fake projects
which had caused a loss of 25 billion rupiah and 2.2 billion
rupiah respectively to the state.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Aceh Barat, Asahan and Batang Hari
district heads in Sumatera island had also been found involved in
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to Coordinating Minister for Development
Supervision/State Reform Hartarto, the Indonesian state suffered
financial losses totaling 2,850 billion rupiah by corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices involving Soeharto,
high-ranking officials of his government and his cronies.

LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea missed several chances
in the match against Manchester United and failed to return to
the top of the English Premier League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea finally only played to a 0-0 draw with the Manchester
United, who went third in the team standings.

Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo was the main culprit as four
good opportunities went wide in a first half dominated by the
second-placed London club.

<P>
Manchester United looked more adventurous in the second half
but Andy Cole failed to make much headway against Chelsea's
French central defender Frank Leboeuf.

<P>
United goalkeeper Peter Schemichel kept Manchester United's
hopes alive with a flailing save from Italian Gianfranco Zola 10
minutes from time to keep Chelsea behind leaders Aston Villa.

In the evening's other match, Wimbledon fought back twice to

BUCHAREST, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank confirmed it
had granted a 5-million-U.S.-dollar loan for cultural programs in
Romania, Romania's Minister of Culture Ion Caramitru said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only cultural project in the world the World Bank

Potlogi, residential palaces which belonged to the Romanian ruler
Constantin Brancoveanu (?-1714).

<HEADLINE> Beijing Youth Respect Scientists Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the young
people in Beijing think scientists have made greater contributions
to society than entrepreneurs, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Beijing Shaohai Market Research
Company, revealed that scientists are the professionals most
respected by Beijing youth, followed by soldiers and middle and
primary school teachers. Journalists, workers and movie stars have
the lowest esteem among this group.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among Beijing residents aged between 14
and 35, found that 53.2 percent of the respondents believe
scientists make greater contributions to society than
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
This shows that they have a good understanding of Deng
Xiaoping's statement that "science and technology is the first
productive force," said the market researchers.
</P>
<P>
The survey was designed to study scientific awareness among
Beijing's younger population. Twenty-nine percent of the
respondents are college graduates, 43 percent have high school
educations, and 28 percent are below the junior high school level.
</P>
<P>
It shows that 89 percent of the respondents think their
scientific knowledge is insufficient, while 40 percent desire more
computer-related knowledge, and 59 percent said they don't have
enough time to acquire all the knowledge they would like.

<HEADLINE> Ward Joins Blackburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Blackburn Rovers have
completed a signing of 4.25 million pounds striker Ashley Ward
from First Division Barnsley.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old has agreed personal terms and the fee could
increase to 4.5m depending on appearances.
</P>
<P>
Ward, who joined Barnsley from Derby for 1.3m following
earlier spells with Leicester and Norwich, has scored 15 goals
this season.
</P>
<P>
He will increase competition for places in attack at Ewood
Park, with Chris Sutton, Nathan Blake, Kevin Davies and Kevin
Gallacher already on Blackburn's books.
</P>
<P>
Ward could make his debut in this weekend's FA Cup third round
tie against Charlton with Sutton out of action for six weeks
after damaging a knee.
</P>
<P>
He had also been linked with Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield
Wednesday and made no secret of his desire to return to the
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Barnsley rejected an earlier 4m bid from Rovers, but an
improved offer persuaded them to cash in their top asset.
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to have hung on to him a bit longer but it
just wasn't possible," said manager John Hendrie.
</P>
<P>
Ward recently completed a four-match ban but was left out of
Barnsley's team for the home game with Queen's Park Rangers on
Monday to allow him to focus on the transfer negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He is Blackburn manager Brian Kidd's second major signing
following the arrival of winger Keith Gillespie from Newcastle.

<HEADLINE> Referee Reprieves Villa Keeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa have won the
backing of referee Dermot Gallagher in their bid to have the red
card shown to goalkeeper Michael Oakes during the Boxing Day game
at Blackburn set aside.
</P>
<P>
Oakes was dismissed by the Banbury official for holding the
ball outside the penalty area following consultation with
referee's assistant, Dave Horlick.
</P>
<P>
He is facing suspension for the game against Middlesbrough on
January 9 as a result.
</P>
<P>
But TV replays appeared to show that he may have let the ball
go before his momentum carried him over the line and Gallagher
has now acknowledged a "genuine error of judgment".
</P>
<P>
Premier League referees' officer Philip Don said Gallagher
would now be writing to the Football Association to tell them
that an error was made.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the FA to reverse this decision once they
receive Dermot's letter and his report," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oakes is the only fit senior keeper on Villa's books and
manager John Gregory has called for video replays to be introduced
 to help referees with marginal decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to be on our side and if we don't get the
decision reversed it will be a real slap in the face for common
sense.
</P>
<P>
"But, knowing Dermot Gallagher as I do - he's a man's man -
and men stand up and hold their hand up when they've made a
mistake. They don't hide behind bureaucracy," said Gregory.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bosnich is currently sidelined by a shoulder injury but
Gregory will not be rushed into signing a replacement.
</P>
<P>
"If I have to play our youngster, Adam Rachel, I will have no
qualms whatsoever," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security Council's Authority, A Must in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday issued a presidential statement, once again
underlining the unshirkable and irreplaceable authority of the
United Nations in maintaining world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement, issued after the U.S.-led
unilateral military strikes on Iraq, was hammered out on the basis
of an open debate on "the maintenance of peace and security and
post-conflict peace-building."
</P>
<P>
Altogether, representatives from 22 countries, including China
and other 14 Security Council members, took the floor during the
debate, which was interrupted by the December 16 military action
against Iraq before its December 23 resumption.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this, Ahmad Kamal, Pakistani permanent
representative to the United Nations, said, "It is ironic for us
to be addressing the role of the Security Council in the
maintenance of international peace and security at a time when the
ability of this Council to play it has been dealt a devastating
blow as a result of unilateral action undertaken without due
debate and authorization from the Council."
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "The world is undergoing profound changes at the
turn of the century. The desire for peace, stability and
development has become the shared understanding and common pursuit
of all Member States of this Organization."
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining international peace and security is the lofty
responsibility entrusted to the Council by the Charter of the
United Nations," Qin said. "The Council's primary responsibility
for maintaining international peace and security is both
unshirkable and irreplaceable."
</P>
<P>
"China is strongly opposed to any act of power politics that
unilaterally resorts to the use or threaten to the use of force in
international relations while circumventing the Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin's remarks were echoed by his Russian counterpart, Sergey
Lavrov, who said, "The United Nations Charter, which assigns to
the Security Council primary responsibility for and a central role
in this very important area, remains the immutable and universal
legal basis for the maintenance of international peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
Lavrov voiced his concern about attempts to make it possible
for individual States or coalitions to use force or take
enforcement measures without the approval of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, the clearest such attempt can be seen in the
drawing up of a new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO was reported to be considering an idea to transform the
Alliance into a leading international peacekeeping organization
whose actions, which would extend beyond the bounds of the
geographic zone for which the military bloc has responsibility,
would be taken solely on the basis of its own assessments and
decisions, thereby sidestepping the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are talking about attempts to replace the
Charter-based functions and the prerogatives of the Security
Council with unilateral actions taken by regional mechanisms,
directly contravening the United Nations Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roselyn Odera, representative from the Kenyan
Mission to the United Nations, said that "primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security rests with
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Kamalesh Sharma, Indian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the attack on Iraq "has thrown up fundamental
problems and questions which must be addressed. We are faced with
a conflict resulting from unilateral action by some members of the
Council."
</P>
<P>
While greeting the impending arrival of the last year of this
century, the world found that none of the armed conflicts in
Afghanistan, Africa and the Balkans and the Iraqi crisis have been
solved, and the United Nations, including the 15-member Security
Council, are facing grave challenges of peace and security, global
economic and financial crisis in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely accepted that only by strict adherence to
the United Nations Charter and the upholding of the authority of
the Security Council, can the world, with the concerted assistance
of the international community, unsher into the next century a
developing, prosperous and stabilizing world.

<HEADLINE> Bates Ready for FA Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Chelsea football
club Ken Bates is ready to offer himself as a force for change
within the Football Association.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old said he has been unofficially approached to
see if he would be willing to stand for election as FA chairman,
if Keith Wiseman gives up or is forced out of the post.
</P>
<P>
Wiseman is expected to face a vote of no confidence when the
FA Council meets next Monday.
</P>
<P>
He has been under severe pressure following the resignation of
chief executive Graham Kelly in the wake of controversy over a 3m
grant to the Football Association of Wales.
</P>
<P>
"I was approached to see if I would stand. I said I'd consider
being chairman for 18 to 24 months to push through the changes
the FA require," said Bates.
</P>
<P>
"The council is top-heavy and getting older. The entire pro
game- the Premier League and Football League - is outnumbered by
those from the Armed Forces, universities, schools and foreign
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"What we need with the new chairman is someone who has a
strong chief executive who is responsible to him."
</P>
<P>
Bates has transformed Chelsea since his time in charge at
Stamford Bridge, establishing the Chelsea Village complex which
also includes a hotel and restaraunts.

NEW YORK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street share prices
soared Tuesday with the blue-chip indicator approaching its
November 23 peak.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 94.23 or 1 percent to
9,320.98, supported by a strong consumer confidence report.
</P>
<P>
The index extended a seven session winning streak with a total
gain of 530 points since December 17. It is now 17.9 percent up
for the year and only 53 points below the record high of 9,374.27.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said Tuesday that despite a slight drop in
consumer confidence in December, Americans are still positive
about the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Retail shares gained as positive forecasts for growth in 1999
boosted the sector. But shares of the larger Internet companies,
which have posted enormous gains recently, fell amid
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of market
activity, was trading in record territory, up 16.32 to 1,241.81,
leaving it 28 percent above the year's starting point.

<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.47 to a new
record high of 2,181.77, a 38.9 percent growth for the year.

LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom Tuesday
warmly welcomed a decision by Cyprus not to set up new batteries
of missiles on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant contribution to international efforts to

The decision would create conditions for a lasting political

Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides announced Tuesday that he was
canceling plans to deploy the Russian-made S-300 missiles on the
Mediterranean island.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded its
northern part in response to a coup in Nicisia. Turkey had
threatened to block the deployment of the missiles.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Released From Hospital After Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan was
allowed to leave a Minnesota clinic Tuesday as "good health" has
returned after several months of treatment for cancer, a clinic
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"He was in good health," said Jane Jacobs, the spokesman for
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "He was in good spirits,
obviously relieved to be out of the hospital."
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old king was traveling to Washington, D.C., where
he may meet with President Bill Clinton as well as Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, a Jordanian Embassy spokesman said in
Washington. But no times have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
The king checked into the Mayo Clinic in mid-July, and was
diagnosed with lymphoma and had six cycles of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The king intermittently left the hospital between chemotherapy
treatments.
</P>
<P>
He left the clinic for several days in October to help engineer
the Wye Plantation agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
over the Israeli pullout of 13 percent of the West Bank.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
sending a doctor to assist an American and two other Westerners
injured when Yemeni security forces attacked kidnappers holding 16
tourists, U.S. State Department officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the American embassy in the capital San'a had
received preliminary reports on the incident from senior Yemeni
officials and were seeking further independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 tourists kidnapped, three Britons and an
Australian were killed.
</P>
<P>
"No Americans have been reported among the dead.... The embassy
is sending a consular officer and a regional medical officer (a
doctor) from San'a to Aden (where the freed hostages were being
taken) as soon as they can get there," one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 tourists -- 12 Britons, two Americans and two
Australians -- were kidnaped Monday while traveling by car on the
road between Habbas and Aden.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government has informed Washington that "it
undertook a rescue action" Tuesday and that at least three of the
hostages were killed during this action.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Cyprus' Decision on Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
welcomed Cyprus' decision not to bring Russian missiles to the
country and said the decision would ease tensions on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome and support President (Glafcos) Clerides's decision
not to bring the S-300 missiles to Cyprus. We commend the
government of Cyprus for taking this important step to ease
tensions on the island," State Department spokesman Lee McClenny
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus announced earlier in the day that it would not take
possession of the Russian missiles and store them on the divided
island which Turkey has threatened to destroy and would negotiate
with Moscow for their deployment on Crete instead.
</P>
<P>
"This action will give important new impetus to Secretary
General (Kofi) Annan's September 30 initiative to reduce tensions
and promote a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus dispute,"
McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
Washington "wholeheartedly supports the secretary general's
initiative and will take all necessary steps to support a
sustained effort to implement it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged all sides in the Cyprus dispute to work to
reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. official said the missile decision means the
weapons "aren't going to Cyprus so now we can focus on the real
issues rather than on the side issues."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the Russian missiles in early 1997. Turkey,
which has occupied the northern third of the island since invading
it in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup, immediately
threatened military action to prevent the missiles from arriving.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday released a presidential statement, reaffirming the
Security Council's authority in maintaining international peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement, issued on the basis of an open
debate on "the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict
peace-building," said, "The Security Council reaffirms its primary
responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the
maintenance of international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed "the need to prevent the resurgence or
escalation of conflict."
</P>
<P>
"The Council recognizes the importance of the post-conflict
peace-building efforts of the United Nations to this end in all
regions of the world and with due involvement of all United
Nations bodies," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, it welcomes the role played by the
Secretary-General in this field," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council underlines that economic rehabilitation
and reconstruction often constitute the major tasks facing
societies emerging from conflict and that significant
international assistance becomes indispensable to promote
sustainable development in such cases," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recognizes the need for close cooperation
and dialogue between the bodies of the United Nations system, in
particular those directly concerned in the post-conflict
peace-building, in accordance with their respective
responsibilities and expresses its willingness to consider ways to
improve such cooperation," it added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Cooperation Over Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday urgently called on the Angolan Government and the
rebel UNITA to "cooperate immediately and fully" with U.N.
peacekeepers in search and rescue of 14 people aboard a
U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed near the war zone in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council for the month of December, Jassim Buallay of
Bahrain, said, "Council members urgently call on the Government of
Angola and UNITA to cooperate immediately and fully with the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) in the search
and rescue mission."
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced the Security Council's "deepest concern
about the fate of the crew and passengers" aboard the missing
plane, saying that "any further delay jeopardizes the lives of
possible survivors."
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed the concern that "there has been no
effective action undertaken in order to find out what happened to
three previous planes that disappeared over territory controlled
by UNITA," namely the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Council members renewed their appeal to the Government of
Angola and UNITA to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement
of MONUA personnel, and encourage the (U.N.) Secretary-General to
take additional steps to ensure adequate security and protection
for its personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, a MONUA statement, issued in the Angolan capital
of Luanda, said, "There could be survivors" aboard the plane,
which went missing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in
Angola, Issa Diallo, "appeals in the strongest terms" to the
Angolan Government and UNITA to stop fighting around the crash
site, so that U.N. peacekeepers can visit the site of the accident
and try to save lives of the 14 persons, including four crew
members.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Spokesman's Office Tuesday disclosed a list of
nationalities of the missing passengers and crew members.
Passengers included three Angolans, an Australian, two Russians, a
Cameroonian, an Egyptian, a Namibian and a Zambian. The crew was
made up of an Angolan, a Bolivian, a Filipino and a South African.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 aircraft crashed 10 minutes after takeoff near the
central highland city Huambo, about 480 kilometers southeast of
Luanda.
