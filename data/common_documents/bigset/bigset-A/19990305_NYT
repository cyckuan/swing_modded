FAA INSPECTORS SAY BOSSES PROTECT ALASKA AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The job of federal inspectors who monitor the nation's
airlines is to protect the flying public.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, it doesn't
pay for inspectors to do their job too well. That message is vivid
in hundreds of pages of Federal Aviation Administration documents,
in transcripts of legal proceedings and in interviews by the
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that has echoed through the decade _ inspectors
who have held the job since 1991 tell similar stories of enforcing
federal regulations at Alaska, only to get heat rather than praise
from their bosses. Some of those safety watchdogs have been
disciplined and moved to other jobs after airline managers or
pilots campaigned against them.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, meanwhile, has avoided some major fines despite
what inspectors call a pattern of bending and breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, inspectors found the airline failed to properly
check the flying skills of 35 pilots and asked their bosses to levy
a fine of more than $400,000. Alaska acknowledged the error and
received an apologetic letter from an FAA manager.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Alaska balked at an FAA order to increase
training for pilots flying into a difficult airport. The FAA backed
down, even though it still requires at least one other airline to
comply with that order.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's practices are also the subject of a criminal
investigation. A federal grand jury in Oakland, Calif., is looking
into allegations that Alaska mechanics signed off on maintenance
that was not done. The FAA may revoke the licenses of two Alaska
maintenance supervisors
</P>
<P>
   All airlines have systems for ensuring safety, but they also
have strict government oversight. An army of FAA inspectors monitor
every aspect of their operations _ from the way pilots are trained
to fly to the way galley coffeepots are serviced.
</P>
<P>
   Each airline has teams of FAA inspectors to monitor operations,
maintenance and security. Each team is lead by a principal
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are the public's primary line of defense. They
can propose fines and sanctions, and even prompt criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors are guided by lengthy regulations, said Mary Rose
Diefenderfer, a former FAA principal operations inspector at
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about enforcing rules and regulations that
I or my team made up,'' Diefenderfer said. ``These are laboriously
written, usually after months or years of research and
investigation by hundreds of the world's top safety experts ...''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the FAA and air carriers is far more
complex than simply enforcing rules. By federal law, the FAA must
simultaneously protect the flying public and promote the interests
of civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Alaska Airlines, that means FAA managers in
Seattle want to police the hometown airline but also maintain a
cordial relationship.
</P>
<P>
   And FAA inspectors say that when the dual roles of safety
enforcer and air travel booster clash, their bosses tend to put
cordiality ahead of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pearson, manager of the FAA's Northwest flight standards
division, said he's ``bewildered and amazed'' by suggestions that
Alaska gets special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any instance where we have overlooked
something we should have investigated or not taken action where it
was appropriate,'' Pearson said. ``I consider Alaska Airlines to be
a good air carrier, and they get a lot of surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Swanigan, Alaska's vice president of flight operations,
said he considers relations with the FAA good. But he said Alaska
has no special influence with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inspectors cite a series of incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, FAA inspectors discovered some Alaska pilots _
including the vice president for flight operations _ failed to
attend required training sessions, but signed rosters saying they
had. Ultimately, the FAA stripped five pilots of their captain's
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA didn't just penalize Alaska. Diefenderfer says the
agency also punished her. She was transferred to another position,
although she fought the move and later won back her old job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go along and get along would make the professional lives of
all inspectors easier, but if there is even a remote chance that
something we find can lead to an accident or death, safety has got
to come first and the hell with politics,'' Diefenderfer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Diefenderfer again angered Alaska. Her inspectors
believed the airline failed to give flight tests _ tantamount to a
driver's road test _ to several newly hired pilots.
</P>
<P>
   After Alaska complained, the FAA again transferred Diefenderfer
to a new job. Two team members also transferred out.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Diefenderfer in Septmber 1997, Pearson wrote that
he and fellow FAA supervisor Marlene Livack found it unacceptable
that the relationship between Alaska and the safety inspectors had
become strained.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote, ``I want you to clearly understand that Marlene
and I are adamant that an effective working relationship does not
mean we lessen our expectations for safety, the carrier's
responsibility for compliance or our inspectors' obligation to
enforce regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors say the message was clear: Being nice is more
important than being tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that FAA management is more interested in
keeping Alaska Airlines happy than they are in keeping Alaska
Airlnes compliant,'' Steven Franklin, a member of Diefenderfer's
team, testified last fall at a grievance hearing over her transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said that in 1997 he put up a poster at his desk
quoting a former FAA administrator who said ``the passenger is the
customer, not the company.''
</P>
<P>
   He replaced it when someone took it down, and Livack, the FAA
manager, removed that copy. In his testimony, Franklin singled out
Livack and Phil Hoy, who supervised both Diefenderfer and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hoy and Ms. Livack believe the company (Alaska Airlines)
is the ultimate customer, and that everything we do is to make sure
the customer is satisfied in order to make sure the customer is
happy,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspector, Lester Martin, testified Hoy ``was too much
pro-Alaska and not hardly any pro-FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the FAA has hammered Alaska Airlines in some cases.
Just last year, the airline agreed to pay a $338,000 fine to settle
a dispute over hydraulic systems on Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It we're talking such a kid gloves approach to the carrier,
what would be the reason that we would have had such large
penalties on maintenance cases,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hubbard, the FAA's principal inspector overseeing Alaska's
maintenance, acknowledged that others in the Seattle office have
been pressured by management, but said he has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt that,' he said in an interview. ``I'm immune
to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alaska's maintenance practices and record-keeping are
apparently the focus of the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But inspectors who who have had trouble with the airline worked
in operations. Much of their work focused on pilots _ particularly
how they are trained and how they fly.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Alaska Airlines places unusual demands on pilots,
some of whom fly large jets into tiny fields at remote villages,
contending with the worst weather and treacherous mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Seattle-based airline retains an Alaskan in a
parka on the tail of its jets is a powerful reminder of the
airline's roots and its continued self-image. Inspectors say they
hear a constant refrain when dealing with the airline: Things are
different on the Last Frontier. Rules sometimes must bend to fit
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan said Alaska faces unusual conditions _ gravel runways
in some places and non-precision approaches to remote airfields _
practices other major carriers rarely face.
</P>
<P>
   But he said safety is paramount, and noted the Department of
Defense, which does $28 million worth of business with Alaska
annually, gave the carrier a perfect score after a week-long safety
inspector last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay awake nights thinking about safety,'' Swanigan said.
``For us to bust an airplane is my worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lloyd, the FAA's principal operations inspector at Alaska in
the early 1990s, said the airline reacted differently to FAA
inspectors than did Pan American or People's Express, which he had
previously regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska, if it wasn't the way they did it, they didn't want to
hear about it,'' he said. ``It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   And Seattle-based FAA managers approached their work with more
of a sense of comaraderie with the airline than did those in New
York and Miami. They ``wanted to make sure Alaska was happy,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After his boss told him to stop sending so many enforcement
letters to Alaska, Lloyd transferred out the Seattle office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson declined to charactorize his office's relationship with
Alaska, other than to say that ``we make a practice of
investigating any incidents, and reports of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA managers can and do point to airline-irritating gaffs by
undiplomatic inspectors when asked to justify transfers and
punishment. But in at least one case, they never gave the inspector
an opportunity to anger the airline.

INSPECTORS UNDER PRESSURE

<P>
   SEATTLE: ``anger the airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Martin succeeded Diefenderfer as Alaska's principal
operations inspector _ and lasted just one day. His only
significant act that day in the summer of 1997 was to write letters
to 10 Alaska captains, asking if they had received the flight
checks Diefenderfer thought were lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hoy stopped the letters from going out and made another
staffer the acting chief, Martin testified at the arbitration
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the ranks, Martin lasted just a few more weeks as part
of the Alaska inspection team. In October, 1997, Hoy approached him
during the investigation of an Alaska captain who failed to log an
aborted flight caused by a mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hoy ``said that I was too hard on Alaska,'' Martin testified.
``That he thought it was best that I _ how did he phrase it _ `My
future would be better with Pro Air.'''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is now principal operations inspector for Pro-Air, a
two-year-old Seattle-based carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said he's offended by suggestions that Martin was
shifted to Pro-Air as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was reassigned to Pro-Air because ... he has experience in
certificate management in (the airline) environment,'' Pearson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors don't question that Alaska is a safe operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing Alaska has going for it are its pilots _ they
are excellent,'' Diefenderfer said. ``That ... is probably the
reason Alaska has such a good (safety) record.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither do they question that Alaska resists FAA oversight
and flexes its muscles to get its way.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's what happened in the first half of 1997, when
FAA inspectors questioned whether Alaska had failed to do
proficiency checks for about 35 pilots. Inspectors also found that
instructor pilots rarely recorded test results, though computer
records showed all had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan said Alaska may have technically broken the rule, but
complied with its spirit. He said paper forms didn't use the common
name for the test, ``line check,'' but that the test was being
done.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors considered asking that Alaska be fined more than
$400,000, Martin testified.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska moved first, pulling the pilots out of service for
testing.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, Hoy wrote Swanigan that he was in the ``unenviable
position'' of having credible evidence of a violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this (the preemptive move) was a prudent decision
inasmuch as a substantial civil penalty ... typically results only
when operations continue uncorrected after the issue has surfaced,
as in this case,'' Hoy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed regret for ``the disruption and inconvenince this
episode has caused Alaska Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's managers and lawyers decided there wasn't enough
evidence to justify a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was clearly a difference between Phil Hoy, the
supervisor, and the reporting inspector,'' said Pearson, the FAA
administrator. `` ... Hoy didn't have the same certainty that it
was a violation (or) that it was so aggravated that it should cost
that size of a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoy said he wasn't the only author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coordinated very closely with Ms. Diefenderfer and others in
the certificate management section,'' Hoy said. ``Mary Rose thought
it was a very good letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to gain additional evidence were squelched.
</P>
<P>
   When inspector Jewett Gibson proposed sitting in on Alaska
training sessions, Hoy said there would be no ``clandestine''
investigations and called Alaska management about the plan, Gibson
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say that they are doing something wrong if you don't
have proof,'' he told the arbitrator. ``The only way to get the
proof is sit in and see the training. I was never allowed to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with their supervisors, the inspectors went to the
Transportation Department's inspector general, which is something
like a police internal affairs unit. The inspectors complained
about Alaska and about FAA managers. A spokesman for that office
said the investigation is ongoing but declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan, the Alaska vice president, said investigators have
told the airline it has been cleared of wrongdoing. He said his
major complaint about the incident was that the FAA hadn't alerted
the airline earlier. He said he told FAA officials: ``If you see us
do something that isn't right, you have to tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said the issue was ``thoroughly investigated, and it was
determined that there was no violation that could be substantiated.
Hundreds of hours went into that case ... and it ultimately was
assessed by our chief counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was no tougher when it came to requiring special
training for Alaska pilots landing in Reno, Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is in high desert, with mountains to the south and west.
Windsheer and turbulence are common. Pilots there are required to
have special training.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air has recurrent training for its pilots, said Greg
Helleckson, that airline's director of flight operation, to help
ensure pilots know what to do if they have a problem while landing
and must go around and try again.
</P>
<P>
   When Diefenderfer ordered Alaska to do the same in 1997, the
airline objected, saying its training and flight experience in
Juneau would suffice and that adding classes about Reno would cut
into training on more difficult airports.
</P>
<P>
   What raised eyebrows in Seattle and Washington, D.C., was that
FAA managers here allowed Alaska to hold off on the training it
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Dullaghan, a safety inspector then assigned to special
projects at the FAA's Washington headquarters, had been involved in
a Congressional study of the Juneau airport. At Diefenderfer's
arbitration hearing he testified that Hoy had ordered her not to
press the issue ``and just accept the fact that Alaska Airlines had
notified us in Washington that they wanted to appeal the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, the procedure as outlined in the regulations was
not being complied with,'' he said. ``therefore, Alaska continued
to operate in violation of an acknowledged safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Alaska won: FAA officials in Washington decided not
to require special training, said Pearson, the regional
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter was not brushed over,'' Pearson said. ``The reason
that the training that was already given was considered sufficient
is because it is much more difficult in Juneau than in Reno. The
procedure at Reno was not particularly complicated. It is unique to
Reno, however.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June 1997, the FAA transferred Diefenderfer to a desk
job.
</P>
<P>
   Martin transferred out of Alaska inspections in October. So did
Jewett Gibson, who testified he asked for a transfer because
Swanigan, the Alaska vice president, ``basically told me that he
was going to have me fired using any means at his availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan says he never said that to Gibson, but yesterday he
confirmed that in 1996, he wrote to the FAA asking that Gibson be
transferred after the inspector argued with Alaska gate agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gibson faced a five-day suspension without pay after he
was accused of peddling health care products as he was doing
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots later told the FAA their statements were
exaggerated, and one said Swanigan ordered him to report Gibson.
Swanigan confirms he ordered the pilot to make a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the appearance a regulated party is exerting undo
influence into personnel matters of the FAA through actively
seeking derogatory information from their employees against FAA
inspectors assigned to the Alaska Airlines certificate,'' a
security investigator wrote. Gibson's suspension was reduced to a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Livack arrived in Seattle in the spring of 1997 to
take over as the FAA's office manager, she met with supervisor Hoy
and Swanigan.
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan said the relationship between the FAA and Alaska was
broken, Livack testified.
</P>
<P>
   Swanigan recalls the meeting. But he said he was not unhappy
with the inspectors. Rather, he wanted Diefenderfer to be promoted
to supervise all the inspectors, eliminating a glitch in the FAA
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Livack was so concerned about the relationship that she
brought in a professional social worker to ``facilitate'' staff
meetings aimed at improving communications.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said the meetings seem more about haranguing
Diefenderfer than improving interpersonal skills.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also threatened to pull out of a voluntary pilot training
program that is a favorite of top FAA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since that exchange in, the FAA has assigned a new principal
inspector and has replaced three of the four inspection team
members. Only Franklin remains in the group.
</P>
<P>
   The new principal inspector is Dennis Harn, who heads what
Alaska likes to call its ``dream team'' of inspectors, Swanigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors have a wide range of technical knowledge and more
resources and can respond faster to questions, Swanigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Franklin testified that Alaska and FAA management
seemed happy, and Livack and Hoy were pleased that Alaska's chief
executive, John Kelly, ``was happy with the way things were
going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that's a red flag,'' he said.

BIG SKY'S THE LIMIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An unpaid balance stood between Frozena Jerro and
a treasure chest full of tomorrows. Anthony Lenz never doubted if
he squared the debt on Jerro's Sacred Heart-Cathedral High ledger,
she would one day repay the act of kindness tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Lenz, the school's athletic director, discreetly saw to
it that Jerro's tuition was paid and she became part of the
school's first coed graduating class in 1988. Eleven years later,
using kindness as her currency, Jerro has showered a once-destitute
basketball program with riches.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jerro's nurturing, the Cal State Northridge women's team
won its first Big Sky crown this year. With a record of 19-7
overall (13-3 in conference), CSUN is two wins away from the
school's maiden trip to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It started out as a rocky voyage, with the squad swept off
course by the on-campus arrest of head coach Michael Abraham on
drug-trafficking charges. That Jerro _ whose only previous
head-coaching experience was at the junior high level _ managed to
salvage the season might seem, on the surface, surprising.
</P>
<P>
   But for those close to Jerro, the Matadors' success confirmed
what they've suspected for years: Fro-Jo is a born captain. All she
needed was a ship.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as high school, ``I was telling her that she should
stop and see me after she got out of college, that I could give her
a job coaching,'' Lenz said.
</P>
<P>
   He would move on to become the athletic director at L.A.'s
Cathedral High, but he never stopped wondering what became of the
big-hearted kid who stole hearts and opponents' passes. When he
found out from a journalist he and Jerro were practically
neighbors, he immediately planned a trip to the CSUN campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``An excellent person, an excellent basketball player, a model
citizen,'' is how Lenz remembers the 27-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, she's all that. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celia Jerro's voice rises and falls, waves of sentiment buffing
all the rough edges of her memories. It wasn't easy rearing a child
as a single parent, though you'd never know it by looking at the
smile her daughter wears like a birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty much like the perfect child,'' Jerro said by
telephone from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Frozena's childhood, spent mostly in California, was hardly the
bubble-gum stuff of Beach Boys' songs. Celia toiled long hours for
a long-distance telephone service near their Palo Alto apartment.
Frozena remembers being ``a serious latchkey kid. I was coming home
and staying by myself in second grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Before mother and daughter moved west from Chicago, Frozena was
introduced to the game of basketball by her great uncle, Reuben
Bolen, a onetime Harlem Globetrotter (another great uncle, David,
finished fourth in the 400 meters in the 1948 Olympics in London).
</P>
<P>
   Sports and school and family formed the triangle offense that
Celia Jerro hoped would enable her daughter to score big in the
game of life. Celia scrimped and sacrificed and when that wasn't
enough, accepted financial assistance from her uncles so Frozena
could attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   One semester in high school, when her family fell behind in her
tuition payments, Jerro took matters into her own hands. She sat
down with one of the sisters and said, ``This is a Christian
school. Well, we need some Christian help.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? ``I was able to come back,'' Jerro said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro paid the kindly school administrators and her family back
with a personality as soothing as a bubble bath. ``She always had a
positive attitude,'' said her grandmother, Frozena Myers. ``She was
always doing for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jerro, ``I guess that's just sort of my personality. I
don't like to be a burden to people. I like to make people smile
and be happy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN women's home gym is called the Matadome, but it looks
more like a matchbox. Although people mock it, Jerro has made do
with plenty worse. Her high school team often practiced on an
outdoor court, dribbling around cracks in the asphalt and gauging
the wind before launching any jumpers. Mother Nature redirected
more shots than any 7-footer could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of us would complain about having to practice
outdoors, but Fro never did,'' said Diannah Cox, who was a year
ahead of Jerro at Cathedral. ``She just loved the game. She was so
enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   During Jerro's senior year, the boys' school down the block
merged with its insular sister school (there were fewer than 100
students in Cox's graduating class) and formed Sacred
Heart-Cathedral. The move naturally caused some upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we merged schools,'' Lenz remembered, ``most of the girls
who played basketball stopped because boys were dominating the
courts. It didn't bother Frozena. She be out there playing one on
one, two on two, three on three with the boys and giving them a
good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro averaged more than 30 points a game as a senior. ``I think
she brought a lot of fans to our games,'' Cox said. ``Fro's just a
natural athlete. She was a great scorer, but the thing I remember
most about her game is her defense. It was awesome. She was so
aggressive. And so quick. One second you'd see her, the next second
she was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox came from San Francisco to watch CSUN's win against
Sacramento State last week. And she was mesmerized by the Matadors'
standout sophomore guard, Edniesha Curry. For Cox, watching Curry
was a personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like seeing Fro out there,'' Cox said. ``I told Fro
that Edniesha reminds me of her as a player and she just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro followed Cox to St. Mary's and helped the school to two
consecutive 20-win seasons. Both years, though, the program was
overlooked for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Jerro
couldn't stand sitting home in March so in 1990 she transferred to
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   She made it to college basketball's Holy Grail as a junior in
1992, when the Sun Devils met DePaul in a first-round game in
Jerro's hometown of Chicago. With members of her family in
attendance, ASU lost by two.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her senior season, Jerro went up for a layup and had
her legs cut out from under her. She landed on her elbow and broke
it _ and that was pretty much it for her season and her playing
career.
</P>
<P>
   Maura McHugh, the ASU coach at the time, nudged Jerro into
accepting a graduate assistant's job at the University of Houston.
McHugh looked at Jerro and saw a natural-born coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fro seemed to have a natural affinity for the game and she has
a really good temperament for coaching,'' McHugh said. ``When she
played for me, everybody on the team liked her. She didn't have a
big ego, she was a very upbeat person and she didn't take herself
too seriously. She was a real people person. I thought she'd be a
very good recruiter.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are sell jobs and then there was the pitch Jerro had to
make in the wake of Abraham's arrest last October and the
subsequent reassignment of the first interim head coach, Judy
Brame.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the softspoken woman in only her second season on campus
had to convince the CSUN players that basketball mattered, that it
could be the glue that pieced together their fractured illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The players had hand-picked her to assume the head-coaching
duties, so Jerro had that going for her. Her personality and
passion pretty much took over from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching her coach, she just looks very natural out there,''
said Cox, who as a volunteer high-school coach knows it's not as
easy as Jerro is making it look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see the girls taking direction from her really well and
I'm like, `How does she do that? That's hard,' '' Cox said,
chuckling. ``One thing you can see is the players really relate to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the note Edniesha Curry slipped under Jerro's
door during a recent road trip. ``I'm so proud you're my coach,''
it read in part.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro had a hard time reading the rest through her tears.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerro found herself in jams _ as when the team lost three
straight games to fall to 4-4 _ she asked herself, ``What would
(ASU coach) Maura do?''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that the players, treading water at .500, heard
``the mediocrity speech,'' about not settling for what's out there,
about always fighting for more. Not that Jerro needed to borrow the
speech from her former coach.
</P>
<P>
   She has, after all, lived it.

NFL OFFICIALS SITE-SEEING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ National Football League officials returned to Los
Angeles on Thursday, holding a series of meetings with the two
groups seeking to win an expansion team and planning yet another
aerial tour today of potential stadium sites.
</P>
<P>
   Led by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Carolina Panthers
owner Jerry Richardson, who heads the NFL Stadium Committee, the
helicopter tour is a prelude to the owners meeting March 15-18 in
Phoenix during which they might decide on the league's 32nd
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson held private meetings with Mayor Richard Riordan and
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, among others, Thursday to discuss
the level of political support for a return of professional
football to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Richardson and Tagliabue are to make the helicopter tour
to look over potential locations at the Coliseum and in Carson, as
well as two other sites previously under consideration _ Hollywood
Park and Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However, the last two both present problems for the NFL.
Hollywood Park is next to a racetrack and casino, and there is
strong local political opposition to the use of Dodger Stadium for
football.
</P>
<P>
   The aerial tour will be followed by a news conference in Carson
with agent Mike Ovitz and Ron Burkle, owner of the Ralphs
supermarket chain, who are seeking a team for that city.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has said the league wants to locate in Los Angeles at
either the Carson or Coliseum site, but has not decided whether the
league would build a stadium or leave it to the new owners _ who
have yet to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some involved in the talks said they saw the trip as a way to
boost the price of a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Richardson, Tagliabue and others on the trip also
met with Ed Roski and Eli Broad, who are heading up the effort to
return football to a refurbished Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Coliseum Commission has asked for
another consultant to review figures on what can be expected if
football does return.
</P>
<P>
   The commission last year approved a three-year contract with
Roski to bring football back or reimburse him for his costs if
another group wins the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members of the negotiation committee felt they needed
additional facts, and we want everyone to be comfortable with
this,'' said commission President Sheldon Sloan. ``I think we will
get to a point where there is a level of comfort that will show
this is a good deal for the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission comprises three representatives each from the
city, county and state, and in the past it was blamed for problems
that led to the loss of the Rams and the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said he anticipated no such situation developing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commission won't stand in the way of what it takes to
bring professional football back to Los Angeles,'' Sloan said.

MAVERICKS CAN'T HANDLE HOT SPURS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The home court was not sweet to the Mavericks last
night. In fact, nothing was.
</P>
<P>
   After winning four consecutive home games, the Mavericks played
sour ball in losing to the San Antonio Spurs last night, 95-79,
before a crowd of 14,719 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, beating the Spurs was a tall order for the Mavericks.
The Spurs often put three players on the court _ Tim Duncan, David
Robinson and Will Perdue _ who stand 7 feet or taller.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks spent much of the night trying to outclimb the
taller Spurs. It was a mountain they couldn't scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out with the intensity that we needed to in
order to beat this team,'' guard Michael Finley said. ``So to
measure ourselves after losing to this team would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson said his team caught the Spurs at the
wrong time. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who used to coach with
Nelson at Golden State, has been rumored to be on the firing line
because of his team's sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs whipped the Rockets in Houston by 17 on Tuesday,
and didn't skip at beat against the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they've got things rolling now,'' Nelson said.
``I thought we'd play them a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be a tough ballgame, but they made us look
bad. I don't know if we're as bad as they made us look, but it's
really hard to score against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had his way as he repeatedly tossed in jump-hook shot
after jump-hook shot. Duncan scored eight of his game-high 26
points and grabbed six of his game-high 12 rebounds in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That surge helped blow open the game, turning a six-point Spurs
lead at the half into a 72-57 cushion going into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers gave us a similar challenge with the dominant
inside game,'' guard Steve Nash said. ``I think we learned how
disciplined we have to be on our rotations in order to compete with
that offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two big guys \RDuncan and Robinson\S down there make it
a tough deal. But that is the challenge we have ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson finished with 20 points and eight rebounds, and Jaren
Jackson added 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mavericks, Gary Trent led the way with 14 points, Finley
scored 11 and Samaki Walker added 10. Also, rookie Dirk Nowitzki
shook off a mild sprained left ankle to score 11 points and grab
six rebounds in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a couple of easy shots and two layups,'' Nowitzki
said. ``But overall it was one of my better games.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki wowed the fans when he flew to the basket off a set
play for a dunk. But he still had his difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about playing against Robinson for the first time,
Nowitzki said: ``I looked at his arms and he has very nice arms. He
had a great game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led by as many as 21 points in the fourth quarter as
they squared their record at 8-8. The Mavericks dropped to 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively in the second half we executed really well and got
a lot of good shots,'' Popovich said. ``We played with a lot of
emotion and with some good offensive execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the Mavericks lacked the fire that had netted them
five wins in their previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dictated the tempo,'' he said. ``We played hard. We just
didn't do enough good things to stay in the game.''

CENTERS SAVE DAY AS STARS WIN IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Joe Nieuwendyk stole the glory, but Aaron
Gavey earned plenty of accolades as the Stars received strong
performances from their hottest center and their newest center in a
3-2 overtime victory against the New York Islanders last night.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk came up with the winning goal in overtime to extend
his scoring streak to five games and help the Stars set a franchise
record for longest road unbeaten streak at 10 games (8-0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Gavey played his first game in four months after a call-up from
the minors and showed Stars coach Ken Hitchcock flashes of a player
who could help down the stretch and possibly in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two lines really carried the mail for us,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We knew coming out here that people were going to be after
us, and that's the price you pay when you're a good team. But I
thought we responded, and I thought those two lines responded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 39-11-10 and already boast the fifth-most wins
in a season in franchise history _ and they still have 22 games to
play. The Stars' 88 points are 18 points better than the Phoenix
Coyotes and the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, playing in a half-empty Nassau Coliseum, fell to
19-37-7 and are out of the playoff picture. However, they're a
respectable 6-8-4 since Bill Stewart was selected interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Islanders played a great game,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, meanwhile, struggled early and forced Hitchcock to
start line shuffling. He moved Jere Lehtinen off a line with Mike
Modano and onto a line with Nieuwendyk and Pat Verbeek. The result
was a trio that combined for 11 of the Stars' 32 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can put Jere with anyone and that would be a good
line,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``And I think me and Beeker have some
chemistry going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear on the final shift of overtime, as Hitchcock left
his hot line on the ice for almost two minutes. But with the line
generating four shots in that span, Hitchcock had little reason to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher was magnificent at the right point as he refused
to allow the puck to leave the offensive zone and eventually
retrieved the puck long enough to get a shot from the blue line.
Nieuwendyk, meanwhile, fought through the check of 6-foot-9,
255-pound Zdeno Chara to get off the boards and to the front of the
net. Once there, Nieuwendyk deftly deflected the puck past
Islanders goalie Tommy Salo with 48 seconds remaining in overtime
and sent the Stars home a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get to the net with that 7-foot-5 . . .
guy . . . beating all over me as hard as he could,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``It was just a good shift. Hatch did a great job of keeping
it in.''
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Stars to overcome some defensive lapses in
which Ziggy Palffy was set free on several occasions and scored two
goals. Dave Reid and Mike Modano had the other goals for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   But through all that, the shining lights were the 25-year-old
Gavey, 22-year-old winger Jason Botterill and 33-year-old
defenseman Doug Lidster. The trio are part of a Hitchcock
experiment to see if the Stars have enough depth on their team
</P>
<P>
   ``Lidster was great, solid, mistake-free and Botterill played
well,'' Hitchcock said. ``And Aaron was terrific. He knows this is
a real opportunity for him. And for his sake, and the team's sake,
I hope he takes advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavey played almost 12 minutes and delivered four hits. More
important, he and linemates Reid and Mike Keane helped ignite the
Stars when they were having a slow start before a dead arena (9,566
fans).
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first or second guy in on every shift. You play
with energy like that and everybody else just feeds off of it,''
Reid said. ``Aaron knows he has something to prove, and he's out to
prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   That could make for some difficult choices for Hitchcock, who
said he will likely play Gavey tonight against the Buffalo Sabres,
Can he keep Tony Hrkac or Guy Carbonneau out of the lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of problems I don't mind,'' Hitchcock said.

ABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY MAKE RUSTY GREER TOO VALUABLE TO TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Would the Rangers be willing to trade
Rusty Greer?
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old left fielder posed that question to himself in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Greer became the subject of trade speculation that month after
right-hander Roger Clemens' request to be traded from Toronto to a
contender or an organization closer to his Houston home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers failed to acquire Clemens, but it was not because of
their unwillingness to trade Greer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a match for David Wells,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said of the Yankees' proposal, which included
the left-handed starter, reliever Graeme Lloyd and second baseman
Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's peers, though, often include Greer in any of their
trade proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring his name up,'' Melvin said, ``but they know we
won't trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer wanted to hear that from Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him during the middle of the winter to find out what
was going on,'' Greer said yesterday. ``That's when my name was
being floated around. He told me, `Don't worry about it. You're not
involved.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize, though, that this is a business and anything can
happen. You never say never, but it's a little more reassuring when
the general manager tells you that.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Greer nearly impossible for the Rangers to trade?
Offensive production Greer epitomizes the classic No. 3 hitter _ a
player who hits for average, reaches base often, scores and drives
in runs.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed hitter has a career batting average of .310.
That ranks eighth among active players, trailing Tony Gwynn (.339),
Mike Piazza (.333), Wade Boggs (.329), Frank Thomas (.321), Edgar
Martinez (.318), Alex Rodriguez (.313) and Kenny Lofton (.311).
</P>
<P>
   His career on-base percentage of .391 ranks 14th among active
players with a minimum of 2,500 plate appearances, and he also
emerged as one of only 22 major-league players who scored and drove
in 100 or more runs during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clemens' agents said he would not approve a trade here if
Rusty were involved in the deal because that would take away from
our club,'' Melvin said. ``He's well-respected by other players,
teams and managers for what he does.'' Defense Greer's mantel lacks
a Gold Glove Award, but one major-league scout identifies the
Rangers' red-headed outfielder and Detroit's Bobby Higginson as the
league's two best defensive left fielders.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballpark in Arlington places a premium on the range of left
and center fielders because of its spacious gap in that power
alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically need almost two center fielders,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``There's a lot of real estate out there. I wish I
owned that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's 2.11 chances per game ranked eighth among the 24
major-league left fielders who played a minimum of 600 innings at
the position during 1998. That illustrates his range, but it does
not depict Greer's fearlessness when it comes to leaving his feet
or going into the wall to make a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays with sort of a reckless abandon,'' Melvin said. ``You
always fear Rusty getting hurt, but that's just how he plays.''
Salary First baseman Frank Thomas drove in and scored 109 runs
during 1998. The Chicago White Sox paid $7 million for that
production.
</P>
<P>
   Greer drove in 108 runs and scored 107. His 1998 base salary:
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Greer to a two-year contract extension
through 2000 worth $7.2 million before the 1997 season. That
contract also includes an option for 2001 worth $4.5 million or can
be purchased by the Rangers for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Greer relinquished potentially greater future earnings through
his arbitration-eligible years of 1999 and 2000 and his first year
of free agency _ if the Rangers exercise their 2001 option _ for
the security a multiyear contract provides. Loyalty Melvin admitted
again yesterday that it would be difficult to trade Greer, who has
been selected the Rangers' most popular player in one local poll
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good ballplayer,'' Melvin said. ``He's
underappreciated. Players, managers, management and fans respect
him. He's out there every day. He plays hard, and he plays hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers received a ``discount,'' Melvin said, when Greer
signed his contract extension. That showed Greer's commitment and
loyalty to the Rangers, and Melvin said he wants to reward that by
reciprocating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's loyalty from management,'' Melvin said. ``I
think he's shown loyalty. It's not like he's ever run up here and
asked to renegotiate his contract or anything like that.'' Attitude
Right-hander John Wetteland, the Rangers' All-Star closer, praised
Greer repeatedly after signing with the organization as a free
agent in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, once an opponent with the Yankees, applauded Greer's
effort, aggressiveness, commitment, work ethic and consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, Greer's manager the previous four seasons, shares
Wetteland's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an appreciation for anyone who plays hard,'' Oates
said. ``That's the way it should be played. I appreciate it from
the fringe player, but I really appreciate it from the star player.
He knows he's got a job no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   And it appears Greer's job will be with the Rangers for at least
another three seasons.

MRS. JONES AND HER LAWYERS AGREE ON SHARING CLINTON SETTLEMENT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paula Jones and the lawyers who represented her at
various times in her sexual-misconduct suit against President
Clinton have agreed on how to share the $850,000 that Clinton gave
her to settle her case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones will keep $200,000, said a lawyer familiar with the
settlement order filed on Thursday before Judge Susan Webber Wright
of Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. Joseph Cammarata and
Gilbert K. Davis, who represented Ms. Jones for a time, will
receive $266,000, plus 40 percent of her income related to the
suit, like personal-appearance fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke is to
receive $283,000 for Donovan Campbell Jr.'s work on Ms. Jones's
behalf, and the Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., is to
get $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The president has always denied Mrs. Jones' accusation that he
propositioned her in a hotel room in 1991. &QL;

CHINESE PRIME MINISTER GRIMLY PLEDGES TO PUSH ON WITH REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BEIJING _ In a businesslike speech short on party rhetoric and
long on macroeconomics, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji addressed the
opening session of Parliament, declaring that ``despite a grim
economic picture,'' China would push ahead with economic and social
reforms, and would continue ``opening our country wider to the
outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sobering speech that starkly enumerated China's many
current problems _ from unemployment to official corruption to a
flagging export market. But he said that &UR;  &LR; China would continue the
policy it started last year of massive deficit spending to bolster
the economy, and expressed confidence that the plan would insulate
China from the worst of Asia's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from the past practice of declaring a precise yearly
growth target, Zhu predicted that China would have an economic
growth of ``around 7 percent &UR; '' &LR;  1999, down from the official 7.8
percent of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``To protect ourselves against the effects of the Asian
financial crisis, we adopted a policy of increasing investment and
boosting domestic demand at the beginning of last year,'' he told
the delegates to the National People's Congress, which meets each
March. ``However, the crisis became broader and deeper than we had
anticipated, exerting more of an impact on China than we had
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat a sharp decline in exports in the first half of 1998,
the government offered more than $12 billion in loans that Chinese
companies could use for investment in factories and basic
structures. Because of continued spending, Zhu said that China's
1999 budget deficit would be about $18 billion in 1999, greater
than the $12 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's speech to the Chinese Parliament, which meets for two
weeks each spring to approve proposals presented by the party, was
essentially the prime minister's public progress report on the
ambitious reforms he proposed a year ago _ before the full impact
of the Asian crisis and this year's devastating floods in China
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year his proposals included downsizing China's bloated
government by 400,000 employees, trimming China's 300,000
inefficient state-owned industries through sell-offs and merger,
and doing away with state supplied housing, requiring urban
residents to buy or rent their own homes by July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even at that time some of the reforms were regarded as
almost impossibly ambitious. And while Zhu noted substantial
progress in some areas, like bank reform and the formation of a
social security system, he acknowledged setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to the fact the sell-offs of small state owned
industries have been mired by corruption, saying: ``We must
resolutely stop erroneous practices such as selling them off for a
nominal price while in fact giving them away, or half-selling and
half giving them away, evading bank debts and states taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention the most glaring failure: that of forcing
people to pay for their housing, a plan that has been at least
temporarily shelved at a time of widespread layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were scattered appeals to Deng Xiaoping Theory,
there was less class struggle than puritan virtues. ``We should
advocate hard work and plain living and building our country
through thrift,'' he said.

PERREAULT GETS SECOND LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Yanic Perreault made it back into the Kings'
lineup Thursday night, perhaps by default.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings decided center Ray Ferraro's 34-year-old knees could
use a night off after he played in Wednesday's 2-1 loss to the
Mighty Ducks, so Perreault took his place in the lineup against the
Nashville Predators at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault had been a healthy scratch against the Ducks, and in
Sunday's 1-0 loss at Dallas he was benched for the entire third
period.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Perreault was second on the Kings with a career-high
28 goals, and he had four goals in the first four games this
season. But he has scored just six goals in 52 games since then,
not including the Nashville game.
</P>
<P>
   Of the decision to scratch Perreault against the Ducks, Kings
coach Larry Robinson said, ``He didn't play that poorly (in
Dallas), but he's still not getting chances to score. Some of it is
he hasn't been put in a position like that, and some of it is he
hasn't played the way we'd like to see him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a goal scorer. He should be getting chances, no matter
who he's playing with. We can't afford to wait for guys to find
their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perreault had a good chance from the slot in the first period
against Nashville, but Predators goalie Mike Dunham robbed him with
a glove save.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also scratched winger Sandy Moger against the Ducks,
and like Perreault, Moger returned to the lineup against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   __ Crucial home stand:The season-long seven-game home stand that
began Thursday night probably will determine whether the Kings have
any chance for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   After the home stand, the Kings will have only 13 games
remaining, nine on the road. The good news for the Kings is that of
the seven opponents on the home stand, four are below .500.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back in town:Former Kings winger Vitali Yachmenev might have
found a home with the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Yachmenev, who made a splash with the Kings by scoring 19 goals
as a rookie in 1994-95, has been playing on the Predators' second
line and entered Thursday night's game with six goals and 13 points
in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers aren't overly impressive, but the Predators
recognize Yachmenev's skills and appreciate his responsible
defensive play. Returning after missing 10 games with a separated
shoulder, Yachmenev had the Predators' only goal in a 5-1 loss
Tuesday night to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing, that we haven't won (at home) since
Jan. 19,'' Yachmenev said. ``We need home points, especially when
we're in a playoff race.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded eerily similar to what he'd be saying if he were
still a King. But the Kings traded Yachmenev to the Predators last
summer for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Yachmenev is one of four former members of the Kings
organization on the Nashville roster. The others are defensemen Jan
Vopat, John Slaney and Kimmo Timonen. Slaney scored against the
Kings in the first period Thursday, his second goal of the season.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's renewed push for a school voucher
experiment illustrates what can happen when his national political
ambitions conflict with the needs of New York City's public
schools. A voucher program could enhance the mayor's image in
national Republican circles, but it might also lose him a fine
schools chancellor, Rudy Crew. Crew says he will resign if the
mayor forces a voucher plan that uses public funds for private or
parochial schools. As the chancellor puts it: ``Always in your life
you come up to the proverbial hill to die on. This is mine.'' For
the mayor, whose aides protest that Crew is not really serious
about leaving over this issue, it is apparently worth the gamble.
For the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren, however, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been lobbying the city's Board of Education to
approve a pilot voucher program over the next three years in one of
32 school districts. The voucher issue has long been the darling of
the Republican Party, and the mayor, now eyeing higher office, has
said vouchers could provide much-needed competition for the city's
schools. Some voucher systems, like one in Milwaukee that the mayor
particularly admires, have also drawn support from those locked in
the worst school districts because they provide hope of a way out
for at least a few children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has argued strenuously and correctly that scarce public
funds should not be used for private or parochial schools, draining
taxpayer support in the process. He also argues that a pilot
program would not be a mere experiment but, instead, a bad
precedent that could even violate the state constitution. Instead
the chancellor is backing the new charter school system that allows
the creation of more experimental public schools freed from control
by local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his administrators have been urging the Board of
Education, particularly the new Queens board member, Terri Thomson,
to buck the chancellor. Ms. Thomson, who says she is studying the
issue, should not be tempted to provide the mayor with a fourth
vote among the board's seven members. Vouchers might give Giuliani
another badge to wear on the national stage, but at an unacceptable
cost if the city loses Crew in the process.

EDITORIAL: THE RULES OF MONICA'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 months the public has had only the most
fleeting, if endlessly repeated, glimpses of Monica Lewinsky. Now
she is at last everywhere _ on every TV screen and on the shelves
of every bookstore _ in a well-schooled, well-rehearsed version of
her own voice. What makes this news is that suddenly, after many
anticipatory trumpetings, one of the leading but essentially
unknown characters in this national drama has walked onstage,
inviting us to re-estimate her and everyone around her, including
President Clinton and Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that this emergence has been skillfully
managed. On ABC's ``20/20,'' Ms. Lewinsky was forced by the terms
of her immunity agreement with the independent counsel's office to
stay silent on her treatment by Starr's prosecutors. That silence
is one of the things that will help sell ``Monica's Story,'' by
Andrew Morton, in which she vilifies Starr without restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Americans the centerpiece of this odd debut is not
the book but Ms. Lewinsky's Wednesday interview with Barbara
Walters. It was an inevitable pairing. Ms. Walters' job was to
palpate the emotions of her guest. Ms. Lewinsky's job was to
reshape the terms in which her story has been presented by Linda
Tripp, Starr and the House managers. She succeeded to a degree that
perhaps only Clinton and the managers who interviewed her in
January could have guessed.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Ms. Lewinsky wanted to rewrite the ingenue's role.
From the evidence of her narrative, the woman who suffered so badly
from the legal fumbling of William Ginsburg is at last benefiting
from high-priced coaching in the fields of public relations,
sound-bitery and psychology. Suddenly, her story was not about a
stained dress or tawdry hallway trysts. It was about a giddy, Cosmo
version of self-realization, a tale told in the psychosexual
language of the magazine covers that urge their readers to own
their sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   In Monica's story, it seemed mysteriously irrelevant to the
heroine and her beau that the venue for this self-actualizing
encounter was the White House. Although she was generally merciful
in sketching Clinton, neither the House managers nor the
independent counsel has offered an iteration in which he looked
dimmer. He has already been depicted as reckless and as the
prisoner of a passionless marriage. In this latest account, there
is a more insulting portrait. Thong underwear is to Bill Clinton's
brain what kryptonite is to Superman's muscles. ``It's a dance. I
think it was saying, I'm interested too. I'll play,'' the Beverly
Hills lady said in explaining the I.Q.-melting impact that exposing
this bit of elastic had on a lover she regarded as imprisoned by
bumpkin religiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the rules,'' she offered on the protocols of affairs
with married partners. However you judge Ms. Lewinsky _ and the air
is turbulent with judgment _ here is the language of real sexual
adventure, the language, perhaps, of the 18th-century novel _ of
``Tom Jones'' and of de Laclos, the author of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses.'' The twist is that in the game of flirtation as Ms.
Lewinsky played it, the player who looks naive is the president of
the United States.  &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Clyde Drexler took his surrogate family of
Houston Cougars home Thursday. Next, he will spend a few days with
his real family _ his wife, Gaynell, and their four children _
before taking to the road for a different kind of ``family'' time.
</P>
<P>
   He'll then sell himself to the parents of the high school
hotshots who must still be brought into the fold for him to
complete his intended resurrection of a UH basketball program he
once helped lead to the highest of plateaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rookie anymore,'' Drexler notes. ``I did a lot of
recruiting last fall.''
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was interesting,'' he said, smiling weakly. ``But I
enjoyed it. Oh, yeah. You really do meet a lot of nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clyde and coaches like him whose desultory seasons have
concluded, March's madness is of a different sort. There will be no
noisy arenas, acrobatic cheerleaders, goofy mascots, gripping
finishes or Dick Vitales screeching in their ears. Just quiet
living rooms, most on the poor side of town, where the business of
selling oneself to proud mamas and/or papas reaches varying levels
of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler will get his feet in the front doors of many homes over
the next several weeks on the strength of his name and reputation,
not the mediocre record of a 10-17 debut season, one that began in
giddy fashion with an upset of eventual Big 12 regular-season
champion Texas only to close dismally here Wednesday with a 75-51
paddling by the University of North Carolina's branch office in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   For gaining such arguably undue recruiting entree, he will be
dissed by a goodly number of his peers, who believe he is a
celebrity dilettante intruding on their sacred turf. They will use
his wealth and fame against him, too, telling prospects and their
kinfolk that he won't be around for long, that the rough business
of coaching will prove more of a burden than he needs in his
would-be cushy life.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Clyde admits the job he took, almost on a charity
basis given his former salary, imposed more demands on him than he
expected. He ultimately quit his TV show, for example, because he
was required to appear live on the set on Sunday nights, when he
thought he belonged at home. He had blown off a few media
conference calls as well after enduring sessions when the only
reporters asking questions were people he saw every day at practice
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he admitted nobody prepared him for the amount of parental
interaction (baby-sitting?) required. In the NBA, where he spent
the previous 15 years turning himself into a basketball icon,
mothers and fathers weren't part of the daily milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, really, I've enjoyed getting to know them,'' he said.
``It's a positive aspect, not a negative one. We've got some great
parents, and some great kids. They made me proud to be their
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clyde's Cougars seemed an upstanding bunch, solid
citizens and good sports who, as a rule, lost gracefully. But they
were clearly short of weapons for fighting big-time hoops wars.
Drexler finished the year with five walk-ons, and he contends his
team, if anything, overachieved.
</P>
<P>
   As a strategist, he put the lads in position to win three or
four additional games, but each time they lacked the skills to
execute their way over the proverbial hump. Still, he is convinced
UH's core group _ namely Gee Gervin, Kenny Younger and William
Stringfellow _ constitutes a strong foundation for advancing to
that next level.
</P>
<P>
   A top-10 recruiting class, a readily viable goal based on the
commitments he already has received, would immediately lift the
Cougars into contention for the NCAA Tournament and maybe the Top
25. This is important to Drexler because, despite his reserved,
almost elegant bench demeanor, he won't be patient, much less
complacent, with entrenched losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to understand,'' said athletic director Chet
Gladchuk, the man who had the vision to think outside the box and
embrace Drexler's interest in the position, ``is that Clyde has
never failed at anything. He doesn't intend to fail as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk kept a close watch on Drexler, looking for signs of
frustration or, worse, disinterest as the year dragged to its
expected uninspiring end. The AD detected only the right kind of
the former and absolutely none, as in zip, of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had dinner the other night,'' Gladchuk said, ``and all
Clyde wanted to talk about was how excited he is for next year. His
attitude is great. He's pumped. I was left with the impression he
wishes they could start playing again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. Because no matter what he says on the record, he would
much rather be coaching than recruiting. However, it's a necessary
evil, so off he goes again, seeking the autographs of kids who
likely have grown up coveting his.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The unthinkable was in the process of happening Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets were losing to the Los Angeles Clippers _ the
winless Los Angeles Clippers. But Charles Barkley wasn't about to
let everyone get all worked up about it.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets losing at halftime, rather than entering the
locker room with a Clip on his shoulder, Barkley told everyone to
relax, have fun and enjoy the game for a change.
</P>
<P>
   The advice seemed to help. The Rockets blew out the Clippers in
the third quarter and coasted to a 96-77 victory before a relieved
crowd of 16,285 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys at halftime, I said, `Man, we're trying too
hard,''' said Barkley, who led the Rockets with 21 points and 12
rebounds. ``It's like we've been struggling and it seemed like
someone had told us that we had to blow the Clippers out because
they haven't won a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let's just go out and have some fun in the second
half. Forget what you read in the paper and see on television. We
just have to go out and play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come. It's not going to come together
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly came together in one beautiful 12-minute stretch
that was the third quarter. Down 45-44 to the Clippers, Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich tinkered with his lineup, inserting Cuttino
Mobley at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The result was magic.
</P>
<P>
   At his worst, Mobley can be wild and inconsistent. But when he's
at his best, as he was Thursday, ``Cat'' is an explosive offensive
player and a quick, long-armed threat on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley had seven points, all three of his assists and a steal in
the third period, the biggest reason the Rockets outscored the
Clippers by 21 points (32-11).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had two games out there, the first half, which
was lackluster, and then a very intense second half where we picked
up the defense,'' Tomjanovich said. ``No comparison. No comparison
from one half to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great third quarter, and I sort of saw what I
envisioned for this team _ being aggressive defensively and getting
out and running, getting some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mobley and Michael Dickerson hounding the Clippers' guards,
Barkley was able to overplay the passing lanes, getting four of his
season-high six steals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that,'' said Mobley, who finished with 13 points. ``I
put pressure on the ball, and Charles comes up with the steal. I
just think that with me, Michael, Rodrick (Rhodes) and Scottie
(Pippen) out there, I don't think there are too many teams that can
seriously give us that much of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the Clippers. Not in the second half, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It had been awhile, but the Rockets finally woke up and buried
an inferior team, ending a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   If that two-game skid seemed tough, just imagine what it's like
to be the Clippers. The loss extended the their slide to 14 games,
just three away from the record set by the 1988-89 Miami Heat for
consecutive losses to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   It looked for a while Thursday like Miami's record might be
safe. But after playing so well in the first half, the Clippers
committed seven of their 16 turnovers in the third period, leading
to nine Houston points, and they never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well for 24 minutes,'' said Los Angeles coach Chris
Ford. ``Unfortunately, the games are 48 minutes long.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who made his first start since coming off the injured
list last week, scored 13 points in the second half, and Dickerson
had 10 of his 20.
</P>
<P>
   Othella Harrington finished with 10 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored just six points, attempting only six shots, but he
had a game-high nine assists, grabbed seven rebounds and played
aggressive, suffocating defense on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The key now, Pippen said, is to take what the Rockets did in the
third quarter and start the game the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think so,'' Pippen said. ``Once you start to build
some type of rhythm like this, you want to keep that energy
throughout a game. It's only a 48-minute game, and you're only out
there for a certain number of minutes, so you have to keep that
kind of energy. Energy is what wins you games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be lackadaisical and go out there thinking that
teams are going to settle for jump shots. You have to be the
aggressor on defense and attack them before they get you back on
your heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that in the second half, and it stopped a lot of their
one-on-one play and their easy baskets.''

ITS HIT OR MISS FOR SETON HALL AS UCONN ESCAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The free throw bounced on the front of the rim,
curled along the right side of the iron and kissed the backboard.
Then the ball dropped through the net. It was the worst single
point Gary Saunders had recorded at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   With two seconds remaining, the Pirates were trailing No.
3-ranked Connecticut, 57-55. So for once in his life, Saunders
wanted to miss. On Coach Tommy Amaker's clipboard, one of the
Pirates' guards would streak down the lane and slam the ball home
to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then, who knows what would happen?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an upset of national proportions. Or just the chance to
give the selection committee a headache.
</P>
<P>
   But on the hard wood of Madison Square Garden on Thursday, it
never worked out for Saunders and Seton Hall. The ball dropped
through the net, Connecticut quickly inbounded it to Khalid El-Amin
and the final horn sounded:
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut 57, Seton Hall 56.
</P>
<P>
   For the Huskies (26-2), it is on to the semifinals of the Big
East tournament where they will play Syracuse, a 70-62 winner over
Villanova on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear by the anguish on Saunders's face that he would
have gladly traded his 18 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds not to
have to explain the cruel logic behind his final free throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to miss and I tried to shoot it off balance and
the ball just went in the rim,'' Saunders, a junior who played at
Rice High School in Manhattan, said. ``When I want to make free
throws, I miss them. When I want to miss them, I make them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few but costly things the Hall (15-14) did
wrong on an afternoon when Connecticut came a well-placed carom
away from having the indignity of becoming the third No. 1-seeded
team in the 20-year history of the Big East tournament to lose its
opening game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates turned the Knicks' home floor into a New Jersey
swampland by continually holding the ball until the last ticks of
the 35-second shot clock before shooting and then banged the boards
so UConn could not start its vaunted fast break.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's usually liquid transition game managed only 12 points
off turnovers and the Big East co-player of the year, Richard
Hamilton, and the celebrated point guard, El-Amin, grew frustrated.
Hamilton scored 15 points, but shot only 5 of 16. El-Amin put in 4
points on 1 of 8 shooting and often looked barely interested in his
team advancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They completely dictated the pace,'' Connecticut Coach Jim
Calhoun said. ``I don't know the exact number, but I'm sure it's
going to be somewhere like 20 times they were under 10 seconds on
the shot clock before shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he has all year, the Huskies forward Kevin Freeman
carried his teammates. With 1 minute 27 seconds to play, he flew
through the air to tip in a missed 3-pointer by Hamilton and put
UConn up, 51-50. Fifty-eight seconds later, he got loose
underneath, took an El-Amin pass and slammed it for a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Freeman's 22nd point of the game, the 1,003d of his
career. Freeman did not even make the All Big East team despite
being the Huskies' best defender and leading percentage shooter and
rebounder. He was 10 of 14 against the Pirates and is shooting
better than 60 percent for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to make a point,'' Freeman said. ``I came
here to win. I think winning games will make a point to the rest of
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Calhoun acknowledged that his team hardly looked
like one of the favorites to make the trip to the Final Four. But
he hoped that his team would learn from the Seton Hall scare.
</P>
<P>
   Next week in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, he expects that his team will confront zone defenses
and slow-down tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun also worries about the health of Jake Voskuhl, who has
not practiced in two weeks and played only 21 minutes against Seton
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One month ago, the 6-foot-11-inch center aggravated a stress
fracture in his left foot that Voskuhl first injured in high school
and has not been at full strength since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get to where we want to go without Jake,'' Calhoun
said of Voskuhl, who had 5 points and 5 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun is also miffed that El-Amin continues to vanish during
big times. Of El-Amin, he confessed that is has been a constant
struggle to motivate the sophomore point guard against inferior
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he can push a button when he wants to turn it on,''
Calhoun said. ``He should have seen today that he couldn't. He
needs to learn to play hard all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Huskies' interior game and El-Amin will be tested on
Friday against Syracuse (21-10) in what essentially is a rubber
match after the two teams traded whippings on each other's home
floors in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the Orangemen center Etan Thomas
led a balanced Syracuse attack in a more overwhelming victory over
Villanova (21-10) than the final score indicated. The 6-9 center
scored 17 points, pulled down 10 rebounds and swatted 3 shots while
guard Jason Hart and forward Ryan Blackwell added 13 and 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim was careful to credit his team's
early tournament dominance on better ball movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etan was big in the middle,'' Boeheim said. ``But I think
we're getting better, particularly Ryan and Jason at trying to find
Etan. He's working hard, he's getting offensive rebounds.''

3_POINT BARON DELIVERS
</HEADLINE>

By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Video became reality here Thursday night, as UCLA
guard Baron Davis added a line to his impressive resume _ a 3-point
line.
</P>
<P>
   For all his spectacular plays and last-second heroics, for all
his dunks and drives and razzle-dazzle, Davis had never made a
game-winning 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not a REAL game-winning 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do that,'' Davis said with a wide grin
after draining the decisive 3-pointer in UCLA's 68-65 victory over
Arizona State, before 9,007 at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I play a video game,'' he added. ``It's tied in
regulation, and I'm shooting 3s. I always wanted to shoot a 3 (in a
real game) with it tied or us down two. That's why I started
celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ball left his fingertips, Davis raised his arms to the
ceiling. The basket broke a 65-65 tie with 40 seconds remaining and
propelled the Bruins to their 21st consecutive victory over Arizona
State and their fifth straight overall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with one obstacle left _ Saturday, at Arizona, in
All-American guard Jason Terry's final home game _ the Bruins are
on the brink of a massive momentum boost entering the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a sloppy game and it wasn't very well played,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said. ``But at this point in the season, we're
happy to get a win, especially on the road in conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (22-7, 12-5) snapped a road losing streak at three
games but lacked the efficiency and discipline they showed in the
loss at Stanford three weeks ago. In fact, they did not play well
enough to win a second-round NCAA Tournament game, much less
survive a visit to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled against Arizona State's zone defense. They
committed 24 turnovers, shot 40 percent from the field and wasted a
double-digit lead in the first half. Their zone offense reverted to
January form, their passes were sloppy and their full-court
pressure lost its bite midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be satisfied with this,'' Davis said. ``It was a
gut-check win, but we knew it would be tough. We knew they'd make a
run at us. It was tough to keep a team that can put points on the
board at bay. But down the stretch, we came up big.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Jerome Moiso overcame his tender feet to gobble
all the important rebounds in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Earl Watson scored a game-high 21 points, grabbed nine
rebounds and committed just three turnovers. Defensively, he and
Davis hounded ASU's leading scorer, guard Eddie House, into 6-of-17
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of Earl's better games on the road,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also received a big lift from senior guard Brandon
Loyd, whose presence usually coincides with poor execution against
zone defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Sun Devils spent most of the second half in a
compact zone that smothered UCLA's post offense and closed Davis'
penetration lanes. The Bruins took bad shots and threw poor passes
in their worst performance against a zone since the first Stanford
game.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd, the designated zone-buster, played 16 minutes, his
second-highest total of the season. Fighting a head cold, he made
three 3-pointers and chased the Sun Devils out of their zone with a
swish with 3:50 remaining. The basket gave UCLA a 63-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my career's about to end, I start playing a little,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game was about to end, when they trailed 59-54 with
nine minutes remaining, so did the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   They took control of the rebounding, tightened their defense _
ASU scored six points in the final 8:40 _ and watched Davis bolster
his late-season charge for Pac-10 Player of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   After ASU's Alton Mason missed two free throws with 47.8 seconds
left, Moiso snatched the rebound and passed to Davis near the right
sideline. He raced downcourt, saw Mason playing for the drive, and
pulled up 21 feet from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to depart for the NBA after the season, Davis is making
the most of his final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now,'' he said, ``I was always passing up those 3-point
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Note: &UR; !off! &LR;  Davis said he might have broken the middle
toe on his right foot after a late-game collision. UCLA will know
more today, but Davis is expected to play Saturday. &UR; !dlim!!end!

H-P 12C, THE CALCULATOR THAT LIVES FOREVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In 4th graf: the words (plus) and (equals) should be replaced
with the symbols. Also, the parens around (enter) should be
replaced with brackets.)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's plans for splitting in two, announced last
week, shook up Silicon Valley, home of the iconic garage where the
company started. But no less unsettled were legions of Wall Street
MBAs who were left wondering how the spinoff would affect their
beloved H-P 12Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The 12C, a calculator that is one of the company's best-selling
products ever, is as indispensable to an MBA as a pocket knife is
to a Boy Scout. Years removed from finance classes, many MBAs still
carry their 12Cs, ready at any moment to calculate the net present
value of the remaining payments on their Greenwich homes or to
convert dollars to euros to see how much their companions owe them
for those bottles of Chateau d'Y'quem.
</P>
<P>
   But like many contrivances embraced by this group (think program
trading and derivatives), the 12C is not always practical in the
real world. To begin with, it has no ``equals'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   With most calculators, if you want to add 2 and 2, you enter ``2
(plus) 2 (equals)''. Not with the 12C, which demands ``2 (enter) 2
(plus)''.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its quirks and nearly two decades of calculative
innovations, the 12C, introduced in 1981, has a remarkably loyal
following. To David Hicks, curator of the Museum of HP Calculators,
a cyberspace salon containing history and arcana, the 12C is ``the
calculator that wouldn't die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12C has become part of the well-dressed business
uniform,'' said Hicks, an Intel engineer based in Hillsboro, Ore.,
whose museum, found at www.hpmuseum.org, is not affiliated with
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees. ``Actually, only the guys over 40 still
use the 12C,'' said Chris Horgan, a 1995 MBA from the University of
Chicago. ``Everyone going to business school now uses the 19BII,''
a more advanced H-P model.
</P>
<P>
   A generation gap is also seen at the Harvard Coop bookstore. Jay
Chrepta, a spokesman for the Harvard Business School, said MBA
students generally opt for more advanced models, while the older
participants in the Executive Education program buy the 12C.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12C, at a list price of $69.95, costs only about half as
much as a 19BII. &UR;  &LR; So what if it has 120 built-in functions while
the 19BII has 450? And who cares if the 12C is now made in Malaysia
instead of venerable Palo Alto?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Benjie V. Garcia cares. A 12C fanatic, Garcia posted a
note on the calculator museum Web site complaining that the
Malaysian 12C has keys that are slightly off-color and mushier
compared with those on the older kind. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Garcia's verdict: ``Of course the calculator still works the
same as would any older 12C, but as a collector and fan of the HP
12C, this is not tolerable!''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Dismore, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard, says 12C
fans can relax. The calculator operations will remain part of the
old Hewlett-Packard rather going into the new, yet-to-be-named
spinoff, and therefore will still carry the H-P name. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Though the company's retail calculator business is barely big
enough to be a quarterly rounding error, Ms. Dismore swears that
Hewlett-Packard will continue to produce the 12C as long as
financiers, students and others buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Which they apparently will continue to do, at least until
Hewlett-Packard adds what could be a very useful function: a homing
device. Hicks said he recently got a call from the lost-and-found
department at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, offering him
a collection of 400 12Cs left behind by travelers. &QL;

MINDING YOUR MENTORS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am a woman trying to get ahead in a field
dominated by men. My company doesn't officially assign mentors, but
upper managers often extend guidance. As a woman, I tend to get
steered toward female executives, who invite me to dinner or lunch.
But there are several men here whose professional interests and
activities are much closer to my own. How can I make the point that
the men would be the better mentors?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First piece of advice: Don't look a gift mentor in the mouth.
Just because the work experience of the guys around the office
seems like a better match for your goals doesn't mean the women
have nothing to offer. ``It's never been written that one has to
have only one mentor,'' said Anne E. Hayden, a senior vice
president at Metropolitan Life, the insurer. ``Look for
opportunities to glean advice and help and guidance wherever you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   In professions dominated by men, female executives can prove
invaluable in showing you how to survive and thrive within the boys
club. Despite what has been written about women not helping other
women on the way up, Ms. Hayden said, your case is evidence that
some top-level women are happy to reach out. Never block that
avenue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for getting what you want from the men at the top rungs, it's
up to you to make the first move. ``Being a woman in a
male-dominated industry, you have to be more assertive, more
confident in yourself and your skills,'' said Cristen McDonough, an
assistant trader at Bluestone Capital Partners, an investment bank
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean marching into some vice president's
office and demanding more attention. Mentors want to see the
benefits for them _ in dedication or productivity. ``Mentoring is a
two-way street,'' Ms. Hayden said. ``The person being mentored gets
help, advice, and coaching, and the person doing the mentoring
generally gets extra effort _ someone very committed to working on
special projects or on assignments that maybe don't fall within the
boxes on the organizational chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayden advises building relationships by looking for ways to
help out. Volunteer for company initiatives, even if they are not
directly related to work _ the United Way campaign, for example.
``Even if the work itself may not be quite as meaty as you'd
like,'' she said, ``it can give you the opportunity to work with
people that you can learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   If efforts to broaden your circle within the organization don't
work out, consider widening your search, said Charlene Walker, a
partner with Women's Focus, a career counseling and outplacement
firm in Tustin, Calif. She recommended getting involved in a
professional organization where you can meet people from other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Donna M. Cornell, a career counselor in Newburgh, N.Y., who
specializes in women's issues, put it this way: ``Make it clear
that you want to learn as much as you can possibly learn from any
and every resource. Once people see how dedicated you are to
learning, they'll be helpful.'' &QL;

CAUGHT WITH THEIR PANTS ON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half the babies born in New York City go home from the hospital
to families with incomes below the poverty level. Something like 10
million children in this country lack health insurance. And, on
average, American children spend 1,500 hours a year watching
television, compared with just 900 in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind all that. As a result of a public outcry, Calvin
Klein Inc. has canceled its new advertising campaign _ including a
controversial billboard in Manhattan's Times Square _ for a line of
children's underwear. The ads showed children actually wearing the
underwear, a fact that astonished and appalled conservative groups,
psychologists and others.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about this latest business capitulation to fin de
siecle Puritanism is that hardly any of those guardians of public
morals have raised a voice against the everyday commercial abuse of
children.
</P>
<P>
   TV series and advertising subject youthful viewers to a
never-ending procession of violence and hucksterism, but it is only
ads like Calvin Klein's _ decried as giving comfort to pedophiles _
that are removed from view.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the data. According to the Center for Media Education,
a nonprofit group in Washington, an average child ``will witness
more than 100,000 acts of violence on TV, including 8,000 murders''
by the time he completes elementary school. The numbers double by
the end of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Some reasonable people believe that seeing all this violence
makes children become more violent, desensitizes them to real
violence and gives them the impression that the world is a sicker
and more dangerous place than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   As for commercials, the Center for Media Education says the
average viewer sees a million of them, including 100,000 for
alcohol, by the age of 21. ``Children see at least an hour of
commercials for every five hours of programs they watch on
commercial TV,'' it noted, adding that most children under 6 don't
even know they're being sold something when they watch commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Della Femina, the veteran ad executive, found it odd that
critics focused on the supposedly sexual undertones of the Klein
ads. He found fault instead with the whole notion of selling
high-priced undergarments for young children _ clothing that no one
sees, after all, except in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obscenity here: selling designer underwear for
little kids,'' he said. ``I wouldn't buy designer underwear for my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Della Femina has observed just how ordinary, if artful,
the Klein ads happened to be. ``Every one of your viewers,'' he
said in a television interview, ``has a catalogue at home that has
a children's underwear ad in it that looks like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the ads, along with those who advocate Internet
censorship to protect children, seem to hark back to a time of
sexual innocence that has somehow been lost. But it is far from
clear just who introduced the sexual snake into the cultural
garden.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Teletubbies seems gay to some people, a perception
noted in the general press long before it was trumpeted by the
National Liberty Journal of the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   But was the past so innocent? Remember the Coppertone girl, with
that cute little dog who pulls down her briefs to reveal that cute
little tush? What happens when the forces of morality and good
order discover that the sweet kid with the white bottom lives on at
www.coppertone.com, right there on the product's Web page?
Pedophiles, start your browsers!
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no denying that some innocence has been lost. Can
any grown-up today consider the relationship of Batman and Robin,
or the tendency of Bugs Bunny to dress as a woman to bedevil
Yosemite Sam, as entirely without sexual implications?
</P>
<P>
   The characters haven't changed; the implications, celebrated or
decried, are in the eye of the implicator. ``In a curious way,''
Jacob Weisberg wrote recently in Slate, the on-line magazine,
``gays, their friends and their enemies have all collaborated in
destroying the sexual innocence of cartoon characters by making an
issue out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   American children, meanwhile, muddle along. Nearly a third are
born out of wedlock. And in their final year of secondary school,
students in the United States score near the bottom in
international rankings of math literacy, just behind Lithuania (but
ahead of Cyprus).

   SCI-LA-QUAKE (Undated) _ Using information once jealously
guarded by oil and gas companies, scientists have identified a
major new fault under downtown Los Angeles. Called the Puente Hills
blind thrust, the fault, which is active, lies hidden in the
basement of the metropolitan area and is capable of producing a
devastating earthquake. Scientists have inferred the existence of
such faults under the city for many years but this is the first
solid proof that one actually exists. By Sandra Blakeslee.

   SCI-SHRINKING-ICECAP (Undated) _ The southern half of the
Greenland ice sheet, the second largest expanse of land-bound ice
on earth after Antarctica, has shrunk substantially in the last
five years, scientists have found in airborne surveys using new and
more precise techniques. Experts have said for some time that a
warming atmosphere has caused many mountain glaciers around the

   BANANA-TRADE-WAR (Frankfurt, Germany) _ On Thursday, Marc
Ecrepont, general manager of Group Fremaux, which exports cotton
bedsheets, became a pawn in a trade war over bananas between the
United States and Europe. The United States is imposing a 100
percent tariff on those sheets in retaliation for the European
Union's refusal to abandon its banana import preferences. The
sanctions hit 15 categories of goods, none of which have any direct
link with bananas. The tariffs followed months of bitter feuding
over Europe's import preferences for bananas from its former
colonies. Neither side produces bananas itself, but both have
companies that market them, and both have elevated the issue to one
of righteous indignation. By Edmund L. Andrews.

With a redesigned logo, chic new uniforms and an income statement

<TEXT>
<P>
   Using information once jealously guarded by oil and gas
companies, scientists have for the first time identified a major
fault under downtown Los Angeles of a kind whose existence there
they previously could only infer. They say it is capable of
producing a devastating earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have for years believed that such faults, called
blind thrusts, exist beneath the city. But this is the first solid
proof that one is actually present, said Dr. James Dolan, a
professor of geology at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The research adds support to the theory, emerging in the last
decade, that Los Angeles is threatened more by faults like this
one, which lie concealed underground right inside the city, than by
the famous and much larger San Andreas fault, a visible scar
running across the landscape 60 miles east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many blind thrust faults might lie beneath Los
Angeles, experts said on Thursday that they did not know. But Dolan
said there was unlikely to be another the size of the newly
identified one, which would measure 250 square miles on the surface
and is believed to be at least nine miles deep.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``the poster child of blind thrust faults underneath Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who was not among the researchers, said they had ``nailed
its location'' and determined that it was under increasing strain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Henyey, co-director of the Southern California
Earthquake Center, a consortium of academic and government
institutions with headquarters at the University of Southern
California, said the finding would add to the data that scientists
and policy makers consider in evaluating building codes and the
design of crucial complexes like hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The fault was identified by Dr. John Shaw, a structural
geologist at Harvard University, and Dr. Peter Shearer, a
seismologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego.
Their work is described in Friday's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust faults, which exist elsewhere and have long been thought
to lie beneath Los Angeles, in part because of surface features
that occur within the city, are given their name because of the
activity they induce in earthquakes. In a quake caused by what is
called a slip-strike fault, like the San Andreas, the blocks of
earth slide past each other horizontally. But in a quake caused by
a thrust fault, whose fracture of the earth dips along at angles
that can be either shallow or steep, the blocks move diagonally,
almost vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Such movement may cause rocks to fold just below the surface. Or
it may create small hills on the surface. But that evidence of a
quake can easily erode away or be bulldozed to make room for
apartment buildings, leaving the fault invisible, or ``blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The blind thrust faults of Los Angeles, Shaw explained, are
caused by the relative motion of the North American and Pacific
plates, two huge masses of crust that are sliding past each other
along the San Andreas fault. Because of a dogleg in the fault, the
Los Angeles basin is being squeezed like an accordion between these
masses of earth. The ground under the city is compressing by a
fifth of an inch a year, Shaw said, and some of that stress is
building up on one fault or another somewhere out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the Los Angeles basin had potentially
dangerous blind thrust faults came in 1987 with the Whittier
Narrows earthquake, a magnitude-6 temblor on the Richter scale,
that killed eight people and caused property damage of $358
million. No fault had been mapped in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake of 1994, also on a blind
thrust fault that had not been mapped, killed 61 people and caused
damage worth $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when scientists began looking for blind thrust faults, they
could only infer their existence from folds in sand and gravel
layers near the surface, Dolan said. The largest of these earlier
inferred faults is called the Elysian Park fault, which like the
newly identified one, apparently lies under parts of downtown Los
Angeles. But its actual size is not known.
</P>
<P>
   To find blind faults, Shaw said, scientists must identify
geologic structures underground, a task with which the oil and gas
industry is quite familiar. Petroleum companies have been drilling
and exploring in the Los Angeles basin for decades, seeking pockets
of oil and gas. The methods they use can also be employed to gain
evidence of faults: setting off small explosions on the surface and
measuring the way sound waves propagate through the ground or
measuring the velocity of sound in rocks during drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas companies long kept their findings secret,
however, regarding them as highly proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, who once worked for Texaco as a petroleum geologist,
said major petroleum companies were now pulling out of Los Angeles
because of strict environmental regulations and the depletion of
oil and gas there. The companies are now willing to turn their old
data over to researchers, he said, in return for improved
techniques that will help them search for oil and gas elsewhere,
using new data.
</P>
<P>
   It was oil company information, Shaw said, that led to the
discovery of the newly identified fault, called the Puente Hills
blind thrust because it lies along the Puente Hills near the town
of Whittier, in Orange County. The fracture, he said, showed up
clearly on 10 seismic profiles _ so clearly, in fact, that
distinctive characteristics could be discerned on each side of the
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The fault runs east-west for about 25 miles from Century City to
Coyote Hills in northern Orange County. If it came to the surface,
it would be about 10 miles wide. Underground, the entire fault dips
at about 27 degrees to the north and appears to form three distinct
segments, termed Los Angeles, Santa Fe Springs and Coyote Hills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fault is active. Using new techniques for calibrating the
epicenter of past earthquakes and oil company data on sound
velocities, Shearer discovered that the Whittier Narrows earthquake
was caused by the Puente Hills fault. Moreover, the earthquake
ruptured only 10 percent of the blocks on that segment of the
fault, which means that the quake probably left a great deal of
stress on the immediate segment and adjoining segments.
</P>
<P>
   Each fault segment is capable of generating a Northridge-size
earthquake, Shaw said. If all three segments ruptured
simultaneously, a much more damaging, magnitude 7 earthquake could
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The record of prehistoric ruptures on the Puente Hills fault is
not known. Each segment could break every 250 to 1,000 years and a
triple whammy might happen once every 500 to 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   No large earthquake has occurred within the Los Angeles basin
since 1850, when European settlers first began to keep records.

ODOM, URI EARN RIGHT TO PLAY ON 
</HEADLINE>
 10-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is evident that the only question Lamar Odom
has yet to answer concerning his stellar collegiate career is how
long it will last. The Atlantic 10 rookie of the year made certain
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night it will continue at least another game.
</P>
<P>
   Odom scored 17 of his game-high 21 points in the first half to
lead Rhode Island to an 83-58 victory over La Salle in the
quarterfinal round of the A-10 tournament. URI (18-12) led by 15 at
halftime and staved off a few mild La Salle rallies.
</P>
<P>
   URI will meet George Washington, a 100-90 winner over Dayton, in
Friday night's second semifinal at 9. The matchup will pit
Colonials coach Tom Penders against the program he led to the Sweet
16 in the 1988 NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's other semifinal, Temple, which beat Virginia
Tech, 64-51, will meet Xavier, a 72-68 winner over Massachusetts.
Temple has advanced to the semifinal round of the tournament each
of the league's 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The four teams in the semifinals not only are the four highest
seeds but also the same teams that reached last year's semifinals.
Xavier beat George Washington in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, considered by many to be a potential top-five pick in the
NBA Draft, finished with 10 rebounds and 5 assists, but didn't
score in the second half until the 6:45 mark. But his play in the
first half helped URI rally from a 13-5 deficit with 15:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out slow so I did what I do best. I tried to energize
my team and I got a couple of baskets,'' said Odom. ``I wanted them
to know there was no way I was going to let us lose that game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Odom's teammates picked up the slack,
particularly junior Ed Brown, the 6-foot-8-inch, 275-pound reserve
center, who finished with 11 points and seven rebounds and did a
solid job against La Salle's 6-7, 253-pound center K'Zell Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to play him on the low post,'' URI coach Jim
Harrick said of Brown. ``They had no answers for him tonight, but a
lot of teams don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom scored on a putback of a Tory Jefferson missed free throw
with 5:20 left to give the Rams a 69-49 advantage and the Rams
coasted from there.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Shawnta Rogers, the A-10 player of the year, had 28
points, 7 assists, and 4 steals to lead GW (20-7). The Colonials
held a 67-38 bulge with 14:55 left before Dayton staged a dramatic
rally, cutting it to 96-88 with 41 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But GW sank four free throws the rest of the way to secure the
win. Mike King had 24 points and 11 rebounds and Yegor Mescheriakov
added 22 points and 9 boards.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mark Karcher had a game-high 22 points and sank three
3-pointers over the last 2:43 of the first half to give Temple a
42-23 halftime lead. The Owls went cold in the second half,
shooting just 20 percent from the floor, but their defense kept
Virginia Tech from getting any closer than 56-46 with 3:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Xavier beat visiting Temple, 62-60, and GW
beat URI, 81-74, at Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let that game get away from us,'' said Odom. ``I think this
team will be looking forward to (Friday night's) game more than any
other. We know we need this game if we're going to get into the
NCAA Tournament.''

MIAMI GAINS REVENGE ON GEORGETOWN

 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since they joined the Big East in 1992, the
Miami Hurricanes have come to the conference tournament at Madison
Square Garden only to be summarily dismissed by an all-too-familiar
foil, the Georgetown Hoyas. But Thursday &UR;  &LR; night the second-seeded
Hurricanes claimed their vengeance by snapping an 0-for-6 skein
against Georgetown with a 65-54 victory over the No. 10 seed Hoyas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've beaten us in the past, for the most part, because
they've been better than us,'' said Miami coach Leonard Hamilton,
the conference coach of the year who guided his team to its first
berth in the tourney semifinals where the Hurricanes will face No.
3 seed St. John's. ``But tonight we were the better basketball team
and we expected to win the game, just like they expected to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bland, Miami's 6-foot-6-inch, 265-pound junior power
forward, led the Hurricanes (22-5) by scoring 15 of his game-high
19 points in the second half and grabbing nine rebounds. Johnny
Hemsley added 18 points while conference co-player of the year Tim
James had 12 despite sitting out 13 minutes in the first half with
two fouls and a sinus problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgetown has a reputation for playing physical basketball
and we knew we couldn't stand around if we wanted to win this
game,'' said Bland, who helped Miami rally from a 34-30 halftime
deficit to a 48-46 lead when he scored on a low-post feed from
Johnny Salmons that gave Miami the lead for good with 9:40 to go.
``I don't want to take anything away from Georgetown because
physical play is how they make their living, but we just had to
match their intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jameel Watkins and Kevin Braswell had 12 points apiece to lead
the Hoyas (15-15), who converted just 19 of 63 field goals and went
the final 5:03 of the game without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse 70, Villanova 62 _ The fourth-seeded Orangemen, fresh
off their 41-point romp over Boston College in the first round,
earned their 15th trip to the tourney semifinals, where they will
face top-seeded Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse owns an 11-3 all-time tourney record in the semis, but
is 2-3 in the tourney vs. the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Etan Thomas, one of four Syracuse starters to
score in double figures, led the Orangemen (21-10) with 17 points,
10 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots while Ryan Blackwell chipped in 16
points and 8 rebounds, and Jason Hart had 13 points, 6 assists, and
3 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense got us to where we needed to go,'' said
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose team will be looking to avenge a
70-58 loss to UConn in the regular-season finale Feb. 28 at the
Carrier Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were aggressive on defense. We were going for
loose balls. We were picking up, getting after it. We were
trapping, getting the steals. I can't say anything but good things
about our defensive effort today.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Syracuse's suffocating defense, Villanova's John
Celestand led all scorers with 24 points on 8-for-16 shooting,
including 3 of 7 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's 77, Rutgers 62 _ Ron Artest scored a game-high 22
points and freshman guard Erick Barkley chipped in 21 to help the
third-seeded Red Storm (24-7) advance to the semifinals for the
10th time in the 20-year history of the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, who are 3-6 in Big East semis, will face
second-seeded Miami, which beat St. John's, 76-68, in overtime in
the first round of the 1997 tourney.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Scarlet Knights (18-12) got a team-high 18
points from Dahntay Jones, but saw a 49-48 second-half lead quickly
disappear after St. John's went on a 14-3 run to secure a
comfortable 62-52 lead with 7:15 to go.

CSUN SEES LEAD SLIP AWAY

   OGDEN, Utah _ Jeff Riggs' off-balance eight-foot jumper with 1.4
seconds left gave Montana State a 91-90 win over the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball team Thursday night in the Big Sky
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs' shot came after CSUN's Markus Carr made a left-handed
layup with 10.9 seconds to give the Matadors a 90-89 lead. Andre
Larry's 3-point attempt was off the rim as time ran out on CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Bobcats (16-12) advance to the semifinals of
the tournament, where they will face top-seeded Weber State. The
Matadors (17-12) failed to win a game in the tournament for the
first time in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN dominated the first 15 minutes, scoring almost at will on
the way to a 39-18 lead. The Matadors rattled the Bobcats with
no-look passes, quick cuts to the basket and smooth inside moves.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State looked like it was going to get run out of the
arena. But the Bobcats scored 11 points in the next 2:41 and the
Matadors came out of their motion offense, preferring to go
one-on-one and passing about once a possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors regrouped to take a 47-33 lead at halftime. They
had no idea what they were in for in the next seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a totally different Bobcats team. Nate Holmstadt and
Danny Sprinkle, MSU's two top scorers, keyed a 19-9 run to start
the half. The Bobcats finally caught the Matadors with 12:45 left,
tying the score 61-61 on Rufus Nicholson's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Portland State 80, Eastern Washington 74: Brian Towne had 25
points and Jason Hartman (Thousand Oaks) had 23 as the third-seeded
Pilots held off the sixth-seeded Eagles in Thursday night's other
first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   Portland State (17-10) will play second-seeded Northern Arizona
(20-7) tonight in the semifinals. The Pilots were pushed to the
brink by upset-minded EWU (10-17).
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles took a 67-64 lead with 4:48 left, but the Pilots
responded with 7-2 run over the next three minutes. Shannon Taylor
had 24 points to lead Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman made a huge 3-pointer that gave the Pilots a 75-71 lead
with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really connected on the screen,'' Hartman said. ``We kept
screening and I got wide open.''

KINGS' PLAYOFF HOPES GROW DIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Barring some miracle of modern science,
whereby a means of breathing immediate life into moribund teams can
be discovered and implemented, the Los Angeles Kings' realistic
hopes of rising in the final quarter of the NHL season to seize a
playoff berth died Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   For if a team supposedly desperate to preserve its season can
lose to an expansion team in the first game of a crucial seven-game
home stand, then how much genuine hope is there?
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell 4-3 to the Nashville Predators in a game they
absolutely had to win before a Forum crowd of 9,686.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that crowd booed the Kings until they got power-play
goals in the third period from defenseman Garry Galley and winger
Craig Johnson. But the Kings' uninspired play in the first two
periods had created a hole too deep to climb out of.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second loss to Nashville in as many visits by the
Predators, meaning that with the Kings moving into the Staples
Center next season, Nashville will go into the books as the only
NHL team never to lose at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Kings (23-35-5) failed to gain ground in
the playoff race. They remain seven points behind San Jose with 19
games remaining. To put this in perspective, if the Sharks play
.500 hockey the rest of the season, the Kings would have to post a
13-6 record the rest of the way to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps instead of worrying about the Sharks, though, the Kings
should direct their concern at the Predators (22-34-6), whom they
lead by one point in the standings. But then, holding off an
expansion team could be tough for a Kings' team getting virtually
no offensive production from its forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville grabbed a 3-0 lead on a first-period goal by former
King John Slaney and two in the second period by Sebastien
Bordeleau, the first of which was a shorthanded score on a shot
from the right faceoff circle that deflected into the net off the
left leg of Kings defenseman Steve Duchesne.
</P>
<P>
   It was an accident, but it seemed to symbolize a season gone bad
both for Duchesne and for the Kings, who were guided on this night
by assistant coaches Jay Leach and Rick Green because Coach Larry
Robinson is in Ontario for the funeral of his mother, who died this
week at 78.
</P>
<P>
   While the Predators were busy building their lead, the Kings
were applying virtually no pressure on the Nashville net, in marked
contrast to the night before, when they'd fired 34 shots at the
Mighty Ducks' net but fell 2-1 because of an outstanding
performance by goalie Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Kings didn't get on the board until 11:27 of
the second period, when Donald Audette redirected a pass from Olli
Jokinen past Nashville goalie Mike Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the second goal for the Kings in the previous 189
minutes, 2 seconds. Audette to that point was the only Kings
forward to score a goal in the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   And what great inspiration did Audette's goal provide?
</P>
<P>
   None. Fifty-five seconds after Audette's goal, Slaney carried
the puck into the Kings' zone and the puck to Patric Kjellberg,
wide open to the right of goalie Jamie Storr for an easy tap-in.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, the Kings undertook their belated comeback,
drawing to within two at 6:45 when Galley scored on a power play
off a cross-ice feed from Audette.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, on another power play, Johnson poked in the
rebound of a Duchesne shot, and the Kings were within one goal, as
close as they would get.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Northern Arizona's women's basketball team is led
by All-Big Sky Conference selections RaeAnn West and Jess LeBlanc
at forward.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was guard Kristi Forman and forward Liz Metsers coming
through Thursday night. Forman scored a career-high 19 points and
Metsers came off the bench and scored all of her season-high 14
points in the second half to lead the No. 6-seeded Lumberjacks to a
68-56 upset of No. 3 Montana State in the first round of the Big
Sky tournament at the Cal State Northridge campus.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second straight time a No. 6 beat a No. 3 in the
tournament, and it earned the Lumberjacks (14-13) a semifinal
matchup tonight with host and top-seeded Cal State Northridge at
approximately 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Forman scored 14 points in the first half, but it was Metsers'
second-half spark that helped the Lumberjacks build on their 32-25
halftime lead and win their fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   NAU didn't make a field goal for the first 8{ minutes. Then
Metsers hit a 3-pointer, an 18-footer and another 3-pointer to lead
a 13-6 surge for a 56-45 lead. Montana State (17-10) never got
closer than seven points after that.
</P>
<P>
   West added 12 points and a career-best 12 rebounds, and LeBlanc
added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State got 17 points from conference MVP Tennyson Ballek,
but she was limited to 27 minutes because of foul trouble. Jamie
Spring added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   __ Montana 62, Weber State 46: Linda Weyler, the conference's
leading scorer, scored 21 points and Linda Cummings added 16 points
as the fifth-seeded Lady Griz (12-15) beat the No. 4 Wildcats
(11-16). Montana next plays No. 2 Portland State today at 5 p.m.

THE BIG WOO: M'S FORGE TIES WITH JAPANESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Normally when worlds collide, bad science
fiction movies are created.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was different. When Japanese theater banged up against
American country music, much excitement was had by all, and neither
deaths nor bad taste were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks played three innings of left field for the San
Diego Padres. Ichiro Suzuki played 5{ innings of right field for
the Seattle Mariners. There was no particular winner, although both
managed to get on base, thrilling millions on either side of the
pond.
</P>
<P>
   What can be concluded from the spring's first game is that if
the Padres are counting on chubby 37-year-old country singers for
bench depth, they are much further removed from the 1998 National
League pennant than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, on the other hand, might be on to something with
Suzuki. It might be years away. But so is the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the name ``Seattle Mariners'' was splashed all over
Japan, thanks to six TV networks and 99 credentialed media
personnel on hand to chronicle the first Japanese position player
to take part in a major league game, albeit a no-counter.
</P>
<P>
   This is big drama in the Far East, where Suzuki, the Japanese
Griffey, will cause Friday's game in Mesa against the Chicago Cubs
and Sammy Sosa to be broadcast live nationally back home at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is more substantive than the one with the
ghee-tar twanger, especially in Seattle. As the game's first
batter, Suzuki, a five-time Japanese batting champion, reached base
and scored without benefit of a hit _ a feat believed to be
unperformed in Mariner duds since Vince Coleman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard on a third-base error, he stole second, advanced to third
on another error and scored on Griffey's double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good-looking athlete,'' said Mariner manager Lou
Piniella. ``He got on base twice, scored a couple of runs and would
have thrown a guy out at third base if the ball hadn't hit the
runner in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell he's a pro by the way he goes about his business.
He wasn't nervous. He was having fun and enjoying himself with
Junior and Alex (Rodriguez).''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning Monday to his Japanese team, the Orix Blue
Wave, Suzuki will have three more Mariner exhibitions to show he
can hit American fastballs and advance a dream _ playing in the
bigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's No. 1 in Japan, but he says he wants to play here very
much,'' said Maki Fukuoka, who has no connection to baseball or
Suzuki other than hero worship. She is one of the numerous tourists
in the Valley of the Sun who vaulted the Pacific just to watch him
and two pitchers, Nobuyuki Hoshino and Nobuyuki Ebisu, experience
an American spring training.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Mac Suzuki, in his sixth season as a Mariner
farmhand, who pitched Thursday's `B' game. Fukuoka was a junior
high classmate of the pitching Suzuki (no relation to Ichiro) in
Kobe. The 24-year-old cook was delighted to learn this week that he
remembered her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not the same _ so warm-hearted now,'' she said,
giggling. ``He is in his face, so ... how you say _ handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's a lot of good-looking things going on between
Japan and the Mariners. The Japanese Nintendo ownership has been
the obvious starting point for what club honchos hope will be a
fruitful relationship not unlike what the older Eastern clubs enjoy
with Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   With a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese consider their baseball close to parity with the
U.S.,'' said Mariner president Chuck Armstrong. ``They don't want
to create a farm system for us. They want to be distinguished from
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no one wants a repeat of the Hideki Irabu episode, which
was an embarrassment for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's refusal to be signed by the Padres, who owned his
American rights, caused a stink between the baseball empires that
jeopardized the slow build in relations. Rules are now in place to
preclude anything that looks like piracy.
</P>
<P>
   That's why no club employee says anything about a Suzuki future
with the Mariners. They call his presence here a visit, nothing
more. And since he will not become a free agent until after the
2001 season, nothing can be imminent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Suzuki will be only 28 by then. So this week's investment
in the ``visit'' might yet pay off well, especially with Griffey
and Rodriguez doing the recruiting instead of Rick Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   The laughs and the teasing among them have been frequent,
despite the language limitations.
</P>
<P>
   As he swings, Suzuki emits a martial arts-style grunt. Asked
whether he shouldn't emulate the slender Suzuki, Griffey smiled and
shook his head no.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got no booty,'' said Griffey, slapping his own bountiful
backyard. ``Got to get the push from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Suzuki commences a buildup to hasten his return to
America remains to be seen. What is likely is that the Mariners,
whether his hitting style requires glutes or grunts, would be ready
and willing.
</P>
<P>
   They've waited this long to fill left field and the leadoff
spots. What's three more years?

10 YEARS AFTER: GRIFFEY FOREVER ALTERED MARINER LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Ken Griffey Jr. and ``Field of Dreams''
premiered 10 springs ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffey walked the 90 feet to first base one day that
spring, he might as well have been striding in from the cornfields.
A legend was coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   The moment that turned the Mariners' greatest player from
prospect to big leaguer has faded from most memories. No outfield
walls were scaled. No mass of bodies elbowed and shoved in
upper-deck bleachers for a souvenir ball. It will not be mentioned
on his Hall of Fame plaque.
</P>
<P>
   But it excites Jim Lefebvre still.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre, now the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, was
the M's new manager in 1989. Griffey was a 19-year-old non-roster
invitee who had played only 17 games above A-ball. But as the end
of camp neared, The Kid was still there. The team had to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're over in Tempe, playing against the Chicago Cubs, and
Rick Sutcliffe's the pitcher,'' Lefebvre said. ``It's the bottom of
the first, and Junior comes up and he works the count to 3-and-2.
And then I remember, it was like seven pitches _ he fouled it off,
fouled it off, fouled it off. I mean, Rick was throwing a cutter,
sinking it, everything. Foul balls. It wound up at the eighth pitch
of a 3-2 count, the ball's just off the plate and he threw the bat
down and walked to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `He's ready.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners drafted Griffey with the first pick in the 1987
draft, then watched as he passed every test they gave him. He
started at Bellingham, a short-season Class A team, and hit .313.
At advanced Class A San Bernardino in 1988, Griffey's number was
retired by the All-Star break and he finished one level higher.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of '89, Mariners officials were reaching a
consensus: Griffey needed no more seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind to take the negative approach on purpose,''
said Woody Woodward, the M's vice president, baseball operations.
``Every time it came up, I was always thinking, who else do we
have? But I'd heard enough people say he was ready right now that I
knew there was something there.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had been at big league camp the year before, going
2-for-4 over seven exhibition games. He reported to Tempe in 1989
expecting much of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it'd be like the first one,'' he said. ``Play a
little bit in the seventh, eighth and ninth after the veterans left
the games. When the team was ready to go north, they'd send me
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But 1989 was different. Griffey had experienced a full, though
injury-interrupted, minor-league season, and the Mariners had a job
available. Mickey Brantley, Greg Briley, Jay Buhner, Henry Cotto
and Jeffrey Leonard were the top outfielders on the roster, and
with a manager and GM entering their first full seasons and the
team coming off a last-place year, a teenager in center field
wasn't a crazy idea.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey scorched Cactus League pitching, with 21 hits in his
first 45 at-bats. But that alone didn't tell much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a guy that has a great spring, and they're
supposed to be the second coming of whoever,'' said Roger
Jongewaard, the Mariners' vice president, scouting and player
development. ``I've seen a lot of them, too. But with Kenny, he was
so young and so good and he did it so easily, I don't think anybody
thought he was a flash in the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as opening day drew closer, the Mariners realized
Griffey wasn't just having the best camp on the team. He was the
team's best player. As pessimistic as Woodward tried to be,
Griffey's talent overwhelmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the numbers, but I remember they were good
enough to where you said, `How could he not make it?''' Woodward
said. ``How could you tell him he couldn't make it? If we had left
him off, it would have sent the wrong message to the other young
guys in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey ended up with a .359 average, and led the M's with 33
hits, 19 runs and 21 runs batted in. (He actually made more errors
than he hit home runs, 5-2.)
</P>
<P>
   But the team's decision was based on more than talent. Except
for his problems sliding _ ``It wasn't a slide, it was more of a
fall,'' Woodward said _ Griffey obviously had major-league skills.
The Mariners needed to know he could handle the rest: slumps,
clubhouse teasing, media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, they knew Griffey was their franchise player and
that his debut would be momentous. With Ken Sr. playing for the
Cincinnati Reds, Griffey's promotion would cause a baseball first:
father and son in the majors at the same time. The Mariners had to
be certain Griffey would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that easy,'' Lefebvre said, ``because the thing I
did not want to do was to bring him to camp and then, if we started
the season with him, have to send him back. This kid had never
failed in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   From spending time with his father growing up, Griffey had
intimate knowledge of the mental side of baseball. His judgments on
the field and nonchalance off it stood out to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability was incredible, but the thing that was most
impressive to me was he knew the game,'' said former Mariners
second baseman Harold Reynolds. ``He always knew situations. The
telltale signs are the adjustments guys make, and if he made a
mistake one at-bat, the next at-bat he'd get a base hit or at least
make solid contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotto, now a Mariners minor-league coach, was impressed with
Griffey's positioning in the outfield. Griffey would scan an
opposing lineup, find out how to play each hitter, then adjust
accordingly, always letting Cotto know when he was moving.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that's how Griffey's experience helped. He used to shag
flies with Cotto when Griffey Sr. and Cotto played for the New York
Yankees. Veteran moves in spring training were only natural. As
Griffey told Lefebvre one day at the batting cage, 1989 was
actually his 12th spring training, not his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always playing with people older than me, all the way
from Little League, because I played better than my age group,''
Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 19, it was time to be moved up one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Lefebvre told Griffey he'd made the team after that Cubs game
late in camp. A few days later, on April Fool's Day in Las Vegas,
veteran Mariners coaxed Lefebvre into telling Griffey he was
heading to Class AAA after all, the result of a trade for a veteran
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey came out of the meeting ashen-faced, looking as if he
was going to cry. Lefebvre, Cotto and Griffey said some veterans
resented Griffey's presence, and the hurt from that prank seems to
linger today. ``How would you feel?'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, of course, Griffey would be in the Kingdome,
homering on the first pitch he saw, adding 15 more that season and
hundreds of others since. Gold Gloves, All-Star Games, division
titles, an MVP, a new ballpark and more would follow.
</P>
<P>
   That spring had been only the trailer. All the summers since
have been the feature presentation.

UW PENALIZES ITSELF FOR NEUHEISEL VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ University of Washington football coach Rick Neuheisel
will have an official reprimand placed in his file and will be
forced to give up two-thirds of his permissible off-campus
recruiting visits next year as part of the university's
self-imposed penalties for several recruiting violations reported
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The UW also will give up six of its permitted 56 on-campus
visits where recruits meet coaches and tour the school and athletic
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, five assistant coaches who contacted potential
recruits during an official NCAA ``quiet period'' will be withheld
from four weeks of off-campus recruiting activities during the
1999-2000 recruiting period, and will be limited to 10 of the 20
allowable evaluation days next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page report that will be sent to the Pacific 10
Conference's Governance and Enforcement Committee, UW athletic
officials admit three main violations stemming from Neuheisel's
contact with recruits since being hired from the University of
Colorado in January.
</P>
<P>
   The violations are:
</P>
<P>
   -- Neuheisel shot baskets with prospective recruit Domynic Shaw
during his 48-hour official visit, a violation of an NCAA bylaw
that states that an institution ``shall not conduct ... any
physical activity at which one or more prospects reveal,
demonstrate or display their athletic abilities in any sport.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Neuheisel called nine Colorado football players after he left
to take the UW job, violating a bylaw that states a coach ``shall
not make contact with the student-athlete of another four-year
collegiate institution ... without obtaining the written
permission'' from the other school's athletic director. No
permission was sought by Neuheisel, who contends he never discussed
transferring to Washington with any of the players except one. That
student, Taylor Barton, initiated the phone conversation and first
raised the issue of transferring, according to the UW report.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its self-imposed penalties, the UW has agreed not to
allow any player to transfer from Colorado if that player was
enrolled as of Jan. 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- On Jan. 31, five UW assistants (Keith Gilbertson, Randy Hart,
Bob Hauck, Tim Hundley and Wayne Moses) contacted eight recruits
off-campus on the Sunday before the initial National Letter of
Intent signing date. The day was designated as a ``quiet period,''
one in which no contact with recruits is allowed. The UW learned of
the violation on Feb. 1 after a high school coach called Neuheisel
and ``informed him that another (college) was upset with Neuheisel
for recruiting impermissibly the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was hired to replace fired coach Jim Lambright on Jan.
10.
</P>
<P>
   UW faculty representative Rob Aronson, chairman of the Pac-10
compliance committee and the lead investigator for the UW on the
violations, found that most of the violations ``were unintentional
and did not constitute a recruiting advantage.'' However, he said
that the UW must take ``meaningful measures to ensure that these
don't happen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those measures include developing a recruiting calendar
that indicates quiet and dead periods, and checking with travel
coordinators on a regular basis to determine if travel arrangements
comply with university and NCAA rules. In addition to Neuheisel's
reprimand, the five assistants who violated the quiet period rule
also will receive similar letters in their personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   In determining what penalties to impose on their own program,
Aronson and athletic director Barbara Hedges reviewed how other
schools were punished for similar violations. Aronson said he found
60 to 70 similar violations of the quiet-period rule by other
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures we've taken have been stronger than in any of the
similar cases we've found,'' Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pac-10 spokesman Jim Muldoon said the conference tries
to avoid comparing infractions when considering how to approach
individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably no rule in the book that hasn't been violated
at some point,'' Muldoon said. ``But we're always reluctant to
compare cases because they are all singular and stand alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel called the measures more than a slap on the wrist and
said they would be a setback to recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role as the leader of the program is to say, `Yes we took
our medicine.' But we're not giving up,'' Neuheisel said. ``We are
confident we can put forward the effort to overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped the report, which will be reviewed by Pac-10 officials
in May, will put an end to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did break a quiet-period rule and we have sanctioned
ourselves accordingly,'' Neuheisel said. ``... We want to be a
flagship school and we'll find a way to overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Neuheisel also said he could ``look at himself in the
mirror and know I didn't do anything intentionally wrong. I know I
can convey that to future recruits. My work ethic will not
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Muldoon said the Pac-10's Compliance Committee should have its
review of the case completed by the end of May, and it will then
issue a report to be forwarded to the Pac-10 council June 16-18 at
its annual meeting in Reno. Once the Pac-10 completes its review, a
hearing might be called, and the entire case would have to be
forwarded to the NCAA, which can add penalties of its own or accept
the ones already in place.
</P>
<P>
   Although she knows the procedure has just begun, Hedges believes
the UW's reaction to the violations will restore the department's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation and a responsibility to protect the
integrity of the University of Washington as well as the athletic
program, and we did that by conducting a very thorough
investigation,'' Hedges said. ``We also did that by accepting full
responsibility for what has occurred.''

SUNS RUN AWAY FROM SONICS IN SECOND HALF 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-SONICS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Every loss or close call the Sonics endure seems to
flush out an on-court deficiency that needs smoothing out.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thursday night's 101-93 loss to the Phoenix Suns threw
a different wrinkle at coach Paul Westphal. His on-going experiment
with the Sonics' struggling offense is starting to create rough
edges in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Detlef Schrempf expressed displeasure about being moved
from the starting lineup to the bench after the Sonics lost for
just the second time in nine games at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said the shift would give the team more offensive
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf called coming off the bench a demotion. When asked if
he liked the switch, Schrempf delivered a terse response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. Absolutely not,'' said Schrempf, who played off the
bench for the first time in his Sonic career. ``I've been starting
for seven years. It's something I've worked for for a long time. To
not have it anymore is like being demoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Schrempf carried the load on a night when
Gary Payton was off.
</P>
<P>
   Payton suffered through 3 of 16 shooting and finished with nine
points and 11 assists. Schrempf, though, scored a season-high 22
points in 38 minutes. He made 8 of 15 field goals and grabbed 13
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics again executed poorly and sputtered offensively,
hitting just 43 percent of their shots. The Suns, meanwhile, shot
51 percent and snapped a two-game losing streak. The Sonics also
did not have an answer for Suns guard Rex Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman finished with 23 points, which included four critical
3-pointers. His last put the Suns ahead 94-85 with less than three
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite outrebounding the Suns, 48-31, the Sonics' defense
allowed wide-open shots most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost it with effort,'' Westphal said, who added that his
new lineup is ``good for us. We got off to a great start. I didn't
think that hurt us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal used Billy Owens in place of Schrempf at small forward.
He also re-inserted Hersey Hawkins into the starting lineup at
shooting guard. Hawkins, whose streak of 461 consecutive starts
ended Feb. 5, appeared uncomfortable as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he will continue to play Schrempf off the bench.
Schrempf was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1991 and 1992
while with the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that's one of the most important positions on
the team. Rather than have two similar players _ shooters who play
the two spot _ Hawk and Dale (Ellis) coming off the bench, I
thought I'd like to have a bigger player come off as well as a
shooter,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf wasn't sure if his 39-percent shooting before Thursday
night's game had anything to do with Westphal's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm the only one struggling with my shooting,''
Schrempf said. ``I've put in the effort to work that out. At the
same time, I'm not getting as many shots as I used to. I'm not
complaining about my role. I understand I'm more of a distributor
now. That was fine with me as long as we're winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But offensively, we don't look good. We struggle. We make
plays once in a awhile, but it's not smooth out there. We don't
have a Jason Kidd who can break everyone down and find the open
guy. For us, it's a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting 42 percent, the Sonics led 50-47 at halftime.
However, Phoenix dominated the third quarter. The Suns outscored
the Sonics 13-9 at the start of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics relinquished their lead and fell behind, 60-59, when
Tom Gugliotta scored an uncontested layup. Phoenix outscored the
Sonics 28-19 in the third and took a 75-69 advantage into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' biggest deficit was 87-75 with 6:15 to play. They
finally made a surge when they began to exploit a mismatch with
Owens. Phoenix tried to defend the 6-foot-9 Owens with the 6-4
Kidd. Owens eventually scored two straight baskets under the rim
and got the Sonics within 87-80 with 4:44 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ellis' back-to-back 3-pointers got the Sonics within
94-91 with 1:23 remaining. But Kidd fed Gugliotta, who buried an
open 17-footer, and the Sonics turned the ball over three times in
the final minute.

PIT BULL OWNERS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF PETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA WEISS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blamed for a series of vicious attacks on people
in recent weeks, pit bulls found a champion Thursday: their owners.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 pit bull owners and lovers of the breed rallied on the
front lawn of an Encino home to try to counter negative publicity
generated by a series of attacks in Granada Hills and the fatal
mauling of a child in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad dogs, it's uneducated owners. We need to change
that,'' said Cinimon Clark, a dog trainer and veterinary technician
who works with Agua Dulce-based Villalobos Pit Bull Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dogs need to be neutered. ... They need to be loved and
treated as a living creature and not thrown in the back yard and
ignored because that's what breeds aggression, frustration and
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that in her six years as a veterinary technician, she
has never been attacked by a pit bull. ``But I've been bitten by
some pretty nasty Chihuahuas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Clark said her rescue group has been ``flooded
with dogs'' left by owners who no longer want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are dropping off puppies (and) dogs they've had for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Simone Patterson brought along her dog, the muscular but
honey-eyed Brad, which she walks twice a day and takes to agility
training classes as an outlet for some of his excess energy. In
return, she said, she's got a loyal, gentle companion who can
withstand bats on the head by the family's cat.
</P>
<P>
   But she said passers-by let her know they disapprove when she
takes the loyal if over-energetic companion for walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discrimination is so distressing,'' she said. ``People
yell at us, You people shouldn't have those dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent incidents have led to many of the dogs being
taken to city shelters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all that many of them can be put up for adoption,'' said
Lt. Richard Felosky, district manager for the city Animal Services
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the dogs show that they are overly aggressive or
dangerous and have to be euthanized.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his staff tries to warn people adopting pit bulls of the
responsibility they're assuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give them information on the type of animal that they
want to adopt,'' he said, ``what will happen if they don't
socialize them with other animals or family members, what will
happen if they don't train it. But it's often just so many words.
They just take the dog home anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The breed is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, which
licenses dog breeders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit bull is almost an underground breed,'' said Gini
Barrett of the American Humane Association. A variation of the
Staffordshire bull terrier, pit bulls don't have a long history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1984, you couldn't find a pit bull in L.A.,'' Barrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, pit bulls and pit bull mixes account for 40 percent to 50
percent of the city's shelter population, said Jackie David of
Animal Services.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett attributes the population explosion to a reaction to a
1980s crime wave. ``Out of fear, people got bigger, more
fearsome-looking dogs,'' she said. ``But part of that crime wave
was illegal dog fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the dogs do not bite more frequently, but their
bites are more severe because the animals have such strong jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Both Felosky and Barrett stressed that owners should neuter
their dogs, train them and keep them appropriately confined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a pit bull or any large, strong breed of dog is a
special responsibility,'' Barrett said. ``Not everyone should have
them.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;

 ECONOMIC UNION, IMMIGRATION BLUR EUROPE'S NATIONAL IDENTITIES  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At the Gare du Nord, the sprawling rail station that
looms over metropolitan Paris one mile from the River Seine, the
revolution ushered in by the European Union boards the world's
fastest train.
</P>
<P>
   Sleek and luxurious, the ``Thalys'' express rockets into the
countryside at nearly 200 mph, reaching the EU headquarters city of
Brussels in 85 minutes. The fare is priced in euros, the
continent's new single currency. There are no passport checks at
the Belgian border, nor onward at the frontiers of Holland and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   This is the New Europe as the EU's founders envisioned it two
generations ago: a union of affluent, borderless neighbors, joined
by economic and social ties that have made war between its member
states all but inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   But within two blocks of the Gare du Nord, another New Europe is
also bursting into existence as the century ends _ a Europe of
undocumented Third World immigrants, for whom violence and poverty
are the central realities of life and the wealthy EU's open borders
an irresistible magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of displaced Africans and Asians have poured into the
EU since civil wars exploded in their homelands in the 1980s and
1990s, along with waves of Arabs who have arrived in such vast
numbers that Islam is now the second religion of France and a major
presence in Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their stark contrasts, these two worlds are inextricably
linked as the century ends. Together, they are rewriting history
from the Mediterranean to the Baltic, shaping a Europe in 1999 that
could hardly be more different from what it was in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have been so swift, and so sweeping, that they have
left many governments and their constituents in dire confusion.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, France has been one of the chief engines of
European integration. The EU's very origins lie in the postwar
inspiration of two Frenchmen, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet. But
at century's end, every step toward the New Europe is accompanied
by bouts of official anxiety in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``France cannot live without having its own identity,'' Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said in February. ``The people of France
cannot live as a people whose destiny will be forged among
others.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the aim of the European Union, which has been
embraced as the only viable road to the future by every French
government, right and left, since the EU's birth in 1957 as the
European Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
   On matters related to immigration, French nerves seem close to
the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has seen bewildering shifts in official immigration policy
in recent years, as each new government _ France has had six prime
ministers since 1990 _ tries to grapple with the flood of
newcomers. Torn between rising political pressure to enforce
immigration laws and their country's proud history as a sanctuary
for the oppressed, French leaders have struggled to find a
``humane'' way to meet the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottom line is what the French call the ``zero
option.'' In principle, that policy has authorized no new
immigration at all since 1974, and it is echoed across the
continent. ``We are not America. We are not a country of
immigration,'' a spokesman for Germany's Christian Democratic Union
flatly declares.
</P>
<P>
   The facts say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-born residents constitute more than 12 percent of
Germany's 82 million people in 1999 _ compared with less than 10
percent of those who live in the United States. In France, the
figure is 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the roots of the zero option do not lie in detached
measurements of demographic reality. They are grounded in the
emotional attitudes of voters who fear change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 60 percent of respondents to a poll conducted by the
liberal French daily Le Monde said, ``There are too many Arabs in
France.'' A European-wide study released last July found that 48
percent of the French describe themselves as ``racist'' or ``fairly
racist.'' In Belgium, the study reported, 55 percent of respondents
consider themselves racist, as do more than 30 percent of those in
Denmark, Austria, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   They are the shock troops of a fierce neo-nationalist response,
to immigration and European unification alike, that is gathering
steam on this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Barely half of Germans surveyed in mid-1998 agreed that their
sturdy mark should be replaced by the euro. If the move to a single
currency were to be decided by a public referendum, say pollsters,
the euro would be rejected in 12 of the 15 EU nations.
</P>
<P>
   Economic integration has brought unprecedented affluence to
average Europeans. With an integrated market of 375 million
consumers, and a collective per capita GDP in excess of $20,000 per
year, the union is the largest highly developed economy on Earth,
dwarfing its rivals in the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The future of that achievement rests on an elementary link
between immigration and the EU's continued development.
</P>
<P>
   To remain wealthy, say economists, the union must either boost
its fertility rate dramatically _ most EU countries have declining
native populations in 1999 _ or welcome newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   One authoritative study predicts that from 16 million to 20
million additional young foreigners will settle in France alone by
the year 2050. Without their introduction to the workforce,
according to demographers, the aging ethnic French population will
be unable to finance its own retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite soaring wealth and leisure, the changes wrought by
the two New Europes have left the old Europe feeling measurably
insecure. Half of those surveyed in a 1998 French government poll
said they ``no longer felt at home in their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Europeans in 1900 knew who they were. What it meant to be French
or German was clear, solid, precise. There was no such thing as a
trans-European identity then, much less the kind of demographic and
cultural upheaval that has brought millions of Muslims to France
and Germany since the EU was founded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the identity of Europe is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   In Corbeil-Essonnes, a bedroom suburb 20 miles south of Paris,
the struggle to define 21st century Europe is written into the map.
</P>
<P>
   One end of town is a tree-lined village of single-family
bungalows, San Mateo County transplanted to the Ile de France. The
other end is a cluster of 15-story towers, an immense government
housing project with more than 12,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   When the project opened in the 1960s, it was a notable landmark
in the cordon rouge _ the ``red belt'' of working-class Paris
suburbs that made the French Communist Party a major political
force for decades. The sole reminders of that era today are faded
murals featuring Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh and Vladimir I. Lenin on
Corbeil walls.
</P>
<P>
   The white working class has moved into the bungalows, and votes
mostly for the right-wing extremist National Front.
</P>
<P>
   The highrise towers are now populated chiefly by families from
Mali, Togo, Senegal and Algeria, with a sprinkling of Kurds,
Romanians and West Indians. Their world view is a mirror image of
the confusions spawned by European unification and mass demographic
change among those who are French, German or Italian by blood.
</P>
<P>
   Hatouma Doucoure, 23, supervises the housing project recreation
center _ a workroom outfitted with drawing tables, and a small
billiards hall. Four young African men are playing billiards when a
reporter arrives. In the workrooms, there are only young women,
assembling collages of magazine images for a community art
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans are very traditional,'' Doucoure, says. ``They don't
approve of boys and girls mixing before marriage. They're nervous
about a lot of things French people take for granted. That can make
relations with the society around them pretty tough.`'
</P>
<P>
   The root problem, says Fatouma Gassama, 19, whose parents
emigrated to France from Mali, ``is that I can't change who I am _
I can't change my Africanness. But if you ask me if I am Malienne,
what can I tell you? I was born in France. I've never set foot in
Mali.''
</P>
<P>
   Doucoure, who is also of Malienne ancestry, visited her
grandparents in their native village once, when she was 17. ``I was
like a tourist,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, I was a French girl. They can't hear my African
accent the way French people do. They can't stand in front of the
Eiffel Tower on a school trip and wonder if such things will ever
have the same meaning for me that they seem to have for French
kids,'' says Doucoure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me,'' says Kemal, 17, who was born in Paris to an
Algerian father and a French Jewish mother. ``I'm no European, and
I'll never be taken for one.''
</P>
<P>
   With his dark, kinky hair and olive complexion, Kemal is
certainly not regarded as European by the police who haunt rail
stations that connect the center of Paris with working-class
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   On an informal survey of their efforts at the Gare du Nord in
mid-January, a Chronicle reporter saw 45 young men and women
stopped and asked for their papers in two hours. Without exception,
they were visibly Arab or black. ``There hasn't been a single week
since 1995 that I haven't been harassed by the cops,'' says Kemal.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year a series of bombings in Paris was blamed by
the authorities _ citing evidence that has never been made public _
on a ``piste islamique,'' an Islamic trail leading to terrorist
groups in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Police harassment, like neo-nationalist political campaigns, has
heightened the crisis of identity among the immigrant young.
</P>
<P>
   Kemal now refuses to have anything to do with his European
mother. He has cultivated a sparse beard in imitation of Muslim
firebrands at his neighborhood mosque, just as many young Arab
women in his school defiantly wear the Islamic veil to classes _ an
act that is tantamount to illegal in the rigorously secular French
educational system.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, immigrants and their children are told they must find
a way to become Italian, French or German, whatever their ancestry,
race or creed. Most EU governments bluntly reject U.S.-style
multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a redefinition of France as an assimilationist society,
prepared to welcome individuals who accept her fundamental values,
will permit a relaxation of the climate and a resumption of
immigration,'' says Robert Sole, a prominent French sociologist and
government adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Yet numbers demonstrate, overwhelmingly, that assimilation has
not worked. For not only has the New Europe's non-European
population drifted more and more into the shadows of civil society,
it has also made next to no dent in the political structures that
might reverse the catastrophic trends now under way.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 36,000 towns and cities in France with
elected governments in 1999. Exactly one of them, a tiny village in
Brittany, has a nonwhite or foreign-born mayor.

U.S. ACCUSES WAL-MART OF DISABILITY BIAS  &HT;     BY LYNDA GLEDHILL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
filed suit against Wal-Mart Thursday, charging the country's
largest retailer with discriminating against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento accuses the
company of violating the American with Disabilities Act by using a
pre-employment questionnaire that asks questions about an
applicant's disabilities. The suit also charges Wal-Mart of a
specific case of discrimination against an employee at the
distribution center in Red Bluff, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-employment questionnaire, called a Matrix, asked an
applicant to indicate if he or she might need an accommodation to
perform any of the duties required in the positions.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC believes under the American with Disabilities Act it is
unlawful to ask about disability before a job offer is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be OK if it had been asked after there had
been a conditional offer of employment,'' said EEOC senior trial
attorney David T. Kelley. ``But the whole purpose of the ADA is to
prevent people who are disabled from being discriminated against
during the hiring process.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart officials in Arkansas could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said Wal-Mart has said in previous litigation that it had
discontinued using the Matrix form in 1996. However, the EEOC
investigation found the form being used in stores in California and
Arizona as recently as last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the specific case, the company was accused of firing Steve
Sanders from his job in a distribution center in Red Bluff because
he is hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   In his position, Sanders was required to use a scanning gun that
would beep when a package had been shipped. According to the EEOC,
Sanders informed his supervisors that he could not always hear the
beep. However, he was terminated after seven months for failing to
meet performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wal-Mart refused to move Sanders to another
position, despite his willingness to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EEOC is committed to protecting the rights of employees
such as Steve Sanders,'' said Susan McDuffie, EEOC San Francisco
District Supervisor. ``Qualified individuals with disabilities are
protected under the law. We believe Wal-Mart's treatment of Mr.
Sanders and its pre-employment Matrix inquiry clearly violate the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the distribution center in Red Bluff, Leroy Croy,
said he was there when Sanders was an employee but does not
remember the name. He said the facility does use a Matrix form, but
that it does not ask applicants to identify their limitation. He
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC is seeking compensation for Sanders and anyone else who
was discriminated against by Wal-Mart's use of the Matrix
questionnaire. &LR;

THE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE IS EMPATHY OR BONDAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I stopped by a homeless shelter the other day to see someone I
know. As I waited, I felt rather conspicuous in my suit and tie. In
fact, the friendly man at the information desk asked me if I was a
pastor. I chuckled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as I sat in the lobby waiting to see the man I came to check
on I was struck again by what may be the most difficult of all
human tasks _ empathy. That is, the challenge of really putting
ourselves in the shoes of others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I watched several residents of this shelter come and go while I
waited, and I knew only that each of them had a unique _ and almost
certainly painful _ history. Indeed, some of them bore the wounds
of life on wearied faces that looked out at the world from the
midst of a general dishevelment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But without talking with them in detail, I could not know how
they had ended up there. I had no way to feel what it must be like
to live their lives. They, in turn, had no way to understand me.
All they saw was a middle-aged, graying white guy in a suit. They
probably imagined me as some deputized agent of a system that
controlled their lives, but that's just a guess. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think I've finally lived long enough to be able to say that
our almost universal failure to appreciate either the struggle or
the point of view of others is what gets us into the most trouble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the starkest example, we need look no further than the
recent trial in Jasper, Texas, of John William King, convicted of
murdering James Byrd Jr. Somehow King, a white man, had been unable
to look at Byrd, a black man, and imagine anything of his humanity,
which is to say his unique history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an odd and distorted way, that failure freed King to wrap
chains around Byrd, whom he apparently saw as subhuman, and to drag
him to pieces behind a pickup truck last June. It was a huge,
bloody, disastrous disconnect, and was rooted in either King's
inability or his unwillingness to see the world through the eyes of
Byrd or even to acknowledge that Byrd had every right to see the
world differently from the way King saw it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, when a jury declared King guilty of capital murder, we
saw exactly the sort of grace and empathy that might well have
prevented this evil in the first place. King's father, Ronald King,
telephoned James Byrd Sr., father of the murdered man, to say how
sorry he was that any of this had happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say, `I know how you feel,' even though I'm losing
my son, too,'' the elder King said. ``I don't know how he feels.
All I know is he's got to be hurting like the dickens. We all
are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, having been offered this noble gift, responded in kind:
``I feel real sorry for him, really. I do. You watch your kids grow
up. You teach 'em and they don't do exactly what they've been
taught. I just told him I can't hold him responsible for his
son.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What struck me about this wasn't just that King and Byrd had
connected across racial lines. In the end, racial lines had
precious little to do with this manifest empathy. Rather, each
simply acknowledged the other's basic humanity and affirmed the
legitimacy of the other's experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This represents ancient, though widely ignored, wisdom. Although
Jesus of Nazareth wasn't the first to advocate this, his wording
may be most famous as the Golden Rule in Luke 6:31 (as rendered by
the New Revised Standard Version): ``Do to others as you would have
them do to you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``do'' here should be seen as both action and attitude. This
rule calls us to get into each other's skin, not only working for
the other's highest good but also acknowledging in humility that
the other person is of infinite value. If we fail, we figuratively
_ and sometimes literally _ wrap each other in chains of bondage
and destroy everyone. &QL;

 &HT;    When your children turn from students to teachers
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Youth baseball season is almost upon us, so I
figured it would be a good time to coax my son out of the house.
You know, loosen up the old arm.
</P>
<P>
   As Ernest Lawrence Thayer told us in ``Casey At the Bat,'' hope
springs eternal within the human breast. So every spring I hope
that I can still see the ball well enough to catch it. Every spring
I hope I don't make a fool out of myself trying to help my son play
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I should have been better at the sport. I longed to play it, but
my parents would never let me join an organized team. My mother had
an irrational fear that I would get hit in the head with a bat. It
did not bother her a bit that her little baby should play football
where, not only your head, but all other parts of your body can get
hurt. No, football was fine; baseball, however, she would not
abide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not ignorant about the sport just because I didn't
play. I know, for instance, that it is necessary to say everything
twice in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If a player watches a close pitch that is called a ball you must
say: ``Way to watch. Way to watch.'' You can't just say it once or
it doesn't mean anything. This is the same with all baseball terms:
``Good cut,'' to be said when the batter misses the ball pitifully;
``Get the next one,'' when your team makes and error, and ``Easy
out,'' to be said when a player who is likely to hit the ball to
Mars steps to the plate. This last is a measure of reverse
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I have instilled a measure of my baseball knowledge in
all of my family and it does, believe it or not, include a small
amount of how to actually play the game.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of knowledge only reaches a certain level. About
the time my son was in, say, third grade, he had surpassed my
knowledge of how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've been faking it. Oh, I could still throw harder
than he could, so it wasn't that difficult, really.
</P>
<P>
   Not that difficult until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because for some reason the ol' arm _ mine, that is _ just
wouldn't get limber enough to throw the ball hard and mostly
straight like I once did.
</P>
<P>
   His throws to me were true and crisp. He can make my glove pop
almost every time and hurt my hand if I am not careful enough to
catch the ball in the webbing.
</P>
<P>
   My throws, however, were going high, or to the right, or low and
to the left. To be honest, he caught more of them than I would have
thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, he got tired of jumping and bending over to get
my throws. He tapped himself and said, ``In the chest, Dad. In the
chest.'' As you can see, he has learned the rule of saying
everything twice.
</P>
<P>
   I mumbled something about how I was just testing his fielding
abilities. It sounded silly even to me and I don't think he bought
it. After a while I just acknowledged that my arm didn't feel quite
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, taking an instructional tone that I had
used with him so often, ``I was noticing something about your
throwing. You seem to be coming a little sidearm. Remember to come
right over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. The next thing he'll be telling me is to keep my eye on
the ball or make sure I use two hands when I catch a pop-up.
</P>
<P>
   You know you're getting old when your children stop being your
students and start being your teachers.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to tell me twice.

 &HT;    Climbing the family tree
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ If somebody put me in charge of this
country I'd make a rule that everybody must be raised in a small
rural community, preferably in the South.
</P>
<P>
   I'd do that out of a sense of fairness and compassion. Every
American, male and female, ought to have the opportunity of growing
up like I did in Inman, Ga., a dot on the map of south Fayette
County, between Harp's Crossing and Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   Living in the country is a lot different from living in Atlanta,
or even Hapeville and College Park. Uncle Raymond was stunned when
he had to leave the farm and take a railroad job in Atlanta after
the boll weevil invasion nearly ruined cotton farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it,'' he said when my daddy asked him how
he survived living in a city. ``They cook collards in the back yard
and go to the bathroom in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   One thing you get to do in a small farming community in the
South is tag along when your grandfather goes places like Mr.
Marvin Lamb's general store, where old men sit around a potbellied
stove, spit tobacco juice in a sandbox, drink Co-Colas, talk
politics and cuss.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon listening to the talk about something Roosevelt
and his New Deal crowd had done up in Washington, I picked up the
phrase ``dammit to hell.'' Being a student of the language even at
an early age, I was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I was walking around my grandmother's back
yard, entertaining Ginger, my faithful collie. ``Dammit to hell,
dammit to hell, dammit to hell,'' I kept saying to Ginger. Until my
grandmother heard me. She washed out my mouth with Octagon soap, a
powerful detergent normally reserved for dirty overalls and guano
sacks. That taught me a lesson. I never used Octagon soap again.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you may have noticed about rural Southerners is that
they address everybody as either Aunt, Uncle or Cousin. ``Why do
they do that?'' an immigrant from Up North asked me. ``Everybody
can't be related.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Just about everybody is. Cousin John McLucas and Cousin
S.J. Overstreet, who do genealogical research on the Internet,
turned up 2,500 of our close kinfolk and ancestors, among them Lord
North, the English nobleman who advised King George to go ahead and
slap tea taxes on the Americans. Said it wouldn't cause serious
trouble in the colonies.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if we're really descended from Lord North. Judging
from the caliber of advice he passed out, it sounds like we might
be. Anyway, our North kinfolk are the reason we have North's Bridge
Road and North's Bridge over the Flint River. Otherwise, we
couldn't tell where Clayton County stops and Fayette begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Minters are newcomers to Fayette County. Until the late
1880s Grandpa Minter farmed with his brothers across the river near
Bear Creek, now known as Hampton. I've heard my Clayton County kin
described as ``good gray land farmers,'' a nice accolade only
slightly below ``good red land farmers'' in Fayette County. We
haven't spent a lot of time tracing our family tree, possibly for
fear of what we might find out.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks in North Carolina sent us a letter saying they had
discovered the authentic Minter coat of arms in England and would
be happy to furnish us a copy for $25. My mother was writing the
check when my father intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Minters I've ever known were looking for a coat to go
on their arms,'' he explained. We still don't have a coat of arms,
but I have suggested a family motto: ``Trust, but check.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harp side of the family has been in Fayette County since
Indian times. We get most of our longevity from our Harp genes. We
buried Aunt May a couple of months after her 109th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mozee Harp helped the Rev. Bogan Mask found our
Methodist church in Inman going on to two centuries ago. His
preacher genes obviously rubbed off on Cousin Don Harp, who left
his daddy's truck farm for the cloth and now presides at Peachtree
Road Methodist Church in Atlanta, which is about as high as you can
fly in his business.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Don must have good connections Upstairs. He served
Communion to Deion Sanders before a Falcons game and Deion
intercepted two passes and ran a kickoff back for a touchdown. He
also performed Lewis Grizzard's only marriage that didn't end in
divorce. In fairness, I guess I ought to mention that Lewis died
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin John Harp, who hit me in the head with the blade end of a
gooseneck hoe one afternoon when we were chopping cotton, grew up
to become Potentate of the Shrine empire stretching from
Chattanooga down to Macon, an office tantamount to two or three
seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm proud of my heritage. We haven't produced a governor or
gotten anyone into the Piedmont Driving Club, but then we've never
had anyone in jail or in the Legislature.

   SCIENCE/MEDICINE

   ANOREXIA-PARTONE _ For Caroline Winkler, they went together like
tights and a tutu, the dancing and fasting. It was obvious to her
that the dancing helped keep her thin and her carrot-stick figure
helped her dancing. ``You're told the costumes aren't made to fit
you,'' she says. ``You're made to fit them.'' How was she supposed
to know that her dedication to sleekness would jeopardize her dance
career? She's only 19. How could she be on the brink of
osteoporosis, with less bone density than her grandmother? Now on
medical leave from Dayton Ballet's second company, Winkler sees a
new dream dawning even beyond the formidable task of beating
bulimia and anorexia nervosa after six years. She wants to help
others recover from eating disorders, preferably without the panic
attacks, bald spots, sleepless nights and shriveled bowel that she
has endured. ``I want to go around to high schools and talk,'' she
says, and she's establishing a foundation to help people pay for
the expensive treatment that health plans rarely cover. (Lamb,
Dayton Daily News). 60. WITH PHOTOS.

   ANOREXIA-PARTTWO _ Terrifying panic attacks and increasingly
serious health problems sent Caroline Winkler to the Renfrew Center
in Philadelphia for 17 days of treatment for her anorexia. She also
learned to start coping with the underlying emotional problems that
led her to stop eating. Unfortunately, the disease may also have

   HEALTH-ARTHRITIS _ Two new treatments are a big topic of
conversation for arthritis patients. One of the drugs is Enbrel,
for rheumatoid arthritis, and it's high price is turning heads _
more than $500 for a two-week supply. The other is Celebrex, a
pain-killer whose sales have skyrocketed since approval in January.

   MEN-MARRIAGE _ Wellington Boone, the Atlanta-based preacher who
appears on ``The 700 Club'' and ``Focus on the Family,'' has this
advice for men struggling with their marriage: ``Your wife is not

   RELIGION-EBENEZER _ Ebenezer Baptist Church is on the move _
literally. The church, once the home for Martin Luther King Jr. and
a meeting place for civil rights leaders, is moving to a new
building, and the old sanctuary will become a museum and tourist
stop. We talk with long-time members of the church, civil rights
veterans and Coretta Scott King about Ebenezer's place in history
and its role in the new millennium. (Blake, Atlanta

   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   OLDHOUSE _ Jeff Jones and Michael Boykin couldn't help but
snicker every time a passerby stopped to tell them what a great job
they were doing restoring their Midtown house. ``A lot of people
would come by during construction and say they couldn't remember
how it looked before we renovated it,'' Jones said. That's because
it wasn't there. Jones and Boykin built the Ninth Street bungalow
two years ago from scratch, designing it as one would have looked
in the early 1900s when many in the neighborhood were constructed.
Their eye-fooling success story is all in the details that Jones,
an interior designer, incorporated, from 200-year-old wide-plank
floors and old-framed windows to rustic kitchen cabinet hardware
and even a heating return vent from the period. A former Buckhead
antiques dealer, he may have missed his calling as a Hollywood set
designer: His attention to authenticity extends even to sound,
using nails, for example, instead of screws to install the floor
boards so that they actually creak. ``It's been really fun to trick
people,'' he said. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH
PHOTOS
</P>
<P>
   LEEMAY-COLUMN _ Lately, a bit of disconcerting bamboo news has
been riding down the information superhighway. The Georgia Wildlife
Federation asserted on its Web site that nandina, ``disrupts
natural ecosystems by out-competing native species, drying up
wetlands and strangling native trees.'' These ``invasive exotics
should not be used at all.'' Like any selfish gardener, I read this
and thought it was OK for some plants to be on that list. English
ivy, sure. But nandina? My nandina? Not my beloved reed. (May,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    Lewinsky loving the life away from `normalcy'
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She is the media princess of the moment, complete
with the Barbara Walters beagle-eyes treatment and the Andrew
Morton biography. No matter how many times Monica Lewinsky rolled
her eyes and giggled, ``I'm so embarrassed,'' or wailed, ``How am I
going to have any sense of normalcy in my life?'' Lewinsky is
clearly loving this.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't strike you as a woman in any hurry to return to
normalcy. Except for a few tearful moments, she seemed to glow in
the spotlight, giggling, mugging, positively flirting with the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Love of the spotlight isn't the only thing Lewinsky has in
common with her former ``boyfriend.'' Both exhibit a genial
amorality that could best be summed up: ``It isn't wrong unless you
get caught.'' Nothing matters unless it happens in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lewinsky's tepid apology to Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.
``I am very sorry for what happened,'' she said. But she shed no
tears for anyone but herself and her family. She never said, ``I'm
sorry I had an affair with your husband.'' She suggested, in fact,
that she might do it all over again. ``There are some days I'm
sorry the relationship ever started,'' she said, ``and there are
some days I'm just sorry I ever confided in Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: I'd do it all over again, only next time I wouldn't
be so gabby.
</P>
<P>
   Some apology. Its giddy self-absorption nearly matched Clinton's
``Ken Starr Made Me Do It'' defiance last August. In Monica's
World, apparently, the affair would have been perfectly all right,
so long as Hillary and the world never learned. ``I never thought
she would find out,'' she explained. ``I knew I was never going to
talk about this publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky claimed ``affinity'' with Chelsea (you could almost
feel the first daughter shudder) and ``a sense of rivalry'' with
Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Had she really been sorry, she would never have said any of
those things. She would not have called Clinton her ``sexual
soulmate'' or described the infamous thong escapade as ``a small,
subtle, flirtatious gesture.'' (Try not to imagine what a nonsubtle
gesture would be. A nuclear explosion, perhaps?)
</P>
<P>
   Declining the interview, and the book deal, would have been the
only sincere apology. But that would mean turning away from her
most enduring romance, the craving for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in her narcissism, she bastardizes D-Day as ``Dump
Day.'' She is outraged by Clinton's ``that woman, Ms. Lewinsky''
speech, not because the president lied, but because he didn't lie
flatteringly enough: ``He could have taken a higher road in his
denial. He could have said, `Monica and I are friends; she's a
great woman, and a bright woman. I don't know why she's saying
these things.'''
</P>
<P>
   I watched the program with my friends, their wisecracks the
perfect antidote to the inane prattle and Barbara Walters' lovingly
soft-focus interview technique. Group consensus: Monica was having
a grand old time. ``I wonder if this poor child knows the whole
world is laughing at her,'' said one. ``She doesn't care; she just
likes the notoriety,'' responded another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, she and Clinton were made for each other,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Lewinsky, at least, still has time to grow up, to step
out of the spotlight and learn to look within. To learn that some
things are wrong whether anyone finds out about them or not.
</P>
<P>
   That, in the end, would be the best apology she could make to
all of us.

 &HT;    Frenzy over computer bug motivates some to peddle arms
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In only 10 months, Y2K will cause TEOTWAWKI.
</P>
<P>
   That's the selling point behind a mail-order catalog that just
arrived at my house: The year 2000 computer bug will cause ``the
end of the world as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog suggests laying in freeze-dried food, blankets,
battle dress clothing, fuel and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same stuff any self-respecting militia-survivalist
would have in preparation for the One-World-Government takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Now the same survivalist gear is being sold in anticipation of
worldwide chaos caused by the failure of computer programmers 40
years ago to embed two extra digits in software to enable the
programs to tell the difference between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Y2K survivalists figure it, the sound of popping
champagne corks will soon be followed by the sound of gunfire as
the world plunges into darkness and disorder.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lures of buying into Y2K-induced TEOTWAWKI is that
you get to buy a load of nifty survivalist gear and never have to
pay for the stuff because the world's monetary systems will
collapse Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some Y2K survivalists recommend piling up lots of credit card
charges because all the debt will be erased by the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   All Y2K survivalists have to do is buy sufficient weaponry and
defenses to hold off the marauding bands of starving Y2K skeptics
who failed to heed the warnings of the coming disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why credit card companies and merchants would sell
all this merchandise on credit if the economies of the world were
about to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   But from the point of view of the survivalists, the banks,
credit card companies, merchants and all the other unbelievers are
fools who will pay the price of their foolishness on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Some churches are holding Y2K seminars for their parishioners.
For them, the problems some software programs will have
differentiating between the years 1900 and 2000 are somehow tied in
with biblical prophesies, the second coming and the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   People should have fresh batteries in their cameras for Jan. 1
to get photos of planes falling from the sky, trains running
head-on after being switched onto the wrong tracks, nuclear
missiles being launched hither and yon, angels blowing horns,
mountains crumbling and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is printing extra currency in case there
is a run on the banks. Some people recommend converting paper money
into gold.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology
Problem issued a 163-page report that concluded Americans should
not panic. At the same time, it suggested that U.S. citizens take
the same precautions they would in preparation for a tornado,
flood, hurricane or earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, wait a second. On the one hand, the government tells us not
to worry. On the other hand it tells us prepare the same way we
would for a natural disaster. Which is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you ought to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane,
a storm where you'd like two or three days of . . . water and
canned goods and the like,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.),
who headed the special Senate committee along with Sen. Bob Bennett
(R-Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Some Red Cross chapters have made similar suggestions. Stock up
on some food and water and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Health specialists suggest that Americans lay in a supply of
prescription drugs in case there are disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe anything will happen. But I do think I'll order
the trip-wire-and-flare perimeter safety package along with an
easy-to-install portable composting toilet. I'll charge it.

 &HT;    Building a better bookshelf, part two: Good support is vital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adjustable shelves have to be held up by something and
it's usually something metal. It's possible to use wooden pegs but
I don't recommend it. Actually, I don't recommend any kind of pegs.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to go. You can buy shouldered pegs in metal
or plastic that fit into holes drilled in the uprights, or you can
get metal strips that take proprietary fixtures to hold the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend the latter. First, I think they look a little better
than a lot of empty holes, but that is debatable. The main thing is
that they are far easier to install correctly. Think about it. In
the first method, each hole on one side of an upright has to be
exactly opposite its counterpart on the other side, or the shelf
will wobble.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly wouldn't try for this kind of accuracy just marking
and measuring. You need a jig. You could make one. You can also buy
them, but the ones I've seen are way too expensive for someone who
just wants a few shelves.
</P>
<P>
   With the metal strips, it's quite simple to get proper
alignment. You need two strips per upright. You rout slots just
deep enough to hold the strips flush with the surface. Cut the
strips to length, but be sure to put the factory end - the uncut
end - at the top of each slot. Screw them in place and accuracy is
assured.
</P>
<P>
   We've gotten off on a bit of a tangent, but I wanted to mention
the problems to be dealt with in terms of shelf support while we're
still shopping for material.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to cut up that expensive plywood. We've got our
cutting diagram showing how each sheet is to be cut. If you've got
a table saw and intend to use it, I strongly recommend you get
help. Handling a sheet of 3/4-inch plywood on a table saw is
terribly difficult by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have help, and you have a good portable circular
saw, consider that instead. It's not so much that cutting a sheet
of plywood on a table saw is dangerous, it's that there is a lot of
opportunity for messing up a cut, and this is expensive material.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to use a circular saw, you need something to hold
the plywood. A couple of sturdy sawhorses will do, and so will your
workbench if it's strong.
</P>
<P>
   Work slowly, setting up each cut with care. Secure the plywood
to the horses or the bench with clamps, remembering to pad the
clamp jaws. Mark carefully, and then use a dependable metal
straightedge to guide the cut. Clamp it securely at each side. Use
a new, or newly-sharpened, carbide blade in your saw. For the heavy
uprights, devise some means of holding them in place during the cut
so they don't break off or bind the saw blade. Again, another pair
of hands is useful.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, assembly.

HEARING BEETHOVEN AND THINKING BRUSSELS SPROUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday March 11)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I almost think it's a shame that Mozart makes kids smart. That
temporary boost in brainpower comes at a cost.
</P>
<P>
   Music, like most things, used to be listened to for enjoyment. A
dancing, clapping, spinning-around, singing-along,
slapping-your-thigh kind of enjoyment, or a melancholy, meditative,
soul-searching-rainy-day, moody kind of enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being marketed and mass produced, sold to parents
like enriched whole-grain cereals, music was something that sprang
from the core of family life, a legacy handed down from barn dances
and ceremonial bagpipes and crude flutes played by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The days of fifes and fiddles may be diminished, but children
still love music for the simple joy it brings. Sure, it enriches
their lives. But that's not why they like it.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say I didn't fall into the ``music as learning
aid'' mind frame when I had children.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary: I bought the soundtrack from Amadeus, the Best
of Brahms, Mozart for the Morning Commute. When Adam loved ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' I bought him ``Annie,'' ``The King and I''
and ``CATS.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as a friend of mine says about the accelerated reading
program at our sons' school, ``We've almost managed to take
something inherently fun and make it a chore.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we raising kids who rate listening to a half-hour of
developmentally appropriate music at night as the equivalent of
taking a vitamin pill?
</P>
<P>
   My son used to love classical music. I would play it on the car
radio and make up stories to go along with the booming drums and
the regal French horns, and he would imagine the scene with a
built-in soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the music without words best,'' he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   Then his school started a new lunch-time strategy. They'd play
classical music in the lunchroom for five minutes, then allow free
talk for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Adam hears classical he has an almost Pavlovian
response: ``YUCK. Turn if OFF! That's the music they play when
we're not allowed to TALK.''
</P>
<P>
   Like vegetables, there's some music I'm willing to force down my
children for their long-term good. They have to take piano lessons,
no matter how much they squirm and wiggle and pout on the bench.
They have to accompany me to see a full orchestra once a year, a
choir singing traditional carols at Christmas, a musical on-stage
when the mood strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, also depending on my whims, I make them listen to
Elton John, John Denver, Van Morrison, the Carpenters, Sonny and
Cher, Elvis and Bob Dylan, and dance around the living room with
me.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there are the songs my husband and I sing
to them at bedtime, everything from ``How much is that doggie in
the window?'' to Janis Joplin's ``Bobbie McGee.'' Neither of us can
sing a note, but the kids haven't figured that out yet and clamor
for encores nightly. They're the best audience we could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of music, some live and out loud, played for the right
reasons is what we can hope to give our children. Otherwise, if
they hear Beethoven and think Brussels sprouts, it will be all our
own doing.

JUDGE SHOWS IGNORANCE IN RAPE APPEAL RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century it will be recorded that some men
still didn't get it and not just in Washington, D.C. A judge in
Italy let a rape defendant go because his accuser was wearing jeans
and, the judge said, everyone knows you can't remove a pair of
women's jeans unless she helps.
</P>
<P>
   Let it also be recorded that people all the way from Sidney to
Sacramento were outraged and showed their solidarity by wearing
jeans to protest the silly judge's ruling. And some of the
protesters were men, proving that at the end of the 20th century
many men, in fact, do get it.
</P>
<P>
   The day the ruling was announced an Italian journalist commented
that at least it wasn't as bad as when the only true rape victim
was considered a dead one. The idea was that any woman who didn't
fight to the death probably secretly wanted to be raped, which is
like secretly wanting to have someone stick a knife in you. But
apparently some people still insist on seeing it their way which
was the problem with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to sneer at the guy and go on, but in spite of
the mocking response there was some nervousness about the ruling
because once again it looks at rape only from the rapist's point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   There are two distinctly different experiences in a rape. It is
not a two-way sex act. One person has sex. The other person gets
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we can assume that the rapist enjoys some part of it. He
(or she when the woman does the forcing) has an urge of a sexual
nature and it is satisfied, though cruelly. The victim is no more
having sex than she is doing her nails. She (or he) is being
tortured. Maybe there's not a knife or a gun. Maybe there's not
even a fist pounding on her, but she is beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what the odds are in Italy but an American woman
has a one in three chance of being raped in her lifetime.
Therefore, women have a vested interest in using every opportunity
to explain what rape means to women.
</P>
<P>
   The judge mistakenly believes that rape can occur only when
someone is physically overpowered. What about being paralyzed by
fear? Shocked out of your mind that this is happening to you?
Willing to do anything to keep from being killed?
</P>
<P>
   At moments like that, tight or baggy jeans are not an obstacle.
If you're scared enough and feel you have no choice and he says
take the jeans off, you probably take the jeans off.
</P>
<P>
   Rape is something that women worry about more than men because
men don't have to play fair in a physical struggle with women. It's
not just because they are often physically bigger and stronger but
because they have the means to force themselves inside a woman and
hurt her. In a fight, they have an extra weapon that women don't
have.
</P>
<P>
   It's why women often walk down the street with less self
assurance than men, even women who know how to kick and yell and
carry aerosol cans in their purse. Men don't carry around the
threat of rape like women, except when they go to prison. But women
know we can be brutalized in a specific way. It is why some women
often don't make eye contact with certain strangers. Why they would
rather drive a flat tire down to the metal than stop at night
beside the road and change it. Why they don't run too early in the
morning and why they check the back seat of the car before getting
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Men have every right to get the creeps, too. If they end up on
the wrong street someone could hit them on the head, mug them, even
kill them. If there's a woman along she could suffer the same, and
also be raped.
</P>
<P>
   If we relax our guard, there are constant reminders that we are
vulnerable. Where would TV cop shows and Murder of the Week movies
be without a rape? If crime is afoot and there's a woman in the
story, sooner or later some bad guy is going to look at her in that
way that makes your blood freeze. In the middle of a holdup or a
kidnapping or pirates taking over the ship or soldiers going
through the peasant village someone in a group of men will start
looking funny at a woman. If she isn't raped she'll at least have
learned from his look that she could have been. Even if she's
wearing a corset, three petticoats and bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   Proving he had other lapses in common sense, the judge also
wondered why the woman waited hours to tell her parents. The woman
was 18 at the time. The man was 45, her driving instructor and old
enough to be her father. It takes a while to want to talk about
things like that. And even in enlightened places, be it Rome or
Northern California, women hesitate to report rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Word is that this judge probably won't be hearing any more rape
appeals. A friend commented that she hopes he's taken off the
bench, ``unless he's attached so tightly to his seat that they
can't remove him without his consent.''
</P>
<P>
   International Women's Day is March 8. That's a Monday and most
people reserve Friday for their casual wear, but you might want to
put on a pair of jeans.

HILLARY PICKS THE WRONG VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time I run into a New Yorker, I ask if
Hillary Rodham Clinton will really run for Senate against His
Fearsome Rudyness, as New York Times writer Gail Collins calls New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere I go, people ask if San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
can be beaten in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Both questions can pretty much be answered with a roll of the
eyes. Rudy and Willie aren't called dictators for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the pit bull he is, Rudy would rip Hillary off the high
road by her ankle. He's already torn her up for advocating a
Palestinian state. A Palestinian state may be the best solution to
problems in the Middle East, but calling for one is the best way to
lose an election in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary won't really run. The vast tabloid conspiracy would kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   She's deluding herself to think her problems are over with the
end of the impeachment trial. She stood by a bad man, and women are
having post-Monicamatic stress syndrome, wondering what wiring is
loose in Hillary's well-educated head.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist heroine was a sucker _ or a co-conspirator in her
husband's adultery _ and they both suckered feminists.
</P>
<P>
   As Hillary has gotten closer to announcing her intention to run
for the Senate, her ratings have dropped faster than her husband's
pants.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco race for mayor, Willie Brown and Clint
Reilly is a more even match-up than Hillary against Rudy. Here we
have a Doberman against a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brown, Reilly has one of the best political minds in
America but, unlike Brown, this wily campaign consultant is
charisma-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   One of my friends describes his run for mayor as a campaign
without a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be a different Reilly from the explosive one we've
seen in the past. He has done a good job of calmly providing a
politically sophisticated voice critical of Brown's neglect of
issues like public transportation and Brown's over-attentiveness to
his developer and lobbyist friends.
</P>
<P>
   You can't write off a political pro like Reilly. He's the only
guy in town with the money (his own) to beat Brown's money machine.
And the transit system could melt down at any moment and throw
every commuter's vote his way.
</P>
<P>
   As for that theory that Reilly will pull out at the last minute,
opening the way for victory by ex-mayor Frank Jordan, get real.
</P>
<P>
   That would be like Patton feinting toward the Rhine, and then
pulling back to let the Boy Scouts fight their way across.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Clint has a snowball's chance in hell, and Willie is
in charge of hell.
</P>
<P>
   There is one sure way that Brown can be beaten, though, and one
way that Hillary can win. She's running in the wrong place. All it
takes is a new village.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has to forget New York and the Senate, and run for mayor
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Residency is no problem. Besides, she's practically lived here
while her husband has milked liberals in the San Francisco area for
money.
</P>
<P>
   But we aren't floating candidacies because we hate him. It's all
in the interest of democracy, and maybe getting someone new to kick
around.
</P>
<P>
   That's what mayors are for, kicking around.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you have it tough, Mr. Mayor, check out what the
New York papers do to rude Rudy. Giuliani has actually gotten a few
things done, and they still put the boot to him every day.
</P>
<P>
   But heaven help the San Francisco press if we kick St. Hillary.
In this city of great women, she would get higher polls than God,
and She isn't running.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wouldn't dare wage a negative campaign against Hillary for
fear of losing women's votes.
</P>
<P>
   With Hillary as mayor, the transit system would run on time or
else it would be flying lamp time. Tell me there's a union or a
civil servant who could outfox Hillary. She has a steel-trap mind
and never forgets a thing or a person, particularly one who crossed
her.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has a steel-trap mind too, but the spring is set too
tight. It snaps with the passing of every breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has nothing to lose. The Clintons and the national
Democratic Party don't need Brown. Al Gore, or whatever stiff is
nominated in 2000, will carry San Francisco and California, given
that the Republicans are eating their own.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Brown stole a bathrobe from the Lincoln bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Brown and the Clintons probably have one
thing in common: hating Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Feinstein
is a real person with a conscience. She was the first Democrat to
chastise Bill for degrading the presidency by having an affair with
an intern.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to get back at Feinstein than to take the office
she once held? Hillary may even become known as a tougher mayor.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to be near Chelsea, too? At least for Hillary,
who may be a single mother by 2000. If she dumps the Big Creep,
it'll be a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary for mayor. It takes 51 percent of the village.

 SUVs MAKE MINCEMEAT ON THE HIGHWAY  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I keep wondering when Ford or General Motors
will come out with a modified version of the U.S. Army's M2 Bradley
Fighting Vehicle as the newest entry in the booming sport utility
vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, it's going to come to that, you know, because
there is no other way to continue along the SUV highway than
bigger, badder and more bruising.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing series of SUVs vs. normal-sized cars, the latest
government crash tests prove that, in front-end collisions, SUVs
make mincemeat out of regular automobiles and the people in them.
Surprise, surprise. Last year's government tests proved the same
thing about side-impact collisions.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is America's answer? Better to be the mincemeater than
the mincemeatee: Sport utility vehicles (aka ``light trucks'')
account for nearly half of all new auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   In tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
a 1997 Honda Accord was sacrificed in 35 mph head-ons with a 1997
Dodge Caravan minivan, a 1997 Ford Explorer SUV, a 1998 Chevrolet
S-10 compact pickup and a 1997 Chevy Lumina sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash dummy driver of the Accord suffered greater
``injuries'' than did the dummy drivers of the Caravan, Explorer
and Chevy truck. As for the front passenger seat crash dummies,
they were ``hurt'' more severely against the minivan, SUV and
Lumina sedan because the Lumina actually weighs more than the Chevy
truck.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the safety administration issued its
findings, the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute livened up a meeting of the Society of Automotive
Engineers by sharing the results of its extensive survey of actual
crash data. Those numbers indicate that design _ bigger, wider and
taller _ play a more important role than weight does in making
mincemeat out of regular cars.
</P>
<P>
   In real wrecks in 1996, the Michigan researchers said, more
occupants of cars were killed or badly hurt in collisions with
light trucks than in collisions with cars that weighed as much as a
light truck. In fact, car drivers were killed at about twice the
rate in car-light truck crashes as in car-car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan study also estimated that about 2,000 occupants of
regular cars would still be alive if they'd had the good fortune in
1996 to smash into another car instead of a light truck.
</P>
<P>
   A response from General Motors' engineering director of motor
vehicle development pretty much sums up the attitude of the auto
industry and the general population: ``It seems to prove, once
again, that physics works,'' Robert Lange told the Associated
Press. ``The occupants of the heavier vehicles are going to fare
better than the occupants of a lighter vehicle in a collision.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a Sterling Heights, Mich., woman wrote to me after my
last column about SUVs: ``This is what the majority of people want,
and the majority rules ... If you don't want to feel like a `tiny
calf being rounded up by four 1,500-pound Brahma bulls,' then
purchase an SUV also.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either that or you shouldn't drive but stay home in your own
little world, safe from those horrible SUVs, and fax your opinions
in to your paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, them's the choices. Either spend $20,000 (minimum) to buy a
``light truck'' or quit driving and stay home.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if that modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle will come in
raspberry, teal and midnight blue?

GAME SHOWS, ONCE BIG WINNERS ON TV, HEADED FOR COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In addition to talk shows, old sitcoms and judge
programs, there is another syndication staple. It was once
dominant, before being crowded out by endless reruns of ``Cheers''
and ``Seinfeld'' and ``M-A-S-H,'' yet more local news programs and
the rantings of Jerry Springer and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what we're talking about, and you might win some Samsonite
luggage, a new refrigerator _ or you can trade it all in for what's
behind Door No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The game show, a standard from radio that made a spectacular
transition to television in the medium's 1950s infancy, has fallen
on hard times, at least on the networks, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game show blanketed the dial when televisions still had
dials: from 1973-75 there were over 27 different game shows,
starting at 9 a.m. and going until 4 p.m., and picking up again
between the evening news and prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Their names still ring regardless of age group (especially if
you get the Game Show Network): ``Let's Make a Deal.'' ``You Bet
You're Life.'' ``Beat the Clock.'' ``Match Game.''
``Concentration.'' ``Truth or Consequences.'' ``What's My Line.''
``To Tell the Truth.'' ``Name That Tune.'' ``The $10,000 Pyramid.''
``The $64,000 Question.'' ``Family Feud.''
</P>
<P>
   How many theme songs can you hum?
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from the esoteric and erudite to action-packed to
just plain silly. They also added phrases into the lexicon, from
``Come on down ...'' (``The Price is Right'') to ``Making Whoopee''
(``The Newlywed Game'') and ```And heeeeeeeeerreee they are''
(``The Dating Game'').
</P>
<P>
   Their dominance has passed, faded since the mid-1980s when
networks ceded more time to the affiliates, and sitcom reruns, talk
shows, added local news and national news magazine programs moved
to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   But it's exaggeration to say the genre is dead. Just look at the
two top-rated television shows in syndication: ``Wheel of Fortune''
and ``Jeopardy!'' ``The Price is Right'' is ranked No. 2 in daytime
programming.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is cable. ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' on Comedy
Central can at times be wittier than most homogeneous sitcoms.
Nickelodeon has several game shows tailored toward kids, while VH1
hosts ``Rock &AMP; Roll Jeopardy!'' MTV has the ``Blame Game.'' Even
the Food Network has several related game shows, including the
slyly named ``Pressure Cooker.'' There are more than two dozen
scattered across cable, many catering to specific audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wostbrock, along with David Schwartz and Steve Ryan, is the
co-author of ``The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, Third Edition''
($19.95 oversized softcover, January 1999, Checkmark Books, 377
pp). A veteran of 13 game shows who now serves as an agent for
hosts, the Los Angeles-based Wostbrock said there is a formula for
why some game shows succeed and others fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a good game show? Three words: A simple idea,''
said Wostbrock. ``The game has to be there. You can have a
million-dollar set. You can give away a trillion dollars. But if
you don't have a good game, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wostbrock said ``Jeopardy!'' is the exception to the simplicity
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, all successful shows have one unassailable
denominator: You have to be able to play along at home. It goes for
``The $10,000 (or $20,000, or $25,000) Pyramid'' or ``The Price is
Right'' or ``Wheel.'' You can't help but yell at the screen (or
contestants).
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability for the home viewer to play is one of the key
ingredients for a successful game show,'' said co-author Schwartz,
who is also the program screener and resident historian at the Game
Show Network.
</P>
<P>
   Wostbrock thinks ``The Price is Right'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''
are the best ever, a perfect combination of simplicity and audience
participation. As for hosts, he cites the late Bill Cullen _ who
presided over a record 21 different television game shows _ as the
standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could host a hard Q&AMP;A show, he could host a celebrity show,
he could host a no-brainer show,'' Wostbrock said. ``(The
versatility), it's like Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Wostbrock believes game shows are due to make a network revival
in the next couple of years, if only out of that cyclical nature of
syndication. What goes around comes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to be wonderful retreads. `The `New'
Hollywood Squares.' `The `New' Let's Make a Deal.' Why? Everybody
is familiar with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be perfect for syndication: more reruns.

MENENDEZ DECIDES AGAINST BID FOR LAUTENBERG'S SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Robert Menendez, a four-term congressman who
was widely seen as the leading Democrat to replace Sen. Frank R.
Lautenberg, has announced that he would not seek the seat in 2000,
clearing the field for several people who might have been
considered long shots before.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians, many of whom were caught off guard by
Thursday's announcement, said the most likely beneficiaries of
Menendez's decision were former Gov. Jim Florio, who has formed a
committee to explore a Senate campaign, and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr.,
who has hired a team of high-profile political consultants in
preparation for a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Susan Bass Levin of Cherry Hill has also hired political
consultants and is strongly considering the race. Other people who
have said they might run include state Sen. Richard J. Codey, the
minority leader; state Sen. John H. Adler, and B. Thomas Byrne Jr.,
who is a former state Democratic Party chairman and the son of
former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   In a Capitol Hill news conference with Richard A. Gephardt, the
House minority leader, Menendez said he had been leaning toward
running for the Senate as recently as last weekend. He had
stockpiled more than $1 million in preparation for a possible
statewide run. But he said Gephardt urged him to remain in his
current job to help the Democrats win back the House majority,
which would require picking up just six additional seats next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the vice chairman of the Democratic caucus, Menendez, 45, is
the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, and he has told people he
would someday like to be speaker. He said that he discussed his
``potential to rise'' in the Democratic leadership with Gephardt,
but that the minority leader had not made him any promises about
future positions.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, who is from Union City, said he had not been
worried about having Gov. Christine Todd Whitman as a possible
opponent in the Senate race. After the Menendez announcement,
Several possible Democratic candidates said they were prepared to
wage expensive primary fights, and their efforts are likely to be
encouraged by local Democratic officials against the desires of
state party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters for the Democrats is the renewal of
hostilities between the state's two most powerful Democrats,
Lautenberg and Sen. Robert G. Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two men boiled over last week during a
private meeting of Senate Democrats when Lautenberg accused
Torricelli of being too friendly with Mrs. Whitman and suggested
that he was endangering the Democrats' chances of holding his seat.
Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, acknowledges that he has a good working relationship
with Mrs. Whitman. But he scoffs at Lautenberg's assertions, saying
he is determined that the Democrats win back the Senate in 2000.

ACTOR'S INTENSITY FLAVORS `JOE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   British director Ken Loach plunges us into another of his social
realist narratives with ``My Name is Joe,'' which features a
performance of explosive honesty by Peter Mullan in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet him, he's at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting (the
title refers, of course, to the introductions of recovering
alcoholics at AA gatherings). Loach's brand of no-nonsense
filmmaking has seen its influence played more in the last decade
than at any other point in his career: Mike Leigh has carved out
his own version of Loach's style; actors-turned-writer/directors
Gary Oldman and Tim Roth have adopted Loach's unblinking gaze at
the behavior of the working class for their first features as well.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, Loach's material doesn't play as the most
effervescent of entertainment. It's touching, and a credit to his
tenacity, that after more than 30 years he's still hanging on to
his craft. ``Joe,'' set in Glasgow, has a loose, documentary feel
that adds to its volatility. (It's subtitled, since the Glaswegian
accents are hard to understand.)
</P>
<P>
   The reforming Joe has thrown himself into reclaiming his own
life and those of others. He manages a soccer team, a bunch of
boiling youths who can't quite get it going on the field. But Joe
loves the chaos, and spends a furious amount of energy helping the
kids to keep body and soul together.
</P>
<P>
   Joe has what movie types used to call a ``meet-cute'' encounter
with Sarah (Louise Goodall), a social worker, who gets into a
squabble with him over a parking space. Soon, though, he's offering
to re-wallpaper her flat _ a job he's comically unequipped to do.
It's odd that a director with Loach's reputation for
close-to-the-world realism falls back on such moldy, stagy plot
gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps slightly more depressing than the moody emotional
swirls that Loach so painstakingly creates. But he's got a fiery
winner of a protagonist in Mullan, who won acting honors from the
jury at Cannes last year. Mullan's windblown intensity and
directness make some of these cliches fully felt.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when a melancholy predictability sets in. The
struggle that brings Joe and Sarah together is the effort to help
one of her charges, Liam (David McKay), a drug addict and
small-time criminal who's also on Joe's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe takes up the battle to help the boy, who's struggling to
stay away from a life of petty crime, ``My Name is Joe'' slinks
slowly, inexorably back into the mire from which both guys clearly
haven't emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of the streets, and past mistakes, are inescapable _
director Loach is diligent in tattooing the story with original
sin. Mullan's hunger and zeal to do what's right give ``Joe'' a
screaming, pounding heart. He rises above its glum obviousness.

NEW YORK RESORT OFFERED RESPITE FROM TUBERCULOSIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. _ More than 1,600 tuberculosis patients came
to Saranac Lake in 1922, the peak year for the ``cure cottages''
offering fresh air, good food and rest as a means of halting TB's
assault on the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Prohibition and the jazz age, the village attracted
visitors both famous and infamous. Murderer and bootlegger Jack
``Legs'' Diamond came to see his tubercular brother. Legendary
baseball pitcher Christy Mathewson was a patient.
</P>
<P>
   Lilo Guggenheim Levine was a year old then, a Jewish girl born
in southern Germany soon after Hitler seized control of the Nazi
Party. TB seemed the least of the perils she might face, and the
Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York were a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for better and for worse, TB and Saranac Lake would become
intertwined with Levine's life, and she would see the age-old
scourge recede, surge and ebb again. Like millions during the first
half of the century, she ended up contracting TB. And like
thousands, she sought ``the cure'' at the sanitarium Dr. Edward
Livingston Trudeau founded in Saranac Lake.
</P>
<P>
   There, Levine found not only renewed health but also the man who
would become her husband. She worked as a nurse at Trudeau's
sanitarium after recovering from TB and fell in love with one of
her patients, Melvin Levine. They married in Saranac Lake on New
Year's Eve, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The Levines grew up when many considered a TB diagnosis a death
sentence. But they witnessed the growing belief, fostered by
Trudeau, that something could be done about the disease. And they
left Saranac Lake as antibiotics were beating back the TB
bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, TB was the No. 1 cause of death in New York
state. Today, the No. 1 cause, heart disease, often strikes in old
age, but TB was known to cut people down in their prime, even in
their teens.
</P>
<P>
   The disease attacks the lungs, debilitating the victim with
fever, fatigue, coughing and severe loss of weight. Although a
vaccine was developed in Europe in the 1920s, treatments did not
become widely available in the United States until the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, the great-grandfather of ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist
Garry Trudeau, retreated to the Adirondacks with TB in 1873. ``Why
doctor,'' a guide said as he carried Trudeau to his room, ``you
don't weigh no more than a dried lamb skin.'' But Trudeau survived,
becoming convinced of the value of simple things: air, rest and
food.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau pioneered TB research, seeking a vaccine and other ways
to battle the disease. And by 1922, his sanitarium had become both
the cradle and epicenter of a sanitarium movement _ with more than
200 ``cure cottages.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's sanitarium allowed both the powerful and penniless to
seek the cure amid Adirondack air that was both fresh and frigid.
Legs Diamond had TB himself, but his was a dormant case, and he
died amid a hail of bullets in an Albany rooming house in 1931.
Diamond's brother Eddie spent his final months on a cure cottage
porch, his bodyguard nearby, hiding a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson went to Saranac Lake with TB in 1920, 15 years after
throwing three shutouts in the World Series. When his health
improved, he returned to baseball as president of the Boston
Braves. TB, however, is noted for lulling its victims, then
returning with a vengeance. And it ran down Mathewson in 1925, when
he caught cold during spring training and died in Saranac Lake
after the first game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Author Robert Louis Stevenson also battled TB there in 1887 and
1888, watching ink freeze and temperatures plunge to minus 25,
calling it ``a bleak, blackguard, beggarly climate, of which I can
say no good except that it suits me.'' Rich food was recommended.
``The more fat that can be absorbed ... the better,'' former
Saranac Lake TB patient Francis DeWitt wrote in his ``How to Get
Well Book'' in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise was limited. Patients spent day and night in specially
designed chairs on the porches of ``cure cottages,'' and their
stays could last nine months or more. The routine could be
monotonous, but there were card games, sleigh rides and walks in
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   And the regimen seemed to pay off. Of the 12,500 patients
treated at Trudeau's sanitarium, 5,000 were alive when it closed in
1954. The success rate was bolstered by the fact that Trudeau, who
was focused on finding a cure, refused hopeless cases. And to be
sure, some patients did die.
</P>
<P>
   So was the cure really in the air? Certainly it didn't hurt to
remove people from stressful environments, but experts question the
wisdom of having people sit in subzero temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medically, it's hard to pinpoint what was or wasn't proven by
what Trudeau did,'' said Dr. George T. DiFerdinando, director of
the New York Health Department's Bureau of Tuberculosis Control
between 1986 and 1995. ``Medically, it was a wash.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trudeau's efforts were not in vain. ``I think his biggest
contribution was the belief that you could really do something
about this disease rather than accepting it as a death sentence,''
DiFerdinando said. ``It galvanized the effort to find a cure.''

BILLY CRYSTAL'S COUCH LOOKS AWFULLY FAMILIAR WITH DE NIRO LYING ON
IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The word is getting out about control,'' goes a line from an
old Who song, ``The Relay,'' which could be the theme of ``Analyze
This.''
</P>
<P>
   Mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is straining to control his
world. An important anniversary is coming up in his life _ the
anniversary of the infamous organized crime summit known as the
Apalachin meeting, which was interrupted by the feds.
</P>
<P>
   Vitti's mentor is killed in a hit that was supposed to have
nailed Vitti. His rival for mob control (Chazz Palminteri) was
behind the assassination attempt, and as Vitti makes the moves to
re-establish his stranglehold, he begins to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from what used to be called a case of nerves _ now
termed anxiety attacks _ Vitti is at a loss to continue until one
of his lieutenants literally runs into Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal,
playing what is basically the Woody Allen part), a Manhattan
psychiatrist. Vitti goes to see Sobel, which produces results
neither had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel has issues of his own, such as an inability to express
rage, so he sits on his easy chair like a velour lump, daydreaming
about: venting while his patients drone on; his celebrated,
obnoxious shrink father (Bill Macy), who simultaneously coddles him
and condescends to him; and his imminent wedding to a TV
correspondent (Lisa Kudrow), who may be more neurotic than he is.
So when Vitti charges into Sobel's life like, well, a raging bull,
Sobel can't handle it. Because, well, who can say no to an alleged
felon with a gun?
</P>
<P>
   De Niro has been playing a mob figure with his face twisted into
a fist for so long that it may seem like he already has sent up
this character. His explosive acting style has become half a joke
itself _ hollow and predictable dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   What once was original has become so stylized he seems to be
imitating Alec Baldwin's Robert De Niro impersonation from
``Saturday Night Live.'' And as ``Analyze This'' starts to unspool,
you may feel like you have already seen this movie _ the fearful
shrink forced to help a violent criminal, a subplot right out of
``Grosse Pointe Blank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' is smarter than it seems, even though there's
absolutely nothing new in it. (A dream sequence is lifted from
``The Godfather,'' the sequel to which De Niro appeared in.)
</P>
<P>
   Director Harold Ramis, who once said his first film,
``Caddyshack,'' was like a $6 million film school scholarship, has
developed polish. Everything fits into place. It's a pretty
old-fashioned movie, which is why it all seems so familiar, right
down to those crime-boss shirts with collar points that stop just
above the waistline.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the man of action (Vitti) provides a liberating example
for the constricted nerd (Sobel). And, of course, the thoughtful
shrink gives the crude mobster self-knowledge and frees him from
his guilt-ridden past.
</P>
<P>
   This is all handled in a businesslike fashion by Ramis and
co-writer Peter Tolan, who got to show his flair for epic pettiness
with his work on ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' But the shadow of
another HBO series looms over ``Analyze This'': ``The Sopranos,'' a
whirring comedy-drama that takes the same material and pays off in
a much more satisfying way. It doesn't italicize every moment, like
``Analyze This,'' with its bullying energy _ made-man comedy that
will intimidate a laugh out of you.

MICROSOFT DIVES INTO E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft may be a late player in the electronic
commerce game, but when the technology giant finally jumps in, it
does so in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. founder William H. Gates and company executives
outlined an e-commerce strategy that includes a suite of software
and services that will allow businesses and consumers to talk to
one another on-line.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash.-based company also announced the acquisition
of CompareNet Inc., an Internet shopping service, as well as
partnership agreements with numerous companies, including
MasterCard International, PeopleSoft Inc. and SAP AG.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will be the marketplace for most businesses,''
Gates told a gather of industry officials on Thursday. ``We're
seeking to expand the marketplace, not just increase our share.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Microsoft's strategy hinges on a server framework called
BizTalk, which Gates described as ``the glue that ties this all
together.'' The framework is a set of standards and technologies
that makes it easier for companies to conduct transactions and
exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft identified small businesses as key e-commerce players
because they often offer unusual products and services and need to
reach a wide audience. A package called Microsoft Small Business
Commerce Services will be available to make it easier for these
companies to have a presence on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To expand e-commerce opportunities, Microsoft announced an open
marketplace for its MSN site designed to allow sellers to promote
more easily and shoppers to search and compare products with less
hassle. Features include CompareNet as well as a ``Passport''
service, which allows shoppers to register just once, receive
targeted marketing information and shop on line.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's announcements come at a time when the company is
under increasing pressure because of competition from e-commerce
rivals Yahoo Inc., America Online Inc. as well as IBM, Netscape
Communications Corp. and the Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Marshall, director of Zona Research Inc., a market
research firm in Redwood City, Calif., said that while competitors
have various pieces of Microsoft's e-commerce strategy, no company
has been able to put it together in such a comprehensive way and
gather the number of partners Microsoft has.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Microsoft comes out in full bloom, it's a very impressive
and powerful entity,'' Marshall said. ``This is something that will
make e-commerce happen. It will make e-commerce easier for big
companies to talk to each other and it will make it easier for
small companies to get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Microsoft services are just a slide show. The
BizTalk Server and Microsoft Commerce Server will be tested this
summer and won't be available until next year.

GUILTY PLEASURES OUGHT TO KNOW THEIR PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even more than the ``Pygmalion''-inspired ``She's All That,''
``Cruel Intentions'' is a Cliff's Notes movie, updating a
200-year-old novel (''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'') in a way that's
palatable to the lucrative teen audience. It's like a WB TV movie
that escaped the notice of the network's standards and practices
department.
</P>
<P>
   It's trashy fun, all the more because it realizes it is trash
and doesn't take itself too seriously _ at least until the last
third, when it grows a conscience. Until then, it's a guilty ride
through some campy performances and so-bad-it's-good dialogue, but
it loses its nerve, because it knows it can't let its young
characters get away with their nefarious doings.
</P>
<P>
   The movie pits bored, spoiled, wealthy stepsiblings Kathryn
Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian Valmont (Ryan
Phillippe) against each other and the world. As in the novel (and
three previously filmed versions), Valmont is a serpentine seducer,
and he finds his biggest challenge in Annette Hargrove (Reese
Witherspoon), who's so virginal that she wrote an essay on sexual
abstinence for Seventeen magazine (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gellar and
Phillippe's ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' co-star, is on the
cover _ now she'd be a challenge). Kathryn bets Valmont that he
won't succeed in bedding Annette _ if Kathryn wins, she gets
Valmont's Jaguar Roadster; if he wins, he gets Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with this fiendishness, Kathryn also sets about
destroying the ingenuous Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair), who
unwittingly stole one of Kathryn's conquests. Blair, who looks just
enough like Monica Lewinsky to give this some unexpected subtext,
is wonderfully goofy depicting Cecile's sexual awakening (with lots
of help from Kathryn, who demonstrates the finer points of French
kissing, and Valmont, who demonstrates kissing of a whole 'nother
kind). Cecile is probably too much of a ditz to be destroyed, but
Blair's antics make her plot thread the most consistently
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair has fun, Gellar looks uncomfortable; although she
relishes playing really bad for the first time since her ``All My
Children'' days, she's unconvincing as a nasty vamp. Instead of
embracing the role, she plays it as if she's fighting off her more
wholesome ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' image.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a bad guy looks better on Phillippe, who for the first
time in a movie looks like he has a pulse (although he often seems
merely to be mimicking John Malkovich's Valmont from 1988's
``Dangerous Liaisons'').
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with brooding characters in ``54'' and ``Playing by
Heart,'' Phillippe seemed bored; insolent and cocky here, he may
have found his niche as a villain, a devil with the face of an
angel. It's when Valmont falls for Annette, played with sunshiny
goodness by the versatile Witherspoon (Phillippe's real-life
girlfriend) that Phillippe turns serious and the movie loses its
way.
</P>
<P>
   Teen movies, even mediocre ones, can be fascinating because they
reflect our culture better than almost any other genre; they're
moviedom's best time-capsule fodder. But ``Cruel Intentions'' is
too insular to work that way; writer-director Roger Kumble (who
worked on ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin'') keeps the characters
largely separated from the real world, at least until the hoary
ending, which plays like the prelude to a biblical stoning.
</P>
<P>
   Kumble has some sly wit _ he casts Swoosie Kurtz, who was in the
1988 version, in a small role _ but his direction loses energy
whenever there's a long dialogue exchange, and he nails his camera
to the ground as if he were filming the glossiest high school play
in history.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it couldn't succeed as a guilty pleasure, but
Kumble's script fights against itself _ an amorality tale that
wants to be moral, a wicked youth movie that still says, ``Hey,
kids _ this is what happens if you play with other people's
hearts.''

HUME TAKES ON ROLE OF ULSTER RECONCILER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Since the signing last April of the
painfully crafted political settlement designed to bring peace to
Northern Ireland, John Hume, its prime architect, has kept what for
him is a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Hume stepped into the background to let others take the
spotlight in Northern Ireland's fledgling attempts to govern
itself, but with concern growing that the peace process is in
danger of calcifying, he is suddenly a ubiquitous presence again.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was walking around
the refurbished Parliament building at Stormont, where local
government was suspended in 1972 at the height of the Troubles _
and where it is now being restored.
</P>
<P>
   Hume's official role is no greater than that of any other member
of the new assembly that has begun meeting at Stormont, but he
worked the corridors, shaking hands, slapping backs, and
encouraging compromise from both Protestant unionists, who want to
remain British citizens, and Irish republicans, nationalists who
say they have given up violence and are prepared to seek a united
Ireland through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
   ``A peace process is just that. A process,'' Hume said, standing
at the members' bar on the second floor of the assembly building.
``You have to work at it. I've been reminding people how far we've
come, and that there is no alternative but to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a week, the new assembly is supposed to take back
from the British Parliament the self-government powers that were
suspended in 1972, at the height of violence here, and transferred
wholesale to London. But few expect that deadline to be met because
of a polarizing dispute over the disposition of the weapons held by
paramilitary forces on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the peace process is on the verge of collapse. More
measured voices, such as Hume's, say Northern Ireland is merely
going through the predictable growing pains of a bitterly divided
society that is trying to take responsibility for its own affairs
after 27 years of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that the peace process is being stalled
by the dispute over weapons, mostly the arsenal of the Irish
Republican Army. The IRA refuses to give up its guns, saying that
would amount to surrender. Besides, IRA sympathizers assert,
previous incarnations of the IRA have been allowed to enter the
political mainstream without giving up weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when Northern Ireland spiraled out of control, Catholic
neighborhoods were overrun by Protestant extremists. The
overwhelmingly Protestant police force stood back, and after
Catholic families were burned out, graffiti appeared saying that
IRA stood for ``I Ran Away.'' The IRA built a substantial arsenal
and vowed never to be caught unarmed again.
</P>
<P>
   On a more visceral level, the IRA and its loyalist counterparts
refuse to turn in their guns because they are not sure they won't
need them again. Loyalists are not convinced the IRA won't go back
to war and have said they won't begin turning in weapons until
after the IRA completely disarms. In 1996, the IRA broke its
cease-fire when the British government refused to convene peace
talks until the IRA disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, led by the new assembly's leader, David Trimble, who
shared the Nobel prize with Hume, say they will not sit in
government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, until the IRA
begins turning in weapons. And Trimble says he will not form a
Cabinet, in which the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and chief
negotiator Martin McGuinness are entitled to hold seats under the
settlement, until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, the British official in charge of Northern Ireland,
said she was encouraged by the politics she sees breaking out here,
even as she acknowledges it will take a major breakthrough to meet
the March 10 deadline to set up the Cabinet and transfer powers
from London to the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week that goes by with people still talking is
progress,'' she said. ``But we need someone to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Belfast Telegraph poll showed that even among Sinn Fein
supporters, most want the IRA to turn in some weapons to keep the
process moving forward. But in the working-class neighborhoods of
Belfast where the IRA and loyalists rule the streets, the writing
has always literally been on the wall. In West Belfast, an IRA
stronghold, new graffiti underscore the IRA's refusal to disarm,
saying, ``Not an ounce, not a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The ounce refers to Semtex, the plastic explosive that the IRA
used to devastating effects in London in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing in the settlement that links the forming
of local government with disarming, Trimble, fighting a rear-guard
action by hard-liners in his own camp, is refusing to compromise.
He said the IRA has to back up its pledge to commit itself to
democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams, in an interview, said the unionists are ``trying to
rewrite the agreement.'' He said that feeds into the cynicism of
many in the IRA that ``nothing has changed, that the unionists
still hold a veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, according to many of the 108 members of the
new assembly, is the political vacuum the stalemate is creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fiddling around, and you know what happens when there
is a vacuum,'' said Monica McWilliams, leader of the Northern
Ireland Women's Coalition, a moderate party that has called for
compromise on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, whenever there is a political vacuum in Northern
Ireland, extremists seek to fill it. The IRA and the two main
loyalist paramilitary groups are observing cease-fires, while
reserving the right to dispense vigilante justice to petty
criminals and dissidents in their neighborhoods. But there are
renegades from both sides seeking to wreck the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Omagh by renegade republicans, in which 29 people
were killed in the worst single atrocity of the Troubles, seemed to
chasten the hard-line extremists. But there have been isolated acts
of violence on the fringes, and many believe there is a potential
for more spectacular violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the weapons held by violent extremists are not the only
obstacle. There are at least two dozen members of the new assembly,
led by the fundamentalist preacher-politician the Rev. Ian Paisley,
who are trying to wreck it from within.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, they received a tongue lashing from one of their
former allies, David Ervine, a leader of the Progressive Unionist
Party, the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a loyalist
paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not prepared to see this holier-than-thou attitude
prevail,'' Ervine fumed. When he finished his dramatic speech, even
his one-time sworn enemy, Martin McGuinness, was moved to say,
``Hear, hear!''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the peculiarities of the new Northern Ireland, former
extremists are united in appealing to so-called moderates to be
more conciliatory.

THREE-STRIKES LAW IS A BEANBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci's bombast was perfectly timed to expose
him as just another governor whose arm is less that of Roger
Clemens than of Peanuts' Charlie Brown. Saying, ``It's time we put
these career criminals out of business,'' he this week reintroduced
three-strikes-you're-out legislation that would imprison third-time
violent offenders for life.
</P>
<P>
   A three-strikes law is a wild pitch. Governor Weld failed in the
mid-1990s to have Massachusetts join a three-strikes frenzy that
saw 24 states and the federal government adopt such laws. Yet
almost no state uses them because courts have found that existing
laws are tough enough and because three-strikes laws handcuffed
their ability to treat cases individually.
</P>
<P>
   The only state that aggressively uses a three-strikes law is
California. The day Cellucci filed his bill the Justice Policy
Institute, a criminal justice think tank, released the first
in-depth study of the three-strikes law in California, a state with
32 million people.
</P>
<P>
   California's three-strikes law is more than a wild pitch. It is
a beanball aimed at the poor, the black, and the brown. It has
nailed far more nonviolent offenders than hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be published this fall in the Stanford Law and
Policy Review, found that of the state's 12 most populous counties,
the six that used the three-strikes law the least had slightly
bigger declines in homicides and much steeper declines in violent
crime than the six counties that used it the most.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco County, which used the three-strikes law the
least, had a 28 percent decrease in violent crime from 1995 through
1997. Santa Clara County, one of the six heaviest users of the
laws, had a 9 percent (itals)increase(unitals) in violent crime.
San Francisco's decline in violent crime was the same as the
decline in Los Angeles and 4 1/2 times the decline in Sacramento.
Los Angeles and Sacramento are the state's heaviest users of the
three-strikes law.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence of deterrence by age. Most third-strike
convictions are of offenders 30 and older. Despite that, violent
crime and other felonies increased for that age group while it
declined for offenders under 30.
</P>
<P>
   The three-strikes law was meant to get rid of unrepentant
murderers. But according to the California Legislative Analyst's
Office, only about 20 percent of the sentences for two strikes
(where offenders receive sentences twice as long as they otherwise
would have received), and 38 percent of sentences for three strikes
were for violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   The most common crimes of second-strikers were drug possession,
petty theft, and second-degree burglary. The most common crimes of
third-strikers were first-degree burglary, robbery, and drug
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The vacuum cleaning of nonviolent offenders under the
three-strikes law has swollen California's prison population with
low-income African-Americans and Latinos, easier for cops to snatch
off street corners than white users in the suburbs. Though
California is 55 percent white, African-Americans and Latinos make
up 70 percent of second- and third-strike prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is already making the same mistakes without a
three-strikes law. A study by Assistant Attorney General William N.
Brownsberger found that two-thirds of men sent to jail from July
1994 to June 1996 under mandatory drug sentencing laws had never
been convicted of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos and African-American drug offenders were far more likely
than white drug offenders to go to prison. Though Latinos and
African-Americans are 14 percent of the state's population, they
make up 85 percent of drug-related convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci may claim that his law would be tighter than
California's. History does not support this. Despite the
rock-busting, go-where-the-sun-don't-shine rhetoric of the
Weld-Cellucci administration, the Globe found in 1995 that most
drug kingpins escaped long prison terms by turning money over to
prosecutors. The kingpins got off so light that only 13 percent of
drug trafficking convictions in Suffolk, Middlesex, and Worcester
counties were for big-time dealers. The jails are so full of
low-level users, costing the state $30,000 a year apiece, that
nearly every Superior Court judge surveyed by the Globe opposed
mandatory minimums.
</P>
<P>
   If the state enacts a three strikes law, it will tilt the courts
even more against those with the least clout. Brownsberger found
that people in high-poverty areas are 19 times more likely to be
imprisoned for drugs than somone from a nonpoverty area.
</P>
<P>
   Or, cynically, a three-strikes law would do nothing at all,
because the parade to prison needs no speeding up. The rate of
incarceration in Holyoke _ 608 per 100,000 _ is nearly that of
Russia, the world's leading prison state.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers who throw deliberate beanballs are merely ejected from
a game. Cellucci's wild pitch is far more dangerous. His courts are
already cracking the skulls of people who need a more creative way
to reach first base. He needs to be taken off this mound before his
ineptitude rivals that of Charlie Brown. He should be sent to the
showers until he understands that three strikes has struck out.

 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many real heroes do we get in a lifetime? I just lost one of
mine.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon McKibben, who died Wednesday at 69 of a brain tumor, had
an exemplary career as a newsman that started as a teenager with
the East Side Journal in his beloved Washington state (Go Sonics!)
and took him from ringside with a young Muhammad Ali to the
Canadian Artic. He would chronicle the rise of Ken Olsen and An
Wang along Greater Boston's Route 128 in the '70s and the break-up
of Europe's Eastern bloc in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But a recounting of the resume misses the point. In every
generation in every newsroom, there are role models for what this
business should be. And they are vital. But Gordon taught us
something even more vital: Without ever even knowing it, this
gentle man taught us how to live our lives by the very way he lived
his.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon loved the news business, but knew how to put a life in
its proper order. Family, fairness, integrity. I never once heard
him talk about these things, but I never for a moment misunderstood
what mattered to him, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this page that Gordon made his most enduring mark for
readers of The Boston Globe. It is no sentimental stretch to say
that Gordon McKibben was the father of the Globe's modern Business
section. He was.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Globe editor Tom Winship hired Gordon, then Business
Week's Boston bureau chief, as the Globe's Business editor and
asked him to launch Business Extra, an expanded section. Gordon's
first act was to change the name of the section from ``The
Economy'' to ``Business.'' While Gordon's bosses knew they were
interested in the economy, they weren't so interested in stuff like
Digital Equipment's earnings and Gillette's new razor. Gordon
didn't spend a lot of time trying to explain to them the connection
between Digital and the economy, he just covered it.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox could have used Gordon. Nothing pleased him more
than hiring young talent from Nowhereville, and he had a tremendous
batting average doing it. In six years he hired a generation of
some of the best people ever to come through the Business page. (I
wasn't one of them, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   Coach McKibben let his talent play. It was OK to make a mistake
on his team; the point was to learn something from it. If Gordon
was going to err, it was going to be on the side of generosity to
the people he covered every day. It was his way.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Ken Olsen was king, he did a taped interview
with us, in which Olsen made a stupid ethnic remark. We all howled
and pushed to publish it because it was great copy. Gordon sat on
us because he knew it was a silly Olsenism and there was no malice
in the great man's heart. (Of course, that didn't stop Olsen from
writing an angry note that the Q&AMP;A made him sound incoherent, which
was standard Olsen, too. If only he had known.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the things that Gordon and I had in common was: We were
both fired as Globe Business editors. Gordon was faulted for not
being aggressive enough in covering the big money laundering
scandal at Bank of Boston in the mid-80s, a story that Michael
Janeway, then the Globe's editor, was sure would win him a Pulitzer
Prize. In retrospect, it was the most overdone local business story
of at least the last 20 years. ``No problems, only opportunities,''
the always optimistic Gordon would tell me a hundred times. But in
those darkest of days, even Gordon said it with a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon would later spend three years as the Globe's European
correspondent and four years as the paper's ombudsman, a tough job
that Gordon's experience and innate sense of fair play to both his
colleagues and the Globe's readers made him well suited. After
retiring in 1995, Gordon literally wrote the book on Gillette,
``Cutting Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   He was always a writer with an eye for the unusual. But more
than any story he ever wrote, what he really left behind for his
wife, Peggy, with his sons, Bill and Tom, and all of us who loved
and admired him was this: a simple model to live by.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Gordon, we will keep forever.

BANNER YEAR FOR THE BONNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Visiting Nashua was closing in on Concord High
School and had narrowed the gap to 29-20 in the first 90 seconds of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback time? Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bonner Time.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bonner, maybe the best high school basketball player this
state has ever seen and soon to be a University of Florida Gator,
took the game over.
</P>
<P>
   Two foul shots, a 3-pointer, a putback. He was fouled on an
attempted alley-oop pass from Tim Weddleton and made those two foul
shots and scored inside and had gone on a one-man 11-1 spree. Flash
to the end of the period and Bonner got the ball out front and
waved off his teammates. Dribbled a couple of times and pulled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' called one Bonner watcher from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Money in the bank. Count it. Nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner Time. It comes in two parts _ Matt Time and Becky Time _
and the Matt portion is coming to an end. What a run it's been.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this winter, Matt Bonner hit career point No. 2,000 on
the same night Becky, his sister and a junior, got No. 1,000 at her
game down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Matt's crowd whooped it up. Bonner, the No. 1 student in his
class, grinned and accepted the game ball from his coach, Bill
Haubrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another milestone,'' said an admirer in the stands that night.
``Another milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Milestones. Plural.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bonner _ a 6-foot-9 1/2-inch senior who rebounds like a
demon, loves the 3-pointer, and can play offense like a guard _
will shoot for a third straight state championship with his Concord
High team in the Class L tournament that begins next week. He will
then finish up with his Granite State Raiders AAU team and play in
the Magic Johnson Roundball Classic in Detroit and the ACC-SEC
Challenge in Raleigh, N.C., before taking his game off to
Gainesville and Gator coach Billy Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Bonner, a 6-2 junior who can handle any position and has
been playing point guard to help develop her overall game, is still
shopping for a college. She, too, will be back in the Raiders
program run by Frank Alosa and Joe Drinon as soon as the high
school season ends. She will play high-level AAU basketball this
summer, as she has the last couple, with the Philadelphia Belles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is halftime of a Becky game, and the subject is numbers:
numbers in feet and inches, not in points and rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Matt was a 23 1/2-inch baby, their mother, Paula, said. Becky
and their little brother, Luke, were average size. Luke, by the
way, is now in seventh grade and is 6-3. And growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 13 and he takes a size 16 shoe,'' Paula said. ``Matt's 18
and wears an 18. At 17, he wore a 17, and at 16, he wore a 16. He
has to be done. He has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Bonner, a schoolteacher in Concord, is 6-2. Her husband,
Dave, a letter carrier and basketball referee, is 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches rave about how hard the Bonner kids, both redheads, are
willing to work and improve. About their intelligence, on and off
the court. They love the matchup problems the Bonners create. They
marvel at what team players they are. At how competitive they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the prize,'' said Concord girls' coach Dan Gauthier.
``They see where the hard work is going to pay off. A lot of young
adults don't quite see that far down the road. They've seen the
prize, and they work every day for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a practice day, and Matt has spent a little more than
three hours at the YMCA before joining his teammates. Jump shots
off the dribble. Then 75 jump shots off the pass, spinning the ball
to himself. Then another 50 jump shots. Shots and more shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make sure I get lots of shots off,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Then dribbling. ``Figure 8s, crossovers, inside-outs, and
behind-the-backs.''
</P>
<P>
   He lifts. And later goes to practice.
</P>
<P>
   The serious individual work, the heavy drilling, starts when the
high school season ends, said Alosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't have to worry about Matt Bonner keeping up with
them at Florida,'' said the AAU coach. ``They might have to worry
about keeping up with him. And Becky Bonner can outwork them all.
Nobody outworks Becky Bonner.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Becky figures, she has to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a natural anything,'' she said. ``It takes me 20 tries
to learn something it can take someone else the first try to get.''
</P>
<P>
   So she'll do it 20 times. Forty times. Hundreds and then
thousands of times. She plays against the boys and works out with
the Raiders. Plays around the world with the Belles and this summer
will go to Paris with them. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Alosa thinks Florida and Donovan _ if not the hardest-working,
certainly one of the hardest-working coaches in the land _ are the
perfect fit for Matt. Duke had several players already at his
position. Kansas wanted him to bulk up and play on the blocks.
Connecticut, Syracuse, Florida, and Virginia were his final four,
and he wanted warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, where Donovan has put together a couple of super
recruiting classes, won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the opportunity to play on the outside, and I feel
his style of play will let me use my outside skills,'' Bonner said.
``It seemed like he really cared about his players, and he gets in
the gym with you and works on your game. They're up-tempo. I just
knew it was the right decision. There wasn't any doubt, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be time to find a school for Becky, who is
considering Boston College among others. She saw how Mike
Krzyzewski and Roy Williams and Tubby Smith and Al Skinner and all
the rest came to the Green Street gym in Concord to watch her big
brother. She knows how Florida kept in touch whenever the NCAA
allowed. She knows Donovan was there at a Florida airport when
Bonner and his AAU team landed at 6 a.m. after an all-night flight
from Las Vegas last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want someone to do that with me,'' she said. ``All the women
coaches are absolutely shocked and say that's unheard of. That's
dedication. I don't see why a women's coach shouldn't do it. But I
don't think they're going to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bonner scored all 17 points in that third quarter against
Nashua and finished with 41 for the night. He averages 37 points
and 15 rebounds a game for Concord, which is 17-1 in the regular
season that closes Friday night. Becky averages 23 points, 12
rebounds, and 5 assists and her team needs a win Friday to get into
its tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Haubrich once mentioned to freshman Matt Bonner that with his
size and athletic ability, he'd make a heck of a relief pitcher and
might want to consider going out for the baseball team. Would not
do, Bonner said. It would cut into his basketball time.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner Time. Bonner Time has him headed to the Southeastern
Conference and the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Haubrich stresses defense, and that certainly has played a large
role in the two straight state titles. Having Bonner hasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to run an offense,'' Haubrich said. ``But it always
seems to get back to Matt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not such a bad thing.

VINCE GILL HOLDS `THE KEY' TO KEEPING HIS SONGS COUNTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Not long ago, Vince Gill came to country radio with a
simple request:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please play a sad song, about a heart that's just been
stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   Would you kindly keep it country for me tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   The song ``Kindly Keep It Country'' was the second single from
Gill's latest album, ``The Key.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gill has been one of the most consistent country
hit-makers of the decade, and ``The Key'' entered the country sales
chart at No. 1 upon its release in August, most mainstream country
radio stations spurned Gill's request by ignoring the song.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because for these stations to ``kindly keep it
country,'' they'd have to drop about 90 percent of the music in
their current formats.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gill is packing a grudge. He says he knew going in that
``The Key,'' the most traditionally country album he's ever made,
might be a tough pitch to radio programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The album has been selling solidly anyway. Six months after its
release, ``The Key'' is back in the country Top 10 and soon will
join Gill's previous seven albums in the platinum category.
</P>
<P>
   ``This record was a serious labor of love,'' Gill said by phone
from his home in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to jump on the traditional bandwagon and say all
country music needs to be like this. I've made records that are
equally as contemporary as this one is country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's refreshing because it has that feel that you
don't hear much anymore. The focus that I had for creating this
record was pretty solid. I think my other records have kind of been
all over the map.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus had a lot to do with the events in Gill's life in the
past two years. In July 1997, his father died suddenly of
complications from surgery. In June 1998, he and his wife of 17
years, Janis Oliver Gill, divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the album's songs seem to have been inspired by the
split and its aftermath. ``All Those Years'' and ``There's Not Much
Love Here Anymore'' betray a dazed and hollow feeling; ``Let Her
In'' is a father asking for his daughter's acceptance of his new
girlfriend; ``Live to Tell It All'' and ``What They Call Love'' are
about learning to love again.
</P>
<P>
   But Gill warns against reading too much into the material.
Obviously, some of the songs reflect recent events in his life. But
some of them don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty rough time,'' Gill said. ``But if anything's
bothered me at all, it was what people perceived _ that they took
things verbatim. People say that because you live in the public
eye, you have to expect all of that. Well, no, you really don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's funny is, if you ask them, `Do you know when that song
was written?', the perception is usually incorrect on certain
songs. I would just sit back and marvel at what people thought they
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill, 41, says losing his father helped him keep the divorce in
perspective. The album's title track was written for his father, a
federal judge in Oklahoma who imparted a deep love of country music
to his son.
</P>
<P>
   At his father's funeral, Gill sang Guy Clark's ``The Randall
Knife,'' which Clark wrote after his own father died. That song in
turn inspired ``The Key to Life,'' which includes the lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few chords on the banjo was all he knew
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of a child, man, his fingers flew ...
</P>
<P>
   And the pain of losing him cuts like a Randall knife
</P>
<P>
   I learned a few chords on the banjo was the key to life ...''
</P>
<P>
   The line about the knife was his way of thanking Clark for his
inspiration, says Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Key'' features harmony vocals by some of the best female
singers in Nashville _ Sara Evans, Faith Hill, Allison Krauss,
Shelby Lynne, Dawn Sears and Lee Ann Womack _ along with Gill's
longtime duet partner, Patty Loveless.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Sonya Isaacs, who had been touring with Gill's band,
did the honors on ``Let Her In,'' which led to rumors that Isaacs
was the new love interest in Gill's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a rumor about every single woman I've spoken
to,'' Gill said. ``It's kind of vile. Just because she's in this
band and we're playing music, people think the worst common
denominator. It's sad. This is a woman that's steeped in her faith
and steeped in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hang on. You want to get in this world; it's not real
pretty sometimes. It's not real nice sometimes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gill says the truth is that there is no serious romantic
interest in his life at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of nice. I get to go out with a few folks, but it's
completely as friends. It's a pretty honest, healthy place to be in
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill's best-selling album, 1992's ``I Still Believe in You,''
sold more than 4 million copies. His 1994 follow-up, ``When Love
Finds You,'' sold 3 million. By contrast, 1996's ``High Lonesome
Sound'' sold just over 1 million, and ``The Key'' seems destined to
come to rest on that same plateau.
</P>
<P>
   But Gill says he's never made music for primarily commercial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've got to do is answer to myself when I lay my head down
on this pillow at night. Sure, it didn't sell as many as ``I Still
Believe in You,'' but nobody else's did, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period of time where if you had a hit record, you
sold three- or four-hundred-thousand records. Then there was period
where you sold a million records or a couple million. To take that
highest point and expect that all the time would be a little bit
unrealistic. It's just kind of flattened out a bit, and I think
everybody understands that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as good as it once was, but it's still better than it
ever was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill says his goal always has been to make music that will stand
the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look through and see what people remember, and see
what sticks, it won't be those ditties. It's gonna be ``He Stopped
Loving Her Today.'' It's gonna be ``Go Rest High on That Mountain''
and ``Look at Us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs will be the things that have longevity. That's all I'm
still trying to do. Sometimes I get it done; sometimes I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few chords in the key to life, he got it done this time.

<P>
   ``A Fish in the Bathtub'' is much ado about not very much. But
then muchness doesn't count for a lot here, and ado does, thanks to
the warmth and richness with which Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara
inscribe their longtime New York City married couple. They are
playing off their longtime dual persona, and the playing suggests a
four-hand piano recital by a couple attuned to each other's every
note and nuance. In the film, the trouble with their couple from
Queens, Sam and Molly Kaplan, may just be that they get in each
other's hair more than they're accustomed to now that he's retired
from his retail clothing business.
</P>
<P>
   The carp he lugs home and harbors in the bathtub is no more the
trouble than the fact that she wants the air conditioner on and he
wants it off (or is it vice versa?) when it's their turn to host
their pals over cards, cigars, and chat. It may be the fish that
breaks the marriage's back, but Stiller and Meara make clear that
something was ready to give, given the pileup of little irritations
on which Sam and Molly so clearly have been sitting. After she
storms out and moves in with their married son, the question is
whether they can be brought back together. The split throws their
grown children into a tizzy, especially since they've got their own
relationship problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's grouchy, but clearly doesn't mean it, something that
becomes abundantly clear in his own fish-out-of-water behavior when
he's schmoozing with his cronies. In every way but verbally, Sam
tells us something is missing. On the other hand, Molly doesn't
mind being missing. She's ready for some fresh air, and maybe even
a fresh man, although Bob Dishy's new romantic interest, a guy she
met in driving school, is hilariously anal. He behaves like a space
alien whose every last little move seems freshly learned from an
instruction manual. You're never sure whether Molly is just using
him to get a rise out of Sam.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, she plays her cards close and smart, while Sam is
too despondent to respond to the overtures of Phyllis Newman's
widowed next-door neighbor. Mark Ruffalo and Jane Adams nail the
far-from-perfect kids, he sweating his way through an impending
affair with a real estate client, she trying to stay cool in the
face of the fact that the counselor they all wind up going to is a
philandering ex-boyfriend of hers. Stiller and Meara are enormously
winning as the rumpled but essentially solid estranged couple. Joan
Micklin Silver works enough authentic texture into the neighborhood
and the Kaplans' give-and-take to lift ``A Fish in the Bathtub''
beyond the perfunctory sitcom patness into which it could have
disappeared in less savvy hands.

A PENETRATING VIEW IN SAND AND FOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG 
By Andre Dubus III 
Norton, 365 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tidy one-story bungalow at the center of this fine novel
doesn't quite have a view of the California coastline, but it has a
definitive hold on more than a few dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Owner number one, Kathy Lazaro, is a recovering addict with an
unsure footing in the world, desperate to hang onto her last link
to middle-class respectability. Owner number two, Colonel Massoud
Behrani, is an Iranian patriarch who escaped the ayatollah's
revolution only to land at the bottom of the heap in America,
working a demeaning job stabbing trash along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown together by a bureaucratic misunderstanding _ Lazaro is
evicted from her home and Behrani buys it at a county auction _
Andre Dubus's characters make perfect stand-ins for the cultural
dramas being played out in cities with significant immigrant
populations. Of course, they will rub each other raw, but there is
art and nuance, shadow and emotion, in the way Dubus draws the
reader into their sliding-down lives.
</P>
<P>
   The story has the familiar feel of everyday tragedy, yet Dubus
never trades in stereotype. An adept craftsman, Dubus _ son of the
prolific short-story writer of the same name who died late last
month _ is able to shift points of view masterfully. Behrani is
more than the faceless ``other'' behind the counter on the midnight
shift at the convenience store; Dubus shows us his smoldering pride
and mute violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country, I was not only a desk officer; I bought F-16
jets from Israel and the United States, and when I was a captain in
Tehran, a genob sarvan, I worked on the engines with my own
hands,'' Behrani muses, early in the book. ``Of course, all the
best aerocompanies are here in California but in four years I have
spent hundreds of dollars copying my credentials; I have worn my
French suits and my Italian shoes to hand-deliver my
qualifications; I have waited and then called back after the
correct waiting time; but there is nothing. I have had only one
interview and that was with a young girl in college who I believe
the company was simply giving personnel experience. That was over
two years past.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Behrani will admit, in his darker moments, to the
crimes of the shah's regime, his wife, Nadi, wants their old life
back. His son, Esmail, simply wants the chance to blossom into a
sweet variant of American teen, complete with baggy shorts and
skateboard. Behrani sees the bungalow, and its potential resale, as
the family's main chance.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro, a recovering addict hiding the chaos of her life from
her mother back in Boston, sees it as her last hope. Abandoned by
her husband, living in her Bonneville, she falls in love with the
officer who helps evict her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him about growing up in Saugus with its . . . strip of
neon car dealerships, Italian and Chinese restaurants and tanning
parlors, shopping malls, my father's small linen delivery business,
how, when I was little, I would ride with him on his
Saturday-morning runs delivering aprons and tablecloths to
restaurants, drinking too many Shirley Temples along the way until
I was giddy and my father smoked Garcia y Vegas while he drove and
listened to ball games on the radio and sometimes I'd feel sick but
I wouldn't tell him because he hardly ever spoke to me, and I
didn't want to spoil my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension builds as Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon gets drawn more
deeply into the snare, and Lazaro and Behrani harden their
positions. At first, Burdon represents the rule of law and common
decency. Like a character in a Conrad novel, however, he strips off
layers of civility as the story progresses _ and in the end, seems
to savor the result. He moves into a musty fish camp and a kind of
boozy freedom with Lazaro, and his decency seems to melt away with
every dip in the Purisima River. It is Burdon who best gives voice
to the ugly envy that eventually ignites: ``And this Arab son of a
bitch _ he knows what he's doing is wrong, but the law saves him
anyway. The day we drove by, you see the kinds of cars parked in
front of your house? You see the clothes those people had on? And
you're out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubus, who lives in Newburyport, is clearly a talent to be
reckoned with. Written over a four-year period, ``House of Sand and
Fog'' is a page-turner with a beating heart. Although a few
metaphors are overused _ cigarettes are repeatedly smoked down to
the filter, sunlit objects are often too bright to look at directly
_ most scenes have a detailed, cinematic clarity.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the characters get a little of what they want, with
wrenching consequences. Finally, their very desires and dreams _
and the flawed cultural assumptions that weigh them down _ are what
make their tragedy inevitable. Although he is talking about the
shah and his imperial imperative, Behrani's hard-won wisdom late in
the book is a fitting coda: ``For our excess we lost everything.''

WILL GOP HEED MR. CLEAN'S MESSAGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a road less traveled in politics, and it is the high
road.The individuals who thrust themselves forward for public
service are not stupid. They know how to pitch their candidacies to
your prejudices. That's how you get elected in a democracy, folks.
Figuring out the lowest common denominator of a particular
electorate's predilections is, more often than not, the path to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Running down the other candidates is the road most traveled in
elections that are close at the end. But the most successful
vote-getters convey the impression that they are a slight cut above
the other fang-and-claw politicians who would stop at nothing to
win office. Appearing to be less vicious than the other guy is
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Revulsion is not infrequently the next-to-last emotional state
of the average voter, before the voter's sense of civic duty
overcomes the guilt, anger, and remorse over having been even a
passive receptor of negative advertising. The sad fact is that
negative campaigning, and the substantial outlays on television
spots that requires, depresses turnout, discourages the
less-motivated electors, and plays into the hand of the cynical
manipulators who craft slogans, push hot buttoms, and sharpen wedge
issues to drive you to or from the polling booth.
</P>
<P>
   All but the most obtuse politicos understand this. They'd just
rather not talk about it in any but the most unctuous generalities.
The average voter, if he heard the innermost thoughts of a
victorious candidate, would feel like a restaurant patron who had
witnessed the chef dismembering the chicken with a cleaver prior to
wheeling in the coq au vin.
</P>
<P>
   We know that certain unpleasantries must occur before we carve
into a crispy breast or steaming thigh. But not thinking about the
preliminaries sustains our appetite for the chewing that lies
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican,
the man with the most interesting resume and most admirable record
of anyone running for president. Almost all Republicans are
familiar with his reputation as a gutsy, occasionally raffish POW
who thumbed his nose at his North Vietnamese captors for 6 1/2
years in the Hanoi Hilton, after his Navy fighter was shot down and
he wound up a prisoner who refused repatriation on
less-than-honorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer voters are probably aware that he is just as
independent-minded now. That he stood in front of the GOP
fund-raising juggernaut and dared his party elders to run over him.
That he bucked his party's pusillanimous allegiance to Big Tobacco.
That he called a spade a rotten spade when the telecommunications
interests bagged Congress with a hollow promise of communications
law reform.
</P>
<P>
   Now the kamikaze pilot of the GOP is at it again, as he runs for
president on the boldest of platforms: clean campaigning. Talk
about baring your chest to the enemy spears. ``Don't let us go down
the road of mindlessly destroying each other,'' he pleaded with
fellow Republican candidates last week in California. ``Scorched
earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is no Goody-two-shoes when it comes to torching
Democrats; he abhors Clinton, and expresses contempt for Gore's
fund-raising practices, which were generally spared as the GOP
plunged into Monica Madness. But when it comes to his GOP rivals,
vows McCain, ``I will not engage in personal attacks and the
politics of division. I will not stoop to negative campaigning
against my fellow Republicans. I will not run negative advertising.
I give you my word on it.''
</P>
<P>
   This plea for what amounts to unilateral disarmament was not,
naturally, completely foolhardy. McCain coupled it with this
caveat: ``I call on the other candidates to join me in that
pledge.'' That is an essential qualification. Only a fool rides
unarmed into Iowa or New Hampshire without packing some negative ad
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's husband Bob came unhinged in New Hampshire by
George Bush's last-minute negative barrage in '88. Lamar Alexander
has not forgotten how Dole pulled the same kind of last-minute
low-blow on him in '96. In both cases, negative ad blitzes over the
final weekend rejiggled the order of finish and finished Dole and
Alexander, for all practical purposes, in those election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy candidate will take counsel in the old Reagan slogan
for the Cold War: ``Trust, but verify.'' Right now Gore's path to
the Democratic nomination looks smooth; only Bill Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator, offers himself as a speed-bump in front
of Al's supercharged dragster. But the GOP faces a demolition
derby, which could wind up as just as much a voter turn-off as the
impeachment debacle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may be acting the Boy Scout, but he deserves praise for
daring to disarm: ``I hope the day never comes when for the sake of
personal ambition I try to destroy people I admire, and with whom I
agree on most issues,'' he said. I wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that I've seen more of the destroying than the
disarming in national politics of late. The politics of personal
destruction has been riding tall in the Washington saddle. And the
party of impeachment does not exactly come to this election with
clean hands.

LEAP TO PENTIUM III MORE LIKE BABY STEP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems whenever Intel Corp. begins shipping a new processor
these days, it comes with an unwanted feature _ controversy.
</P>
<P>
   When Intel's low-cost entry, the Celeron, was introduced,
critics complained about its lack of onboard memory known as cache.
And remember the floating-point math bug in the original Pentium?
The Pentium Pro and Pentium II chips had similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the Pentium III, with its built-in serial number
that privacy groups say amounts to ``Big Brother Inside.'' And
there's the fact that the Pentium III is actually a Pentium II,
with 70 extra software commands to boost multimedia performance.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at the following two high-end Pentium III systems,
I can say they're impressive _ as any system built around a
500-megahertz processor would be. But I'm not so sure the chips in
these are worthy of another Pentium version number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dimension XPS T500, $2,500, Dell Computer Corp.: In the days
before the Pentium III's late-February launch, Dell teased visitors
to its Web site with a banner ad for ``the new Dimension.'' The
implication was that Dell was going to be revamping its flagship
small and home office line.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new Dimension'' is about as revamped for a PC as the
Pentium III is for a processor. Essentially, it has more memory,
bigger hard drives, and of course the new processor. In other
words, it's about what you would expect Dell _ or any PC maker _ to
do to keep up with technology.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip,
256 megabytes of memory, a 20.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 4.8X DVD-ROM
drive with software decoding, a 16-megabyte STB Velocity 4400 video
card, a Turtle Beach Montego II audio card, a U.S. Robotics 56K fax
modem, a 3Com 10/100-megabit network card and Microsoft Office 97
for small business.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that this is a very fast machine. Dell is
using some of the best components in the business here, including
that video card. The Velocity 4400 is built around nVidia's Riva
TNT 128 chip set, which currently is one of the fastest combination
2-D/3-D cards available. This card will do just fine if you want to
stick with a single board.
</P>
<P>
   The software decoding in the DVD was excellent, and not having
to use a PCI slot for a decoder card was a big plus. And the
Montego II sound card supports positional audio, which simulates
surround-sound. With the optional Altec Lansing ACS-295 speakers _
which come with a wood-encased subwoofer _ the sound was
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension comes with a couple of games that are supposed to
show off the capabilities of the Pentium III's SSE feature _ or
``Streaming SIMD Extensions.'' The only one that really wowed me
was Rage Software's Expendable, a 3-D action game. The colors,
lighting and smooth gameplay were incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Dell ships this with the Pentium III serial number turned off.
To turn it back on, you must change BIOS settings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pavilion 8940, $2,500, Hewlett-Packard: This consumer-oriented
PC comes with plenty of bells and whistles _ and one is very cool.
It is one of the first PCs you can buy with a built-in, writeable
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8940 comes with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip,
128 megabytes of memory, a 19-gigabyte hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM
drive, an HP CD-Writer Plus drive, an eight-megabyte ATI Rage Pro
video card, a 56K fax modem, a 16-bit stereo sound card and Polk
Audio speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-Writer will be a revelation if you've never used one. It
works with both CD-Recordable (record once) and CD-ReWritable
disks. It comes with Adaptec's excellent EasyCD software, which
makes creating your own audio or data CDs drag-and-drop easy.
</P>
<P>
   The system is smartly designed, with a standard serial port on
the front of the case for plugging in a digital camera or other
serial device.
</P>
<P>
   This system is going to be great for anyone using mainstream
multimedia, but game-players may find the video card lacking. The
ATI Rage Pro is not the best card for 3-D gaming _ you probably
would want to add a Voodoo2-based card to this system.
</P>
<P>
   The sound also lacks the kind of punch gamers expect, but those
using it for children's multimedia or music will find it more than
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   This computer doesn't come with any software that showcases the
chip's abilities _ in fact, the software bundle is relatively
light. That will please those who would rather have plenty of free
hard disk space.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8940 also ships with the Pentium III serial number
turned off in the BIOS.

DE NIRO, CRYSTAL SPARK `ANALYZE THIS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANALYZE THIS 
Directed by: Harold Ramis 
Screenplay by: Ramis, Peter Tolan, Kenneth Lonergan 
Starring: Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Joe
Viterelli, Chazz Palminteri 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: R (language, a scene of sexuality and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Analyze This'' laughs battle formulas and laughs win. The
new comedy on an old subject _ the mob _ is kicked into orbit by
Robert De Niro's conflicted Mafia kingpin and Billy Crystal's
nervous shrink chosen by the mobster as his designated savior. It
may appear easier than it is for De Niro to do comic riffs on the
mob archetypes he began putting in place in ``The Godfather'' era,
but if the Mafia has declined since then, movies about the Mafia
have declined even faster. In fact, one of the things stressing out
De Niro's Gotti-like character is that he knows the mob that once
had no bigger problem than how to split tons of loot now is
struggling for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the film faces a certain struggle for credibility.
But De Niro and Crystal make it work, carrying it past its
threadbare schematics. It's an escalating pleasure to watch De
Niro's emotional zigzagging between no-nonsense brutality and the
disabling panic attacks that alarmingly are causing repeated
failures to rise to the occasion, whether at work or in bed.
Knowing that any perception of weakness by his enemies can be
fatal, De Niro doesn't so much consult Crystal's shrink as
commandeer him. As the shrink suspects, the offer is not only one
he can't refuse, it's one that means he can consider himself on
24-hour call.
</P>
<P>
   This puts considerable strain on his impending marriage to Lisa
Kudrow's broadcaster when both are vacationing in Miami on the day
of a foiled assassination attempt on the life of De Niro's Paul
Vitti. With spot-on timing and suave confidence, De Niro deftly
roots his troubled mobster firmly and confidently in the genre
while proving an expert farceur. He plays the role and plays off
it, heightening the comedy so that you find yourself laughing even
when you think it's not that funny, such as the scene in which
Crystal tells him to hit a pillow when he loses his temper,
whereupon he whips out a pistol and fills it full of holes, and the
room fills with feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's falling apart, he manages to never let us forget
that the word ``closure,'' at least initially, has an entirely
different meaning to him than to his therapist. Funny, effortless,
virtuosic, he even keeps grooving when the film starts going soft
as some of the therapy starts to work. One of the nonsurprises in
this film of nonsurprises is that the conflicts of both men are
traceable to their respective fathers, although Vitti's was rubbed
out while Crystal's is still very much alive and competitive. In
contrast to Vitti's Vesuvian volatility, Crystal's Ben Sobol has
adopted a cerebral air.
</P>
<P>
   Because De Niro's Vitti is so big, Crystal's Sobol can take a
minimalist approach. This is one of the things that has been making
Crystal a more and more interesting actor. People think of him as
the extroverted stand-up comic spark plug who sometimes
single-handedly renders the Oscarcasts watchable. But here he works
small and makes it count, especially when it sets the stage for a
hilarious reversal as he's forced to put on a tough-guy act as a
last-minute substitute for De Niro at a mob summit. You'd hate to
see anybody but De Niro on the job when the mobster does get in
touch with his gentler, more nurturing self. He keeps us from
longing for gangster cliches to wipe out the psychobabble.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to see Kudrow work her way up the A-list, even though
she's given little to play here except formula consternation, and
Chazz Palminteri is a decidedly secondary presence as Vitti's chief
rival. But Joe Viterelli's blocky, beefy, thick-skinned right-hand
man to Vitti is a big plus, chiefly because of his priceless
reaction shots that tell us that he isn't liking what he's seeing,
but, good soldier that he is, he's going to keep his mouth shut.
``Analyze This,'' in short, is not the kind of film that wants to
get anywhere near heavy analysis. But the laughs it delivers won't
make it seem to matter much. You've seen most of this stuff before,
but you'll never see it more wonderfully executed than by De Niro
on the roll he's on here.

FROM ROMANIA, WITH LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``I left Romania five years ago,'' says violinist Irina
Muresanu. ``I would never have believed you if you had tried to
tell me then about all the wonderful things that were going to
happen to me _ that I would have played the concerts I have played,
that I would live in an amazing city like Boston, that I would be
teaching at the New England Conservatory, that I would have had the
opportunity to play a Stradivarius. I wouldn't have believed 20
percent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu, now 27, first came to America on a scholarship to the
University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana after she graduated from
the Music Academy in Bucharest. A year later, she came to Boston to
audition for the artist-diploma program at NEC. ``Between the
audition and the interview I had a few hours, and I was very
nervous, so I went for a walk ... and fell in love with Boston. I
grew up in Bucharest, so I am a city girl.''
</P>
<P>
   In her American years, Muresanu has toured the world under the
auspices of the Pro Musicis Foundation, taken second prize in the
1997 Washington International Competition, formed a piano trio with
two friends, played the Bruch Concerto with Benjamin Zander and the
Boston Philharmonic (using a borrowed Strad), and begun a teaching
career at the conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   She still returns annually to play concertos with orchestras in
Romania, and has appeared with international orchestras such as the
Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Her artist-diploma recitals at the
NEC over the last couple of years have generated considerable
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Even offstage, Muresanu looks like a '30s movie star in a
moodily lit studio portrait, and creates an onstage aura at least
as glamorous as Anne-Sophie Mutter's; she has the violinistic chops
and the musical intelligence to support and surpass her image.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation over lunch last week, Muresanu was intelligent,
youthfully enthusiastic, and, above all, focused _ she had to be
focused in order to survive as a musician in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father loved music,'' she says, ``and he had an amazing
ear. Even when I was a baby, he was always testing me, and when I
could sing little tunes back to him correctly, he was very excited.
I started off in ballet, which I studied for seven years. I loved
it. This was my very first taste of the stage. Every year there was
staged performance, with costumes, makeup, and an audience. When I
was 7, my parents gave me a little violin as a Christmas present. I
have to tell you, I was not very excited about it. I wanted to play
the piano _ somebody else has to keep the piano in tune! But in the
end my parents convinced me. `How many pianos are there in an
orchestra?' is what my father asked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu says the violin did not come easily to her. ``I am
left-handed, so I had a very hard time learning how to hold the
bow. I spent a lot of time learning to catch a tennis ball with my
right hand! But I have to tell you, my parents were amazingly
supportive, and they put tremendous time and energy into my music,
taking me to concerts, the theater, and the opera. All this was
good training, even though in the beginning I wasn't looking for a
career in music. I thought I would be a dancer, and when I was 11 I
had to choose. I was very good in ballet because I knew music
better than the other kids; I had a sense of rhythm. But the music
virus got into my blood; I knew music was something I could not
live without. Also I realized that a dancer's life is short, and I
could play the violin my whole life. But I still love ballet''
</P>
<P>
   Music study was not encouraged in the Romania of Nicolae
Ceaucescu. ``Life in Central Europe got harder and harder, and
music was considered a luxury; to study music was not politically
correct. The Ceaucescus were not interested in the arts, and wanted
to keep them undercover. In the ninth grade of music school, there
was an exam, and 50 percent of the students had to leave. Later, 18
violinists auditioned for six places in the Music Academy in
Bucharest. The competition was very tough, but it also led to an
incredibly high level of playing. If I wanted something, I knew I
had to work hard to get it. At an early age, I had to take my life
into my own hands _ whether this is good or not, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu's principal teacher for 13 years in Romania was Stefan
Gheorghiu, a notable musician and pedagogue. At the time, the
Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu was married to Stefan Gheorghiu's
son, and Mureanu knew her long before she became an international
superstar _ and a diva of terrifying reputation. ``Angela was a
nice girl back then, but the singer's world _ that must make you
tough. Violinists were trained to be soloists; this was the Russian
system. We played in orchestras and sang in the chorus as a part of
school, but we didn't play much chamber music. I was very lucky
because every three weeks I was soloist with a different Romanian
orchestra. This was a tremendous experience, and it built my
confidence. I think stage experience is more valuable to a musician
than anything else. You have to spend time inside the four walls of
a practice room, but that is not your final goal. Over my years in
Romania, I studied and played most of the standard concertos,
although there are still some 20th-century concertos by Stravinsky,
Shostakovich, and Bartok I would love to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu's decision to come to America was not lightly
undertaken. ``It meant leaving my family, for one thing, but my
family had invested so much in my playing that I really had no
other choice. My father has died, which was very tough; my mother
is still in Romania, but she was here a year ago and she really
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu singles out several recent experiences as particularly
valuable. One was her work as a Pro Musicis artist; musicians
chosen by this program play recitals in major international centers
as well as in hospitals, rehabs, senior centers, and prisons.
``Doing this changed the way I look at making music. In Hong Kong,
I played in a hospital for people with mental disabilities. I
played for an hour, and the staff was amazed because they said
these patients couldn't sit still for one minute. This opened a
door for me. We think of music as an acquired taste for educated
people, but in fact music touches many people very deeply and it
can reach audiences nobody thought of reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu is also very devoted to her teachers at the New England
Conservatory, particularly to Patricia Zander, who has coached her
in chamber music, and to Michele Auclair, the legendary French
violinist who commutes from Paris to teach at NEC. ``The fresh way
Patricia Zander approaches a piece every time constantly amazes me.
I had heard about Michele Auclair from Stefan Gheorghiu. Some
people complain that she is very demanding both technically and
musically, but in fact she is very realistic; she tells you the
truth, good or bad. But she has been influential in other ways _
one has to go from music to real life. How do I organize my
practicing when I have no time? How do I handle the paperwork, the
management things? How do I develop my own conception of everything
I play? How do I reconcile my need for friends and for a life with
my passion for music? She has asked me to face all these issues,
and helped me to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Muresanu says that ``of course'' she still dreams of having a
great career, but she has learned to focus on other goals. ``What I
want from myself is to be a good chamber music partner, a teacher
that students can look up to, a good musician. If I succeed in
those things, everything else will come along.''

DON'T BE BLIND TO BUILDUP OF DIRT ON THE INTERNAL ROLLERS OF MOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: You missed one important step in ``mouse cleaning.'' At least
the Microsoft Intellimouse tends to collect garbage around the
interior rollers, which are moved by the ball itself. They collect
so much stuff you may even have to use your fingernail to loosen
the junk with the same cleaner-soaked cloth you use on the ball. I
cleaned my mouse several times as you described, before finding the
problem was junk on the rollers.
</P>
<P>
   A.: You're right. After a recent column on how to clean a mouse
that's ``sticking,'' several readers pointed out that it's
important to clean around the rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Some recommended using a Q-tip swabbed in denatured alcohol.
Another suggested using an X-acto knife to clean it _ it had
accumulated hairs around the rollers, much as string gets wound
around the beater brush on a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A reader had a question from someone whose Windows 98 disk
defragmenter was working very slowly. You suggested it was just a
matter of time, that the Windows 98 defragger takes a while to
process usage logs that let it optimize files differently from
Windows 95. Well, I tried just waiting _ and 24 hours later, I was
still waiting. Obviously, I have a different problem. Got any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, I don't, but my boss, Assistant Managing Editor
Scott Clark, does. He ran into this same problem, and offered the
following:
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem appeared to be related to partitions I had on one
drive. I could run a traditional defrag, but when I tried to run
the one where it moves the most used applications to the front of
the drive, it would die right after starting to move stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two solutions _ disable the `rearrange files' by unchecking
that box under `Settings' in defrag; or, instead of starting defrag
from the defrag app, launch My Computer, highlight the drive you
want to defrag, right click and select Properties, click the Tools
tab and click the defrag button. For some odd reason, this approach
will allow you to do a `rearrange' defrag.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the second solution comes from Microsoft tech
support.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Windows 98, I used to be able to get a thumbnail of JPG
files in a folder that was set up as a Web page. Suddenly, that
doesn't work. I can see GIF and TIF and even HTML files, but not
JPGs. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A: This preview feature is one of the nicest benefits of having
Internet Explorer act as the desktop interface in Windows 98. If
you have a lot of graphics on your system _ say, a folder where you
keep scanned or digital photos _ just highlight a graphics file and
watch a small version of it magically appear in the margin on the
left.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the association between these thumbnails and
the Web-page view comes ``undone.'' Sometimes it's because another
application is installed that tries to handle the association. This
seems to happen more frequently with JPGs than with other graphics
types.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's a common enough occurrence that the solution is
found on several Windows tech support sites, including this nifty
one: www.windows-help.net.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you do: Go to Start, then Run, and enter this in the
Open field: regsvr32.exe /i shdocvw.dll and then hit the Enter key.
This will restore your Web preview for JPGs, but not remove the
master association for whatever program you may use to edit them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I put a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive in my computer, but Windows
says I only have 5.9 gigabytes. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Your drive needs to use a certain amount of disk space to
hold information about where data and programs will be stored.

GRAMMY VOTERS MISS THE POINT OF REAL RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We kept our fingers crossed as our hearts beat furiously, hoping
that (itals)this(unitals) year, the Grammys would do right by rap.
</P>
<P>
   But as the awards in the three rap categories were handed out
last week at the LA ceremony, it became clear: The Grammy gods
don't like rap in its natural state _ angry and raw.
</P>
<P>
   Their choices have become social commentary. They like the
artists who rap about the joys of life or being spiritual, artists
who don't swear, artists whose music should really belong in the
pop category.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they love Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, when Smith debuted as the Fresh Prince, with his
suburban-friendly ``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' he's been the
darling of Grammy voters. He won a Grammy for that song and has
been winning them ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he won for ``Men in Black,'' a song that employs his
boy-wonder formula: sampled dance music and cute lyrics devoid of
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he won for rap solo performance, for the upbeat,
sugary-sweet ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.'' Unlike most rap albums, his
doesn't have a ``clean version.'' That's because it's sanitary
enough for a third-grader.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Jiggy:'' (itals)Everybody looking at me/glance at the
kid/wishing they was dancing the jig/here with this handsome
kid/ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba/I just bite it/it's for the
look/I don't light it/ (unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It's the stuff parents love, and the kind of lyrics that make
Grammy voters feel good all over. With Smith as the
Grammy-appointed ambassador of rap, white America can feel proud.
Everything else gets stuffed in a closet, so that no one has to
deal with the ugly realities of ghetto life that are expressed in
real rap music.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy voters seem to figure that if they reward rappers who
write lyrics about gang-banging, womanizing, or smoking weed that
they are somehow accepting the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While some rappers glorify violence, most of it is an expression
of what surrounds them. Come on, what do they expect kids who grew
up in ghettos to rap about, the country club?
</P>
<P>
   Rappers are artists who choose to write about the pain and
anguish they witness everyday. If they started rapping Will
Smith-style, they would be abandoning their communities, the places
that have no political voice.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, rap is the only voice of these communities, but
it's one that the Grammy voters don't hear.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists say they don't need a Grammy to feel validated,
that a true rap artist is better off not getting mainstream
attention. But deep inside, they want recognition. The fans do,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So as Foxy Brown, Missy Elliott, and Sean Combs stood at the
microphone, reading the list of nominees for best solo rap
performance last Wednesday, a nation of rap lovers held their
breaths. Would it be Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes
or, ugh, Will Smith?
</P>
<P>
   Foxy gave a shout-out to her homie Jay-Z, who wasn't there even
though he was nominated for three Grammys. Jay-Z said he boycotted
the awards because ``too many major rap artists continue to be
overlooked'' in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   As Foxy announced the nominees, she stumbled before saying
``Will Smith.'' Was that a mistake? Did she get nervous and forget?
Or did she, like many of us, choke on the thought of even having
him in the category?
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef Jean should have won for ``Gone Till November,'' his
impassioned story about young men chasing money and dreams. Or
Busta Rhyme for his eloquent rhyming skills on ``Dangerous.''
(Though a better nomination choice would've been Rhyme's ``Put Your
Hands Where My Eyes Could See.'')
</P>
<P>
   Grammy voters messed up in the second rap category, performance
by a duo or group. Clearly, OutKast should've won with ``Rosa
Parks,'' a party anthem that blends in elements of funk, folk, and
traditional R &AMP; B. But who won? ``Intergalactic'' by the Beastie
Boys, three out-of-touch white dudes from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But rap is making strides.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill won five Grammys, the highest number of Grammys ever
given to a hip-hop artist. Jay-Z won for best rap album, but his
win was scrolled along the TV screen just before a commercial
break, making hip-hop lovers wonder why that wasn't announced on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Jay-Z's third album, ``In My Lifetime, Vol. 2 . . . Hard Knock
Life,'' sold more than 5 million copies, a million more than ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' It also was the No. 1 album for five
weeks on the Billboard Album Chart.
</P>
<P>
   All we can hope for is that the Grammy gods wake up to the
reality of what rap music is supposed to represent. It's not Will
Smith.

COMPUTERS: WHAT'S ONLINE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tech talk: A few weeks back, What's Online offered a Web site
devoted to funny technical support anecdotes. Well, they were funny
to the technicians, anyway, who used much of the Web site's content
to mock users. (See Spam! at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/12/online.html) That
item inspired one reader to offer up two more, similar sites.
Computer Stupidities at rinkworks.com/stupid/ is similar to Spam!
in that it includes written anecdotes submitted by technicians. But
this one isn't quite as mean-spirited. An example: ``Tech Support:
`Do you have 3{-inch diskettes?' Customer: `No, I only have 3 of
them.''' There's even an area called ``Stupid Tech Support'' in
which the tables are turned. Help Desk Funnies at
www.helpdeskfunnies.com goes beyond just printing stories _ you can
also hear them. Along with written anecdotes, Help Desk Funnies
features recorded tech support phone calls in either RealAudio or
WAV format. There are some hilarious moments here, such as one call
in which a woman thinks she's called a TV preacher's prayer line
and has wound up with printer tech support. Or, listen to one man
threaten to throw his new digital telephone into the bay _ and then
talk himself out of it. Some of the calls include strong language,
including one in which an America Online subscriber denies he used
vulgarity in a chat room by screaming epithets at the poor customer
service representative.

   _ Rule Britannica: Encyclopedia Britannica, the venerable
reference work, nearly was killed by the computer revolution. While
it was still selling only books for thousands of dollars and later
a CD-ROM version for hundreds of dollars, its competitors had moved
to CD versions selling at less than $100. But the Internet has
offered Britannica a new lease on life, even allowing it to become
_ gasp! _ hip. Here's evidence: the Brittannica's new Web site at
www.britishinvasion.eb.com/ devoted to the British Invasion of the
1960s. The site looks at the monolithic pop bands that came out of
that era, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who.
You can hear sound clips, print out trading cards and read the
stories of each band. And here's a good example of how much times
have changed _ while parents in the 1960s disapproved of the
``longhair music'' coming out of England, it's now a subject of
study in schools. There is even a study guide for teachers at the
British Invasion Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unreal reality: In the 1970s, PBS enthralled American TV
viewers with a show that involved TV cameras spending every waking
moment chronicling a family. ``An American Family,'' featuring the
Louds of Santa Barbara, Calif., was considered a seminal event for
television. That later inspired the less-than-seminal ``Real
World'' series from MTV, in which a group of 20-somethings is
thrown together in a house somewhere in the world while the TV
cameras roll. Now we have ``Hear and Now,'' which uses a Web camera
to track the lives of six friends sharing a house. Located at
www.hereandnow.net, the site leans more to ``Real World'' than ``An
American Family.'' It's obviously more a financial than a
sociological experiment _ there is a ``contact us'' page with
separate e-mail addresses for investment and advertising
opportunities. The camera isn't always up _ it's more like ``Here
and Occasionally'' _ and when it is, you get the feeling things are
being staged. You'll need the Windows Media Player, and the site
works best with Internet Explorer as your browser.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auto magic: Here's a little secret about machines: if you know
how they work inside, your skills at using them will improve.
That's true for the personal computer, and for the automobile. If
you understand how steering works, for example, you may be better
able to judge whether your vehicle can take that hairpin turn up
ahead. Learn about what makes your car tick at Automotive Learning
Online at www.innerbody.com/innerauto/Default.htm. The site is
broken down by the different systems in a car, from the braking
system to the electric system. It combines images and Java to teach
you the various components and what they do. Move your cursor over

   _ Looks familiar: Those who've already started trying the latest
version of CompuServe's client may think it looks a little
familiar, and there's good reason. CompuServe 2000, available at
www.compuserve.com/cs2000conversion/, is based on the America
Online 4.0 software. Since AOL now owns CompuServe, the larger,
consumer service is trying to apply its ease-of-use approach to its
business-oriented acquisition. But be aware these are two separate
services, and using them both will cost you extra. Eventually,
CompuServe hopes to wean current users over to the new software.

AS SCANDAL GROWS, IMAGE MALONE HONED TAKES A BRUISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Say it ain't so, Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Skeletons in the treasury closets? Corruption at the top levels
of the treasury staff? Former treasurer Joseph D. Malone himself
apparently turning a purblind eye to a rogue appointee who is said
to have landed his job with the help of one of Malone's top
fund-raisers?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the man who spent eight years proclaiming himself
Beacon Hill's one true reformer has a whole different legacy: His
office has spawned the biggest scandal to hit the State House since
the MBM affair of the 1970s, which revolved around bribery in the
awarding of contracts to build the UMass campus in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Treasurer Robert E. Foley's arrest Wednesday on
charges he was the mastermind of a $2.4 million theft from the
treasury has quickly reframed a scandal that Malone had hoped would
be limited to low-level functionaries. Instead, it's now apparent
that the corruption involved Malone's own hires _ and reached to
the highest levels of the office he ran.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for the legacy of _ and any possible political
future for _ Malone, who came to Beacon Hill vowing to bust up the
web of patronage and sweetheart deals left behind by that legendary
rascal Robert Q. Crane. But Crane never had a scandal like this.
And as each day brings revelations more startling than the last,
Malone's reputation steadily erodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got this word, I felt like somebody had punched
me in the stomach,'' Malone said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively, somebody has. For Foley has delivered a body blow
to Malone's once pristine reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crushes his reputation as a clean outsider,'' said Tobe
Berkovitz, professor of communication at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike John Trischitta, the low-level employee charged with
helping someone on the outside steal $6.5 million, Foley was one of
Malone's hand-picked deputy treasurers. It helped that he was the
business partner and friend of Malone political associate and
fund-raiser Richard Arrighi.
</P>
<P>
   More important, sources say that when other top Malone aides
urged the treasurer to fire Foley last year, Malone refused to
budge. Instead, the former treasurer protected Foley, to the
disgust of many on his staff, who were convinced there was
something fishy about what was going on in the Unpaid Check Fund,
the obscure fund that Trischitta managed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Malone turned that forgiving eye to Foley at a time
during his gubernatorial campaign when he was denouncing Paul
Cellucci's ethics and character on a daily basis, charging that
Cellucci opened his office to lobbyists and special interests.
Campaign aides implied the Republican chief executive could never
measure up to Malone on the integrity scale.
</P>
<P>
   But now a scandal worse than any of the wispy charges Malone
regularly threw at his political rivals has enveloped the office he
directed for eight years. For a man who hopes to resurface in
electoral politics in the future, the headlines are devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole stock in trade was that we needed a Republican
treasurer to be an honest check on the Democrats,'' said John Berg,
professor of Suffolk University's graduate program in professional
politics. ``It really just undercuts the whole basis of his
political success. Unless something new comes to light and he is
vindicated, I think it is big political trouble for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone is hopeful that all is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dust settles, the people of Massachusetts will
hopefully realize that this wasn't a cultural problem in the
treasurer's office,'' he said. ``This was some bad apples who did
some foolish tings.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has also highlighted another weakness of a man who
operated as a political lone wolf. With Malone's reputation taking
a pounding, no one on the Republican side seems particularly
willing to defend him. Indeed, some on the Republican side see the
scandal consuming Malone's reputation as poetic justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe doesn't have many friends in politics, because he carved
out his public image at the expense of a lot of other people,
including Republicans,'' said one GOP source. ``Anyone who knows
Joe knows he would have had seven press conferences by now if he
weren't the subject of the story.''

XTC POPS BACK UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Apple Venus Volume 1'' starts with the sound of dripping
water, then a deep rumbling bass note is plucked. Strings enter,
creating this crazy counterpoint. The journey is about to begin,
but it could be anybody, the Verve, the Orb. Horns enter. Hmmm. The
melody begins to take shape and a high-pitched voice enters. It is
then that a feeling of warmth rushes in and washes over you and _
nearly a quarter-century after this long trip started, many years
since the last album of new material _ we know: We're back in the
Oz that is XTC. Everything might be a little off-center, but it all
sounds very much all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you still think it's got our fingerprints?'' says XTC
singer-songwriter-guitarist Andy Partridge. ``It's true, however
you arrange it, it's still there. It's still Jell-O, if it's Jell-O
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not, necessarily, a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' Partridge says. ``I mean my
personality has changed a drop of sand a day and my art is going is
going to come out a certain way.''
</P>
<P>
   XTC arose out of England's mid-to-late-'70s punk rock movement,
but showed more melodic range, and more sense of irony, of
storytelling, than most of their peers. They created a vital body
of work through the 1980s and scored with songs such as ``Senses
Working Overtime,'' ``Ball and Chain,'' ``Dear God,'' ``The Mayor
of Simpleton,'' and, in 1992, ``The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead.''
Then they went ``on strike'' against their record company, Virgin,
as Partridge likes to put it, until they wriggled out of what they
considered an onerous financial arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A four-CD boxed set of live material, ``Transistor Blast,'' was
released late last year. ``Apple Venus Volume 1,'' XTC's first
album of new material since 1992, came out last month. It is an
ambitious pop record _ more acoustic than electric, with a
pronounced orchestral flavoring. As the title suggests, it is one
of two halves. The initial plan was to release a double CD, but
more rational thinking kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, legally, we were allowed to make records again,'' says
Partridge, ``I said to myself, `Well, why don't we just take the
best of all this stuff and make a genuine, bona fide two-disc set?'
As the music that was written across 1992 to 1994 came out
acoustically or orchestrally, that would make a great disc 1. And
then the music that came out from '94 to '96 _ I'm being very broad
here _ was mostly noisy and electric, so that would make a good
Volume 2. They could reflect two sides from the same coin. But,
naively, we didn't really take into consideration the money it
would cost to get these recorded well, the studio time it would
take, and the fact that we picked a very good producer (Haydn
Kendall) whose painstaking qualities are kind of tortoise-on-glue
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The early XTC, which scored a hit with ``Life Begins at the
Hop'' in 1979, was a more raucous outfit than today's unit. There
was ``a very charming naive energy to it. They really don't know
what the hell they are doing, but they are doing their darnedest,''
ventures Partridge, slipping into the third person. ``It is like
naive painting _ the perspective's all wrong, color choices are
maybe not great, but they are trying to finish off as nicely as
they can. It's charming, it's folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Virgin, the band has signed with TVT in America.
The group has also lost a member, drummer Dave Gregory, leaving the
duo of Partridge and bassist-singer Colin Moulding. Gregory
recently let loose with an anti-Partridge screed in the English pop
music magazine Mojo. Partridge says the interview reads as though
Gregory is Islam and Partridge is ``Salman Rushdie, the devil
incarnate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, Partridge's 14-year marriage fell apart. ``The
whole thing about finding myself out to be a cuckolded husband was
extremely painful,'' says Partridge. ``But I seem to have predicted
it all in (songs) and anyway, I did find myself thrown away. I said
to myself, `OK, this is the most painful thing that's ever happened
to me, and I'm going to do two things: I'm going to cut out
drinking or cut it right down because I don't want to be over at
the pub crying into my beer like a country and Western casualty. I
don't want to be a country lyric. And the other thing was: I'm not
going to write any divorce songs, because I don't want to turn into
Phil Collins. I didn't want to write songs for swinging divorcees.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I carried on writing and oddly enough felt very inspired. I
suppose the more hammer blows, the sharper the sword gets, and
things built up. I was so built up, I was so angry and so upset,
that I thought, if I don't write this down in some way, in some
form, I'm going to explode. It was written in '93, in the depths of
my despair. I gave myself the luxury of writing one divorce song.''
That is ``Dictionary,'' a pointed and joyously profane number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a theraputic treatment,'' Partridge continues. ``I
immediately felt better. And then I fell in love again and my life
took a great big upswing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is reflected in the music. There's both a sense of
giddiness and maturity in today's XTC _ some bitterness, some
spite, a lot of wonder. Rather than suggesting an old pop group's
calcification, the orchestration helps bring the songs alive,
albeit in a gentle, pastoral fashion. XTC's music recalls the more
experimental sides of the Beatles and the Kinks.
</P>
<P>
   Does Partridge consider it a mature record? ``I think so,'' says
Partridge, ``but `mature' can have negative connotations,
especially in the music business _ `Well, they passed their finest
point and they are still making records, isn't it cute.' It can
have that kind of let's-be-nice-to-them-they-are-old-now
connotation. I have to say, though, that most records with a tag of
mature tied to them are not good, they have a tiredness of life. .
. . Let's reclaim `mature' and say mature as in, confident, more
relaxed with what you do, and getting better, like a piece of fine
furniture or cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming as no surprise to any of its fans, XTC will not be
touring. Partridge had a notable freakout on stage years ago, but
says his stage avoidance these days is based on principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music,'' he says, ``seems to be the only art form where making
your finished art product is not enough. You make an oil painting,
and . . . love it or hate it, that's the oil painting. You put your
life and soul into making a record, which you are proud as punch
of, and they say, `Yeah, but when are you going to tour?' ''
</P>
<P>
   When young, he says, it was ``good fun, the sense of being in a
gang with guitars instead of knives. We were young men drinking the
world dry and going around the planet for the first time, and
making a horrible sound, just being young and arrogant and stupid.
And it was great fun. And then, after five years of it, you start
to think, `I don't really want to do this. I want to live in a
house. I don't want to live in a hotel. I don't want to wake up
every morning and see orange wallpaper and corporate art and have
to ring down a receptionist and say, ``Excuse me, where am I?'' '
''
</P>
<P>
   Partridge now lives a normal life, so normal, he says that a
television documentary crew proposed a piece on him and he warned
what they would get is this: ``I'm going to get up in the morning,
put on my duffel coat, and they're going to follow me around to the
store to get some milk and that's going to be it. I don't live an
`art' life.''

AFTER FOLK OUTING, WILCO REGAINS ROCK `TEETH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Tweedy of Wilco was curled up in the quiet
Hotel La Reve off Sunset Boulevard, awaiting the recent Grammy
Awards. Wilco and Billy Bragg were up for best contemporary folk
album for ``Mermaid Avenue,'' consisting of new music they wrote to
some old Woody Guthrie lyrics. They would lose to Lucinda Williams,
but Tweedy was still pleased with the Grammy nomination, even if it
might confuse fans interested in Wilco's new album, which comes out
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be really funny to put a sticker on our new record
that says `Grammy nominee for best contemporary folk album.' You
know, there will be a lot of disappointed folk fans,'' he said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. It's a long way from the archival Guthrie
project to the progressively melodic new disc, ``Summer Teeth.'' It
is Wilco's best record yet and moves the band farther along the
roots music road, encompassing influences from the Beatles and John
Lennon (from his solo career), to the Velvet Underground and
singer/poet Leonard Cohen, to new realms of folk, country, and pop
interplay.
</P>
<P>
   The new album is a kind of ``Sgt. Pepper's'' version of Wilco,
with an adventurous melding of styles and instrumental sounds, from
electric, acoustic, and pedal steel guitars, to timpani, horns,
flute, harmonica, strings, piano, synthesizer, and cheesy, but not
overdone, organ riffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonically, it's all over the place . . . We were just doing
what we always kind of do _ trick ourselves into thinking we're not
making a record and let it take shape,'' said Tweedy, who is based
in Chicago and was formerly in Uncle Tupelo, whose members
splintered into Wilco or Son Volt (another popular roots band).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to work on a song until something surprising
came up,'' said Tweedy.
</P>
<P>
   It came up most vividly on ``Pieholden Suite,'' which takes the
name Pieholden (adapted from a phrase the band heard a Lebanese
street vendor use) and constructs not one, but five songs around
it. It starts with piano and acoustic guitar, then picks up tempo
with horns and harmonica. ``The idea was that we would take pieces
of it and re-record different sections and splice it all back
together . . . When we were done, it was like, `OK, that's going to
get us compared to `Sgt. Pepper's.' Whatever, it was just fun to
do.``
</P>
<P>
   Hey, there are worse comparisons than to the landmark ``Sgt.
Pepper's,'' he's told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the group used an intimate, Lennon-like, piano-ballad
style on ``We're Just Friends,'' a Lou Reed/Velvets guitar sting on
``I'm Always in Love,'' and a sparse Cohen-like vocal on ``She's a
Jar,'' with the classic Tweedy lyric, ``She's a jar with a heavy
lid/a pop-quiz kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and it's a highly consistent album of fruitful
experimentation and studio effort that took a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot more collaboration in the studio this time. We
just worked a little closer together than we ever have,'' Tweedy
said of bandmates Jay Bennett, Ken Coomer, John Stiratt, and
touring member /keyboardist Leroy Bach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We retracked almost every song on the record one or two times,
and some songs up to four and five times,'' Tweedy said. ``We were
really not looking for perfection, but looking for it to be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up is touring. Wilco will be at Pearl Street in Northampton
on April 19. The group also expects to play in Boston and may do
some shed dates with Tom Petty &AMP; the Heartbreakers and some
European shows with R.E.M.

<P>
   --Wyclef Jean &AMP; the Refugee All-Stars at the House of Blues in
Los Angeles: Wyclef Jean is known mostly as a hip-hop act, first
with the Fugees and now with the Refugee All-Stars, but he defied
that stereotype in concert. Saying that he should also be
considered a rock 'n' roller, he showed why by breaking into Carl
Perkins's ``Blue Suede Shoes'' introduction (``one for the money,
two for the show, three to get ready, go cat go''), then added
improvised guitar riffs that were somewhere between Jimi Hendrix
and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Wyclef is a complete entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   --Cybill Shepherd at the Cineaste in Los Angeles: She may have
film and TV star credentials, but Shepherd is an erratic mess
around a microphone in a hotel lounge show. Most of it was
disconcertingly shrill. She sang some jazz standards and blew
through the Elvis Presley hit ``Hound Dog,'' but don't expect to
see her at the FleetCenter any time soon.

MOVE TO NEW ENGLAND, AUTHOR TELLS LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So what does Monica Lewinsky do next? Andrew Morton,
the author of her official biography, ``Monica's Story,'' says he
has given her one suggestion _ move to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her Boston would be the best place for her,'' Morton
said Thursday in a midtown Manhattan hotel suite, where he was
promoting his book, which hit bookstores worldwide in the morning
and soared instantly to the No. 1 slot onamazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's classic Boston,'' said the British author, who a few
years ago wrote a best-selling biography of Princess Diana and said
that New England is his favorite part of the country. ``That sort
of shabby chic, roses, a mix of urban and country _ she loves that.
We talked about this a fair amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous intern in history was noncommittal. ``She
doesn't know what she wants to do,'' Morton shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The New York tabloids suggested Thursday that she become a
talking head on a TV roundtable show. But this might merely
indicate that, after Barbara Walters's two-hour interview with
Lewinsky, which aired on ABC-TV the night before, there might not
be much left to say about the woman whose bizarre affair nearly
sank a president.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's book does contain some new bits for the Lewinsky
compleatist. Most vivid is the fullest picture to date of _ as one
chapter calls it _ ``Terror in Room 1012,'' the 12-hour session of
psychological torture she said she underwent at the hands of
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's deputies at the Ritz-Carlton
hotel near the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was unable to talk about this episode with Barbara
Walters because the immunity agreement she signed with Starr
prohibits her from discussing it with the news media. Starr has
said his aides employed procedures commonly used by law enforcement
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky could discuss it with Morton because, as he put it,
``I'm not part of a news media.'' Morton, 45, used to be a reporter
_ at one time, a member of the London tabloid pack that covered the
Royal Family. But, he said, ``I've not worked for a paper in 12
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton laughed at the notion of Starr trying to indict Lewinsky
for violating the rules at this point. ``That'd be fun, wouldn't
it?'' he said. ``It'd be funny if he tried to subpoena me, or
indict me, or whatever you call it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest revelation of the book, if Monica's story is true,
might be the degree to which it shows _ at least at the beginning
of their affair _ President Clinton pursuing the young intern as
much as the intern pursued the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what people want to ignore,'' Morton said. ``The
president of the United States was acting like a love-sick
teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky might have flashed him her thong, but Clinton was the
one who told her to come see him on weekends and phoned her as
often as four nights a week. The book shows him blowing kisses, or
mouthing ``I miss you,'' to her in crowds. And it makes a fairly
compelling case that he really did wear certain neckties to send
her a signal.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's book is based on 3 1/2 weeks of interviews with
Lewinksy, her family, and her friends, from mid-November to early
December, starting at 8 a.m. every day and ending, as Morton put
it, ``when she dropped dead of exhaustion, usually till 4 p.m. or 7
or; if she was on a roll, till 9. She can really yack when she gets
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The two also spent casual time together. ``I went shopping with
her,'' Morton said. ``And we went to see Woody Allen's `Celebrity,'
which was weird because it's about a scandal and oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He landed the book contract in the unlikeliest way. In October,
a London paper reported that he was writing a Lewinsky biography.
It wasn't true, but, on the basis of the report, Lewinsky's lawyer
called Morton's British publisher to see whether he was interested
in meeting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and I clicked right away,'' Morton said. He found her
similar, in some ways, to the subject of his best-selling biography
up to now _ Princess Diana. ``They were both seen in a certain
light, but were really very different,'' he said. He also called
Lewinsky ``the most candid, honest person I've ever spoken with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's television appearance sparked interest Thursday at
several Boston bookstores. ``There was a store buzz and everyone
was pretty excited,'' said Brian Jefferson, manager of Borders
Books &AMP; Music on School Street.
</P>
<P>
   At Lauriat's Books on Copley Square, manager Mark Flagg said his
store received about 15 telephone calls Thursday about the book,
which is a lot because most of his business is generated by walk-in
sales. But he said he doubted the longevity of the Lewinsky boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the type of book that will sell for a week or
two and then just stop,'' Flagg said. The early buyers ``are the
rubbernecker type of people who want to see what's going on.''

WAITING OUT THE SMALL-CAP SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Laporte and the executives at Levi Strauss have a lot in
common: They are both selling a product that is hopelessly out of
fashion. In Laporte's case, it is small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Laporte runs T. Rowe Price's New Horizon fund, sometimes
referred to as the grandfather of small-cap funds. For the past 38
years, 12 under Laporte's direction, the fund has been investing in
small-growth companies. Laporte's long-trm track record is
terrific. In 1995 his fund was up 55 percent. But for the past few
years, he's been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Big stocks aren't just outperforming small stocks. They are
crushing them. Last year the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, a proxy
for big stocks, rose 28 percent. The Russell 2000 Index, a proxy
for small stocks, rose just over 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year is shaping up no better. Big stocks are up slightly;
small stocks are off more than 6 percent. Investors have reacted by
yanking money out of small-cap funds, including New Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors got their year-end statements, saw that we did 6.2
percent compared to 28 percent for the S&AMP;P and said, `Why do I want
to be in New Horizons?' '' says Laporte.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the stocks in Laporte's portfolio have had a
higher price/earnings ratio than do large-cap stocks. It makes
sense. Small companies have the potential to grow much faster than
their large counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, for the only the third time in the last 38, New
Horizons's stocks had a lower price/earnings ratio than the stocks
in the S&AMP;P 500. At the moment the ratio is more out of whack than
it has been in the entire history of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Why are small stocks so out of favor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a good answer to that,'' says Laporte. Part of
the answer, of course, is the rise of indexing. Investors have
poured enormous sums of money into S&AMP;P 500 index funds, which
guarantees more cash will flow into the big stocks that have
already done well. Another part of the answer is the excellent
earnings performance of the big companies, especially technology
giants such as Microsoft, Dell, and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the advantage the giants enjoy may be a
permanent one. The argument goes something like this: In today's
open global economy, big companies have greater power than ever to
cut costs, raise prices, and dominate markets. And when the big
firms see a small company that poses a competitive challenge they
don't sweat it. They just buy up the little company. Microsoft and
Cisco have bulked up on a steady diet of small rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Laporte doesn't accept the notion that the world has changed so
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small companies continue to have the advantage of being more
nimble,'' he says. ``Well-managed small companies should be able to
grow earnings faster than large companies do.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Laporte is that even when small companies
perform well, their stocks get hammered. He cites two examples from
his portfolio: Apollo Group Inc. and Henry Schein Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo is in education; Henry Schein is in health care. Both
companies have had solid sales and earnings growth. Yet Apollo's
stock is down 25 percent from its high and Henry Schein is off 35
percent. To Laporte, it looks as if investors are throwing out the
baby with the bath water.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks have been down before. In fact, over time their
performance is almost biblical: five to seven years of good times
followed by five to seven years of lean times. Small stocks have
been in a relative slump since 1994. So should investors expect the
tide to turn soon? Laporte's answer: Don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will need a pretty good washout in the current
market leaders before we get a reversal,'' he says. In other words,
the big stocks will have to crumble first, Laporte argues.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, small stocks won't be out of the woods. Laporte
predicts it will take a broad correction and then a subsequent
rebound for the small stocks to begin a new cycle of strong
performance. And with the economy in such good shape, that washout
may not be on the horizon, says Laporte.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is not about to change its stripes. Laporte will
continue to look for small companies that have the ability to
increase earnings at 25 percent a year. Like the bell-bottoms in
your closet, such companies are bound to come back into fashion
sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparity in valuations inevitably has to close,'' says
Laporte. Right now, it's just hard to say when ``inevitably'' will
be.

PHARMAECONOMICS THE RAGE AMONG HOSPITALS, FIRMS, INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the miracle cures landing on pharmacy shelves with
increasing regularity, Photofrin stood out.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just because the drug promised to make it possible for
a simple laser beam to kill cancer cells. It was also the killer
price tag _ a single dose of Photofrin can cost $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the drug was introduced last year, physicians at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston faced some vexing questions. Did it
work? Should everyone get the drug? Was it worth the awesome price?
</P>
<P>
   The doctors called in the ``drug police.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dr. Jerry Avorn, associate professor of Harvard Medical
School. His answer: It works. Use it.
</P>
<P>
   Avorn is a pioneer in the emerging fields of pharmacoeconomics
and pharmacoepidemiology. Once derided by a Harvard Medical School
dean as ``Mickey Mouse'' science, Avorn's work in dissecting the
cost and benefits of new drugs is now all the rage among hospitals,
drug companies, and insurers in the cost-conscious era of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   His department's staffing grew 50 percent in the last year
alone, and the Brigham plans to expand it further. Grants are
pouring in from foundations and the National Health Institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conceptual approach is just very prescient,'' said Dr.
Joseph Gerstein, medical director of Tufts Health Plan, the state's
second-largest health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacoeconomics involves the study of similar drugs, and their
costs and benefits. Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of the way
doctors prescribe medicine and how patients use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those fields dovetail perfectly with the philosophy of managed
care, which seeks to maximize the use of every health care dollar
and minimize complications. As drug spending soars, threatening to
bust the budgets of hospitals and HMOs, there has been a
corresponding burst of interest in Avorn's work. And with drug
companies churning out more wonder drugs with big price tags and
potentially scary side effects, Avorn is assured his work will
continue to be in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Avorn, a 51-year-old internist with a leprechaun beard and a
cheerful lilt in his voice, is flattered by all the attention. His
ideas weren't always so popular. As a medical student at Harvard,
Avorn remembers telling a medical school dean about his career
plans. The response: ``Why isn't a smart guy like
</P>
<P>
   you going into cardiology instead of this soft science Mickey
Mouse crap?'' Avorn decided he was going to pursue what interested
him, fully aware that many of his peers looked down on his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense at Harvard Medical School that if you were
not dealing with molecules or lab rats, it wasn't science,'' Avorn
said. ``But that has changed dramatically in the last few years as
people realize that what the health care system needs to confront
are issues of cost effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   As a medical student in the 1960s, Avorn studied Pondinim, which
was used to treat obesity. Avorn found that the much-hyped drug
didn't work very well. As soon as patients stopped using the drug,
the pounds came right back. Pondinim, it turns out, was a trade
name for the drug fenfluramine, which became a key ingredient in
Redux, a diet drug that was pulled off the market in 1997 because
of fears it would cause heart valve problems.
</P>
<P>
   Avorn did another experiment in the 1970s that turned out to
have modern relevance. He selected several, widely marketed drugs
that were known in the medical literature to have little benefit.
He then asked doctors for their opinions on the drugs. The answers
he got matched the message in advertisements for those drugs, not
what was borne out by research. So while physicians swore they were
not influenced by pharmaceutical marketing, the ads clearly worked,
Avorn concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Avorn didn't stop there. Taking a page out of the drug
marketers' handbook, Avorn developed slick color handouts and short
``pitches,'' put them into the hands of smartly dressed ``sales
people,'' and sent them into physicians' offices. Instead of
persuading doctors to prescribe more drugs, his handouts often
pointed out shortcomings of specific drugs and was designed to get
doctors not to prescribe them. One of the drugs was Darvon, a
costly pain killer that worked no better than aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The approach worked. Doctors wrote fewer prescriptions for
Darvon and other targeted drugs. The savings that resulted from
prescribing fewer drugs was twice the cost of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after he conducted that experiment, Tufts Health
Plan in Waltham is using the technique to educate physicians on
ways to prescribe more wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs are now implementing concepts that (Avorn) had
developed,'' said Tufts's Gerstein, who was Avorn's physical
diagnosis instructor at Harvard Medical School. ``He was a prophet,
and like many other prophets, he was not appreciated in his time.
Only now is he being given his due.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all knowledge, there is a dark side to Avorn's research.
While it hasn't happened yet, Avorn acknowledges his approach
provides an opportunity for insurers to deny access to costly but
effective medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good approaches in the wrong hands can have bad
consequences,'' said Avorn, who is an academic researcher who does
not sell his research. He argues his work isn't meant to be used as
a club to make purely economic decisions. Avorn says he is simply
adding to the pool of knowledge physicians draw from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do both economic and quality-of-life analyses so at least
we can have a rational conversation instead of a lot of arm waving
about what should and shouldn't be done,'' he said. ``We try to
raise the level of discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his current studies involves a raging debate over whether
to give cholesterol-lowering drugs to seniors who have modestly
high cholesterol levels but no heart disease. At stake are billions
of dollars in spending on such drugs, since the medications have to
be taken every day at a cost of up to $1,000 a year for each
patient. To complicate matters, there have been no clinical trials
of the drugs involving the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, we don't know whether giving cholesterol-lowering
drugs to older people is effective or not,'' said Avorn. ``If yes,
then at what price? It's no longer good enough to say something
works better than a placebo. You need to say what benefit you'll be
getting and whether it's worth the cost, which could otherwise be
applied to other, possibly more effective, therapy. We're trying to
find the answer to that.''

ONCE-AUSTERE CASKET INDUSTRY LIGHTENS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Art available on the Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Despite its cold, serene nature, the funeral
industry is hardly in a state of eternal rest.
</P>
<P>
   Recent innovations and the willingness to change business
practices to accommodate family wishes are beginning to liven it up
a little.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a customer can buy a casket decorated with images
such as Our Lady of Guadalupe from a Dallas-based company, or
choose from many service options for cremations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as traditional as it used to be,'' Sig Gonzales,
funeral director at Max Martinez Mortuary Inc. in San Antonio, said
of the funeral industry. ``Funeral homes are finally catching up
with what consumers want.''
</P>
<P>
   WhiteLight of Dallas sells steel caskets decorated with an image
created by applying a laminated photo mural on the casket.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 14 designs, including a sunset, an Irish flag,
a cross with a background of a blue sky and a few puffy clouds,
cathedral-like stained glass, a golf course view called ``Fairway
to Heaven'' and a Texas-themed image with the Alamo, bluebonnets
and a steer. And WhiteLight will personalize designs for an
additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   The company only sells to funeral homes, which then set prices,
but company spokeswoman Becky Mayad said the cost of the art
caskets range from $1,700 to $2,800. She would not say how much
WhiteLight charges the funeral homes for the caskets.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of plain steel caskets can range from about $1,000 to
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fant, the 50-year-old co-owner of WhiteLight, said he
hoped to sell 4,000 art caskets that will appeal to his fellow baby
boomers who want more choices. So far, only 20 have been sold, but
he said there had been dozens of inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its time has come. We're adding some warmth and personality in
a one-dimensional, cold, kind of gloomy service,'' said Fant, a
former radio station manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fant said that about 20 percent of the funeral directors he had
contacted do not plan to carry the art caskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand this is not for everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cremation experienced an upsurge in popularity after the Vatican
in 1997 granted authority for funeral Masses for cremated Catholics
with the ashes present in the church. Previously, it allowed only
memorial services without the ashes present.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more funeral homes are beginning to offer options
such as a cremation casket, a rental casket for viewing,
cosmetology and embalming.
</P>
<P>
   With the national average cost of burying a loved one nearing
the $5,000 mark (not including costs for cemetery plots and
headstones), and with the price of funerals doubling every 10
years, will families be willing to pay extra for special touches?
</P>
<P>
   Porter Loring III, an owner of Porter Loring Mortuaries in San
Antonio, said he wouldn't be surprised if customers request a
little extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are becoming aware of death and want more
options,'' Loring said. ``Ten years ago, I didn't think people
would want cremation, but it's becoming more popular. I've learned
never to say never.''

BELIEVE IT: CELTICS ARE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be bumps in the parquet _ like the narrow loss to the
Nets on Monday and the hideous beating in Cleveland Tuesday _ but
the Celtics are New England's feel-good team of this spring season.
</P>
<P>
   Truly.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Team hasn't played a postseason game since 1995 (the
Bruins, Red Sox, and Patriots all made the playoffs last year) and
they are under .500 (March 5). Still, the C's are the team that
pleases. Maybe it's the 16 banners. Maybe it's Rick Pitino's suits.
Maybe it's just illogical hope.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, there's a feeling around the Celtics that
is much like the karma that engulfed the upstart Patriots in 1994 _
Bill Parcells's second year on the sidelines. That Patriots team
won its last seven games to sneak into the NFL playoffs. They were
beaten by Cleveland, but it felt like they were going to be
important again. Two years later, they were in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is to the Celtics what Parcells was to the Patriots. In
Rick We Trust. Of course we have to tease him about ``lyin' and
laughin' '' (why do we write down (itals)anything(unitals) the man
says?) but there's a confidence and command about Pitino that makes
the New England fandom believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are young, hungry, and entertaining. They have the
blocks necessary to improve. The NBA's new basic agreement will
allow them to keep their best players. They have a good coach. They
are going to get better. They are going to get back to the big
games. And it is going to be fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the other three New England teams:
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won 92 games last year, but lost Mo Vaughn, who was
their blood and thunder. Like the rest of the American League, they
are hopelessly behind the Yankees. Meanwhile, general manager Dan
Duquette has sapped all color and controversy from the clubhouse.
It is spring, but the Sox are not the hot topic around here.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are dissolving in front of our eyes. A new player
bails out every other day, the coach is embarrassingly powerless,
the general manager is in a draft slump, and the owner just wants
to make money, move to Hartford, and fire anyone who still speaks
to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins continue to skate their wing and make us wonder when
they'll next go deep into the playoffs. Even the Hockey Krishnas
seem resigned to the fact that the B's are doomed to one-and-out
playoff bids while the man in Buffalo puts more cash in his
mattress.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, meanwhile, are giving fans reason to believe. After
five home games, attendance is running ahead of the last three
seasons (an average of 17,747 compared with 15,767 last year after
five home games). Not only that, but fans are getting to the game
on time and staying until the end. In recent years, we've grown
accustomed to the empty lower bowl at the start and finish of most
Celtic games. (By the way, who decided to put loud yellow/orange
seats near courtside in the new building? They exaggerate the
no-shows and late arrivals.)
</P>
<P>
   When the Celtics played the lowly Nets Monday the lower bowl was
almost full at the start of the game. No one left early. It was a
thrilling 48 minutes of basketball, not decided until Keith Van
Horn's putback broke the Green at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker, Ron Mercer, Paul Pierce, Kenny Anderson, and
Tony Battie are lottery picks. With the possible exception of
Anderson (who has suspect knees), all of these players should be
around for the next championship run. In the meantime, there will
be rough nights like the ones we saw Monday and Tuesday. And could
Antoine burn his Dino Radja Defense Manual?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have no legitimate big man, no offensive scheme, and
no transition offense. But they've got the energy of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who we are and where we're going,'' says Pitino.
``We're painfully young. But the great part is, we're young and
talented. There's a promise for tomorrow. This is a young talented
team that keeps getting better and better, continues to play hard,
and continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans are unusually patient when it comes to the Celtics,
but it would be nice to see the C's in the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're not ready yet,'' says Pitino. ``Would it shock
me? Absolutely not. We could make it, but things don't come easy
yet. But I look down the road and I see Antoine and Kenny and Paul
and Ron. I think the future is really bright.''
</P>
<P>
   New England sports fans, ever a cynical lot, seem to think the
same way.

SWITCH LIKELY A SNAP FOR IRWIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ His uncle, Hale Irwin, a professional
golfer, is used to everything that comes with being the center of
attention. Pressure putts, sudden death, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   So in the weeks to come, Heath Irwin may want to seek some
family advice because he is about to become the center of attention
in the Patriots' offense, making the move from guard to center
following the loss of unrestricted free agent Dave Wohlabaugh, who
had been the starter the past four seasons before signing with the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, a fourth-round draft pick in 1995 out of the University
of Colorado, hasn't played center full time since junior high
school. Two years ago, he asked then-offensive line coach Paul
Boudreau if he could start practicing at center and get some work
as a long snapper.
</P>
<P>
   The transition seemed to come relatively easy to the
6-foot-4-inch, 295-pounder. He fared well during the exhibition
season, even getting the approval of quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who
often clashed with centers other than Wohlabaugh.
</P>
<P>
   He also received good reviews for his second-half play vs.
Kansas City last season, when he played in place of Wohlabaugh, who
had a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the job is his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I'm going to get the opportunity,'' said Irwin.
``I play guard so really the transition isn't too bad. It's not as
physical a position as guard or tackle, so that part I can handle
with no problem. It's the mental part of the position that I have
to work on because you're making the calls for the offensive line.
A lot of the guys have helped me with that so I think by the time
the season rolls around it should be second nature to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing I think is on third down when the nickel
packages come in and the linebackers are replaced by safeties or
corners. Usually a center will look and see what the linebackers
are doing and make the calls based on that. With no linebackers out
there, you have to be careful about the safeties or corners
blitzing. I'm sure there'll be times out there when I'm seeing
something I've never seen before, but even in my experience with
Dave, he had situations where he was looking at things for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier said
last week that he expected Irwin would be able to handle the job.
He said he thought Irwin would be an ``athletic center'' in the
mold of Dermontti Dawson, who relied more on athleticism than
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to pull and get out there and block,'' said Irwin.
``It's a little tougher to do it from the center position, but I
think I can bring some quickness. Because I'm quick, maybe I can
get a little more leverage on the bigger guys I'll be lined up
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that I stay lower from the start.
You're 2-3 inches from the nose tackle's head so I have to learn to
hit someone on the first step rather than the second step, which is
usually the norm when you're playing guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin had become the starting right guard, supplanting Max Lane,
before suffering an ankle injury that sidelined him for three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin figured to compete for the starting guard spot in training
camp, but now he intends to focus on being the team's center. As of
now, his competition will come from second-year player Jason
Andersen, another converted center, from Brigham Young. Andersen
has played more center than Irwin and could surprise everyone and
take the job, but for now Irwin is in the driver's seat unless the
team signs a veteran free agent such as Mark Stepnoski.
</P>
<P>
   The only wrinkle is that Irwin is a restricted free agent. He
was tendered at the minimum offer ($429,000) before Wohlabaugh
became a free agent. If he signs an offer sheet elsewhere and the
Patriots decline to match it, they would be compensated with a
fourth-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here,'' said Irwin. ``We haven't signed any
contracts and I'm hoping we'll come up with something. I can't
imagine getting to this point and then having something like that
happen. I'm sure something will be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's agent, Jack Mills, said the Miami Dolphins had shown
interest in Irwin before before trading for San Francisco's Kevin
Gogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think teams are going through the unrestricted free
agents,'' said Mills. ``There's been a great market for them the
past couple of years. It's so great that we're tempted to play this
year and test that market next year, but we certainly would listen
to anything the Patriots proposed and they've certainly indicated a
willingness to get something done with Heath.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who has lived in relative obscurity for the past few
years, will now be under a microscope starting in training camp in
July. He's already began his workouts in Foxborough. He'll begin to
do his offseason work with the rest of the team March 22 and will
work with Dante Scarnecchia, who has been shifted to the offensive
line after being the special teams coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the rest of the team gets here, I'll be working on the
position stuff at least once a week until the minicamps,'' said
Irwin. ``Like I said, some of the stuff is already second nature to
me. But there'll be new things. I understand I'll receive more
attention from the media and everybody will be watching. But this
is what you prepare for all of your life in this game and I'm going
to be ready for it.''

CUP HOPEFULS BEGIN LINING UP TO CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, R.I. _ On a murky March day in an unassuming metal
workshed in a corner far from the fashionable seaside of this town,
a weapon is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Though no outsiders are allowed to see, this weapon is
dagger-shaped, honed with high-tech materials to a high-tech
formula devised over months of painstaking high-tech study.
</P>
<P>
   And this weapon has a mission: Defeat that fearsome power New
Zealand and bring the America's Cup back to the Rhode Island waters
from where it was rudely snatched by Australia some 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Goetz Custom Boatworks, the Bruce Farr-designed America's Cup
Class yacht is under construction _ and of course high secrecy. It
is one of two boats being built by Young America, the New York
Yacht Club's syndicate whose mission is to restore the Cup to what
the New Yorkers believe is its rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   After the longest interim since the World War II hiatus _ five
years _ and after it was nearly forgotten by all but its most rabid
fans, the first America's Cup trial race is a little more than
seven months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the year 2000 was so far away,'' said Ed Baird,
the 41-year-old skipper of Young America from St. Petersburg, Fla.,
``but now it's going to be on us pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Round Robin 1 begins in Auckland Oct. 18, with the final series
for the Cup getting underway Feb. 19. That means the Cup could be
home in Newport (Harbor Court?) by Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, yes, there are a few things to get out of the way for
Young America _ like beating 16 challengers (five from the United
States) for the right to take on the Royal New Zealand Yacht
Squadron, defender of the oldest trophy in sports.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baird, Young America will be one of just two
two-boat programs heading to New Zealand late next summer, Italy
the other. The defender will also have two boats.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of having two boats has been well demonstrated in
the last two Cup campaigns, as Young America and Dennis Conner know
well. Despite having perhaps the best one-boat campaign in San
Diego in 1995, Young America couldn't reach a competitive plane
with New Zealand, nor the Australians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having enough money to develop a second boat is going to
be really hard for (the other) programs to overcome,'' said Baird
by phone from Florida, where he is sailing in the Southern Ocean
Racing Circuit with Young America team members. ``Besides us, the
Italians are really strong, and the rest of the teams all seem
fairly equal. Of course, the real test comes when we get the new
boats on the water and throttle them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of two boats is being able to set a benchmark
with one, then push beyond it with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider a two-boat program meaning having one new
boat and one boat from '95,'' said Baird. ``I mean having two boats
from the last generation, and building two new boats. We found last
time that having a new boat and a '92 generation, we couldn't learn
enough from the '92 boat to help us get faster.''
</P>
<P>
   As challengers in Australia in 1986, New Zealand started with a
bang, amassing the second-best record among the challengers and
losing to Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes in the final. Conner went on to
easily win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand showed up in San Diego with the Michael Fay ``Big
Boat'' challenge, which wound up in court when Conner defended in a
catamaran. But back on track in new lightweight 75-footers by 1992,
New Zealand made a strong bid to challenge, falling apart at the
end when Paul Cayard sailed for Italy and won the right to
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Bill Koch won the Cup with his America/3 three-boat
campaign in 1992, but by the next Cup in '95, New Zealand came back
with a program so far ahead of the competition that it looked like
a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   And now for five years, New Zealand has been preparing the
waterfront harbor of Auckland to entertain the 2000 America's Cup,
and will have another two-boat program ready to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at home, with all their experience and proximity to the
race course could be an advantage for New Zealand,'' said Baird.
``But it could also work the other way. Maybe they've been around
together too long, and maybe they didn't explore some little area
where others are advancing. You know, if you drive to work the same
way every day, and one day there's road construction, you may have
a problem getting yourself where you want to go. That could happen
to them.''
</P>

`SALARIED' WORKERS WANT THEIR OT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Ida Basha worked for MCI Telecommunications Corp.
in Sugar Land, Texas, she arranged for the placement of new phone
and Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly clerical work, she said recently, describing how
she'd print out orders and file the requests.
</P>
<P>
   However, MCI called her an engineer even though she did no
engineering work, didn't have an engineering degree or any
experience as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Basha believes the company classified her and her colleagues as
engineers solely to avoid paying overtime. She said she often
worked 80 to 90 hours a week, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Federal labor law requires employers to pay workers not exempt
from the overtime law time and a half for every hour over 40 hours
worked in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Workers not legally entitled to overtime include outside sales
people; computer analysts, programmers and software engineers who
earn at least $27.63 an hour; professionals (with an advanced
degree such as doctors, lawyers and some engineers); executives
(such as first-line supervisors); and administrative workers
(that's the murkiest category but typically requires the employee
to make corporate policies and exercise discretion).
</P>
<P>
   But many employers misclassify their workers, telling them
they're ``salaried'' and not eligible for overtime pay, said Gregg
Rosenberg, a Houston employment lawyer who is representing Basha
and another former MCI employee.
</P>
<P>
   Some common jobs that are typically misclassified, according to
Shirley Gardner, district director of the Wage and Hour Division of
the U.S. Department of Labor in Houston, include inside sales
representatives, customer service representatives,
computer-assisted designers, assistant managers who work alongside
their subordinates in fast-food outlets and construction foremen
who swing hammers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUIT GIVEN CLASS-ACTION STATUS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. recently gave Basha's
lawsuit preliminary class-action status for the 20 or so order
arrangers in the Houston-area city of Sugar Land, who work for a
division of a corporation now known as MCI WorldCom. Rosenberg
hopes to expand that class to include employees who do similar work
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Basha, who earned $47,000 a year, figures she's got a chunk of
change coming.
</P>
<P>
   The work had to get done, said Basha, who recounted the pressure
she felt to fill those orders and the illnesses she suffered as a
result of the stress. Some days, she said, she'd stay until 11 p.m.
and would return by 4 a.m., but was refused overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   That workload didn't go unappreciated: Basha was named to the
company's Ring of Champions, the highest honor within network MCI
Services, which is reserved for the top 1 percent of the division.
She was sent to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in August along with dozens
of other winners.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after she was added to an overtime lawsuit, Basha
said she was fired for ``no longer meeting the MCI WorldCom
standard.'' She explained her termination as she showed off a big
commemorative trophy with her name etched in crystal along with
letters heralding her nominations for other performance-based
awards.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI WorldCom spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASES EASIER TO PROVE IN COURT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suing companies for overtime pay is becoming increasingly
popular. That's because it's a lot easier to get a judge to certify
a class of employees on an overtime pay issue than on a race or
gender discrimination case, Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The way a company classifies its employees is typically a
corporate decision, he said, which makes it relatively easy to
prove the company sought to keep its employees from overtime
whether they're in Wisconsin or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prove a race or sex discrimination class-action case
is much more difficult, especially when employees work for
different supervisors and in different locations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime cases also are easier to present. Many times a lawyer
can go to a judge and establish corporate liability for
misclassification without having to try the case before a jury,
said Jack Wisdom, an expert on overtime pay issues and lawyer for
Bracewell &AMP; Patterson in Houston. Lawyers fees are then tacked on
top of the back-wage awards, said Wisdom, who is not familiar with
the MCI case.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom said he tells his corporate clients if they're in doubt
whether a job is exempt, go ahead and pay the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The downside can be substantial, he said.

FOR LONG HAUL, GO WITH WELLINGTON'S BETTER RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 07, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 63 and have been fully retired for
almost a year. With the exception of our $160,000 mortgage, we are
debt free, and we are maintaining our comfortable life style on a
combined monthly income of $3,699 from Social Security and a
military pension. We have approximately $33,000 in a credit union
savings account and in short-term CDs which we hold for
emergencies. We manage to add a bit each month, to be used for
vacations and other major purchases. We are confident that our
income stream will continue and with cost-of-living increases we
will be okay in the future. When I retired I rolled over money that
was in two former employers 401(k) plans into an IRA, which amounts
to $172,000 entirely invested in Vanguard Wellington fund. This
balanced fund has about 65 to 70 percent of its assets in stocks
and the remainder in high-quality bonds. The fund grew by about 13
percent last year. My question is, what now? We are somewhat
concerned about the health of the stock market and feel we might
also be at risk being in the single balanced fund. Perhaps a move
to other, more conservative Vanguard funds is in order. Should we
make a move?
</P>
<P>
   R.K., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. I appreciate your nervousness about the stock market, since I
share it. But before you make a change in your investment, consider
what your goals are for this money and how long you intend to leave
it invested. From the outline you supply, it sounds to me as if
this money is simply accumulating as a form of financial security.
You are relying on your income stream not only to supply your
living expenses, but it's also sufficient to allow savings for
extras. So basically it seems like the IRA is long-term money, an
account that probably won't be touched for about eight years until
you will be required to begin your mandatory withdrawals. And even
then, the withdrawals at that point will be fairly modest.
</P>
<P>
   What's a reasonable expectation for Wellington over a 10-year
period? Certainly looking backwards at the 13.66 percent of the
last decade provides a view that's probably too rosy. But I do
think it's realistic looking forward to expect that long-term
returns will be in the area of 9 percent or better. Bear in mind,
the stock portfolio is fairly conservative, with a distinct value
orientation to the 105 stocks on that side of the portfolio. The
fixed-income portfolio of 226 issues is, as you note, dominated by
high quality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the overall yield of 3.5 percent indicates that the
fund holds the kind of securities that are likely to be supported
to a certain degree by their income stream in sour markets.
</P>
<P>
   Then let's consider what you might get if you diversified -- as
if owning a fund which spreads its assets among 331 investments
isn't diverse enough. Suppose you decided to go along with the old
idea that the percentage of your investments on the fixed-income
side should roughly equal your age. You might then decide to leave
$100,000 in Vanguard Wellington and move the balance to a more
conservative fund that's entirely on the fixed-income side, say
Vanguard GNMA. When you add $72,000 from the GNMA fund to the third
of the Wellington portfolio that's similarly invested, that would
put you in the right neighborhood. But it would also ratchet down
the reasonable expectation of long-term returns, reducing the
figure perhaps from 9 percent or so to about 8 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move is a strategy which would give you some short-term
comfort if the markets do indeed go sour. But my guess is that if
you stick with Wellington over the long haul, you'll see better
returns that the safer alternative would be likely to deliver. And
bear in mind that since since you have an adequate income stream
with built-in cost-of-living protection, you can afford more risk
than people who are less comfortable or who have less protection
against the effects of inflation. Altogether, if I were in your
shoes I'd leave the IRA account as it is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You often recommend GNMA mutual funds for income investors.
What do you think about long-term Treasury funds, and long-term
high-quality corporate bond funds as alternative. How do they
compare to the GNMA funds?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Strange, but I was thinking about that very subject about
6:30 this morning. It's probably a bad sign when you're pondering
risk-reward structures and yield curves at such an hour rather than
seed catalogs. But it is indeed intriguing. In theory, the yield on
a fixed-income fund should escalate directly in line with the
duration of the investment -- so you might expect to get about 5
percent from a short-term money-market investment, about 6 percent
from an intermediate-term bond portfolio (such as a GNMA fund) and
perhaps 7 percent from a long-term holding. After all, the longer
you have promised to lend your money, the larger the risk you face,
so in return you should expect to get a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not working out that way in the current market.
Consider Vanguard's bond funds, which are a pretty good proxy for
their categories, given their plain-vanilla approach to building a
portfolio. If you hold the GNMA fund, the current yield is 6.6
percent. Yield on the Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury fund is 5.6
percent. For the Long-Term Corporate Bond fund, yield is 6.1
percent. For the Long-Term U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury, the yield is 5.5 percent. So what's the result? The
Investor is not only not getting the extra bang that's usually
associated with lending long, but is actually getting a lower yield
with long-term funds than with intermediate-term issues. To me,
this makes no sense. In fact, it's been some years since the bond
markets offered what I consider a sufficient yield premium on
long-term bonds to justify the additional risk, and that's why
neither you (nor I) can remember the last time I advised buying
one.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, before you simply decide that the GNMA is the best
offering among those listed, you should consider that these funds
bear another kind of risk.
</P>
<P>
   The GNMA securities from whence these funds draw their name are
bundles of federally-guaranteed mortgages. A nasty and
unpredictable feature of these securities is that the borrowers may
prepay all or part of these mortgages at any time. When interest
rates fall, borrowers are particularly prone to refinancing, and
the manager of a GNMA fund is in the unhappy position of having
large amounts of capital returned -- and the alternative
investments that he or she finds in the market invariably carry
lower coupons. It's that level of additional risk that can be
blamed for the one percentage point spread between the GNMA and the
Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury funds. That makes sense, but since
I don't think interest rates are about to go appreciably lower, I
am comfortable with the risk, and consider that an additional
percentage point of yield is a tidy reward for assuming it.
</P>
<P>
   As for what I consider the reverse spread between the long and
intermediate bond funds, it makes no sense to me, so I don't
recommend going beyond the intermediate term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In 1998 I started investing money in Education IRAs for my
five grandchildren. The initial contributions went into Vanguard
Star fund. I would like to consider a more aggressive fund for my
1999 contributions. Can you suggest what might be an appropriate
fund? The children range in age from three to nine. Also, should I
move out of the Star fund?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, for many years I went along with most financial
writers, who give Vanguard Star short shrift. But I eventually
decided that the primary rap against this fund-of-funds is simply
that it's sort of boring. But when you consider ten-year growth
rates, it shapes up awfully well. According to the latest
Morningstar Mutual Funds figures, it delivered 13.09 percent
average annual returns over the decade ended Jan. 31, comparing
favorably to the 12.42 percent of the once-storied Vanguard Windsor
fund, and also comparing nicely to the 16.68 percent delivered by
the better-performing Windsor II -- comparing nicely when you
consider that Star has been holding about a third of its portfolio
in fixed-income holdings during that time. So no, don't swap the
positions you started in Star.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be more aggressive this year, I suggest you pick
different investments according to the ages of the children. For
example, for the three-year-old, and any others under age five, why
not consider Vanguard Specialized Health Care fund -- one of the
riskiest funds the family offers, but also a fund with terrific
potential for big gains. For children aged five to ten, I'd suggest
Windsor II, an all-stock fund with a value orientation, and a fund
which seems to be better attuned to the current markets than some
of its value-oriented peers. But once a grandchildren attains the
age of ten, I suggest you then go back to steady-old, boring-old
Star for your subsequent annual contributions.

PREFAB OR MODULAR, QUALITY IS HIGH

   Q. I plan to put up a prefab house. I've heard a lot of about
them, but can't find any of the companies. Until I find a company,
can you tell me if they are any good, that they come up to local
codes, and anything about them?
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR VOZZELLA, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, you can find nearly a whole column of companies in the
Yellow Pages under ``Modular Homes, Buildings and Offices.''
Today's modular houses are very good, mainly because they are built
in a factory, and the work has a strict quality control. Yes, they
are up to code; they have to be. ``Prefab'' as a name has been
replaced by ``modular,'' although there is little difference in the
meaning. In the early days of modular, styles were limited, and
rather plain, designed to be trucked in parts to the site. Today
there is virtually no limit to the styles; you can also order a
custom house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The deck off my bedroom is covered with white roll roofing,
so we don't walk on it. Someone spilled paint thinner on it,
creating a prominent black spot. I painted it with latex paint, but
it only lasts a few weeks. How can I lighten that spot so it will
stay light?
</P>
<P>
   DAN BAKINOWSKI, Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I have suggested, in the past, an oil spray paint. Try a
white Krylon aerosol spray. Or, slather roofing cement on the spot,
very thinly, then sprinkle stone dust on it. The stone dust is
gray, but will disguise the spot. You might be able to get white
stone dust. The stone dust will stick to the roofing cement and
will last a lot longer than a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I took apart two faucets and diverter in the spout of my tub
shower to see if I could stop some leaks. The faucets stopped
leaking, but the diverter is continuing to leak, or at least does
not shut off properly. How can I get it to shut off properly (not
pour into the tub from the spout) when I am showering shut off the
shower when the tub is filling?
</P>
<P>
   DON LAMBERTON, Bellingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You strarted off right: Cleaning the innards of a faucet and
diverter or any other valve often fixes it. But to fix the
diverter, try changing the cartridge or stem that is in the spout.
If that doesn't work, replace the whole diverter.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to make everything work properly, put in a new one-handle
control that controls the pressure and keeps a showered person from
being scalded or doused with cold water when someone uses another
faucet or flushes the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I find a toilet seat with a bigger opening than
standard? I can't find one, and wonder why they don't make one. I
am not interested in a commercial split seat, nor an elongated one,
and the need for a larger opening is not medical.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING A LONG TIME, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Good question. The ony non-standard seat that I know of is an
elongated seat used for elongated toilets. Does anyone out there in
great-big Reader Land know if they are made and where they can be
bought?
</P>
<P>
   I checked the giant catalog of Watertown Supply, which lists
seven pages of seats, including the famous Church (``The best seat
in the house,'' is its motto), but could find only regular or
elongated.
</P>
<P>
   Short of finding one, you could buy an oak seat and trim the
inside of the opening by an inch or so, shape and sand smooth and
refinish the seat. You have to get a solid wood seat. The oak ones
are solid, although they are laminated. Most painted toilet seats
are made of particleboard or other composition that will not lend
themselves to enlarging. But solid wood will. Just don't make the
opening so big that it compromises the seat itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The paint is peeling off my 25-year-old house. The siding is
some sort of composition board, and some of it is decaying despite
its overcoat of paint protection. I understand there are some sort
of class-action suits against firms that make this composition
board. Do you know what the companies are and how I can joint the
suit?
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE, with composition siding
</P>
<P>
   A. Your composition siding is probably hardbaord of some kind,
an amalgam of ground-up wood and glue. In my opinion, it never
works well as a subsitute for wood. I wish people would stop trying
to imitate wood; it never works well. To join any suit, you have to
identify who made the composition board, something that may be
difficult or impossible. At any rate, the companies involved are:
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, (404) 652-8466; Louisiana-Pacific,
800-648-6893; Masonite: 800-330-2722.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Formica counter top has a burn mark, so bad that the
plastic is bubbling. Can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   MATT REGAN, Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Until you install a new top, you can put a cutting board
on the top. Or, cut out the burned spot and glue in a patch piece
of the same design and color, or make it a contrasting color just
for kicks. When cutting out the burned spot, use a plastic cutter
and apply heat with a hair dryer to soften the adhesive so you can
pry it up and out.

MID-MAJORS SHOULD LAND MORE BIDS THAN USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people at ESPN trumpet this week as Championship Week, with
a plethora of conference championships (and NCAA bids) being
decided, ranging from the America East title to the WAC title.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the upper echelon teams in the ``major
conferences'',the UConns, Ohio States, Kentuckys, and Dukes of the
world, this week merely is a tune-up for next week, with the only
thing at stake (not insignificant in some instances) being seeding
position for the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, all but the top conferences will send only their
tournament champion to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   This year could be different. With the ACC expected to send a
maximum of four teams, the Atlantic 10 only three, and the Big 12
only three or four, open spots abound for the so-called mid-major
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, one of the cardinal rules of the NCAA Tournament
is that a 64-team bracket must include 64 teams. Thus the Missouri
Valley will probably send three teams: Creighton, Evansville, and
Southwest Missouri. The Mid-American should get at least two bids
in Miami of Ohio and Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news for the Big Dance, which can use more
Cinderella stories such as Valparaiso last year and would benefit
from a strong mid-major conference team again making it to at least
the Final 8.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time to move on
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As good as the set-up at the University of Delaware has been for
the America East tournament, the league needs to move at least part
of the tourney to a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage for Delaware to play all of its tournament games
on its home court in front of a sellout crowd is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The league voted earlier this year on whether to move the event
to Boston next season, with Boston University and Northeastern
serving as co-hosts. The vote was a 5-5 tie and the league office
chose not to exercise a tie-breaker in favor of Boston, which is
strange since the America East offices are in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So the conference will return to Delaware next year.
</P>
<P>
   America East officials should consider a move to Philadelphia's
Palestra. It's small enough that it can be loud even without a
sellout, it's close enough to Delaware to draw their fans, and it's
in the heart of Philadelphia, which over the years has proven to be
a solid college basketball town. Plus, where can you find a
building with more tradition than The Palestra. And it would be
more of a neurtral site.
</P>
<P>
   And the league felt that playing the championship game at the
court of the higher remaining seed was necessary, so be it. That
would be enough of an advantage for the No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of conference tournaments, what is the Atlantic Coast
Conference doing continuing with that nonsensical bracket that had
No. 1 seed Duke vs. No. 9 seed Virginia playing, with the winner
getting a bye into the semifinals. Is the ACC so arrogant that it
thinks no No. 1 seed can lose to a No. 9 seed? And the idea of
giving a last-place team a bye into the semifinals is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC needs to do what other conferences do. Have the No. 8
seed play No. 9 in a play-in game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Providence's loss to Georgetown in the opening round of the Big
East tournament Wednesday night was tainted by the arrogance of the
officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened: The Hoyas' Trez Kilpatrick and the Friars'
Jamel Thomas got involved in a shoving match. Then things escalated
and Kilpatrick threw a punch at Thomas's head. The rules call for
an automatic ejection. The officials say they didn't see the punch.
They chose not to look at video tapes, which clearly showed a punch
being thrown.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are clear. If you throw a punch, you're gone.
Kilpatrick landed a punch. He should have been ejected. He wasn't.
He reentered the game and scored a big basket down the stretch.
Georgetown won by 2 and Providence was eliminated from
consideration from the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Providence coach Tim Welsh said he told official Jim Burr a
punch had been thrown. In a statement released by the officials
after the game, the officials said no one told them that.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the officials should have looked at the tape.
Kilpatrick should have been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Providence might have lost the game anyway. But it shouldn't
have happened that way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blaney available
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With all the coaching openings popping up and more sure to come,
someone needs to hire former Holy Cross and Seton Hall coach George
Blaney. Blaney has been biding his time since he was fired by Seton
Hall two years ago and still has the energy and enthusiasm of a
young man. ``There's a few things out there,'' said Blaney, who was
watching the America East tournament last week in Newark, Del.
Blaney reportedly is in the mix at Brown, Holy Cross, and Florida
Atlantic . . . The problem with the Holy Cross job is that no one
is quite sure of the administration's commitment to the program.
How much will basketball be emphasized? Will the Cruasders stay in
the Patriot League or move to the MAAC? And what will be the
limitations on scholarships? Once the parameters have been
established, Holy Cross officials can move forward and check out a
strong list of candidates that range from Ralph Willard
(Pittsburgh) to Blaney. Another up-and-coming young coach who
should be moving up a level is Lafayette's Fran O'Hanlon, who has
steadily built the Leopards into a mid-major force . . . One of the
questions as we move into the final days before Selection Sunday is
where does the College of Charleston fit in. Coach John Kresse's
team took care of business by winning the Southern Conference
tournament last weekend. With a 28-2 record (16-0 in conference),
the Cougars have not lost since Dec. 4, with wins over
Massachusetts and North Carolina, and seem a lock to get a high
seed (maybe as high as a 6) . . . UConn fans should keep a close
watch on what Auburn is doing in the SEC tournament this weekend.
With Stanford and Cincinnati finishing on high notes, word has it
that the Tigers might need to win the SEC tournament to maintain
their No. 1 seed in the South. A stumble, coupled with a Stanford
win over Oregon State Saturday or a strong showing by Maryland in
the ACC tournament, could put Stanford or Maryland as No. 1 in the
West and shift UConn to a No. 1 seed in the South.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heady matchups
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few dream first- or second-round NCAA Tournament
matchups we'd like to see. Pennsylvania vs. North Carolina so
Michael Jordan (of the Quakers) can play against the Tar Heels;
Samford vs. Stanford just to see how the CBS announcers deal with
the tongue twisters; Fresno State vs. Duke, which as one sage
basketball fan noted would be a nice historic twist since it was
Duke that spoiled the run of Jerry Tarkanian (now at Fresno) and
Nevada-Las Vegas at a perfect season in the 1991 Final Four . . .
Word has it that Notre Dame coach John McLeod will probably be back
next season. OK. But let's look at some numbers. With Wednesday's
loss to Seton Hall in the first round of the Big East tournament,
the Irish are 0-4 in Big East tournament games under McLeod and
haven't even been within single digits in their four losses. In
eight years, the Irish have had only three winning seasons and
haven't been to the NCAA Tournament once . . . No matter what
Auburn does the next three weeks, it has been a dream season for
the Tigers and coach Cliff Ellis. In more ways than one. Ellis
signed a three-year contract extension last March that was laced
with incentives and included additional years if the Tigers won the
SEC West (they did) and made the NCAA Tournament (which they will)
. . . Although former UMass player Ajmal Basit spent extensive time
talking to Rutgers about transferring, that is looking less and
less likely. Basit reportedly thinks he might only be a role player
at Rutgers, while he feels he can transfer somewhere else and be a
star, which would increase the likelihood of extending his career
to the NBA . . . Willard, who finished his tenure with Pitt
Wednesday night, could wind up on P.J. Carlesimo's staff at Golden
State if Holy Cross doesn't work out.

ACTOR'S INTENSITY FLAVORS `JOE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   British director Ken Loach plunges us into another of his social
realist narratives with ``My Name is Joe,'' which features a
performance of explosive honesty by Peter Mullan in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet him, he's at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting (the
title refers, of course, to the introductions of recovering
alcoholics at AA gatherings). Loach's brand of no-nonsense
filmmaking has seen its influence played more in the last decade
than at any other point in his career: Mike Leigh has carved out
his own version of Loach's style; actors-turned-writer/directors
Gary Oldman and Tim Roth have adopted Loach's unblinking gaze at
the behavior of the working class for their first features as well.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, Loach's material doesn't play as the most
effervescent of entertainment. It's touching, and a credit to his
tenacity, that after more than 30 years he's still hanging on to
his craft. ``Joe,'' set in Glasgow, has a loose, documentary feel
that adds to its volatility. (It's subtitled, since the Glaswegian
accents are hard to understand.)
</P>
<P>
   The reforming Joe has thrown himself into reclaiming his own
life and those of others. He manages a soccer team, a bunch of
boiling youths who can't quite get it going on the field. But Joe
loves the chaos, and spends a furious amount of energy helping the
kids to keep body and soul together.
</P>
<P>
   Joe has what movie types used to call a ``meet-cute'' encounter
with Sarah (Louise Goodall), a social worker, who gets into a
squabble with him over a parking space. Soon, though, he's offering
to re-wallpaper her flat _ a job he's comically unequipped to do.
It's odd that a director with Loach's reputation for
close-to-the-world realism falls back on such moldy, stagy plot
gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps slightly more depressing than the moody emotional
swirls that Loach so painstakingly creates. But he's got a fiery
winner of a protagonist in Mullan, who won acting honors from the
jury at Cannes last year. Mullan's windblown intensity and
directness make some of these cliches fully felt.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when a melancholy predictability sets in. The
struggle that brings Joe and Sarah together is the effort to help
one of her charges, Liam (David McKay), a drug addict and
small-time criminal who's also on Joe's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe takes up the battle to help the boy, who's struggling to
stay away from a life of petty crime, ``My Name is Joe'' slinks
slowly, inexorably back into the mire from which both guys clearly
haven't emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of the streets, and past mistakes, are inescapable _
director Loach is diligent in tattooing the story with original
sin. Mullan's hunger and zeal to do what's right give ``Joe'' a
screaming, pounding heart. He rises above its glum obviousness.

THEY MAY BE TWO OF A KIND AFTER ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saga of Bill and Monica is more the stuff of Sidney Sheldon
than William Shakespeare, but Monica Lewinsky's gossipfest with
Barbara Walters nonetheless conjured up some lines from
``Othello'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak
</P>
<P>
   ``Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well ...''
</P>
<P>
   The operative phrase here is ``lov'd not wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt after Wednesday's tedious, two-hour
interview on ABC's ``20/20'': Lewinsky was _ maybe still is _ madly
in love with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during her shabby dalliance with Clinton, Lewinsky
apparently deluded herself into believing that she had a future
with him _ that the 42nd president of the United States might
actually dump his wife and live happily ever after with this giggly
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky-Clinton ``romance'' began, Monica said, when she
flashed the president a glimpse of her undies to let him know that
``I'm interested ... I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get the nerve?'' Walters wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Where did she get the nerve for all of it _
flashing her thong, sneaking in and out of the Oval Office for
sexual encounters, engaging in late-night phone sex with the leader
of the free world?
</P>
<P>
   Where did she get the nerve to gush about the tawdry details in
telephone conversations with her so-called friend Linda Tripp _
conversations that Tripp secretly recorded and eventually turned
over to the president's archenemy, independent counsel Ken Starr?
</P>
<P>
   Where did Lewinsky get the nerve to rehash the scandal in a
tell-all book that hit the store shelves Thursday? Where did she
get the nerve to go over it one more time with Walters?
</P>
<P>
   How, you ask, could anyone be bored by an interview in which the
interviewee explains the concept of phone sex to the interviewer?
How could a lurid tale of sex and lies in the White House be
tedious?
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood made a movie about all this (starring, let's say,
John Travolta and Jennifer Love Hewitt), wouldn't the public go
wild for it?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. Which only proves that most of the time, fiction is a
lot more interesting than reality.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Clinton-haters, who saw the scandal as an
exquisite opportunity to demolish his presidency _ and the
Clinton-lovers, who went to war on his behalf _ the public was
bored with ``The Adventures of Bill and Monica'' about 15 minutes
after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it evolved into the second presidential impeachment
in American history, the scandal had outlived its usefulness for
everyone except the people who were determined to acquire Clinton's
head on a platter _ and, of course, the folks who've been making a
living dissecting the scandal in the media. What will Ann Coulter
and Alan Dershowitz argue about once this story heaves its final
breath?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky came across as sincere, phony, tortured, silly,
sometimes thoughtful and frequently shallow _ a perfectly normal
concoction of personality traits that told us virtually nothing
about why the president was drawn to her, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   She hardly seemed to be the naive woman-child that some had
expected _ hoped? _ she would be. Nor was she the scheming tramp
that others imagined.
</P>
<P>
   She obviously knows that she did something wrong _ but she just
as obviously feels no guilt or remorse about it. Come to think of
it, Monica might well be the Clinton soul mate she imagined herself
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Bill: two self-deluding, self-absorbed,
self-indulgent brats feeding off each other's arrogance and
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky began the interview by apologizing to the nation and to
Clinton's wife and daughter, but it was evident throughout that she
somehow felt entitled to her fling with the president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not someone who suffers from low self-esteem, as she
claims, but rather a person who wants what she wants when she wants
it _ and believes she is special enough to merit such entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Bill Clinton.
</P>

`TANGO' IS ENTICING BUT LACKS SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about ``Tango'' is the pedigree: It's
written and directed by Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura, who has
helmed 33 features, including ``Blood Wedding'' and ``Flamenco.''
</P>
<P>
   It was photographed by the Italian cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, who shot ``The Last Emperor,'' ``Apocalypse Now'' and
``Last Tango in Paris.'' It was scored by Lalo Schifrin, who
composed music for ``Bullitt'' and ``The Dead Pool.''
</P>
<P>
   All this talent is evident in the film, which looks great,
showcases ravishing, passionate dancing and is crafted by these old
pros with skill. You can see why it was Oscar-nominated this year
for best foreign-language film. (It's in Spanish with English
subtitles).
</P>
<P>
   All that's lacking _ a major lack in a love story, actually _ is
a story. Saura's shaky script doesn't equal the movie's
choreography and visual flair, and the presence of a gifted
Argentine cast can't make up for the absence of compelling
characters and a narrative backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Saura fans will have to content themselves with the film's fast-
shifting palette of colors, Storaro's vivid use of light and shadow
_ and, of course, the dancing. The latter comes courtesy of
real-life ballet star Julio Bocca, who makes a cameo appearance,
lead actresses Cecilia Narova and Mia Maestro (who portray rival
dancers and dueling femme fatales) and a large and lively company
of dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The fulcrum for all this activity is Mario (played by Miguel
Angel Sola), a trim, chiseled dance director who is undergoing a
mid-life crisis. Mario's wife Laura (Narova) has left him for a
younger dancer. Poor Mario is walking with a cane after an auto
accident, and he's struggling with his latest dance epic. Maybe
building the work around the tango and life's tangled dance of
relationships will help inspiration to strike, he hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Mario casts his ex and her lover in the new show _ financed
largely by a Buenos Aires gangster, Angelo (Juan Luis Galiardo).
</P>
<P>
   Angelo has a young mistress, Elena (Maestro), who happens to be
an aspiring dancer. He wants Mario to give her a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Director and dancer fall in love, which should propel the story,
but it's hard to get interested in either character. He is
manipulative and narcissistic, fixated on younger women. She is
manipulative and narcissistic, fixated on her career. When she
tells sugardaddy Angelo to kiss-off, an air of menace suggests
something dramatic is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get very long _ albeit smartly staged _ rehearsal
scenes for Mario's show. These are interspersed with unrealized
snippets of recent Argentine history under the 1970s military
junta. Then there's a dance dedicated to immigration, which seems
to have nothing whatever to do with the rest of the film. Again,
nicely staged, but what of it?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a love story about interesting human beings,
``Tango'' is a love song to the riveting eroticism and stylized
movement of the tango. That, and a love song to the stage; the
glimpses of Mario and his choreographers, musicians and dancers
striving to perfect their art fills one with admiration for their
intensity and attention to detail. The architectural splendor of
Saura's sets (constructed on a sound-stage near Buenos Aires) is
also something to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' has flair, style and the sleek surfaces of passion. If
only it had a heart, too.

`F ZONE' AN OVERTAXING IRS RANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of ``The F Zone,'' an anti-Internal Revenue
Service tract masquerading as a movie, federal marshals acting on
behalf of the IRS seize the following: a sport-utility vehicle from
a pregnant woman, leaving her stranded in the street; a boys' home
from a black woman, putting her charges back on the street; and a
residence from an old woman, leaving her sobbing on her sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, subtlety isn't going to be one of this movie's
strong points. We never see these characters again; for all we
know, they're brazen tax cheats who deserved what they got. But the
implication is that the IRS consists of a bunch of jackbooted thugs
who are after all of our worldly possessions. The movie accents
that with its villain, whose name is _ are you ready for this? _
Lothar Guenter, a skinheaded IRS brute who looks like pro wrestler
Steve Austin with a briefcase. Lee West (TV's ``The Bold and the
Beautiful'') plays him as the broadest bad guy since Billy Zane
chewed the decks of the Titanic; you get the impression that G

`BEAUTOPIA' ISN'T ALL THAT PRETTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's apparent that tragedy has struck in Katherina Otto's torpid
documentary about models, ``Beautopia,'' when the soundtrack cries
a sad song and Sara is reduced to using pay phones and buying off
the rack at outdoor bazaars that would make Harpers cringe.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish beauty can't find any modeling work, but she's
determined to find celebrity nonetheless. ``Maybe modeling's not
the thing I'll be famous in,'' she says. Yeah, maybe she could be
the next Sheena Easton.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Otto's film is a shapeless strut through the
auspicious beginnings of three girls from Europe and one from the
United States looking for supermodeldom.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking the fashion industry is redundant. Otto, on the other
hand, is enamored of the horrors of what it takes to get that Vogue
cover. She follows Petra Svabenska (Czech Republic), Sarah Cookson
(Great Britain), Dana Douglas (United States) and Susanne Hoppe
(Germany) from local celebrity to international obscurity that
spans catwalks from New York to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The only sashaying these girls do is from the end of one agency
office to the next. It's a hard-knock life for Sarah and the gang,
but ``Beautopia'' treats their dire straits like love taps.
</P>
<P>
   Otto presents her subjects in angleless ``Dateline'' fashion.
There's Dana being evicted from New York, but she looks amazing in
that super-tight close- up.
</P>
<P>
   Otto also narrates the film with a wooden Scandanavian
voice-over that means to be concerned about or bewildered by the
whole modeling business. But ultimately she's as starry-eyed as the
girls. It's like having your mother following you with her film
crew from one rejection to the next. But rather than dispense hugs,
Otto recites sanguine platitudes as the models experience serial
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Her stilted English readings, though, are nothing compared with
the poor Euro hotties forced to speak handicapped English for
intended American and British audiences. Petra suffers the
particular indignity of losing a key gig because her English is not
deemed good enough to enable her to stroll down a plank in couture
blinded by flashbulbs on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is that the film is dated badly _ it wrapped filming in
'95. As the film basks in the runway aura of icons like Tatayana
and Helena Christenson and designers like Valentino and Calvin
Klein, it only grazes the real story, which is how the industry
uses young girls once and then destroys them _ if they don't
destroy themselves first.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling grandmamma Lauren Hutton, shown doing what amounts to a
rehearsal for her short-lived talk show, provides ``Beautopia''
with its only moments of insight into the damaging world of
modeling in an engrossing heart-to-heart with a fatigued Naomi
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're addicted to admiration,'' Hutton tells the future
alleged batterer. That craving for fame is alluded to throughout
the film but remains tacit and unplumbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautopia'' is a lifeless journey, detouring into obviously
truncated conversations with models and former models like Veronica
Webb, who is shown praising modeling then is cut off right before
that critical ``but.'' It doesn't help that Cindy Crawford has the
most vapid exchange with none other than Veruschka von Lehndorf and
that the four girls are so lifeless they make the fashion
automatons of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ``The Bitter Tears of
Petra von Kant'' look like The Spice Girls.

 &HT;    CANDIDATE GORE BALANCES ENVIRONMENTAL AND BUSINESS APPEAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (p) politics and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the seven years since he wrote ``Earth in the
Balance,'' an apocalyptic environmental treatise, Vice President Al
Gore has found that presidential politics also requires a certain
balance.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore, in pursuing the Democratic Party's 2000 nomination, has
been reaching out to American business communities even as he tries
to retain the support of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, credited with inventing the phrase ``information
superhighway,'' has always been popular in the high-tech community.
Over the past year and a half, he has held 17 beer-and-pizza
strategy sessions with his ``Gore-techs,'' Silicon Valley whizzes
led by John Doerr, a well-known venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of manufacturing, small business and Wall Street
have had doubts about Gore ever since his 1992 book. In it he
called, among other things, for the elimination of the internal
combustion engine by early in the 21st century _ in other words, an
end to the automobile industry as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 campaign appearance in Michigan, President Bush
lambasted Gore as ``Ozone Man'' _ a ``guy so far off in the
environmental extreme, we'll be up to our neck in owls and out of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Black, a prominent GOP political consultant said Gore is
still vulnerable to such characterizations. ``He stands for more
regulation, more government solutions, not involving the private
sector,'' he said. ``Gore is an old-style Democrat,
McGovern-oriented, traditional liberal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fighting such perceptions on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   One is by citing the strength of the economy. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average has nearly tripled from its 3,241.95 close when
Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office on Jan. 20, 1993. So when
Clinton insists, as he did in New Hampshire recently, that Gore was
a part of every economic policy decision of his administration,
Wall Street is willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street likes stability, and in all likelihood a Gore
presidency would mean more Clintonomics,'' said John Geer, a
political science professor at Vanderbilt University who has
closely followed Gore's political career.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this may be the ``cultivational meetings'' that
Steve Rattner, CEO of the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres
and one of Clinton's biggest supporters on Wall Street, has been
organizing for Gore with financial heavyweights such as Bankers
Trust CEO Frank Newman, J.P. Morgan CEO Douglas Warner and
philanthropist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's other tactic is to highlight positions that business
finds attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense there that ... when it comes to a choice
between what the environmental community wants and what the
business community wants, Al Gore will go with the former,'' said
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute and a
longtime political associate of the vice president. ``But the vice
president has tried to show that he is flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club last fall, the
same Al Gore who once lamented the ecological damage caused by the
automobile gushed that ``cars have freed the American spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has pushed for more flexible enforcement at the
Environmental Protection Agency, and in late 1997, he instructed
the U.S. delegation to the global warming talks in Kyoto to
exercise ``increased negotiating flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Cook, author of a prominent political newsletter,
the Cook Political Report, said voters are more attuned to
environmental issues now than in 1992, and that works to Gore's
advantage. ``Green is the default color for most voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that Gore has prominently addressed issues of
``sprawl,'' the set of creeping suburban problems from traffic
congestion to the loss of open space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, longtime Clinton political adviser Dick Morris believes
the environmental issue could be Gore's ticket to the White House.
After so many natural disasters and El Nino, the American public is
``ready to buy the notion that there's fundamental climate change
really is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate and the environment have the potential to be the
same kind of explosive issue that crime was in the early 1970s,''
he added, and Gore, more than any other candidate, ``can mobilize
seemingly unconnected weather atrocities into a global issue and
really run on it.''

`F ZONE' AN OVERTAXING IRS RANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of ``The F Zone,'' an anti-Internal Revenue
Service tract masquerading as a movie, federal marshals acting on
behalf of the IRS seize the following: a sport-utility vehicle from
a pregnant woman, leaving her stranded in the street; a boys' home
from a black woman, putting her charges back on the street; and a
residence from an old woman, leaving her sobbing on her sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, subtlety isn't going to be one of this movie's
strong points. We never see these characters again; for all we
know, they're brazen tax cheats who deserved what they got. But the
implication is that the IRS consists of a bunch of jackbooted thugs
who are after all of our worldly possessions. The movie accents
that with its villain, whose name is _ are you ready for this? _
Lothar Guenter, a skinheaded IRS brute who looks like pro wrestler
Steve Austin with a briefcase. Lee West (TV's ``The Bold and the
Beautiful'') plays him as the broadest bad guy since Billy Zane
chewed the decks of the Titanic; you get the impression that
Guenter would tie his victims to the railroad tracks if he could
get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Among Guenter's targets is Dennis Smith (producer-writer-editor
William Harrity), a commercial director who becomes a guinea pig
for a tax loophole that works in the IRS' favor. You can tell that
Smith's a good guy because he gives money to panhandlers even when
he's threatened with bankruptcy. Smith, played by Harrity as if he
were fighting off a combo-plate-induced nap (hmm ... says here he's
a real-life anesthesiologist), seeks the aid of a comely lawyer
(Kelly Hunt), who has a tax-ax of her own to grind. She has to
grind it so hard, in fact, that she apparently drops all her other
clients just to work on Smith's case as he runs from Guenter and
his frick-and-frack federal sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   Buried within this stiffly acted, boringly directed film _ we're
treated to exciting shots of the lawyer watching Dennis staring at
his computer _ is a bit of subversive propaganda about how the
income-tax system is unconstitutional and the 16th Amendment that
created the IRS was never ratified. That would bear further
investigation if the film had any credibility, but it looks like
the work of an Internet crackpot who had access to a camera and lab
equipment. Its contrived lopsidedness recalls such '50s
anti-Communist fantasies as Jack Webb's ``Red Nightmare,'' a movie
that's now unintentionally hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind this probably believe that they've made a
public-service statement; Harrity, when he looks awake, has the
earnestness of an Eagle Scout. ``The F Zone'' is too inept to leave
a bad taste, but it still smacks of yuppie self-pity. You can just
bet that Harrity's upset about high taxes because he makes the kind
of money that leads to them.

FILM PROVIDES UNUSUAL INSIGHT INTO THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each new film on the Holocaust, there's a tendency to think
that because of ``Schindler's List,'' ``Judgment at Nuremberg,''
``Life Is Beautiful,'' or any number of European movies on the Nazi
death camps in World War II, there is nothing more to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who appears in ``The
Last Days'' with four other survivors of the death camps, each
telling a story that has not been told before.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Lantos praised director James Moll and the
brutal honesty of the documentary, which has been nominated for an
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect `Schindler's List','' said Lantos, the only survivor
of the Holocaust elected to Congress. ``But `Schindler's List' is a
movie, with actors, actresses and a script. It could've been made
25 years ago or 25 years from now. `Last Days' had to be made now.
This generation will be gone. This is the last chance to hear
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Days,'' produced by Steven Spielberg and the Shoah Visual
History Foundation, follows the Nazi slaughter of the last major
enclave of Jews in Europe, from Budapest, Hungary. While Hungary
was an ally of Germany. the bulk of the country's Jewish population
of 825,000 had been spared. But after Germany invaded Hungary in
March 1944, that changed radically _ in less than three months,
440,000 Hungarian Jews were deported and before the war ended more
than 600,000 had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told through the eyes of five Hungarian survivors:
Lantos, artist Alice Lok Cahana, teacher Renee Firestone,
businessman Bill Basch and Irene Zisblatt, a grandmother who made
it through the worst of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   It is Zisblatt who talks in the film about seeing children
thrown against the side of a truck until blood spurts from their
faces and says, ``That's when I stopped talking to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt remembers experiments on her eyes and her hands, of
being injected with a virus and doctors trying to remove the
tattooed numbers on her arm without anesthetic. She was pulled away
from a gas chamber by an angry guard when she couldn't be squeezed
through the door, and throughout her Holocaust years swallowed a
tiny handful of diamonds her mother had given her, waiting for them
to come out of her body and swallowing them again, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds survived the war and Zisblatt had them made into a
teardrop pendant, saying, ``These are the only things my mother
touched that I can touch.''
</P>
<P>
   When her family is rounded up, Cahana asks, ``You're allowed 25
kilos. What do you take?'' Firestone, crying, tells of wearing a
bathing suit her father had given her under her clothes, the colors
of it shining when she's forced to disrobe at the death camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are other unique moments in ``The Last Days.'' Basch tells
of the vow of three boyhood friends to ``die for each other'' _ a
vow broken when one of them is singled out by a Nazi guard who sees
him limping. His friends step in front of him, are threatened with
death themselves, and step back. ``We couldn't keep that promise,''
says Basch, tears in is eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Zisblatt remembers friends and neighbors yelling as Jews were
rounded up, ``It's about time! We don't need any Jews!'' Lantos
said. ``There was a naivete ... that we Hungarians don't do such
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lantos, the hardest portions of the film to watch were new
footage of Nazi crematoriums and Renee Firestone's confrontation
with a doctor who was at Auschwitz whose clinic conducted
experiments on prisoners, including her sister. Unable to get an
answer as to what experiments her sister went through, Firestone
explodes in anger, an anger that simmers throughout the film.
</P>
<P>
   Lantos, 71, is still mystified at Nazi guards in the final
months of the war. It made sense to shut down the killing operation
and put on a good face for the Allies, Lantos said, but instead,
crematoriums worked overtime to kill as many Jews as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate blinds you,'' said Lantos, pointing to the recent racial
killing in Jasper, Texas, the massacres in the Hutu-Tutsi wars in
central Africa and the ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia as
manifestations of that same hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have learned anything in all my years on this planet it's
that the veneer of civilization is paper thin,'' Lantos said.
``People become consumed by hatred. ... Brutality knows no
bounds.''

   WOMENHISTORY-FALK _ ATHENS, Ga. _ She was termed the most
dangerous woman in America. Federal agents followed her around,
writing down everything she said. She was briefly accused of
participating in the attempted murder of an official of Carnegie
Steel, then released and deported, much to the delight of J. Edgar
Hoover. When she died in Toronto in 1940, at age 69, Emma Goldman
was mourned as an ardent free speech advocate and government
critic. On Friday, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley scholar Candace Falk

'Texas Mafia,' a group of Texas Exes scattered all over the country
he met while a UT student. So, when Rod Caspers _ one of that Texas
Mafia _ signed on to do perhaps the biggest production of his
career 13 years later, it was no surprise he called upon Chandler
for help. Together the two veteran stage managers are producing UT
Interactive, a mammoth open house featuring about 470 events
showing off the importance of the nation's largest public
university. UT says the pair, who has orchestrated everything from
James Michener's memorial service to the ticker-tape parade for
returning Desert Storm heroes, personifies the influence UT has on
Texas and the nation. (Shah, Austin American-Statesman).

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Every home needs a dog
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susie Blair is a most distinguished citizen of Alexandria, La.,
and not just because her husband, Cecil, served as state senator
under four Louisiana governors.
</P>
<P>
   No, Susie Blair is esteemed because Susie Blair is AFAD and
proud of it, as am I.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, I was AFAD before Susie Blair ever told me
about AFAD Maybe you are, too.
</P>
<P>
   AFAD stands for A Fool About Dogs. AFADs cherish one another
almost as much as we do our dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Susie and her husband are in their early 80s, just ``two old
dinosaurs,'' she says, ``trying to keep rolling in this strange
world we face today.''
</P>
<P>
   But with all the ways the world has changed, one pleasure
remains the same for the Blairs _ ``the joy of having a devoted dog
to share our bed and hearth.''
</P>
<P>
   Susie, who can't recall a time when she didn't have a dog --
``my mama was that way, too,'' she said -- sees a need for pets in
nursing homes, ``even just for visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``None in Alexandria do so to my knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said I could make myself be happy even if I have to go
to a nursing home, but the one thing I could not do is adjust to
living without a dog to pet and love on.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there are any number of such programs, but I don't know
a thing about them. If you do, you may want to write to Mrs. Blair.
Send your letters to me, P.O. Box 151108, Lufkin, Texas, 75915, and
I'll pass them along to her. She'd be most grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here's something she passed along to me _ ``strict,
unbending rules for dealing with stray dogs,'' as endorsed by the
AFAD organizational headquarters. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   1. Stray dogs will not be encouraged to make this house their
permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stray dogs will not be fed. (Amendment 2a: Stray dogs will
not be fed anything except dry dog food. Amendment 2b: Stray dogs
will not be fed anything except dry dog food moistened with a
little water. Amendment 2c: Stray dogs will not be fed anything
except dry dog food moistened with a little water and leftover
steak scraps.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Stray dogs will not be taken to the vet. (Amendment 3a: Stray
dogs will not be taken to the vet except for the mandatory vaccine
shots such as rabies. Amendment 3b: Stray dogs will not be given a
collar unless one has to show the proof of vaccination tags.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Stray dogs will not be petted or played with by the children.
(Amendment 4a: Stray dogs will not be petted, played with or
cuddled unnecessarily. Amendment 4b: Stray dogs that are petted,
played with and cuddled will absolutely not be given a name.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Stray dogs with or without a name will not be allowed inside
the house at any time. (Amendment 5a: Stray dogs will not be
allowed inside the house except in very cold or very hot weather.
Amendment 5b: Stray dogs will not be allowed inside the house
except on days ending with the letter ``y.'')
</P>
<P>
   6. Stray dogs allowed inside will not be permitted on the
furniture. (Amendment 6a: Stray dogs allowed inside will not be
permitted on the really good furniture. Amendment 6b: Stray dogs
allowed inside will not be permitted on the really good furniture
unless there is a towel to put under them.)
</P>
<P>
   7. Stray dogs will sleep outside. (Amendment 7a: Stray dogs will
sleep in the garage. Amendment 7b: Stray dogs will sleep in the
laundry room. Amendment 7c: Stray dogs will sleep in the laundry
room in a cardboard box lined with an old blanket. Amendment 7d:
Stray dogs will sleep in a special Doggie-Komfort bed with
non-allergenic pillow.)
</P>
<P>
   8. Stray dogs will not be allowed to sleep in our bed.
(Amendment 8a: Stray dogs will not be allowed to sleep in our bed,
except at the foot. Amendment 8b: Stray dogs will not be allowed to
sleep in our bed under the covers. Amendment 8c: Stray dogs will
not be allowed to sleep in our bed under the covers except at the
foot.)
</P>
<P>
   9. Stray dogs will not win our hearts. (Amendments pending.)

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A guy from Jerksville
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's such a smooth guy. Speculating wistfully about
the future with Monica Lewinsky, he mentioned that their age
difference was, well, awkward. When he was in his 70s, she'd be
young and he'd be peeing 25 times a day. Now here was something I
could identify with.
</P>
<P>
   I fell asleep during Lewinsky's famous interview on ABC. Two
hours listening to strangers talk about sex is more tedious than
might be supposed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bill Clinton nor Monica came off well. He a heedless
cad. She sadder, but only somewhat wiser. Don't you know about
phone sex? It's fun!
</P>
<P>
   She seemed, by turns, peppy, ingratiating, contemptuous,
fragile, savvy, coy, apologetic, unrepentant, victim, user, the
modern woman, a kid. Bill was, in her memory, tender and sensual, a
sexual soul mate. At several moments, one could almost feel he
could get her back for a half-baked apology and a box of
chocolates. Otherwise, he's a guy from Jerksville.

MILK PAINTS, STAPLE OF YESTERYEAR, LAST FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ House paint was not sold commercially until the
middle of the 1880s. People made their own. Shakers and other
residents in earlier America painted their interiors and
furnishings with a milk paint whose formula dates back to Ancient
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Their paint mix was to simply combine milk protein, quicklime
and earth pigments.
</P>
<P>
   Milk paint is being made again today, because of its lasting
durable color. There are examples of milk paint finishes a few
hundred years old that still reflect the true color of the day they
were applied.
</P>
<P>
   The Old-Fashioned Milk Paint Company in Groton, Mass., has been
making such paint in 16 muted colors, from barn red to Lexington
green, mustard and pumpkin, the old-fashioned way since 1974, when
owner Charles E. Thibeau couldn't find it in hardware or paint
stores. He re-created the old milk paint formula to provide an
authentic finish for his hand-made reproduction furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients include milk protein, clay, lime and earth pigments,
such as ochre, umber, iron oxide and lampblack. No chemical
preservatives, fungicides or lead is used. Milk paint is packaged
in a dry powder form, allowing you to control the thickness for
either a wash stain, full cover coat or for stenciling. Powders
also may be mixed to create other hues and tones. Various finishes
and textures _ from a semigloss to an antique crackle _ can also be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight milky odor when applied and it's odorless when
dry in two hours, making it safe for those who are allergic to
modern paints and for children's toys and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't contain hydrocarbons or any petroleum derivatives.
Milk paint is easily cleaned up with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   Powdered milk paint comes in three sizes from a pint ($8.50) to
a quart ($14.95) and gallon ($42.95), which when added to water
will cover approximately 35, 75 and 300 square feet respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A milk paint surface can be polished, oiled, waxed, distressed
and polyurethaned. Mixed with Milk Paint's Extra-Bond, it also will
adhere to most nonporous surfaces, and a coat of Clear-Coat, will
seal the painted surface, making it easy to clean fingerprints and
spills.
</P>
<P>
   You also can make a version of milk paint for yourself by
combining powdered milk, pigment, lime and water.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FOES ARE READY TO CARVE UP THE COMPANY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues for release
Sunday, March 7
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON ``No! No!'' says the Red Queen of Hearts. ``Sentence
first -- verdict afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Alice in Wonderland'' fashion, Microsoft officials feel as
if their foes in industry and government have sentenced the company
before a verdict has been reached in its antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking last month, before the trial was recessed at the
federal courthouse in Washington until mid-April, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates said: ``All the e-mails I've gotten from my
lawyers tell me not to use the lens of the press to judge what may
or may not be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are, and these are the solutions _ if Microsoft is
found guilty _ that are being bandied about.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the so-called ``death penalty'' remedies.
</P>
<P>
   One would break Microsoft into several firms, each of which
would market a different type of software.
</P>
<P>
   Another would divide Microsoft into rival ``Baby Bills'' (cq) of
a sort, each of which would offer its own version of Windows,
Microsoft applications and server technology. In some respects, the
latter approach would be comparable to the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Still another potential path would be to require Microsoft to
license Windows source code. That would enabled rival companies to
clone the operating system while third-party developers extend its
overall functionality.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could also be barred from signing exclusive or
preferential contracts with hardware vendors. That would require
vendors to scrap their current practice of forcing consumers to
purchase machines already loaded with Microsoft's operating system.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers claim that Microsoft prevents them from offering
rebates on the already-loaded operating system to customers.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, if Microsoft loses the case, it clearly would be
bound to change its way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exclusive contracts (with partners) are as good as dead,''
Hillard Sterling, a technology and antitrust lawyer at
Chicago-based Gordon &AMP; Glickson, told PC Week, a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week what he would do if he were the judge presiding
over the Microsoft trial, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert
Pitofsky said: ``the remedy is where the challenge will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, on a legal panel in New York, contended the rapid rate
of change in the high-tech field makes it far harder to apply
standard antitrust formulas than in oil or steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech is different,'' he said. ``...You don't want to
under-administer or over-administer the law in that industry. It's
very hard to strike that balance in high technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft, spokesman Jim Culligan said: ``We believe it's
premature to talk about remedies since we believe we've built a
strong legal record in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Culligan was reacting to reports, initially published in the
Wall Street Journal, that the nation's largest software industry
trade group had recommended the Justice Department consider
breaking up Microsoft. Such a step, the group's 40-page report
said, could be an appropriate remedy for the damper that Microsoft
allegedly puts on competition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Software and Information Industry
Association's board urged the government to avoid imposing any
sanctions that risked a ``fracture'' of the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows, the report noted, has emerged as a de facto
industry standard. It currently runs on more than 90 percent of the
world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The next version of the operating system, dubbed Windows 2000,
is due to be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Microsoft is about to release the next version
of its browsing software, Internet Explorer 5.0. On March 18, Gates
is to demonstrate the program at the software company's Redmond,
Wash., campus. Preliminary versions have been widely praised in the
trade press.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust charges lodged last May against Microsoft stem
from its earlier behavior in the Internet browser wars. Remedies _
if the case goes against Microsoft _ could be shaped by the
company's response toward a consent decree signed in 1995. The
decree was approved by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is presiding without a jury over the current case.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged Microsoft with flouting the decree by
bundling its browser directly into Windows 95, after having first
sold Internet Explorer to retailers as a stand-alone item.
</P>
<P>
   After putting e-mail into evidence that shows Gates never
intended to change the way Microsoft does business, the Justice
Department does not appear to be interested in negotiating a new
consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the government persuades Jackson that Microsoft is
an abusive monopoly that behaves in an exclusionary and predatory
manner, the company would be free to appeal, all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, the quest for effective remedies proceeds
along two tracks:
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department antitrust chief Joel Klein has a panel of
internal and independent legal experts and cyber-savvy economists
weighing possible courses of action. Some members of Klein's panel
have participated in the trial, although David Boies, the
government's lead litigator, is not involved.
</P>
<P>
   - Attorneys general for 19 states, led by Iowa's Thomas Miller,
a Democrat, also are crafting recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   At the staff level, this effort is being coordinated by Steven
Houck, New York's antitrust chief.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown if the Klein and Miller task forces will make a
joint proposal to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson remains free to chart his own course and to seek outside
advice. If he does so, he's likely to turn to Harvard Law School
Professor Lawrence Lessig, on whom he sought to rely in an earlier
phase of the case. Microsoft successfully challenged Lessig's
appointment then as a special master by citing a joking e-mail
message he sent a friend.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear that Microsoft will lose -- as both new
technologies and the appeals' process move forward in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Says Microsoft general counsel William Neukom, who has
supervised the defense: ``We're in a very innovative business where
companies reinvent themselves and their product lines on a very
rapid basis. The notion that the government can observe this
torrent of innovation in technology and decide who ought to do what
in terms of the design of their products I think is foolish.''

ATTICS MAY OFFER MORE THAN STORAGE SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As we try to eke out more room in our homes,
there's one location that may offer the answer: the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Long used for storage of things forgotten _ from outdated
clothing and furniture to family heirlooms _ the attic, if large
and sturdy enough, can be converted into usable closet or living
space.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the perfect place for a finished playroom for the
children or perhaps a guest or even bedroom suite, home office or
quiet reading room. If you have a view, you just might want to
create a comfy space in which to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   Converting an attic into extra space can make sense in many
cases. In addition to being more economical to build up than out,
an attic conversion may offer the solution when there's no further
room for expansion on your lot.
</P>
<P>
   Many houses built before World War II feature large unfinished
walk-up attics with high-pitched roofs and strong floor joists,
offering what appear to be likely spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But before you run out for sheetrock, wallpaper and paint, there
are a few important points to consider before tackling this lofty
project.
</P>
<P>
   Many town, city and state building and fire safety codes set
minimum standards for the size of habitable space in an attic
conversion. These same codes, however, do not apply to areas that
are not considered living space, such as a closet or storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by making a complete floor plan of the type of room you
desire, measuring the space and placing everything from electrical
outlets to plumbing and ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are not making any changes or additions to the
exterior, you may still require a building permit. For this reason,
it is helpful to seek the help of a professional engineer or
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of remodeled attics out there that are not in
compliance with local and state building codes,'' said John
Hofelich, a contractor and president of the Albany Area Builders
Association. ``I've stopped short on a job because of noncompliance
to codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond legalities, there are a lot of mechanics involved when
converting an attic into a living space.
</P>
<P>
   Because many attics were constructed for ventilation and not
future expansions, existing floor joists may not be designed to
handle anything heavier than storage items such as Christmas
decorations, clothing and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Existing joists and trusses can be shored up if need be. But
remember to subtract any inches for thickness of flooring and
ceiling material from the maximum ceiling height.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider insulation, heating and cooling, as well as
plumbing and electricity. Again, local building and fire codes may
apply.
</P>
<P>
   You should also take into consideration that if you are on a
septic system, you may have to increase the drainage field and size
of your septic system. The addition of a sink and tub may also
require a separate or larger hot water tank.
</P>
<P>
   Hofelich said that anything that incorporates versatility into a
home today is a good thing as an investment, because houses last a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why adhering to building codes is important,'' Hofelich
said. ``And always use quality materials. They are safe and meet
industry standards and last. As I like to tell clients, `Good
things aren't cheap and cheap things aren't good. Long after the
sweetness of cheap prices have gone, the bitterness of poor quality
lingers.''

WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, HE FELL ON HIS SWORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 07, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is 72 years old. He was working 40 to 50 hours a
week on a job that pays nothing. He was making enemies at a clip
that no one in public life can sustain for long.
</P>
<P>
   And when it became clear that he was boxed in, that people
appointed by one governor were unwilling to do what another
governor wanted, he did the honorable thing and threw himself upon
the sword of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus passeth John Silber from the front lines of educational
reform. For three years of hand-to-hand combat, buoyed by his
intellectual firepower and hampered by his cantankerous
personality, the transplanted Texan kicked and whipped and cajoled
and sweet-talked and did every damn thing he could think of to
demolish the obstacles to improved education in Massachusetts, the
place where the public school was born, and where higher education
was planted on this continent.
</P>
<P>
   But hamstrung by a dysfunctional state Board of Education, with
no relief in sight from a pathetically dysfunctional governor,
whose ineptitude is ever more apparent, Silber saved Gov. Cellucci
from embarassment and threw in the resignation towel. Upon which
Cellucci, stumbling cameraward as usual in the wake of debacle to
claim victory before his yawning press corps, was the essence of
befuddlement.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, the dazed Guv claimed with endearing
ingenuousness, is a real victory for me, and my vision of
education. OK, so I didn't get the guy I wanted (the little-known
James Peyser) to be commissioner of education. OK, so I have to
swallow the guy I didn't want (David Driscoll, the consensus
favorite of the topheavy educational establishment) instead. And
OK, the only way I could give Peyser a role was to have him replace
John Silber as chairman of the board, with only vague and tenuous
influence over the commissioner. And, yeah, you got me, I showed
one and all that I couldn't get the board members appointed by me
and Bill Weld to do my bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With breathtaking naievte, Cellucci has the nerve to claim:
``The man I wanted is now the chair of the commission.'' Peyser,
continued the humbled governor, ``is a change agent . . . and he is
the boss of the man who did get the job.'' Yeah, Guv. Right. Thank
you and goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   And goodnight to to tart-tongued John Silber, the fiercest
critic of shoddy standards, pathetic management, spineless
politicians, obstructionst union deadbeats and that minority of
grossly-inadequate teachers clogging the educational arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci tried _ and failed, natch _ when he demanded the
resignations of two board members, Abagail Thernstrom and Roberta
Schaefer, who would not cooperate with Silber. The whole issue of
finding a new commissioner had dogged Cellucci for months. He'd
spent a lot of time in last fall's campaign praising Silber to the
skies. Why? Scott Harshbarger had promised the Massachusetts
Teachers Union he'd fire Silber first day on the job; Harshbarger
and Silber are political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's handlers ran a poll, discovering that 49 percent of
the voters approved of Silber's kick-butt approach to public
education, and only 27 percent opposed, which meant that defending
Silber in the election was a 2-1 winner for Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   But, having mangled the appointing process, having been suprised
by the intransigent objection of the GOP-dominated board to his man
Peyser as commissioner, and proving himself impotent when it came
to persuading six of the nine board members to back his choice,
Cellucci was stymied on arguably the most important issue facing
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   To save the sadsack governor's bacon, Silber threw himself on
the concertina wire, and let the hapless governor and his
incompetent staff run up his back to escape danger. This is one of
the most pathetic performances by any governor in decades, never
mind one fresh off a hard-won election victory and supposedly
bursting with ideas, innovations and intellectual intensity. This
was Keystone Kops to the kore.
</P>
<P>
   There's the usual chorus of pious hopes and optimistic
at-last-we've-turned-a-page enthusiasms and yes, let's give the new
people a chance, etc. etc. But the ramrod of reform is gone. The
let's-call-a-spade-a-spade impulse is muted. John Silber, the
educator with an attitude, is headed off-stage.
</P>
<P>
   He forced tests on the teachers, and tests on the students, and
took his rhetorical weed-whacker to the bureaucratic underbrush. He
ranted and raved and raised hell, and alienated a lot of folks in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   But would educational reform be where it is without Silber? Are
the students better off, or worse off, for his efforts? Would we be
where we are, with the meager gains we've won to date, without his
cantankerous contribution? Any fair assessment would acknowledge
that Silber, for all his controversies, was part of the solution,
even if his personality became part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   From the governor's bunker, there issues a sigh of relief.
Silber was always a little too high-octane for the Cellucci
administration. Bill Weld's intellectual incandescence has not been
matched by the low-wattage staff and narrow-gauge railway that
replaced Team Weld.
</P>
<P>
   What we wind up with is a system still mired in the ditch. The
governor, having narrowly avoided the creme pie in the kisser, can
pretend to have made some headway. The Teachers Union, having
outlasted its bitterest critic, Silber, now turns its attention to
the chore of undermining Peyser and his ideas about vouchers,
charter schools and other union-threatening reforms. Driscoll's
allies in the establishment can relax.
</P>
<P>
   Silber, who took the union to the woodshed, who rammed mandatory
teacher testing down the complaining throats of the union bosses,
who held up the mirror to the sad reality of public education and
made us all take a real hard look, is only one of the casualties of
this gubernatorial gong show.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is obviously wounded by this. The whole superstructure
of public education is shaken by the rifts exposed, and still only
papered-over. And the children of Massachusetts, pawns yet again in
political power-plays, remain trapped in what are all-too-often
second-class classrooms.

`BYTE FLIGHT' TO DIGITAL WILL TRANSFORM BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after World War II ended, something profound happened to
America's cities. Their best customers started moving to the
suburbs. This trend gathered momentum during the Eisenhower era. By
the end of the 1960s, it had transformed the nation's demography.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, suburbs had the best-educated residents, cities the
least-educated. Younger, richer, healthier people became
suburbanites; older, poorer, more infirm people remained in town.
Cities across the United States nearly collapsed as a result. Some,
like Detroit and Washington, never really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Something very much like this is happening in business today.
Best customers are going digital. Although their numbers are not
yet overwhelming _ they comprise roughly anywhere from a sixth to a
quarter of the total population _ the impact of their departure is
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Best customers control a disproportionate share of the nation's
financial assets and thus a disproportionate percentage of its
disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   They are younger, better educated, and more technologically
savvy. For countless business enterprises, best customers represent
the difference between success and failure. And they're leaving by
the tens of thousands, every week, for greener digital pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the impact of their departure and the wealth they
have already created in the digital world. Ten years ago, Dell
Computer did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the leading personal computer company in the world.
In two or three years, Dell will conduct 50 percent of its business
on the World Wide Web. By the end of the next decade, Dell hopes to
conduct all of its business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Yahoo! did not exist. Last week, 45 million
individuals passed through its site. That's 44 million more people
than read The New York Times on Sunday. Six years ago, Amazon.com
did not exist. Today, it has a market capitalization roughly four
times the combined market capitalization of Barnes and Noble and
Borders, the two largest bookstores in America.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Charles Schwab was considered a ``discount''
brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the leading digital brokerage service in the
country. Its competitors are scrambling to catch up. Thursday
night, Merrill Lynch initiated its own on-line brokerage service.
As Joseph Kahn reported in The New York Times, ``Merrill's main
task is not to lure low-end customers away from on-line brokerage
firms, but to keep its own 8 million clients, and their $1.4
trillion in assets, on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Best customers are leaving the world of atoms and joining the
world of bits.
</P>
<P>
   They're going there for groceries (witness the success of
Streamline and Pea Pod in Massachusetts). They're going there for
entertainment and travel.
</P>
<P>
   They're going there for financial services, credit cards, and
long distance phone service. They're going there for health care,
education, and every conceivable kind of information. In the near
future, they won't go anywhere that doesn't offer its services on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Their behavior will change every business in their path, which
is virtually every business. Among the Massachusetts businesses
that will be transformed is real estate. What is the value of real
estate? Traditionally, it has been all about location, location,
location. Best customers add a new and perhaps more important value
to the location trio: Internet access speed.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for towns like Needham and Westwood, which are
served by cable modem Internet access that is 10 times faster than
``normal.'' This is bad news for towns like Brookline and
Cambridge, which do not offer cable modem access. Unless Brookline
and Cambridge get faster Internet access, they will lose many of
their best customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best customer behavior will change the business of health care.
Anderson Consulting recently reported that the only part of the
health care business of the future that will look anything like the
health care business of today is acute care. If you have to have
open-heart surgery, you'll still have to go to a major hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Web will transform every other aspect of the health care
system. In the near future, basic readings can and will be taken
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Referrals will be done over the Internet. Medications will be
adjusted on-line. Amazon.com will be your drug store. Instead of
you going to it, it will come to you.
</P>
<P>
   Consider education. There is no conceivable reason that every
college student in the country cannot take David Donald's history
course at Harvard University. His lectures can be digitized.
Reading materials can be made available over the Web. Papers can be
assigned and exams can be taken on-line. Teaching assistants
(around the country) can grade the work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of you going to Harvard, Harvard will come to you.
</P>
<P>
   This will happen because best customers want it to happen.
Businesses that do not pay attention to this demand will inevitably
go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that meet the demand will get rich. If you have any
doubts about this, just ask the mayors of Washington and Detroit.
They're still dealing with the consequences of ignoring best
customers.
</P>

NO-COST DEALS ON THE NET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Economics 51, the professor always said there's
no such thing as a free lunch. Someone, somewhere was paying, even
for the ``free'' stuff. All you had to do was figure out what
people were paying how much and where.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Internet is busily trying to blow up this basic tenet
of economics, as it is with so many others.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a while, then, you can enjoy a digital dinner for
pretty much nothing, with free e-mail, free calendars, free data
backup, free Web space and even free computers at no cost.
Everywhere you go these days on the Internet, it seems, sites are
offering a bewildering array of stuff at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   But even free comes with a cost. In this case, you pay with your
attention, which some Information Age theorists say will be the
most valuable thing we each own in a media-saturated future.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are paying their way (or hope to, anyway) by
selling advertising. You keep going there to get your e-mail, or
check your calendar, and they get a guaranteed base of return
visitors to whom they can show ads. The more valuable the giveaway,
the more they ask of the user.
</P>
<P>
   For things like FreePC.com, the Pasadena company that made such
a splash last month with its plan to give away 10,000 (and perhaps
ultimately 1 million) computers, the requirements can be extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do you have to submit significant demographic details
about your life and buying habits, you have to agree to use the
included Internet service at least 10 hours a month. That
guarantees you'll be staring at oodles of perfectly targeted ads
flashing in a wrap-around border on your free computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of people seem willing to pay the price. FreePC was
swamped by 1.2 million applicants for its first round of offers.
</P>
<P>
   And other folks are using some of the lesser services in numbers
that are only possible on the Net, or at a Peking convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail, for instance, is the granddaddy of the free e-mail
services and now is part of Microsoft while busily fighting off
dozens of competitors. But Hotmail still has 35 million users,
roughly double the size of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of the smaller sites are offering free services too, often
with help from behind-the-scenes companies such as PeopleLink in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Scott Glenn, said people are drawn to
specific sites not for things like e-commerce, but ``for the
people. The content creates the context for a communications
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   PeopleLink provides the free e-mail, interest groups, chat rooms
and instant messaging services used by many major Web sites such as
AltaVista, Earthlink and Go.com, as well as dozens of small-timers.
The company's own Web site also provides direct access to many of
the services, though without the customization common on
specialized sites.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are willing to partner with PeopleLink for the
services because those give people a reason to visit _ and to stay
long enough to show them lots of ads.
</P>
<P>
   There are some advantages to these services.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll be able to access your e-mail from anywhere
in the world, as long as you can get online somehow, from anyone's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly useful for people who travel a lot; who
have company-supplied Internet access but want a personal address;
and for people who are tired of endless spam (unsolicited
commercial e-mail) and want a ``front'' e-mail address they can
walk away from should the advertising get too thick.
</P>
<P>
   They're handy as spam screens, too. If your home e-mail address
is starting to get a few too many unwelcome, unsolicitied junk
e-letters, using a free-mail virtual address to do such things as
register with sites online is a way to cut the gelatinized meat
byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't have Internet access through such common
outlets as a library, workplace or family member's home, most of
the free-mail services aren't much use.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, you might want to make a deal with NetZero Inc. in
Westlake Village. Again in exchange for your demographic
information, you get Internet access to go with the e-mail address,
saving you $20 or more a month in subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   You also get lots of ads, precisely targeted to you, in a
movable 1-by-3-inch window that can even show video clips tied in
some cases to the specific Web sites you visit.
</P>
<P>
   The excessively mobile also will benefit from such services as
always-available online calendars and address books, handy if
you're often jumping between computers in more than one place and
can't afford a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies will let you backup the contents of your hard
drive on their big storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   That provides a great deal of protection in case you live in a
tinder box. But the downside is someone else theoretically could
read all your files. And backing up over the Net can be
excruciatingly slow unless you have a very fast connection.
</P>
<P>
   InfoWorld columnist and editor Dylan Tweney warned that the
FreePC gambit and others like it will usher in ``an era of free
stuff and ceaseless advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   He posits a world where that model _ first embraced in radio and
television and now reaching its heights in the Internet _ would
lead to urban buses outfitted with TVs, plying city streets for
free while flashing ads at riders.
</P>
<P>
   And given the ads already plastered on milk cartons, can it be
far away before we see food given away as advertising platform?
</P>
<P>
   So even free comes with a price, just as the professor said. And
it didn't even take a ``calculus guy'' to figure it out. That said,
if you can abide by a little relentless commercialism in your
online meal, soup's on.

WHERE TO FIND THOSE FREEBIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Sidebar runs with FREE-MAIL)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Free e-mail. Free Web space. Free love. Well, two
out of three ain't bad, even for the Internet. Here's a brief list
of some of the free services offered online:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-MAIL AND WEB SPACE
</P>
<P>
   www.hotmail.com has about 35 million subscribers, making it the
world's most omnipresent letter slot. You may prefer something a
little more exclusive, so you can have exactly the e-mail handle
you want, but Hotmail lets you check up to five accounts at once,
though none can be your primary business account.
</P>
<P>
   Mail.com Inc. (www.mail.com) provides free e-mail services not
only directly but also through deals with big sites such as CNN
Interactive and the AltaVista search engine.
</P>
<P>
   LA.com (www.la.com) is a Los Angeles site that offers free local
e-mail services to go with its news, entertainment, wedding and
other items. And best of all, you can wear your Angelo-ness on your
virtual sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune City (www.fortunecity.com) offers both an e-mail address
and a whopping 20 megabytes of Web space, making it one of the more
generous free sites out there.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune City also just cut a deal with Warner Bros. to create
ACMEcity (www.acmecity.com), which allows users to create Web sites
that use tons of free art and photos from such Warner Bros.
franchises as Bugs Bunny and Batman.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities (www.geocities.com) has been a leader in providing not
only free e-mail and 11 megabytes of Web space, but grouping the
Web sites into 41 ``GeoAvenues,'' or areas of relatively
like-minded folks. And if you want more space, or to create a
commercial site, they'll provide that for modest prices. Yahoo!
just bought Geocities, so expect some interesting fallout as the
two operations merge more closely.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero Inc. (www.netzero.net) goes a step further than all
these services, offering complete Internet access that includes
e-mail and other services in exchange for your demographic
information and the requirement to always have a 1-by-3-inch ad
window playing on your screen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FREE INSTANT MESSAGING AND DISCUSSION AREAS
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (www.icq.com) has free instant-messaging capabilities
throughout the Net, just as America Online users can do within the
AOL universe. If a friend is online at the same time as you, ICQ
will let you ``chat'' (well, type) directly with them.
</P>
<P>
   Talk City (www.talkcity.com/) focuses on Net ``communities,''
with a wide array of subjects you can pick through, such as
knitting or sailing or whatever else appeals most to you. You can
also create a free home page, or check out their events calendar.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleLink (www.peoplelink.net) has message boards, discussion
areas connected to specific topics, chat rooms and instant
messaging, both on its own site and for a burgeoning number of big
clients.
</P>
<P>
   FREE CALENDARS AND APPOINTMENT BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Most of the portal sites _ such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and
Excite (www.excite.com) have numerous services to go with the
customized home pages they offer to their users, including calendar
reminders and more.
</P>
<P>
   For more extensive programs, though, Jump Networks' Jump site
offers free calendar, address book and e-mail services that link up
with your computer's programs, such as Microsoft's Schedule and

FOR THESE DRIVERS, HOT WHEELS CAN SINK A RACE

   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ Hydraulic jacks, portable heaters and
helmeted drivers have taken control of the frigid beach. Between
the belches of engines and the barks of Jim Guynup, pit boss and
starter, this is not the best place to work on a tan.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Ice Racing Association (NYSIRA) is here and
ready to rumble across the frozen water.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five of its members showed up last weekend at this
upstate New York resort to renew old rivalries and establish higher
standards. ``OK, let's line 'em up,'' Guynup shouts before the
start of a heat. ``We're running a little behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost at once, ice-gripping cars begin assembling two-by-two
for what looks like a Popsicle parade toward the starting line
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always this way,'' Harold Cameron said. ``We didn't
start using studs until 1980. Before that, it was rubber on ice.
Now, a lot of the finesse has gone out of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At 71, Cameron is still among the 100 or so members of the
NYSIRA. The Westerlo, N.Y., resident has been climbing behind the
wheel on frozen lakes since 1964. His wife Mary is usually not far
away as the designated scorekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these years, we've never had a serious accident that I
know of,'' Cameron said. ``Well, the worst was when a driver broke
his hip. It should have been prevented. He mounted the motor beside
him in the middle of the car. When he got broadsided, there was
nothing to protect him from slamming into the motor.''
</P>
<P>
   All the cars are equipped with bright yellow halogen lights on
the rear. Sometimes, when the ice starts flying, it's the only way
a driver can see the car in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets tricky out there,'' said Darryl Carl of Voorheesville,
N.Y. ``When you're going more than 100 mph, even a few ice chips
can hamper your vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl, who drives a modified Saab 900, is closing in on his fifth
club championship in his class. There are six classes, based on
such criteria as engine size and whether the car is stock or
modified. The most popular ice cars are Volkswagen Golfs and
Rabbits and other front-wheel-drive imports.
</P>
<P>
   The power-to-weight ratio is the key to success. Three of the 35
cars at Lake George on this day are rear-wheel drive, including a
30-year-old Corvair. ``Obviously, some of these (cars) have been
recycled many times,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the heats, we try to run the classes together,'' Carl said.
``But, in the finale, it's everybody against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Before studded tires, the cars relied on high snow banks to keep
them from spinning wildly out of control. The present course, 100
feet wide and plowed after each race, is set up clockwise with a
few wiggles in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like a Grand Prix road course than a stock car
oval,'' Carl said. Easily, the biggest challenge for NYSIRA is the
fickle nature of winter.
</P>
<P>
   If the lakes aren't solidly frozen when the first heavy snows
come, then it might be weeks before they're safe enough to support
cars because the snow on top acts as an insulation against frigid
temperatures. This winter has been one of the better ones. The club
has been able to compete on many of weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out a couple of days before the race and drill holes to
see how thick the ice is,'' Cameron said. ``Of course, it gets less
and less thick as we chew it up on race day. I've seen it when
water is coming up to the doors near the end of the weekend.''

`CABARET': SORDID, SEXY AND SATISFYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(NOTE USE OF ITALICS IN 3RD GRAF) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As you wait for the performance of ``Cabaret'' at
your table, perhaps sipping a drink, your eyes move to the stage.
There cast members ready for the show. Women, dressed in camisoles,
torn white stockings and open short silk robes stretch
provocatively or wander listlessly as if trying to come out of a
stupor. They smoke cigarettes or strike up a conversation with
someone in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   You notice bruises, a sickly pallor and dark rings under their
eyes that imply drug use. On a wrought-iron black platform that's
part of the stage, a trombone player from the orchestra, dressed in
a cut-off shirt, tattoos evident, sits on a chair. One of the girls
suggestively straddles his lap, facing him as he strokes her
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   (START ITALICS)Willkommen(END ITALICS) to the new ``Cabaret,''
which opened Wednesday at the Wilshire Theatre. Gone is the
world-weary irony and the between-the-lines coyness of the 1966
Broadway Tony Award-winning production, or Bob Fosse's 1972
Oscar-winning film, both of which told the story of second-rate
singer Sally Bowles during the rise of Nazism in Germany. Here,
divine decadence has been replaced with risque business that has
deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Emcee (Norbert Butz) of the Kit Kat Klub tells you ``to
leave your troubles outside/ so, life is disappointing/ we have no
troubles here,'' there is no insinuating glamour of the earlier
versions. Entering wearing a long black leather coat that opens,
revealing a bare chest with red sequined nipples, the Emcee exudes
an exuberant vulgarity. He operates throughout the show like a
street-corner pusher, luring in new marks while keeping the users
hooked. No matter how much the world is crumbling, or how ugly it
becomes, the cabaret is a strung-out junkie's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Sam Mendes, this reinvented ``Cabaret'' remains as
entertaining as ever, thanks to the wonderful Fred Ebb-John Kander
score that evokes the age of Brecht and Weill and jazzy production
numbers, but it also packs more punch. By placing most of the
audience at tables, Mendes creates a setting in which they are
implicated in all of the club's tawdriness as they laugh and
applaud the erotic gyrations of the chorus of men and women, who
feign an assortment of sexual positions throughout the show. And
the choreography verges on the chaotic at times rather than the
coolness of Fosse. (There are a few numbers done in storm-trooper
boots.)
</P>
<P>
   And don't go expecting to see the highly stylized sheen that
Joel Grey and Liza Minnelli imprinted on the roles of the Emcee and
Sally. Their cabaret was a place where Marlene Dietrich might stop
by. This one is more like a trip to an S&AMP;M bar, lash marks and all.
If Sally possessed the voice of Liza, she wouldn't be at the Kit
Kat Klub.
</P>
<P>
   This Sally (Teri Hatcher) is a second-rate performer, a cocaine
and sex addict with an exaggerated and misplaced sense of
sophistication. When she talks her way into the room of aspiring
writer Cliff Bradshaw (Rick Holmes) during the number ``Perfectly
Marvelous,'' it's her survival instinct at work. She's a girl of
minor talent who has used her feminine wiles and some time on her
back to get by. Like the club, she is walled off from the real
world. Hurts and slights are quickly covered over with jokes and
grandiose delusions. Deep down, she knows her limitations but
refuses to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a role like that is a difficult challenge (how do you
play second-rate without seeming second-rate?), but Hatcher, who is
making her stage debut, is up to the task. Though she never
commands the role, she commands your attention when on stage.
During her first production number, ``Don't Tell Mama,'' she oozes
little-girl charm. On the thin and pale character, it quickly
becomes a little-girl-lost quality in those few moments when she's
not performing or trying to charm someone. And while no great song
stylist, Hatcher's vocals work well within the musical's dramatic
context. More about that later.
</P>
<P>
   One thing this new ``Cabaret'' hasn't overcome is some of the
narrative problems of the original. Based on Christopher
Isherwood's ``Goodbye to Berlin,'' a collection of stories, and
John Van Druten's ``I Am a Camera,'' a stage adaptation of them,
the original musical is more of a photo album.
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around events on the stage of the Kit Kat
Club, the insidious growth of Nazism and two doomed relationships _
the strange attraction of homosexual Cliff for Sally, and Cliff's
elderly landlady Fraulein Schneider's (Barbara Andres) romance with
Herr Schultz (Dick Latessa), a Jewish fruit merchant. At times,
scenes play more like individual snapshots than part of the whole
picture, especially some of the Schneider-Schultz moments, as
charming as they may be. (The movie solved the problem by
eliminating their relationship.)
</P>
<P>
   But charming isn't really what this ``Cabaret'' is about. Mendes
uses the Emcee throughout as some perverse Greek chorus in an
attempt to tie the narrative together.
</P>
<P>
   As the Emcee, Butz has two tough acts to follow _ Grey, of
course, and Alan Cumming, who originated this raunchier androgynous
incarnation in London and New York. It is a particularly demanding
role and really pivotal to the success of the show, and despite a
few rough edges at the beginning on Wednesday night, Butz turns in
a strong performance, eventually revealing a human face beneath the
greasepaint.
</P>
<P>
   That is what ``Cabaret'' is about. At the end of the first act,
during an engagement party for Schneider and Schultz, Ernst (Andy
Taylor), a Nazi, is about to stomp off after learning that Schultz
is Jewish and has warned Schneider about the consequences of
marrying him. One of the boarding-house residents, Fraulein Kost
(Jeanine Morick), who has been doing her patriotic duty by
entertaining sailors in her room, lures Ernst back by getting him
to sing with her the stirring Nazi anthem ``Tomorrow Belongs to
Me.'' Then she asks everyone to join in. Since we have joined in
the fun up until then, it is a disquieting moment.
</P>
<P>
   The performances in ``Cabaret'' are solid. And Morick and
Latessa display fine voices. But a fine voice is not what Hatcher,
who is known for her film and television roles, needs when she
tears through the show's title number. Wearing a short black dress,
looking gaunt and in need of a fix, she practically howls as she
tries to hold herself together. It is a stunning moment. The irony
in the song is replaced with a sense of inevitable doom as Sally
recites the story of Elsie's death from ``pills and liquor'' and
then stomps off. It isn't often that you can turn a classic on its
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are your troubles now? Forgotten? I told you so. We have
no troubles here! Here everything is beautiful,'' the Emcee nearly
commands at the end. And then Mendes exposes the whole sordid scene
in a chilling finale _ the inevitable doom that Sally has foretold.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the cabaret, old chum? You bet. It's an exciting piece of
theater, but don't take the kids. &QL;

DAKOTA IS A PICKUP WITH MUSCLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dodge performance fans remember two of the famous muscle cars of
the late '60s, the Coronet and Charger R/T models, both available
with 375- or 425-horsepower V-8 engines, and the 1970 Challenger,
with a 230- or 425-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   Smog controls in the early '70s put an end to the Hemi-engine
models (the famous 426-cubic-inch, 425-horsepower demon), and Dodge
muscle cars were never quite the same until the introduction of the
Viper R/T 10 two-seater in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge has since extended the R/T designation to a 150-horsepower
four-cylinder Neon subcompact, a 242-horsepower V-6 full-size
Intrepid sedan, and, beginning last year, a 5.9-liter V-8 model of
the Dakota midsize pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Rated at a whopping 250 horsepower (well, it's whopping for a
little pickup) and an even more-impressive 345 foot-pounds of
torque, the Dakota R/T engine turns this truck into a small rocket
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Given the popularity of pickups, it sort of makes sense that
Dodge would soup up the Dakota to try to make a muscle truck out of
it. I decided that the R/T must stand for ``red truck,'' which is
the color of our test vehicle. It really stands for ``road and
track,'' which is not a reference to the automobile magazine, but
to the original R/T's dual role as a road and a track machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota R/T is a truck, so let's not get confused here and
start thinking that maybe this hot little pickup could ever handle
like a Charger R/T. The biggest problem is that there is no weight
over the drive wheels, so that when the driver gooses the gas
pedal, particularly on any kind of turn, the rear wheels break
loose and all of that power is for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Dakota R/T was fun, however, even with the traction
problem. This is not a high-speed truck, but it's hard to beat off
the line when the traffic signal turns green. That's a function of
all that low-end torque sending quite a bunch of twisting power to
the drive wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota's ride is trucklike, although Dodge has attempted to
smooth it out some. That's tough to do, though, when the vehicle's
raw power calls for a harder sport suspension than normal, as well
as front and rear anti-sway bars to maintain safe handling in the
curves.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably the cheapest thrill ride in the truck segment,
with a base sticker of $22,725 including popular options such as
air-conditioning ($800) and automatic transmission ($950) for the
regular-cab two-wheel-drive R/T. (The truck is not offered with a
manual transmission, which is probably best. With manual gears and
a clutch, the Dakota R/T would often be in need of clutch repairs
and new rear tires.)
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota is the only small pickup to offer a V-8 engine; to
get a V-8 in the Chevy, GMC or Ford truck lineups, a buyer must
move up to a full-size pickup with a full-size price.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the R/T's price tag might be fairly reasonable,
operating costs could be a bit of a problem for folks on a budget.
It gets an average of 12 miles per gallon in the city and 17 mpg on
the highway, according to EPA estimates. I had to fill up the tank
on our test vehicle about midway through the week, something I
rarely have to do with a passenger car.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a kick to drive (most of the time), the Dakota
R/T gave me the feeling that it had too much power for the target
market: young, single men who aren't really experienced drivers,
and whose idea of fun is trying to spin the rubber off the tires.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I believe the Dakota R/T regular cab is aimed at
young, single men is that there is absolutely no extra space in the
cab. The front seat rests against the back wall of the cab, and if
you're hauling groceries for a family, they would have to go in the
truck bed, exposed to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   It was kind of funny driving the Dakota R/T around town and
having young men in low-rider Honda Civics pull up beside me at
stoplights, race their anemic little four-cylinder engines, and act
as though they wanted to race me. As if ...
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was the short-bed model with a wheelbase of 112
inches. Base price for the Dakota is $13,260, but the R/T options
and other amenities, such as air-conditioning, power
windows/mirrors/door locks and more, quickly drive the price past
$20,000. The 5.9-liter engine alone adds $1,585, but you can't buy
a cheaper Dakota and just order the engine upgraded to the
5.9-liter powerplant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you must also pay $2,330 for the ``R/T sport group,''
which includes 17-inch tires, aluminum wheels, cruise control, tilt
steering wheel, sport suspension, fog lamps and special R/T
badging.
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our Dakota included fog lamps ($120); security
alarm ($120), and a so-called power overhead convenience group
($755), which added such amenities as keyless entry, automatic
day/night mirror and an overhead console.
</P>
<P>
   The R/T comes with a 22-gallon fuel tank, enough to make a few
runs around town or a few hunded miles down the open highway.

 &HT;    CANDIDATE GORE BALANCES ENVIRONMENTAL AND BUSINESS APPEAL
 &HT;    Eds: Updates ``nearly tripled'' to ``more than tripled'' in graf
8.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (p) politics and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the seven years since he wrote ``Earth in the
Balance,'' an apocalyptic environmental treatise, Vice President Al
Gore has found that presidential politics also requires a certain
balance.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore, in pursuing the Democratic Party's 2000 nomination, has
been reaching out to American business communities even as he tries
to retain the support of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, credited with inventing the phrase ``information
superhighway,'' has always been popular in the high-tech community.
Over the past year and a half, he has held 17 beer-and-pizza
strategy sessions with his ``Gore-techs,'' Silicon Valley whizzes
led by John Doerr, a well-known venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of manufacturing, small business and Wall Street
have had doubts about Gore ever since his 1992 book. In it he
called, among other things, for the elimination of the internal
combustion engine by early in the 21st century _ in other words, an
end to the automobile industry as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 campaign appearance in Michigan, President Bush
lambasted Gore as ``Ozone Man'' _ a ``guy so far off in the
environmental extreme, we'll be up to our neck in owls and out of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Black, a prominent GOP political consultant said Gore is
still vulnerable to such characterizations. ``He stands for more
regulation, more government solutions, not involving the private
sector,'' he said. ``Gore is an old-style Democrat,
McGovern-oriented, traditional liberal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fighting such perceptions on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   One is by citing the strength of the economy. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average has more than tripled from its 3,241.95 close
when Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office on Jan. 20, 1993. So when
Clinton insists, as he did in New Hampshire recently, that Gore was
a part of every economic policy decision of his administration,
Wall Street is willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street likes stability, and in all likelihood a Gore
presidency would mean more Clintonomics,'' said John Geer, a
political science professor at Vanderbilt University who has
closely followed Gore's political career.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this may be the ``cultivational meetings'' that
Steve Rattner, CEO of the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres
and one of Clinton's biggest supporters on Wall Street, has been
organizing for Gore with financial heavyweights such as Bankers
Trust CEO Frank Newman, J.P. Morgan CEO Douglas Warner and
philanthropist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's other tactic is to highlight positions that business
finds attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense there that ... when it comes to a choice
between what the environmental community wants and what the
business community wants, Al Gore will go with the former,'' said
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute and a
longtime political associate of the vice president. ``But the vice
president has tried to show that he is flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club last fall, the
same Al Gore who once lamented the ecological damage caused by the
automobile gushed that ``cars have freed the American spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has pushed for more flexible enforcement at the
Environmental Protection Agency, and in late 1997, he instructed
the U.S. delegation to the global warming talks in Kyoto to
exercise ``increased negotiating flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Cook, author of a prominent political newsletter,
the Cook Political Report, said voters are more attuned to
environmental issues now than in 1992, and that works to Gore's
advantage. ``Green is the default color for most voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that Gore has prominently addressed issues of
``sprawl,'' the set of creeping suburban problems from traffic
congestion to the loss of open space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, longtime Clinton political adviser Dick Morris believes
the environmental issue could be Gore's ticket to the White House.
After so many natural disasters and El Nino, the American public is
``ready to buy the notion that there's fundamental climate change
really is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate and the environment have the potential to be the
same kind of explosive issue that crime was in the early 1970s,''
he added, and Gore, more than any other candidate, ``can mobilize
seemingly unconnected weather atrocities into a global issue and
really run on it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the seven years since he wrote ``Earth in the
Balance,'' an apocalyptic environmental treatise, Vice President Al
Gore has found that presidential politics also requires a certain
balance.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore, in pursuing the Democratic Party's 2000 nomination, has
been reaching out to American business communities even as he tries
to retain the support of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, credited with inventing the phrase ``information
superhighway,'' has always been popular in the high-tech community.
Over the past year and a half, he has held 17 beer-and-pizza
strategy sessions with his ``Gore-techs,'' Silicon Valley whizzes
led by John Doerr, a well-known venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of manufacturing, small business and Wall Street
have had doubts about Gore ever since his 1992 book. In it he
called, among other things, for the elimination of the internal
combustion engine by early in the 21st century _ in other words, an
end to the automobile industry as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 campaign appearance in Michigan, President Bush
lambasted Gore as ``Ozone Man'' _ a ``guy so far off in the
environmental extreme, we'll be up to our neck in owls and out of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Black, a prominent GOP political consultant said Gore is
still vulnerable to such characterizations. ``He stands for more
regulation, more government solutions, not involving the private
sector,'' he said. ``Gore is an old-style Democrat,
McGovern-oriented, traditional liberal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fighting such perceptions on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   One is by citing the strength of the economy. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average has more than tripled from its 3,241.95 close
when Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office on Jan. 20, 1993. So when
Clinton insists, as he did in New Hampshire recently, that Gore was
a part of every economic policy decision of his administration,
Wall Street is willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street likes stability, and in all likelihood a Gore
presidency would mean more Clintonomics,'' said John Geer, a
political science professor at Vanderbilt University who has
closely followed Gore's political career.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this may be the ``cultivational meetings'' that
Steve Rattner, CEO of the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres
and one of Clinton's biggest supporters on Wall Street, has been
organizing for Gore with financial heavyweights such as Bankers
Trust CEO Frank Newman, J.P. Morgan CEO Douglas Warner and
philanthropist George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's other tactic is to highlight positions that business
finds attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense there that ... when it comes to a choice
between what the environmental community wants and what the
business community wants, Al Gore will go with the former,'' said
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute and a
longtime political associate of the vice president. ``But the vice
president has tried to show that he is flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club last fall, the
same Al Gore who once lamented the ecological damage caused by the
automobile gushed that ``cars have freed the American spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has pushed for more flexible enforcement at the
Environmental Protection Agency, and in late 1997, he instructed
the U.S. delegation to the global warming talks in Kyoto to
exercise ``increased negotiating flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Cook, author of a prominent political newsletter,
the Cook Political Report, said voters are more attuned to
environmental issues now than in 1992, and that works to Gore's
advantage. ``Green is the default color for most voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that Gore has prominently addressed issues of
``sprawl,'' the set of creeping suburban problems from traffic
congestion to the loss of open space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, longtime Clinton political adviser Dick Morris believes
the environmental issue could be Gore's ticket to the White House.
After so many natural disasters and El Nino, the American public is
``ready to buy the notion that there's fundamental climate change
really is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate and the environment have the potential to be the
same kind of explosive issue that crime was in the early 1970s,''
he added, and Gore, more than any other candidate, ``can mobilize
seemingly unconnected weather atrocities into a global issue and
really run on it.''

UNDERSTANDING THE SEMICOLON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days the semicolon, one of the least loved, least
understood punctuation marks, barely ekes out a living between the
period and the comma. It was not always that way.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Nunberg, a researcher at Xerox, an adjunct professor at
Stanford University and a consultant on the usage panel of the
American Heritage Dictionary, has spent a lot of time thinking
about the semicolon and its changing place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the semicolon, said Nunberg in a recent lecture,
you must first ponder written language in general. Is it merely a
way to transcribe spoken language or does it have its own
character? For Nunberg, the answer is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Written language captures things that spoken language never
could. Does anyone know, for example, what a semicolon sounds like?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sentence ``Order your furniture on Monday, take it
home on Tuesday.'' With a comma, it means that if you order your
furniture on Monday, you can take it home on Tuesday. ``Order your
furniture on Monday; take it home on Tuesday'' is different,
however; it is a double command. But you can't tell the difference
between the two sentences simply by reading them aloud. You need to
see their punctuation to detect the difference.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully, Nunberg said, the world of punctuation
has its own rules of power politics. Commas are the weakest,
semicolons are middleweight powers and colons are superpowers. Look
more carefully and there is even a ranking among semicolons. There
are the weak ones (replaceable by ``and,'' ``or,'' ``but'' or a
comma) and the strong ones (replaceable by words like ``since'' or
``because'' or even by a colon or a period.) But there is a strict
law governing all of them. If there is more than one semicolon in a
sentence, one cannot dominate. They must all be the weak type.
There is parity.
</P>
<P>
   This law of nondominance even governs the weakest type of
semicolon, which Nunberg calls a ``promotion'' semicolon, a
semicolon that would have been a comma if there were not already
too many commas in the sentence. Here is an example: ``He has
written books on Tinker, the shortstop; Evans, the second baseman;
and Chance, the first baseman.'' In this sentence all semicolons
are created equal, and they are all more equal than the commas.
</P>
<P>
   There was not always such a restrictive, democratic order
governing semicolons. Nunberg discovered that in the 19th century
and early 20th century, semicolons were as loose and carefree as
commas are now.
</P>
<P>
   T.S. Eliot used what is known as the appositional semicolon:
``The essential is to get upon the stage this precise statement of
life which is at the same time a point of view, a world; a world
which the author's mind has subjected to a process of
simplification.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Austen used semicolons to introduce subordinate clauses. In
``Persuasion,'' she wrote: ``His good looks and his rank had one
fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a
wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunberg even found writers who let their semicolons dominate
other semicolons in the same sentence. In ``Middlemarch,'' George
Eliot wrote: ``But some say, history moves in circles; and that may
be very well argued; I have argued it myself.'' In that sentence,
the second semicolon, working like a colon or period, dominates the
first semicolon, which acts like a comma. How could she let that
happen?
</P>
<P>
   Did 19th- and early 20th-century writers sprinkle semicolons
without any sense of propriety or limits? Or were there rules for
semicolons that are obscure to us now? After looking at passages
from T.S. Eliot, Henry James, George Eliot and Jane Austen, Nunberg
at last discovered the old law of the semicolon: A semicolon that
wants to dominate another semicolon in the same sentence must wait
for the end of the sentence; and then it can act like a colon,
trumping the rest; the last semicolon gets the last laugh.

GO AHEAD, FULFILL A VERY BASIC NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Your mention of the Apple IIe brought tears to
my eyes. Does anybody have an equivalent to Applesoft for Windows?
I don't know, but I suspect Visual BASIC is expensive and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old-Timer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OLD: No, I'm the one who's expensive and clumsy, but we're
not here to talk about my love life.
</P>
<P>
   You can score Visual BASIC for about a hundred bucks. It's the
``learning edition,'' which means it does almost everything the
``professional version'' does except cost an arm and a leg. And
don't worry: BASIC is still pretty much BASIC.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code, which some nerd must have thought was extremely
clever when he thought it up at 4 in the morning. Never mind that
it should be called BAPSIC. Anyway, it's an easy-to-learn
programming language using quasi-English commands, so geek wannabes
don't have to twiddle with hexidecimal numbers or languages like C,
where the commands resemble English only inasmuch as letters are
arranged haphazardly to form what appear to be words.
</P>
<P>
   And guess who churned out BASIC for the Altair, the first home
computer (although it was pretty much just a box with some switches
and blinking lights)? And for the Radio Shack Model 100? And, yes,
even for your venerable old IIe? Sorry, Bill-bashers, but you owe
the guy an apology. Without Big Billy Gates giving those early
boxes something productive to do, we'd all still be sitting here
staring at blinking lights. Can I have my check now, Mr. Gates?
</P>
<P>
   If you want something as simple as Applesoft, try snaring a copy
of QuickBASIC 4.5, which is out of print, but traded on the
Internet the same way baseball cards are.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find a copy of DOS 6, it came with QBASIC, a
stripped-down QuickBASIC. Ancient versions of DOS had GW-BASIC. The
bad news in all this (other than the stuff will probably be on
5.25-inch floppies) is that you'd only be able to write DOS
programs. True, they can run under Windows, but they look dorky and
old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Visual BASIC isn't that scary. The hard part is designing what
your application will look like. You take things like command
buttons and text boxes and slap them together like Legos until your
program is pretty. Then you add little snippets of code to each
Lego. If you want a command button to close the program, you attach
the BASIC command END to it. It's simple enough for a monkey to do,
which would explain the quality of some of the software I've seen
lately.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I can't load any programs without calling the
system administrators and waiting two days for them to get here.
How can I get by this ``lockout'' in order to load legitimate
programs?
</P>
<P>
   _ Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Try calling the system administrators and waiting two
days for them to get there. Like it or not, those people are
responsible for what's on your company's computers, and if the
latest virus starts popping up in all the wrong places, it's their
necks. And don't think they won't take you down with them. Load
your ``legitimate'' programs at home.
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay has gotten awfully
strict in his old age. You'd think he never pirated a copy of Doom.
Uh, ignore that. His real name is Michael Gerst, editorial systems
manager for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He can be reached at

and the culture's infatuation with New Age blather. ``She is a
Yahweh with a profound appreciation of irony,'' Deborah Mason wrote
in these pages in 1997. ``Weldon has become one of the most cunning
moral satirists of our time. In her rueful stories, justice is done
Q whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucasia By Danzy Senna. Riverhead, $12.95. This first novel
tracks the coming of age of the daughter of a white activist and a
black intellectual who struggles to find her identity in a harsh
and confusing world. ``Senna superbly illustrates the emotional
toll that politics and race take on one especially gutsy young
girl's development,'' Elizabeth Schmidt said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia By
Tim Judah. Yale University, $16. A journalist argues that the Serbs
have been subjected to ``ethnic cleansing'' since medieval times,
making it the driving force behind their national consciousness,
and he links the recent atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs
to a collective madness prompted by a desire for revenge. In 1997
our reviewer, Aleksa Djilas, called this ``a lively and balanced
history.'' Yale has also reissued Croatia: A Nation Forged in War,
by Marcus Tanner ($16), which focuses on a Balkan culture with a
bewildering web of influences and contradictions Q not to mention a
long tradition of close relations with Serbia. The book is
``written with vigor, full of absorbing stories and important
insights,'' Djilas wrote here, also in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Knife Thrower and Other Stories By Steven Millhauser.
Vintage Contemporaries, $12. The dreamers, inventors, artists and
illusionists who populate these tales don't know when to stop. The
author reveals ``splendid flashes of absurdity and satire'' and a
``rich, sly sense of humor'' as he explores our complex response to
``the products and projections of our own minds,'' Patrick McGrath
said in these pages in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cagney By John McCabe. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $14.95. Cagney the man
was hardly the tough guy and ebullient showman he portrayed on
screen: he was a retiring sort with surprisingly refined tastes,
the former ghostwriter of his autobiography maintains. This
``revealing biography'' exceeds ``the half-dozen previous books on
the actor at illuminating the private Cagney,'' David Hajdu wrote
here in 1997. Another iconic entertainer is profiled in Man on the
Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W. C. Fields, by Simon
Louvish (Norton, $18), which recalls the actor's early vaudevillian
career as a world-class pantomime juggler and does its best to sift
through the ``acres of flamboyant flim-flam'' that obscured his
past. ``Besides proffering anecdotes, Louvish does a heroic job of
filling in Fields's life,'' Katharine Whittemore said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton By Jane
Smiley. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95. The spunky 20-year-old narrator
blossoms into a committed abolitionist when she and her husband
journey to the Kansas Territory in the 1850's and are forced to
cope with hardscrabble prairie life and nasty proslavers. Until it
lapses into a ``feminist revenge fantasy,'' the novel is
``consistently entertaining, filled with action and ideas,'' Thomas
Mallon wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Edith Wharton Murders By Lev Raphael. St. Martin's, $11.95.
The moderator of a conference of hostile Wharton scholars at a
Michigan university turns reluctant sleuth when a celebrated author
turns up dead. The result is a ``maliciously funny campus mystery''
that satirizes ``the intellectual jealousies and political
rivalries . . . in academic communities,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brassal: Letters to My Parents Translated by Peter Laki and
Barna Kantor. University of Chicago, $16. The Hungarian-born
photographer Brassa (1899-1984) recounts in exuberant fashion his
efforts to support himself as an aspiring young artist in Berlin
and Paris. In 1997 in these pages, Christine Schwartz Hartley
called this a ``delightful volume'' that is ``rich in anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Night of Many Dreams By Gail Tsukiyama. St. Martin's Griffin,
$12.95. This novel centers on two sisters from Hong Kong growing up
during and after World War II and the family rituals that bind
them. Last year our reviewer, Bill Kent, admired the ``evocative
scenes of a wonderfully unexotic, warmheartedly domestic Hong
Kong.''

Y2K COMPUTER BUG EXPECTED TO BE FELT AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia and Ukraine could face prolonged,
large-scale power outages and additional food shortages next winter
as a result of year 2000-related computer problems, U.S. government
officials told Congress Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world, including many European countries, lag behind
the United States in addressing so-called Y2K computer problems
which could cause computers and other systems that rely on embedded
micro-chips to misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing the system to
shut-down or spit out erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global linkages in telecommunication, financial systems, air
transportation, the manufacturing supply chain, oil supplies and
trade will virtually guarantee that Y2K problems will not be
isolated to individual countries,'' said Lawrence Gershwin, an
intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said the world-wide consequences of Y2K problems _ also known
as the millennium bug _ will range from the relatively benign to
serious problems that could have wide-ranging humanitarian
implications.
</P>
<P>
   One major area of concern is Russia and other former Soviet
Union Republics like Ukraine that rely on nuclear power plants to
generate electricity. Such plants are run on old computer systems
and many of the vendors that supplied equipment and software have
not been in business since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While a failure of such plants would disrupt power supply, the
safety of the power plant itself is of greater concern. A certain
amount of power is needed to safely shut down a nuclear reactor.
The U.S. Department of Energy is currently working with the
Russians to try to avoid a breakdown of their nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Food shortages in Russia would also be exacerbated next year if
Y2K problems shut off power and disrupt telecommunications and
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States is expected to face relatively few
disruptions caused by domestic Y2K failures, Y2K problems in other
nations could have an impact in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Middle Eastern countries are lagging behind in
addressing potential Y2K problems. This could disrupt oil
production and shut down their desalination plants, which provide
virtually all of the region's fresh water, according to Jacquelyn
Williams-Bridgers, inspector general for the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imports about 50 percent of the oil it
consumes. About 20 percent of U.S. oil imports come from the Middle
East and about 25 percent come from Venezuela and Nigeria, two
other countries that are behind in fixing their computer systems,
according to the special Senate panel that is studying world-wide
Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week a committee report said any disruption to oil
imports could significantly affect oil availability and prices.
Canada, which supplies 15.5 percent of imported U.S. oil, is well
prepared for the Jan. 1, 2000 date change, according to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute issued a statement saying it
expects that oil-exporting nations will fix many of their computers
by the end of the year, knowing they will face severe economic
consequences if oil production is disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The API, a trade petroleum industry trade group, also noted that
the United States has a 61-day supply of oil in its Strategic Oil
Reserve if oil production is seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of concern is the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., vice-chairman of the Senate Y2K
panel, said the biggest problem regarding the shipping industry is
lack of information about potential Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin noted that some Y2K experts believe the shipping
industry has done the least to prepare for the Y2K problem.
Computers run everything from the loading equipment used in ports
to the ships themselves. Widespread failures in the shipping
industry would disrupt the flow of oil, food and commercial goods.

TELEVISION MONEY COULD BE BOOST FOR NASCAR RACE TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PATRICK ZIER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR's recent decision to retain negotiating rights for all
broadcasts of Winston Cup and Busch Series races could represent a
major step forward for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, individual tracks make their own radio and
television deals, the result being huge differences between the
fees paid for various races.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, NASCAR has gotten itself in a position much like
the NFL, where it can put together packages and offer them to the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   This should produce increases in the amount paid by the various
networks and cable companies for the right to televise racing.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers NASCAR an opportunity to check the spiraling
costs of competition and perhaps even increase the number of
competitive cars on the track.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the best teams tend to attract the most
money, enabling them to do things the less well-off operations
can't afford, particularly in areas like research and development.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR could limit this by setting a maximum limit on the amount
of sponsorship money that could go to any individual team, say $15
million for each car.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be difficult to enforce, because all NASCAR would
have to do is get copies of the sponsorship contracts.
</P>
<P>
   And it might cause some trickle-down if a company that couldn't
spend money on Jeff Gordon, for example, went somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The key to that, however, is convincing sponsors that more cars
can be competitive with better financing, and that's where NASCAR's
decision to negotiate broadcast rights comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 65 percent of television money goes to the tracks and
10 percent to NASCAR. The remaining 25 percent goes to the drivers,
usually by adding it to the race purse.
</P>
<P>
   But what if NASCAR took the 25 percent going to the drivers and
instead of putting it in the purse, gave equal amounts to the top
40 teams in the previous year's point standings?
</P>
<P>
   The tracks put a pittance of their income in the purse, so to
make up for the money taken out, the tracks' shares of TV revenue
could be cut to 50 percent, with the extra 15 going in the purse.
</P>
<P>
   With TV fees bound to go up, something like this could represent
a bonanza to the race teams, which might get an extra $1 million to
$2 million apiece, maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   That could make a difference to those struggling to compete. It
might allow teams with no research and development program to start
one, which could help them catch up to the best cars and attract
more sponsorship money that would put more competitive cars on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   So a lot could come out of NASCAR's decision, if the right
things are done.

NASCAR'S AIM: EXPAND AGGRESSIVELY WITHOUT RISKING OVEREXPOSURE

<P>
   One way NASCAR is building national interest in stock car racing
is by going to places that 10 years ago would have been almost
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these are places where it had once been and, for various
reasons, failed. Places like Texas, California and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Winston Cup circuit returns for the second
time to Las Vegas for the Las Vegas 400 on Sunday. The first Las
Vegas race was held a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding new speedways and new markets is an important part of
racing,'' said John Andretti, who drives for Richard Petty. In
1998, Andretti finished 41st at Las Vegas after losing a piston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to continue to grow, we have to grow every way
we can,'' Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A positive, controlled growth in markets is important,'' he
said. ``Adding Las Vegas last year, Homestead this year, California
and Texas a couple years ago, Indianapolis before that ... all of
that has really given the series a kick-start.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, NASCAR has added six venues to the Winston Cup tour.
And with more tracks either built or under construction, the demand
for races continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of businesses, you see some flat-lining on the growth
charts, but I'd say it's been a pretty good while since you've seen
that in Winston Cup racing,'' Andretti said. ``It doesn't have a
chance to flat-line.
</P>
<P>
   He credited that growth to NASCAR officials, singling out the
direction of NASCAR President Bill France, Chief Operating Officer
Mike Helton and Senior Vice President Brian France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough deal. You want to grow quickly because it's
exciting to grow fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you want to grow with some control because it's easy for
any business to outgrow itself. These guys walk a fine line, but
they seem to walk it pretty well,'' Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, that's because the France family has maintained its iron
grip on the sport through NASCAR, which it owns.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. Although Bruton Smith, who owns six
tracks, says all the right things, he could become a threat if he
acquires enough speedways to set up his own circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In December, casino owners Ralph Englestad and William Bennett
sold Las Vegas Motor Speedway to Smith for $215 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith does break from NASCAR, it could be a major blow. So
far, however, he isn't in position to do it, although in addition
to Las Vegas he own tracks in Charlotte, N.C.; Atlanta; Dallas-Fort
Worth; Bristol, Tenn.; and Sears Point, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop growing,'' Andretti said. ``Las Vegas, for
example, was a real asset to our schedule. This race took us to a
place we'd never been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there has been some racing around Caesar's Palace and
Evel Kneivel has jumped over everything in the city, but this
speedway was a legitimate, motor sports-only venue. I'm sure a lot
of people wondered if it would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious that it worked very well,'' Andretti said.
``The track is one of the show places on the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The television coverage was fantastic, and everybody had a
good time. I guess Mark Martin had the best time,'' Andretti said,
referring to the race winner. ``But the drivers, the teams, the
fans, everybody seemed to be really enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that, we don't just have a new market, we have a
solid new market, one that will be there for years to come.''

INTEREST GROUPS CALL FOR CLOSER SCRUTINY OF DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With statistical evidence suggesting dangerous
doctors may be slipping through regulatory cracks in New York,
consumer groups have called for closer monitoring of physicians and
mandatory public disclosure of medical disciplinary matters.
</P>
<P>
   A report jointly prepared by the Center for Medical Consumers
and New York Public Interest Research Group shows that,
statistically, New York is likely catching and disciplining only
half of the doctors who are a danger to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Thursday, also says that more than 40
percent of disciplined doctors continue to practice and that
patients, unless they know enough to ask, are unlikely to realize
that their physician's competence has been called into question by
state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Interest Research Group and the Center for Medical
Consumers contend that standard projections that roughly 1 percent
of physicians deserve serious disciplinary action each year
indicates that 700 doctors in New York should face disciplinary
action annually. Yet New York disciplines about half that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York state takes far too few actions, and that leaves the
public at risk,'' said Blair Horner of the Public Interest Research
Group. ``There are many more doctors that deserve to have their
licenses examined and their practices examined, and it doesn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Health Department questions the validity of a
statistical assumption that a certain percentage of practitioners
commit misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We investigate every complaint we receive,'' said spokesman
John Signor. ``Any disciplinary action that is taken is based on an
investigation. It is not based on an arbitrary percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Dears Kent of the state Medical Society said that when
similar charges were lodged several years ago, physicians ``stepped
up the plate'' and volunteered to double their own registration
fees to fund the Office of Professional Misconduct. She said the
additional funding assures that complaints lodged by patients are
investigated and dealt with ``in an appropriate and timely way.''
</P>
<P>
   As a related but separate issue, advocates said the state needs
to take a more proactive role in providing consumers with
information on physicians whose practice has been limited or whose
competency has been questioned by the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there needs to be a proactive requirement for
consumers, for patients, to be told when a doctor has had an action
taken against them and is still allowed to practice,'' said Arthur
Levin of the Center for Medical Consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Health department records, cited in the report released
Thursday, show that more than 40 percent of physicians punished by
the state continue to practice medicine. According to the report,
216 doctors in New York have been suspended since 1995, but 150 of
the suspensions were ``stayed'' _ meaning the physician could
continue practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers know more about cars than they know about health
care, than they know about their own physicians,'' Horner said.
``We are trying to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and medical offices are under no obligation to alert
patients when a practitioner is under the scrutiny of regulators
and advocates say consumers are unlikely to take the initiative to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   Horner and Levin would require doctors and medical offices to
inform both new and existing patients of any disciplinary findings.
</P>
<P>
   Signor said the health department is willing to consider the
proposal. Kent said the information is already readily available to
consumers.

 &HT;    Coverdell to join Bush's presidential committee

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell, Georgia's senior Republican,
flies to Texas Sunday to formally accept an elite position on the
presidential exploratory committee of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican and son of former President George Bush has
also tapped Coverdell to be his point man in the Senate, where
Coverdell has served since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious first order of business is to nurture and secure
as much support in this institution as possible,'' Coverdell said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's selection of Coverdell to be one of the 10 members on his
presidential exploratory committee, the first formal step in his
bid to win the 2000 presidential nomination, is hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell supported each of President Bush's campaigns for
president, including his first run in 1980 when he lost out to
Ronald Reagan. In 1989, Bush named Coverdell, then a state senator,
to be his Peace Corps director. Coverdell's visibility in that role
was one factor that helped him win election to the U.S. Senate in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been associated with this really grand family for a
long time,'' said Coverdell, who was re-elected to a second term
last year. In 1996, Coverdell backed the failed presidential bid of
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has already jumped to an early lead in the polls over
a crowded field of Republican presidential aspirants, has scheduled
a 2 p.m. Sunday news conference in Austin to announce all the
members of his exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Though by no means the flashiest of those who are likely to
rally around the Texas governor, Coverdell will bring formidable
political skills to Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is one of the Republican Party's most methodical and
aggressive fund raisers and he is widely respected in Washington
for his relentless commitment to the GOP mainstays of tax reduction
and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the senior senator from Georgia, Paul will be a potent
force, not only in Georgia but in other states as well,'' said
Georgia Republican Party chairman Rusty Paul, who will assume a
major role in the presidential campaign of publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also has established himself as a leader in GOP
education policy. Last year, he authored a proposal for tax free
savings accounts for education that won the backing of the
Republican Party. It passed Congress but was vetoed by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expected Bush to run a presidential campaign
that was different from that of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is distinctly a Texan, a southerner,'' Coverdell said.
``His dad was sort of a transplant, but not this kid. He's a
southerner. His campaign will be distinctly G.W.''

<P>
   XIAMEN, China _ King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the converted avionics plant where Dell Computer Corp.
builds computers for Chinese customers, optimism is bursting like
sunrise over the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early '90s? ``We
will do the same thing in China -- absolutely no doubt about it,''
says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has moved on from Dell's European
operations to oversee the start-up of the newest Dell factory here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the big open workfloor from Griffin's office, the Dell
sales manager has erected a Chinese gong. Whenever a salesperson
clinches a major order -- say 20 or 30 computers -- the sales
manager bangs on it with a wooden rod.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the
company is expecting. Dell China president David Chan predicts that
annual sales revenues in China will double in 1999, and then double
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Austin (Texas), the guys know what we are doing
here,'' said Chan, a former IBM marketing executive. ``Michael
knows what we've been doing on a month-to-month basis, because he
sees the results. He's very happy with the progress we've made to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments saying that the China
operation's progress has been ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impressive to see them kind of knocking down
milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and capacity,''
the Dell chairman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already China ranks as the world's fifth-largest market for
personal computers, with about 4 million computers sold last year,
compared to 8 million in Japan and 36 million in the United States.
With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year,
China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world's
third-biggest computer market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales
on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched
American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even
further behind Legend, China's fast-growing, state-owned computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's results for the last four months show signs of moving
up. For the first time, one percent of personal computers sold in
China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.'s
preliminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in
January, Dell notched probably it's strongest month so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively
quickly in China,'' said Dane Anderson, an analyst at
Connecticut-based IDC. ``They had a relatively strong performance
in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the
top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell expects sales in China to hit $1 billion within three
years, a company executive said in a report published Friday. John
Legere, Dell's president for the Asia Pacific Region, also told Dow
Jones News Service that sales in China at the end of 1998 were
running at a rate equal to $100 million for the full year
</P>
<P>
   Dell's workforce in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last
six months, and is projected to keep expanding past 500 by later
this year
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the five-story, blue-and-white Dell building
here, the phones are ringing. Since October, calls to Dell's
technical help lines have doubled as more customers break in their
new Dells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, new help-line technicians and order-processors are
showing up for work, and the top floor is running out of desk
space. The telephone sales crew is about to move to the vacant
fourth floor. And with no time to spare: the crew is expanding from
30 to 50 in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the second floor, the computer-manufacturing team grew
from 36 to 54, just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dell is the first computer manufacturer in Xiamen, almost
none of the assemblers had seen the inside of a personal computer
before they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dell picked them on the strength of experience in assembling
electronic parts in other Chinese factories. Now, five days a week,
they are turning out and testing Dell-brand notebooks, desktops and
servers that the company says are virtually identical to those made
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence
gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year.
That's when a landing party of executives from Dell's Singapore
office navigated China's bureaucratic reefs and won permission to
start a 100-percent, Dell-owned computer factory here.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the
hurly-burly of China's biggest city, Shanghai. But then the mayor
of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai,
approached Dell with an unbeatable, still nonpublicized package of
tax and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with its reception in Xiamen, Dell announced a year
ago this month that it would open a sales, manufacturing and
service center here. But three weeks later, China's central
government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering
all companies to cease ``direct selling'' in order to prevent
``social chaos'' throughout China
</P>
<P>
   Although the order mainly targeted alleged ``pyramid sales''
schemes by Chinese and Taiwanese hucksters, the language was broad
enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Products Inc. and
several other blue-chip international companies engaged in direct
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Dell's ``direct selling'' strategy could be viewed by
the Chinese as akin to the legendary Avon Lady's tactics in selling
lipstick door-to-door, outside normal commercial venues. But after
a few days of worried consultations with Chinese authorities, the
Dell advance party concluded that its own direct selling strategy
was not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record
time, Griffin's team of five expatriates recruited and trained a
200-member Chinese crew -- everyone from computer assemblers to
salespeople to telephone help-line technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early
products were clustered at the most expensive, high-tech end of
Dell's computer line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and
even Poweredge servers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Dell's foreign legion could find almost no Chinese
customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell's vaunted
worldwide ``model'' of selling computers directly to the customer
didn't seem to catch on in China.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the
factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based
American multinationals that purchase Dell equipment for all their
worldwide offices through their ``global accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's market share in China actually sank lower than the
previous year during the first month the factory was operating,
according to IDC. In cold numbers, Dell had done better when it was
still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through
Chinese vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, one of the sparkplugs of direct-selling in Dell's
Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last
October and took on the responsibility as Dell's bilingual
salesman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   As if by magic, the tide began turning about the time Chan took
on the assignment. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November
to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan's
salespeople were clinching orders from provincial
telecommunications companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One early customer was the state-owned Xinhua news agency, which
bought personal computers for its Beijing and Guangzhou offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, Dell locked up what was probably its biggest
China order so far -- 265 of the company's newest-model servers,
the entry-level Poweredge-1300. They were bought by one of
Beijing's increasingly technology-conscious government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sale that demonstrated Dell's strengths, and its
weaknesses, in China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell's China sales have been heavily concentrated in
what the company calls ``the corporate space.'' To Chan, that means
big buyers with at least ``a few thousand employees, buying a few
hundred PCs a year.'' They could be foreign multinationals, Chinese
banks or manufacturing companies, or agencies of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Dell an edge in ``corporate space,'' says Chan, is
that buyers are most often looking for the latest high-end models,
powered with 400 megahertz processors or faster. And they insist on
reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   In that price range, Dell's head-to-head competitors turn out to
be the same ones it has successfully challenged in Europe -- IBM,
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese computer makers are not really playing in the
high-end PC market that we play in -- at least not yet,'' Chan
said. ``They (Legend and other Chinese makers) are playing in the
lower-power market, selling 266 megahertz and 300 megahertz
desktops like those we used to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our minimum desktop is 350 megahertz, and very soon
it will be 400 megahertz. Every few months we jump up a notch, so
(the Chinese and American computer makers) are not meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dell would also like to sell computers to vast
numbers of Chinese individuals and small businesses. But it has had
only scant success so far.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Dell has made a hard-boiled marketing judgment
that the overwhelming majority of China's 1.3 billion people are
not now potential Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously pared down the theoretical mass market to
what it calls the ``addressable market size'' in China. That is
made up mainly of sophisticated urbanites and the big institutions
that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in deference to the market power of Legend and other
Chinese computer makers, Dell has avoided offering budget-priced
computers that might appeal to Chinese university students or other
first-time computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for Chinese looking for bargain home PCs, China-made Dells
aren't especially attractive. Dell's cheapest desktop sells here
for about $1,500, compared to about $800 for a desktop made by
Legend or other domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the Dell websites in China and the United States
produces other examples of why Dell isn't a consumer's bargain in
China:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell high-end Optiplex GX1p desktop sells for $3,010
in China, compared to a $2,672 pricetag on a virtually identical
GX1p model purchased through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell 266-megahertz Latitude notebook costs $3,601
when purchased through the Dell website in China, compared to a
price of $2,902 when the same model with the same features is
bought through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the
next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what
happens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the
highway from Dell's present Xiamen factory.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last
August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement
with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger
piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter
factory that would handle only the first few years' growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dell and its architects have laid detailed plans for
an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land -- one
with at least twice as much workspace that would contain highly
automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture
``huge'' numbers of computers, many more than the current Xiamen
factory, according to Dell's Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start
preparing the land for construction of the second Dell factory.
Dell has just hired a Chinese civil engineer to seek necessary
environmental and other construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the second factory should be cleared and ready for
the start of construction as early as August. But Dell's top
management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten,
there could be an indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best estimate is that in two years, we'll be in there,''
says Griffin. ``It won't be less than 12 months, that's for sure.
But it could be a year and a half from now.''

 &HT;    Socialite diary: `This is sort of the art of being a woman'
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lesley Friedman is a self-made woman.
She created a temporary-lawyer business in New York, sold it and
became a multimillionaire, then retired early and moved to Palm
Beach, Fla., four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then she took a look at herself.
</P>
<P>
   She never had the time before, she says. She and other women at
the law firm had purposely dressed conservatively, even matronly.
She got manicures when she remembered to, and she let her naturally
curly hair be. Makeup and styling really didn't make a difference,
she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes on dates, I would wear my business suit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was too busy to bother. ``I had the attitude of, `This is
me, successful and smart. People are going to like me no matter how
I look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She never married. When she retired, she realized that the
young, natural look starts to go in the mid-30s. And if she was
going to take the trouble to correct it, she figured, wouldn't it
be nice to have someone around to admire the work?
</P>
<P>
   So, a year and a half ago, she got started. She lost 25 pounds
on a variety of diets and hired a New York fashion consultant at
$100 an hour. She shipped her entire wardrobe by UPS to New York,
and the consultant threw almost everything out. Friedman, nervous,
learned to get used to low-cut necklines and tight pants. For the
first time in her life, she teetered on stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   As she changed she tackled dating, to a degree (73 blind dates
in one year) that The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page feature
story about her new ``job.'' She got hundreds of calls, some very
odd, but also a book deal. The topic: ``How I'm using my business
skills to find a mate.'' There's talk of a movie, and if that comes
about she wouldn't mind Meg Ryan in the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   She's finding, though, that her transformation is neither
complete nor permanent, and it certainly isn't cheap. It takes
hours of maintenance, and last week she was willing to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   With classical music playing softly and a vanilla aromatherapy
candle flickering, she lies back in a chair at Deborah Koepper's
Palm Beach salon and waits for her newest treatment, a light
electric current that is supposed to tone the facial muscles _ at
$75 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is refreshingly open. The only thing she keeps quiet
about is where she gets waxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I didn't care about this s---,'' she says.
``But when things started happening to me, it got really
bothersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman lives alone in Palm Beach and travels often to New York
or California, where she grew up in a Los Angeles suburb and
skipped dating to study.
</P>
<P>
   When in town, she spends her days working out at Mar-a-Lago,
visiting the salon, dating, going to parties, working on her book
and wondering if she started all of this a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman won't quite reveal her age. ``That's like asking a man
about his net worth,'' she says. She only admits to 37 and told The
Wall Street Journal she only admits to 39.
</P>
<P>
   Size is easier. She is a 6 or 8 on top and a 8 to 10 on the
bottom, and she still wants to lose another 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With the weight loss and the straightened and colored hair and
the dental work and the contact lenses, she looks nothing like her
driver's license photo anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She walks into the salon in slim black pants and a peach-colored
scarf around her neck one day, and the next she comes in wearing a
lime-colored tank minidress. ``I wouldn't have worn this dress
before,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her New York fashion consultant, Sheila Grant, remembers meeting
Friedman with her ``sacky'' dresses and her ``long, kind of bushy''
hair. ``She had no real sense of fashion or style, to be honest
about it,'' Grant says. ``As much as she was sort of reluctant, it
was a very exciting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a tall blonde who admits to having had a face lift at 47,
is used to seeing women like Friedman. ``Many, many women wake up
at age 40 and say, `My God, I don't have a life.' It's a panic
button. For Leslie, she had made all this money and was wonderful
and independent, but she wanted a personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   After dumping most of Friedman's clothes, Grant took her on a
three-day shopping spree for a 77-piece fall and winter wardrobe,
and even went with her to the hairdresser. In that first year,
Friedman spent into the six-figure range on clothes alone.
</P>
<P>
   Grant would dress her for her dates, and the two still talk
nearly every other day. Last week, Friedman needed to a buy a coat
for a romantic weekend in the Hamptons, and Grant described what
she needed over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Friedman thought the clothes were too young, too sexy.
``I want to be taken very seriously, for my brains,'' she says. But
she squeezed into the 3-inch stilettos and the strapless cocktail
dresses just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still fiddle,'' she says, ``but I try not to do it in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Her seasonal wardrobes are bought to mix and match. For one
season, she says, they bought four pairs of tight pants, three
cashmere turtleneck sweaters and four blazers. The spring corner of
her walk-in closet is full of lime greens and peaches, which go
well with her skin tone, and the usual black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Grant taught her to wear long jackets (``You're hippy''), high
heels with pants and low-cut tops (``I have a good chest'').
Friedman used to buy what was trendy or cute. Now she gets what
flatters her body shape, and when it doesn't she has learned to use
a tailor.
</P>
<P>
   She shops at Luca Luca, Escada, Celine, and Armani, but she can
walk just as easily into Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and the Gap.
``You can find a copy of an Armani at Ann Taylor,'' Friedman says.
And she goes to Nine West for ``great knockoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   About accessories, she knew zip. ``I didn't understand you don't
take a purse like this out at night,'' she says, pointing to her
beige Charles Jourdan bag. She went to Books-A-Million and bought a
book on how to tie a scarf, and packs about 15 scarves when she
travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the French women do it,'' she says, as she gets a
pedicure. ``They spend a fortune on accessories, and clothes-wise
they have just a few pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   She switches chairs, tissue paper stuffed between her toes, to
get her blow dry and manicure done simultaneously. At 11 a.m., two
hours after walking into the salon, the blow dry is over and the
base coat is on. ``I'm going to be here three hours today,'' she
says, marveling at the time. ``It's ridiculous. But I'm not gonna
cut back.''
</P>
<P>
   She grabs a phone. Usually she checks her messages, or chats, or
plans what clothes she will pack for an upcoming trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is flying to New York for a date? Wow, it must be
nice!'' Deborah Koepper says to Friedman, preparing her for makeup.
</P>
<P>
   She dabs on concealer _ ``She had the facial yesterday, so her
face is nice and plump and moisturized'' _ and peach-colored blush,
to show off Friedman's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All Friedman will have to do the rest of the day, Koepper says,
is touch up her Glossy Maple lipstick (Koepper's own brand). And
she's right _ lipstick is usually the only makeup Friedman carries
in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items for her weekend getaway are already laid out
on the table in her living room. Among the jewelry is a copy of
Chic Simple's What Should I Wear? She's more confident in her
judgment now, but a little help is nice.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, not finished with her changes. ``She's not
willing to accept any imperfections now,'' Grant says. They consult
about getting her ``undereyes'' done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like this is my creative expression,'' Friedman
explains. ``Before, I was doing nothing, just being casual. But
this is sort of the art of being a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The facial
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $135 per session
</P>

   How often: Every two weeks
</P>

<P>
   XIAMEN, China _ King Michael of Dell is capturing territory in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the converted avionics plant where Dell Computer Corp.
builds computers for Chinese customers, optimism is bursting like
sunrise over the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how fast Dell grew in Europe in the early '90s? ``We
will do the same thing in China -- absolutely no doubt about it,''
says Irishman Buddy Griffin, who has moved on from Dell's European
operations to oversee the start-up of the newest Dell factory here.
</P>
<P>
   Across the big open workfloor from Griffin's office, the Dell
sales manager has erected a Chinese gong. Whenever a salesperson
clinches a major order -- say 20 or 30 computers -- the sales
manager bangs on it with a wooden rod.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gong will be sounding more often, or so the
company is expecting. Dell China president David Chan predicts that
annual sales revenues in China will double in 1999, and then double
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Austin (Texas), the guys know what we are doing
here,'' said Chan, a former IBM marketing executive. ``Michael
knows what we've been doing on a month-to-month basis, because he
sees the results. He's very happy with the progress we've made to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dell echoed Chan's sentiments saying that the China
operation's progress has been ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impressive to see them kind of knocking down
milestones in terms of quality, order run rates, and capacity,''
the Dell chairman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already China ranks as the world's fifth-largest market for
personal computers, with about 4 million computers sold last year,
compared to 8 million in Japan and 36 million in the United States.
With personal computer sales in China growing at 27 percent a year,
China is projected to surpass Japan and become the world's
third-biggest computer market by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a latecomer to China, Dell ranks only 11th in computer sales
on the Chinese mainland. It lags well behind the entrenched
American multinationals IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and even
further behind Legend, China's fast-growing, state-owned computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's results for the last four months show signs of moving
up. For the first time, one percent of personal computers sold in
China were Dells, according to International Data Corp.'s
preliminary findings for the last three months of 1998. And in
January, Dell notched probably it's strongest month so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on it is that Dell is going to grow relatively
quickly in China,'' said Dane Anderson, an analyst at
Connecticut-based IDC. ``They had a relatively strong performance
in the fourth quarter. I think they certainly will break into the
top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell expects sales in China to hit $1 billion within three
years, a company executive said in a report published Friday. John
Legere, Dell's president for the Asia Pacific Region, also told Dow
Jones News Service that sales in China at the end of 1998 were
running at a rate equal to $100 million for the full year
</P>
<P>
   Dell's workforce in China has jumped from 200 to 330 in the last
six months, and is projected to keep expanding past 500 by later
this year
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the five-story, blue-and-white Dell building
here, the phones are ringing. Since October, calls to Dell's
technical help lines have doubled as more customers break in their
new Dells.
</P>
<P>
   Already, new help-line technicians and order-processors are
showing up for work, and the top floor is running out of desk
space. The telephone sales crew is about to move to the vacant
fourth floor. And with no time to spare: the crew is expanding from
30 to 50 in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the second floor, the computer-manufacturing team grew
from 36 to 54, just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dell is the first computer manufacturer in Xiamen, almost
none of the assemblers had seen the inside of a personal computer
before they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dell picked them on the strength of experience in assembling
electronic parts in other Chinese factories. Now, five days a week,
they are turning out and testing Dell-brand notebooks, desktops and
servers that the company says are virtually identical to those made
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   After about a year of market surveys and other intelligence
gathering, Dell launched its assault on China early last year.
That's when a landing party of executives from Dell's Singapore
office navigated China's bureaucratic reefs and won permission to
start a 100-percent, Dell-owned computer factory here.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1998, Dell was on the verge of locating in the
hurly-burly of China's biggest city, Shanghai. But then the mayor
of this quaint old port city, one-tenth the size of Shanghai,
approached Dell with an unbeatable, still nonpublicized package of
tax and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Delighted with its reception in Xiamen, Dell announced a year
ago this month that it would open a sales, manufacturing and
service center here. But three weeks later, China's central
government threw the entire project into limbo by suddenly ordering
all companies to cease ``direct selling'' in order to prevent
``social chaos'' throughout China
</P>
<P>
   Although the order mainly targeted alleged ``pyramid sales''
schemes by Chinese and Taiwanese hucksters, the language was broad
enough to cripple the China operations of Avon Products Inc. and
several other blue-chip international companies engaged in direct
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Dell's ``direct selling'' strategy could be viewed by
the Chinese as akin to the legendary Avon Lady's tactics in selling
lipstick door-to-door, outside normal commercial venues. But after
a few days of worried consultations with Chinese authorities, the
Dell advance party concluded that its own direct selling strategy
was not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   By last May, Dell resolved to push ahead. In what must be record
time, Griffin's team of five expatriates recruited and trained a
200-member Chinese crew -- everyone from computer assemblers to
salespeople to telephone help-line technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 20, Dell started the assembly line. The early
products were clustered at the most expensive, high-tech end of
Dell's computer line: Optiplex desktops, Latitude notebooks and
even Poweredge servers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Dell's foreign legion could find almost no Chinese
customers ready to buy Dell computers. Michael Dell's vaunted
worldwide ``model'' of selling computers directly to the customer
didn't seem to catch on in China.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, anyway. For the first month Dell was running the
factory, it had to rely almost entirely on sales to China-based
American multinationals that purchase Dell equipment for all their
worldwide offices through their ``global accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's market share in China actually sank lower than the
previous year during the first month the factory was operating,
according to IDC. In cold numbers, Dell had done better when it was
still exporting computers from abroad, and selling them through
Chinese vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, one of the sparkplugs of direct-selling in Dell's
Singapore headquarters, was named president of Dell China last
October and took on the responsibility as Dell's bilingual
salesman-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   As if by magic, the tide began turning about the time Chan took
on the assignment. By the time Michael Dell arrived last November
to commemorate the opening of his Xiamen factory, Chan's
salespeople were clinching orders from provincial
telecommunications companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One early customer was the state-owned Xinhua news agency, which
bought personal computers for its Beijing and Guangzhou offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 13, Dell locked up what was probably its biggest
China order so far -- 265 of the company's newest-model servers,
the entry-level Poweredge-1300. They were bought by one of
Beijing's increasingly technology-conscious government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sale that demonstrated Dell's strengths, and its
weaknesses, in China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell's China sales have been heavily concentrated in
what the company calls ``the corporate space.'' To Chan, that means
big buyers with at least ``a few thousand employees, buying a few
hundred PCs a year.'' They could be foreign multinationals, Chinese
banks or manufacturing companies, or agencies of the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Dell an edge in ``corporate space,'' says Chan, is
that buyers are most often looking for the latest high-end models,
powered with 400 megahertz processors or faster. And they insist on
reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   In that price range, Dell's head-to-head competitors turn out to
be the same ones it has successfully challenged in Europe -- IBM,
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese computer makers are not really playing in the
high-end PC market that we play in -- at least not yet,'' Chan
said. ``They (Legend and other Chinese makers) are playing in the
lower-power market, selling 266 megahertz and 300 megahertz
desktops like those we used to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our minimum desktop is 350 megahertz, and very soon
it will be 400 megahertz. Every few months we jump up a notch, so
(the Chinese and American computer makers) are not meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dell would also like to sell computers to vast
numbers of Chinese individuals and small businesses. But it has had
only scant success so far.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Dell has made a hard-boiled marketing judgment
that the overwhelming majority of China's 1.3 billion people are
not now potential Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously pared down the theoretical mass market to
what it calls the ``addressable market size'' in China. That is
made up mainly of sophisticated urbanites and the big institutions
that employ them.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in deference to the market power of Legend and other
Chinese computer makers, Dell has avoided offering budget-priced
computers that might appeal to Chinese university students or other
first-time computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for Chinese looking for bargain home PCs, China-made Dells
aren't especially attractive. Dell's cheapest desktop sells here
for about $1,500, compared to about $800 for a desktop made by
Legend or other domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the Dell websites in China and the United States
produces other examples of why Dell isn't a consumer's bargain in
China:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell high-end Optiplex GX1p desktop sells for $3,010
in China, compared to a $2,672 pricetag on a virtually identical
GX1p model purchased through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A typical Dell 266-megahertz Latitude notebook costs $3,601
when purchased through the Dell website in China, compared to a
price of $2,902 when the same model with the same features is
bought through the Dell website in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   How much of China does King Michael think he can capture in the
next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, perhaps the best gauge will be to watch what
happens in the next few years to a block of land five miles up the
highway from Dell's present Xiamen factory.
</P>
<P>
   At least four months before Dell opened its assembly line last
August, its executives had already reached a preliminary agreement
with Xiamen city authorities for a 99-year lease on the much larger
piece of land. Dell viewed its present leased plant as a starter
factory that would handle only the first few years' growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dell and its architects have laid detailed plans for
an efficient two-story factory on the larger block of land -- one
with at least twice as much workspace that would contain highly
automated assembly lines. It could theoretically manufacture
``huge'' numbers of computers, many more than the current Xiamen
factory, according to Dell's Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Xiamen city authorities are scheduled to start
preparing the land for construction of the second Dell factory.
Dell has just hired a Chinese civil engineer to seek necessary
environmental and other construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The land for the second factory should be cleared and ready for
the start of construction as early as August. But Dell's top
management has yet to announce final approval. If sales flatten,
there could be an indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best estimate is that in two years, we'll be in there,''
says Griffin. ``It won't be less than 12 months, that's for sure.
But it could be a year and a half from now.''

PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES DOUBLE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The number of pedestrians killed on the streets
of San Francisco nearly doubled in a one-year period, a statistic
that alarmed city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, buses, trucks and streetcars hit and killed 41 pedestrians
in the city between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998 _ up from 23
during the previous fiscal year, the San Francisco coroner said in
a newly released report. The death toll is the highest for
pedestrian fatalities in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are alarming,'' said Abbie Yant, administrator of
the Emergency Medical Services section at the San Francisco Health
Department. ``We know that pedestrian deaths and injuries are
disproportionately high in San Francisco because of the dense urban
environment; there's just a lot more traffic _ foot, bicycles and
cars. What we really need to do now is conduct an in-depth study to
really examine the accidents to figure out what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials could not explain the spike in pedestrian fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like there's a single factor,'' said Dr. Boyd
Stephens, the city coroner. ``It just seems like everyone's gone
crazy _ the drivers and the pedestrians. A lot of people just
aren't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 cases handled by the Police Department's Hit and Run
Detail for that yearlong period, 18 were determined to be the
pedestrians' fault, according to Lt. Marlene Ottone, who heads the
investigative unit. The biggest culprits were jaywalking and
crossing against a red light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of traffic and, at any given time, there may be
someone who's not completely attentive,'' Ottone said. ``But it's
not just the attentiveness of drivers. Pedestrians also need to
obey the traffic signals and cross in the crosswalks. In many of
these cases, tragedy easily could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases in which the driver was at fault, several pedestrians
were hit as they were trying to cross the street legally. Motorists
making left-hand turns and not yielding to those on foot killed
several people.
</P>
<P>
   There were the flukes, too: a parked car that rolled down a hill
and killed a 53-year-old man, and the 39-year-old drunk man who
fell off his bike and was run over by a truck.
</P>
<P>
   One victim was riding a shopping cart down the middle of a
street, ran a red light and was killed when he was struck by a
hit-and-run driver.
</P>
<P>
   Transit vehicles killed two people, a 72-year-old woman who was
struck by a bus she had just left and a 29-year-old man hit by a
streetcar in a subway tunnel where he was seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pedestrian Safety Task Force, made up of representatives
from city agencies and senior, disabled and environmental groups,
has compiled an annual list of the ``Dangerous Dozen,'' the
intersections most vexing to those on foot or in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco's not the easiest place to walk; cars seem to be
coming at you from all directions,'' said Linda Jacobson, a
waitress in the city's Mission District. ``You've got to stay alert
and be ready for anything.''

AN OXFORD HISTORIAN REACHES OUT TO THE PUBLIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Scotland)   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, England _ Niall Ferguson likes to joke that he became a
historian by default. ``At Oxford, I discovered that I couldn't be
a politician, I wouldn't mak a terribly good journalist, I was a
very poor double bass player and I was an absolutely appalling
actor,'' he said. ``I came to realize that what made me happy was
to sit in a library reading about dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   His choice of A.J.P. Taylor as a role model, however, suggests
he was not exactly yearning for seclusion. ``Alan Taylor was the
first historian I had ever heard of as a schoolboy,'' he recalled,
``and I had heard of him because his books were commercially
successful and he did television, newspapers and radio.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 20, then, even before graduating from Oxford,
Ferguson had understood it was possible to be both a respected
academic and something of a public figure. What perhaps the
soft-spoken Glaswegian did not imagine was that he would achieve
this double-billing _ ``The Intelligent Populist,'' as The
Spectator weekly magazine has called him _ so early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just weeks before his 35th birthday, he is a Fellow of
Jesus College, Oxford, and author of an appropriately learned tome,
``Paper and Iron: Hamburg Business and German Politics in the Era
of Inflation, 1897-1927,'' published by Cambridge University Press.
But he is also the most talked-about British historian of his
generation, thanks to frequent newspaper articles and interviews on
television and radio, along with two new books aimed at nonacademic
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World's Banker: The History of the House of Rothschild,''
published as a single 1,309-page book in Britain by Weidenfeld &AMP;
Nicholson, has been split into two volumes in the United States,
with the first 608-page volume, ``The House of Rothschild: Money's
Prophets,'' issued by Viking in December. Ferguson's other new
book, ``The Pity of War,'' about World War I, which appeared in
Britain in November under Penguin's Allen Lane imprint, will be
published by Basic Books in the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to have the books read, Ferguson (who pronounces his first
name NEEL) chose to publish them with commercial houses, which
helped assure him a large number of reviews _ almost all excellent
_ as well as a fresh flurry of press interviews. The books also
stirred debate since both present what historians would consider
new discoveries (for example, that Nathan Rothschild almost was
bankrupted by Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo or that Scottish
soldiers in World War I routinely killed their German prisoners of
war).
</P>
<P>
   For Ferguson, though, the main difference between, say, his
German inflation book and ``The Pity of War'' lies in their
presentation. ``Cambridge University Press will produce a book that
is intimidating to read, the print is small, the footnotes are on
the page,'' he explained. ``Penguin will produce a book which has
pictures, good charts, looks nice, and then they will market it.
But if you look at the texts of the two books, it's not that big a
shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson knows he is risking the disapproval of his academic
peers when he reaches out to the general public. ``I think it is a
minus in the eyes of the majority of academics, who are deeply
suspicious of `media dons' as a phenomenon,'' he said, sipping
mineral water in a hotel in the shadow of Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he insists that he is continuing an old tradition. ``The
idea of the academic as somebody who is dedicated purely to
scholarly activities, who will address only an inner priesthood who
speak the higher jargon, is a very modern idea,'' he said. ``I
think that, for a modern historian, engagement with the media is
terribly good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Ferguson specialized in economic history
and German history because he felt expertise in these areas might
serve him well outside the academic world. But he also believes
that knowledge of history can enrich debates about contemporary
affairs, whether the topic happens to be post-Cold War Europe, the
Bosnian conflict or even whether the stock market bubble is about
to burst.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, then, he has embraced journalism. ``Zola
said that journalism is the anvil on which everyone should bash
their prose into shape,'' he noted, adding that aggressive editing
of his early work taught him to write more clearly. He answers his
academic critics by challenging them to expound and defend their
views in public. ``It is much harder to convince television viewers
than your students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson looks the part of a ``media don.'' He cuts a dashing
figure, with his tousled hair, good looks and dapper clothes. He
wears the corduroy suit of an intellectual and the ``power''
suspenders of a banker. While his marriage to Sue Douglas, a former
editor of The Sunday Express, keeps him close to the world of
journalism. But he is also not short of opinions he is ready to
share.
</P>
<P>
   His political foes call him a right-wing historian or, more
generously, an intellectual conservative, although he describes
himself as a liberal fundamentalist. Either way, he seems to be a
product of Britain under Thatcherism: he believes strongly in the
market and in individualism and is opposed to government
intervention in the economy. Recently he spoke out against
Britain's joining the new European currency, the euro, although he
claims to be ``a very European person culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Scot, he has raised eyebrows by criticizing Britain's Labor
government over its efforts to increase Scotland's autonomy by
creation of a Scottish Parliament. ``There's huge hypocrisy about
Scottish nationalism,'' he said. ``Their nationalism starts and
stops at the entrance to sports stadiums. In reality, all the talk
of independence is just a strategy to get more money out of the
Treasury.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he insists that he is skeptical about ideologies. ``I think
being a historian is a terribly good cure for ideological rigor,''
he said with a laugh, ``because it's very hard to see any ideology
withstand the experience of 200 years of modern history.''
</P>

   Thus, if Ferguson had to name an underlying belief, it might be
old-fashioned research, like the four years he spent working on his
doctorate on German inflation. His massive history of the
Rothschilds, which covers the period from 1780 to 1918, was the
result of five years' work financed partly by a research fellowship
from the British branch of the Rothschilds, who also arranged for
him to become the first outsider to gain access to the family's
archives. ``The Pity of War,'' originally inspired by his
grandfather's stint on the Western Front, also involved extensive
research, which led him to go against the conventional historical
tide and conclude that World War I could have been averted. This
prompted some critics to tag the book ``revisionist.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, he was in Windsor working in the castle's Royal
Archives in preparation for his next book, a history of the
Saxe-Coburg family, which supplied much of the 19th century's
European royalty (including Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's
consort). On a year's sabbatical from Oxford, Ferguson is also
spending time at the Bank of England working on a long-term study
of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he has been teaching modern history at Oxford as well
as working on other books, including ``Virtual History:
Alternatives and Counterfactuals,'' a collection of essays about
the ``what ifs'' of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual history'' stands at the center of his approach to the
past. Specifically, by examining the uncertainties, dilemmas and
options of history _ for instance, ``Would World War II have
occurred without Hitler?'' _ he challenges the inevitability of
history and the supremacy of ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize we have a fundamental problem with
historical philosophy,'' he said. ``Some people just don't think
the past could be any different. And that leads to the belief that
history repeats itself. I think there's nothing more dangerous than
people who exercise the power of prophecy on the basis of a
deterministic theory of history. As Alan Taylor said, all we can
learn from history is how to make new mistakes.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you're hot in retailing, you're hot. And when
you're not, you're not. But with retail stocks, it's different:
When you're not hot, perhaps you really are.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., which for a while rode a wave
as shoppers and investors alike bought into the company's sterling
image. The stock was first offered to the public in June 1997 at
$26 a share and has traded as high as $33.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Ralph Lauren, the chief executive, was a proven
commodity. The brand was tried and tested, effortlessly pulling in
licensing royalties. But the stock was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the company issued a disappointing quarterly
earnings report. Company officials also said profits would be
squeezed for another six months. The reason was backed-up
inventory, mostly at downscale outlet stores. Compounding the
problem was heavy spending that had been intended to fuel further
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investors like American Century's $32 billion Ultra
fund, which looks for companies with accelerating earnings, dumped
the stock. Polo Ralph Lauren shares fell 16 percent, to $20.125,
the day it disappointed Wall Street. Over the next month, the stock
sank even more, to an all-time low of $15.875 on Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   To address its problems, the company last month announced a
restructuring that is expected to generate $15 million to $20
million in savings for its fiscal year beginning in April. And last
week, it announced that it would spend $52.5 million to acquire
Club Monaco, a small Canadian-based specialty retailer. The deal
raised eyebrows because it is unusual for a design house to buy a
retail chain devoted to selling clothes that are not its own. It
seemed to signal that the company was looking beyond its own brand
for promising growth.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have not succeeded in luring growth-hungry
investors back into the shares. But the steep drop in the stock has
persuaded a number of value investors to start or expand positions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company may make for a very attractive value play at
current levels. ``Ralph has a phenomenal brand established over the
last 31 years; people all around the world know it,'' said Ronald
Baron, chairman of Baron Capital Group. ``We think the stock is
really cheap, and that earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent,
and possibly over that, is achievable over the next few years.''
Baron Capital, which began buying the stock more than a year ago,
increased its position in December as the stock slid. Currently, it
owns more than 12 million shares, a stake Baron said represents
about 12 percent of the company. Another big holder is Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., which paid $135 million in 1994 for a stake that now
represents 23 percent of the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Black, president of Delphi Management, a deep-value
investor with a little over $1 billion in assets, is a more recent
convert to the stock. ``We bought it when the stock was selling at
between $17 and $18 a share, which I thought was good value,'' he
said. ``It is a great branded franchise that I think will
straighten out its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he started buying the stock in December and has added
to his position since. As of Feb. 26, he said, Delphi owned 182,000
Polo Ralph Lauren shares.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's drop caught the attention of Wall Street analysts,
too. Based on projections for the next fiscal year, Josephine R.
Esquivel, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, raised her
rating on the shares to ``strong buy'' on Jan. 7. ``At the time,
the stock was trading at about 14 times March 2000 earnings, which
we thought was a very compelling valuation for one of the world's
true premier global brands,'' she said. ``In talking to them, I got
the sense they were very, very committed to looking at all of their
businesses.'' Her 12-month target price is $30 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the recent cuts, overhead expenses remain much
higher than those of rivals. And some people wonder if the company,
which had sales of $1.5 billion in its 1998 fiscal year, has grown
too big to generate earnings growth of 15 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can make their numbers and live up to their promise to
reduce costs, people will have greater comfort'' with the stock,
said an analyst at a big mutual fund company, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, looking at the list of major shareholders, some analysts
say it may be a positive for Polo Ralph Lauren to have the likes of
Goldman, Sachs and Baron Capital paying close attention to the way
it conducts its business. ``If people are looking over Ralph's
shoulder, I don't think that is bad,'' said Brenda J. Gall, a
retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``If people are saying how he
should operate as a public company, that can't be all that bad.''

DELICIOUS, DECADENT SHADES OF BLUE FOR SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday March 7)  
(mk) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners with a weakness for blue know annual lobelia well. It
is a low-growing plant, rarely more than 4 to 6 inches tall with a
foot-wide spread, and it's covered with clouds of exquisitely
formed tiny blossoms from late spring until frost.
</P>
<P>
   There are trailing varieties to use in hanging baskets and
window boxes, and there are varieties that bloom white, carmine or
pinkish lavender. But those colors are common among annual flowers,
whereas blue is not. The first and most important attribute of
annual lobelia (L. erinus) is that its flowers come in delicious,
decadent shades of blue, a rare and welcome color in the summer
garden.
</P>
<P>
   The second important attribute of annual lobelia is that it does
well in dampish, semi-shady spots, where one would otherwise be
resigned to growing impatiens. Impatiens is a lovely plant, but an
occasional change of pace is nice, and impatiens doesn't come in a
true, vivid blue.
</P>
<P>
   If kept well watered, annual lobelia will take full sun, and
there are few more beautiful combinations than a drift of
midnight-blue lobelia in front of lemon-yellow marigolds. The tiny
tubular lobelia flowers are much loved by butterflies and
hummingbirds, and will attract a number of beneficial insects, like
syrphid flies, often mistaken for bees. Syrphid fly larvae _ tiny
tan, sluglike creatures _ are capable of eating an aphid every
minute.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any disadvantage to annual lobelia, it is that
admiring those delicate flowers, shaped like tiny vases with fluted
lips, requires getting nose-to-petal with the plant. Unless the
plant is growing at eye level in a hanging basket, that means
getting down on hands and knees. It's well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   In the perennial garden, you can enjoy the unusual shape of
lobelia flowers without groveling. The most common perennial
lobelia is L. cardinalis, or cardinal flower. It is native
throughout much of the East, favoring cool, shaded areas adjacent
to streams as far north as New Brunswick, Canada, and as far south
as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers have the same complex form as annual lobelia
blossoms and are borne in clusters on stalks up to 5 feet tall,
which makes them considerably more accessible for admiration. But
the color, as the name suggests, is bright scarlet. When it blooms
in late summer, cardinal flower provides a brilliant, fiery accent
in the perennial garden. If your heart is set on a tranquil and
cool blue, you will need to grow its cousin, the beautiful but
unfortunately named Lobelia syphilitica.
</P>
<P>
   The name came from the belief that lobeline, an alkaloid
produced by the plant, was useful in treating syphilis. All
lobelias produce lobeline to some extent, and extracts from various
species are still used in naturopathic and homeopathic remedies for
a variety of ailments. Native Americans used a wild species, L.
inflata, or Indian tobacco, as a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Since lobeline can be toxic in excessive quantities, it's
probably safer to enjoy the flower as a visual stimulant in the
garden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   L. syphilitica, commonly known as great blue lobelia, is a bit
shorter than cardinal flower, growing to three feet or less, and
not quite as hardy. It can be grown as far north as New England,
but it is relatively short-lived for a perennial and will need to
be divided or replaced every two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Its flowers are medium sky blue _ not as dark as the blues
available in some of the annual lobelias, but a restful shade that
looks especially nice with the silvery foliage of artemisias. Like
its scarlet-flowered relative, it's a late-summer bloomer.
</P>
<P>
   All lobelias prefer soil that is rich and moist but well
drained. They are streamside plants, not swamp plants. If planted
where water stands after a hard rain, they will rot at the base.
They will take full sun if the soil is constantly moist, but prefer
light or dappled shade.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal flower and great blue lobelia are easily started
indoors from seed, as is annual lobelia. But the plants take at
least 10 weeks to grow to garden size, so the annuals should be
started by mid-March. Perennial lobelia can be started in late June
and transplanted in early fall for bloom the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Lobelia seeds are vanishingly small, so don't try to seed them
in tidy rows in a seedling flat. Just scatter them as thinly as
possible over the surface of the potting medium, and don't cover
them. They need light to germinate.
</P>
<P>
   Some annual lobelias are blue with a white eye (Mrs. Clibran
Improved and Sapphire), and some are solid blue (Blue Moon and
Crystal Palace). The foliage can vary from deep green to bronzy
red. If you don't demand blue flowers, Rosamund is carmine red with
a white eye, and Riviera White is a good white variety.
</P>
<P>
   Color Cascade and Fountain are trailing varieties, available in
several colors as well as in mixtures of blue, lilac, rose and
white.
</P>
<P>
   The seedlings will be large enough to move into individual pots
or six-packs about a month after you sow them. It's fine to move
clumps of three or four seedlings, rather than trying to separate
the tiny plants.
</P>
<P>
   Like many small-flowered annuals, lobelia tends to flag in the
heat of midsummer. Shear the plants back by half and feed them.
They will bounce back in a few weeks and bloom through autumn.
</P>
<P>
   By then the asters, monkshood and spring-planted delphiniums
will be contributing a little more blue to the garden, but the
lobelia will be no less welcome.

 &HT;    MONICA, DIANA ALIKE IN MANY WAYS, THEIR BIOGRAPHER SAYS
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the tell-all biographer of Monica Lewinsky and
Princess Diana, Andrew Morton sees stark similarities in the
tabloid lives of these most scrutinized of modern women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both come from broken homes. Both had eating disorders as a
result of emotional trauma. Both became involved with very powerful
men,'' explained the author of the just-out ``Monica's Story'' (St.
Martin's Press, $24.95) and ``Diana: Her True Story,'' which was
first published in 1992 and reissued in 1997 after the princess
died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   And both displayed unexpectedly quick wits, he recalled.
Princess Diana, who was bulemic, would joke, ``I'm cheap to feed.''
After being waylaid by paparazzi outside a New York restaurant
where she had dined with the author and a publisher, Lewinsky
joked, ``It's a good thing you guys didn't take me to a cigar
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Although charmed by the self-deprecating humor, Morton suspects,
``for both women, it masked their low self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The author was suffering from no such feelings Friday as he
juggled telephone and television interviews from a New York hotel
room and received updates from his publishers in the United States
and Britain. The book about the former White House intern who had
an affair with President Clinton ``is selling like hotcakes,'' said
the writer.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor of the journalistic jungle of London's Fleet Street,
the 46-year-old Morton has written 11 books on the royal family _
none of which had been read by Monica Lewinsky when her lawyer
invited the author ``out of the blue'' to a New York meeting in
November. Lewinsky's attorney had seen a completely false item in a
London tabloid that Morton was planning to write a book about
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the more delightful ironies of this entire project that
it began as the result of a complete myth,'' said Morton in the
foreword to ``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, ``it was pretty clear within the first hour or
so that we got on pretty well. ... It seemed to be right,'' he
recalled Friday. ``I was talking about what I'm interested in, and
that is the difference between image and reality. The image of
Diana. The image of Monica. The reality of Diana. The reality of
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that really hit home as far as Monica was concerned,
because she had lived through the past 12 months when it was just
the image of Monica that has been projected and not the reality,''
said Morton. ``And I think that was the clinching argument.''
</P>
<P>
   A sudden and intense relationship developed, as Morton
interviewed the former White House intern and her family and
friends ``intensively over a number of weeks.'' They talked in New
York and Beverly Hills and Oregon, where Lewinsky had gone to
college. They sat on swings at a Los Angeles playground where
Lewinsky had played as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rules and she obeyed them _ for once in her life,'' said
Morton. ``The rules were that I had editorial control, but she
could check facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a book with some revelations that might surprise
even Kenneth Starr. A teen-aged Lewinsky was treated at an eating
disorders clinic. After discovering the married teacher with whom
she was having an affair was cheating on her, she paid ``him back
for his treachery by having a fling with his younger brother.''
During a lull in her relationship with Clinton, she had a
relationship with a Pentagon official that ended with an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the book, Morton said, Lewinsky felt she had been
``too candid'' at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's my job _ to get people to talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Were there any questions that his subject wouldn't answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. There were times when she said, 'Give me a brown paper bag
and I'll put it over my head','' he said. ``The thing about Monica
is that she's very open and she's very candid and we had a good
rapport. She spoke very movingly about her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were many differences between the subjects of
his two best-selling biographies, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica was thrust into the public limelight because of
circumstances. She was somebody's mistress. She had an affair,'' he
said. ``Diana was in the public eye because of her position. She
was a royal princess, the future queen of England. She was
celebrated because of her beauty, for her charisma, and for her
empathy for people. Monica is celebrated because of the scandal
surrounding her.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was much easier dealing with the Houses of Lewinsky than
with the House of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to interview Diana through a third party because of the
secrecy of the operation,'' he said. ``I couldn't ask follow-up
questions. And I like to get more of the flavor of the person _ how
they hold a teacup and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The royal family is bound by protocol and position,'' he said.
The Lewinsky family ``wanted to talk. In a sense it was a very
emotional unburdening for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Princess Diana would tease him about his neckties, Morton
said Lewinsky bought him a couple, as she did for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike with the president, though, we were like an old married
couple. We argue a lot but we don't have sex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said the unanswered questions about the whole affair have
mostly to do ``with the entrapment of the president and of Monica.
The linkage between the special counsel and Paula Jones's people.
The motivation of Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes his book goes beyond the story that has already
satiated the interest of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd read the Starr Report like everyone else,'' he said. But
through his interviews, ``it became very clear to me that there was
a different story there. ... It was a story of love and betrayal.
Of obsession. And it existed on several levels. It wasn't just a
Harlequin romance. It was a constitutional thriller, almost a
political thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to Monica subsequent to her betrayal is a
parable of modern American life _ how your life can be stripped and
picked clean in a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   After another week of book signings in the United States, Morton
will head home to England, where Lewinsky will already be promoting
her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to show her around,'' he said. ``I'm going to take
her to my home town of Leeds, take her for some fish and chips.''
</P>
<P>
   His next project? A book on Hillary Rodham Clinton ``would be
fun to do. I've always been intrigued by her. I was thinking about
that as a project long before Monica even came into the public
eye.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Marnie Mueller picked the occasion of her 50th
birthday for the homecoming to the place where she was born, but
found not a trace of it left.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a surprise, as Mueller was born in an infamous
prison camp, one whose existence the United States government would
just as soon forget. But then the light changed in the high sky and
it reminded of the light in her baby pictures. And then the breeze
came up and her face was soon coated with fine dust, an experience
her mother often described from her time in the Tule Lake
Japanese-American Segregation Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wiped my face and there was that same grit,'' Mueller
recalled this week in Seattle. ``I felt very powerful emotions at
Tule Lake, especially when I reflected on my mother giving birth to
me on that very day in a tarpaper hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The grit, the cold and the desolation of the Tule Lake camp
provide the setting for Mueller's powerful new novel, ``The Climate
of the Country'' (Curbstone Press, 306 pages, $24.95). But it is
the rugged politics inside the barbed wire of the camp that are her
real subject _ and her real contribution to the growing body of
testimony about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Climate of the Country'' not only examines the expected
divisions between the Japanese-Americans and those who incarcerated
them. It also examines the divisions between the Americans in the
camp (liberal social activists vs. law-and-order conservatives) and
the divisions between generations of Japanese-Americans (the Issei,
first generation immigrants, vs. the Nisei, second generation).
</P>
<P>
   That a white American would be writing about the various camps
within the camp is risky in these days of rigid ethnic and racial
correctness. But Mueller is reclaiming her birthright since she was
the first Caucasian born in the Tule Lake camp, just across the
California border from Klamath Falls, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my story,'' Mueller, 56, said. ``I'm a Caucasian
telling a story of Caucasians in the camp, a forgotten story that I
thought should be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The central characters in ``The Climate of the Country'' are
closely patterned upon Mueller's late parents _ Donald Elberson, a
conscientious objector doing social work at the camp, and Ruth
Siegel Elberson, a teacher there. Both of these social activists
graduated from the University of Washington and had strong Seattle
area roots _ Louis and Chana Kahan, Mueller's great grandparents,
were a pioneering Seattle family and her grandmother, Sara Siegel,
was a nationally known chemistry teacher at the then-Broadway High
School.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller's novel is not just family biography disguised as
fiction. Her beloved father is transformed into Denton Jordan, a
more conflicted character who has considerable doubts about his
role in the camp, where he is director of business enterprises, and
about his family life. Jordan even has a brief love affair in the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want some goody, goody white character when the
Japanese characters were enduring such troubles,'' Mueller
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is set in 1943, a bitter time at Tule Lake soon after
Japanese-Americans were required to sign loyalty oaths to the
American government. Some did and some did not and the divisions
wrought by the oath-signing boiled over into violence, especially
when Tule Lake was designated as a segregation camp to hold
``disloyals'' who had refused to sign and soldiers enforced martial
law.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, in her novel, describes the tense atmosphere at Tule
Lake: ``But who knew these days what was truth and what was rumor?
In this place the tiniest whisper, the slightest innuendo could be
blown into an article of faith in a matter of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Climate of the Country'' is particularly effective in
depicting the ghastly conditions and the haunting hopelessness of
life at Tule Lake. All that underscores the observation of a
Caucasian character who remarks, ``I never thought I would see such
inhumanity in my own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller's depiction of the camp has already won praise,
including some from those who might be the most skeptical. Critic
David Takami, writing in Seattle's International Examiner (``Asian
American Journal of the Northwest''), describes what Mueller has
done as ``a masterful interweaving of fictional technique and
historical detail.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the longest time, ``The Climate of the Country'' seemed
as though it might never be finished. The New York City resident
had written one previous novel, ``Green Fires,'' a rainforest
thriller that drew on her experiences as a Peace Corps volunteer in
Ecuador. But that was no help at all when she tried to create a
novel centered upon internment.
</P>
<P>
   So hamstrung did Mueller become that she placed the incomplete
manuscript in a drawer for a decade. She was wracked by doubts,
wondering if she were betraying the memory of her parents by
fictionalizing their experience, wondering if she were betraying
the memory of Japanese-Americans in the camp by ``airing their
dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem ran much deeper than that. Mueller was not only
trying to fill pages, she was trying to fill a void in her life.
She had spent the first two years of her life in a place that not
only no longer existed. It had been excluded from American history.
Not once in her schooling had Mueller heard anything about Tule
Lake or internment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had enormous impact on me,'' she said. ``To be born in a
place that is denied by the history of our country is such a
powerful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller's research in the National Archives and at the
University of California did provide historical reality, plus also
help bring her father alive again. He was often mentioned in secret
narratives written by internees, including a note that ``Donald
Elberson is the one Caucasian in the camp that we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, aided by the support of her husband and friends,
Mueller returned to the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbearably hard,'' she recalled. ``I thought I was
dying at times during the writing _ I literally had heart
palpitations. I thought I would never ever have this book out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Climate of the Country'' now stands as a testament to the
perserverance of both those in the camp and the writer who wanted
to tell their story. And it particularly honors the memory of
Mueller's father, whom she interviewed many years ago about Tule
Lake, the only time she ever saw him cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when,'' Mueller recalled, ``he started to describe a
Fourth of July there and watching Nisei children in Boy Scout
uniforms standing on the parade ground and reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance to the American flag. And behind the flag, he could see
the barbed wire.''

BUSH TO USE `CULTURAL LEADERSHIP' AS CAMPAIGN THEM, ADVISER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If he officially enters the 2000 presidential
sweepstakes, Texas Gov. George W. Bush will talk a lot about
``moral leadership,'' the idea that national leaders must teach the
difference between right and wrong, a longtime Bush adviser said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, a Washington-based Republican political
consultant who has known Bush more than 20 years, said that if he
runs, the governor will campaign on traditional GOP themes of lower
taxes and less government _ and will also portray himself as
committed to what Black called ``cultural leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``has spoken out not for government to impose its values,
but (has said) public officials should provide moral leadership and
that leaders need to help change the culture,'' Black told
reporters at a breakfast meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The governor believes that ``you cannot have the government
accept responsibility for everything and assign blame for
everything,'' Black added. ``It's up to individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders must be prepared ``to tell people there is a
difference between right and wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on ``cultural leadership,'' while not specifically
pegged to the Monica Lewinsky episode and the impeachment of
President Clinton, would be a calculated effort to put Bush in a
positive light in contrast to Clinton and his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it might also trigger greater scrutiny of Bush's own record.
Without offering specifics, the 52-year-old governor has said he
had a wild streak in his youth but that those days are long behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that while he has not discussed that issue with Bush,
``I do know he is confident there's nothing in his background that
in any way would disqualify him from serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would not necessarily benefit from the Lewinsky scandal if
a race shapes up between him and Vice President Al Gore, but he
would have other advantages, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no charisma there,'' Black said of Gore. He described
Gore as ``an old-style Democrat'' and a ``government-oriented,
traditional liberal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush government, he added, would include policies that
encourage the distinction between right and wrong _ ``boot camps''
for juvenile offenders, for instance, or an end to automatic
promotion of schoolchildren to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Black also offered an elaboration of Bush's description of
himself as a ``compassionate conservative. ``When he says
`compassionate conservatism,' he means conservative policies that
address 100 percent of people, 100 percent of the problem, and lift
everybody up as opposed to the kind of conservatism that might be
divisive, polarizing or appear to be discriminatory against some
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   While on some issues Bush has taken conservative positions _ he
opposes abortion and supports vouchers for private schooling _ he
has reached out to moderate voters, especially those in minority
groups not generally supportive of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some hardline conservatives have derided Bush's use of the term
``compassionate conservative.'' Presidential candidate Lamar
Alexander has accused Bush of employing ``weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Alexander said: ``My objection
was if we just say `I'm a compassionate conservative,' no one knows
what we're talking about. The country deserves better than that ...
We should be electing a president who doesn't mince words, doesn't
fudge the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has led Alexander and the rest of the early Republican pack
in virtually every poll. Yet, Black said at the breakfast, the
Texan does not have an overriding ``boyhood dream'' of becoming
president.
</P>
<P>
   Although he grew up in a political family and was an informal
adviser to his father, President George Bush, the younger Bush had
to be encouraged by a friend to run for governor, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   After serving two terms in that post, Bush would be ``perfectly
happy'' to return to his previous life as a successful businessman,
Black said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In setting up a committee to explore a presidential bid, Bush is
responding largely to widespread support by Republican leaders
around the country, including a majority of the nation's 30 other
Republican governors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, he started out saying, `Let me see if I can
get myself elected governor and see how I do,''' Black said. ``He
was fabulously successful at it and at the same time, a relative
vacuum opened up on the national scene, which any governor of a big
state would have to take a hard look at.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is ``confident he can do the job'' of president,
Black said he has not committed himself 100 percent to running. His
17-year-old twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, will be going off to
college in September 2000, just as the campaign is going into high
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his wife Laura and the girls still must talk through these
issues, Black said. ``The family concern is a legitimate one.''

NONSTOP SCHLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Its title implies that ``Sons of Thunder'' can lay
claim to some sort of mythical parentage, a direct link to the
gods. In this case, that would be the god of Saturday night
schlock, Chuck Norris, whose ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' continues to
find an audience drawn to bad writing, worse acting and
stomach-turning violence.
</P>
<P>
   To these viewers, Norris offers a respite from ``Walker'' for
several weeks (it'll be back April 24) so they can become
acquainted with two younger guys eager to give the Dallas crime
scene a good swift kick.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Wlcek plays private eye Trent Malloy, a Walker protege
who's still learning the art of hurting people without the aid of
gunpowder. He teams up with Carlos Sandoval (Marco Sanchez), a more
conventional police detective who quits the force because private
practitioners, he finds, are freer to ``handle things the way they
need to be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bogged down by procedure and the law, Malloy and Sandoval
are better able to bring miscreants to justice. (Translation: Be
prepared for lots of Dallas cops whose IQs are in the range of the
lower leafy vegetables and who just can't seem to solve a case
without the help of you know who.)
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's premiere episode offers not a single surprise:
A serial killer is terrorizing women, and then taunting Sandoval
with little messages in verse. The messages, of course, are clues,
because as we all remember from Serial Killer 101, these wackos
actually want to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who is an executive producer of ``Thunder,'' also aced
Cliche 101 at the School of Derivative Programming. In addition to
the dumb cop, tonight's episode gives us the African American with
authority but not many lines (police captain), the pretty woman in
peril (four, by my count), the hostage situation (two), the
well-connected friend who runs a bar (Alan Autry) and _ de rigueur
for any martial arts show _ the poolroom fracas in which the bad
guys always wait their turn to be whacked with a cue stick.
</P>
<P>
   While technically a spinoff of ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' ``Sons
of Thunder'' is really ``Walker'' with less of Norris in it. It's
as if the Chuckster is paving the way for retirement but making
sure CBS has a suitable successor.
</P>
<P>
   For fans of the genre, I suppose ``Sons of Thunder'' is
suitable, though Sammo Hung does it with lots more style in CBS's
other kick-face show, ``Martial Law.'' But for anyone seeking the
slightest bit of intellectual stimulation or even quality
entertainment, a burrito with extra hot sauce might work better.

   NEW YORK _ Selma Blair was among the first to arrive at her
movie premiere party at Henri Bendel last Wednesday night. The
movie, ``Cruel Intentions,'' is a remake of ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
with students at a fictional Upper East Side private school. By
showing up unfashionably early, Ms. Blair was completely in
character as Cecile Caldwell, the awkward, eager freshman that she
plays in the film.
</P>
<P>
   In her 18-month acting career, Ms. Blair, 26, has carved a niche
playing mystified adolescents on the verge. She also plays Zoe Bean
on ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,'' the WB network's teen-age version
of ``Friends.'' This was her first big-deal movie premiere. It may
as well have been her coming-out party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I have a little more grace than Cecile,'' she said, in
a blue Chloe gown, glancing down at her Jimmy Choo heels. ``They
don't have straps on the ankles.'' She was concerned about walking
out of them. Ms. Blair, who is from Southfield, Mich., was flanked
by Jason Grosfeld and Frances Lee, classmates from Cranbrook, the
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., prep school she attended. ``She was
certainly the heartthrob of Cranbrook,'' Grosfeld said, recalling
Ms. Blair as an actual 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   At Bendel's, the three set up camp at a table in the VIP room,
consumed Korbel Brut Champagne and chocolates, and watched the
party fill up with fashionable young Manhattanites. ``Who are all
these people?'' Ms. Blair asked. ``Everyone is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Hilton, Dylan Lauren, Miguel Forbes, Rachel Peters, Lulu
Johnson, Lulu de Kwiatkowski. The party had been stocked with the
Manhattan-Hamptons-Palm Beach crowd, the people portrayed in
``Cruel Intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese Witherspoon, Ms. Blair's co-star, stopped by to exchange
congratulations and trade compliments. She left soon after with
Ryan Phillippe, also a star in the film. Spotting the couple on the
way out, Ms. Blair said: ``You can tell I'm the newcomer. I'm just
thrilled to be here. I'm like, `This is my night out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blair didn't mind that the other guests didn't notice.
Samantha Ronson, a deejay, was spinning 1980s rock, from Bow Wow
Wow to Billy Joel. The truly stylish didn't dance; they splayed
themselves out on a red velvet couch.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Eleanor Lembo, a blond senior at New York University,
still in her coat, talked to Dani Stahl, a fellow Chapin School
alumna, drawing parallels between the film and people they knew.
Ms. Lembo said that after seeing the movie, she called her former
boyfriend on her cell phone to tell him he reminded her of
Sebastian Valmont, a character who gets a laugh when he says he's
tired of bedding ``insipid Manhattan debutantes.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about Valmont's wager that he can seduce a virgin,
played by Ms. Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Flanagan, the owner of Tavern, a popular bar in Southampton,
grabbed Ms. Lembo by the waist. ``I just made a bet that I would
sleep with you by June,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Back at her table, Ms. Blair and friends likened the night to a
prom. ``You want to look pretty and talk to all the cute guys,''
said Ms. Blair, who wanted to talk to Jake Gyllenhaal, the actor
from ``October Sky.'' Instead, she tracked his movements. ``Where
did he go?'' she asked, craning her neck. ``I still never got up
the gumption to talk to him,'' she said after he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Before midnight, Ms. Blair left the party in a limo with
Grosfeld. ``What's in my goody bag?'' she asked. ``Did they give me
food?'' From her brown and white striped gift bag she pulled out a
lipstick and candy-covered snacks. ``Popcorn, or something,'' she
said. ``My big night out, and they give me popcorn.''

WOMEN'S SPORTS HISTORY A SLAM-DUNK FOR HBO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a forgotten matter but a telling one about gender
history in American sports: When Babe Didrikson, perhaps the
greatest athlete ever, began to field questions about her
sexuality, she got married, wore her hair longer and skirts
shorter, and lowered her boastful version of 1940s trash talking to
a girlish whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Didrikson, an extraordinary track and field performer,
basketball player and golfer, died of cancer at age 45. Buried with
her was whether she married out of convenience to appease a fan
base that couldn't possibly have dealt with a lesbian hero. Buried
just as deep was the notion that Didrikson was too masculine for a
time when a sweaty woman was considered no woman at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Monday's documentary ``Dare to Compete: The Struggle of Women
in Sports'' (9 p.m. CST, HBO) makes abundantly clear, society still
wants its women feminine, graceful and even docile. Perhaps that
explains why women's figure skating has become the sporting event
most likely to seize prime network time.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why the young, pretty, shapely Anna Kournikova has, at
last count, 33 Web sites devoted exclusively to her existence _
even though she has never won a major tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   We must remember that long after Didrikson came Martina
Navratilova, whose two-decade rivalry with Chris Evert was covered
by a press that favored the girlish Evert over the muscular
Navratilova. Like Didrikson, Navratilova confronted questions about
her sexual identity until eventually she was forced to come out as
that she was] a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Both Evert and Navratilova are interviewed, along with
historians and other athletes. What Evert remembers about their
heyday are her endorsements, while Navratilova, lacking the
feminine charms required, recalls being ``killed by the media,''as
she puts it in disgust. (Just as intriguing is that Evert never
actually defends Navratilova, making one suspect that she, too,
bought into the black hat-white hat hype.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish women's achievements. Probably the most
interesting factor of this immensely dignified and effective
90-minute documentary is how it unobtrusively lays out colorful
stories in historically chronological order, allowing viewers to
make out the meaning of how each generation made headway in closing
the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accomplishments, like women attaining the right to
compete in the 1928 Olympic Games, the pivotal moments in
governmental decision-making, and the Title IX legislation forcing
colleges and universities to share the wealth with women's athletic
departments, are famous even to nonfans. But this account also
draws attention to a number of lesser-known stories.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know, for example, that in 1967 Kathrine Switzer had
entered the male-only Boston Marathon under the name K.V. Switzer.
During the race, she was literally tackled by the director, Jock
Simple, who had learned of her participation from TV news crews and
apparently went berserk. There's terrific footage showing the
bizarre spectacle, which would be laughable if it weren't so
humiliatingly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer finished the race but was banned from any AAU
competition. Seven years later she won the New York Marathon,
beating more than half the men.
</P>
<P>
   Particular attention is given to tennis star Billie Jean King's
defeat of Bobby Riggs, the rise of women's basketball, and how
black women were discriminated against on two fronts. (They show
the film clip of the black woman firing a baseball well over the
head of Geena Davis in ``A League of Our Own,'' the one scene that
explained the absence of black players.)

   It's impossible to not gain respect for the struggle female
athletes have faced at the hands of men (and some women) who
believed the hype that women simply didn't belong in competitive
sports. Women were told that running long distances, for instance,
would prevent them from being able to have children. And the
lesbian factor _ society's belief that you must be homosexual if
you were an athlete _ kept just as many women away from such
activity.

PREMIER SAYS ITALY EXPECTS PUNISHMENT IN SKI LIFT TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema bluntly told
President Clinton Friday that Italy expects the United States to
identify, convict and punish those responsible for a Marine Corps
combat aircraft slicing through a ski lift cable in the Italian
Alps last year, sending 20 skiers to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema pressed his demand with unusually explicit language at a
joint news conference with Clinton that capped a tense U.S.-Italian
summit, which was overshadowed by Thursday's acquittal of the
Marine pilot who had been accused in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Capt. Richard Ashby was cleared of 20 counts of
involuntary manslaughter and other charges stemming from the Feb.
3, 1998, accident near Cavalese. It was caused when his EA-6B
Prowler aircraft slashed through a cable car cable 300 feet over
the valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 31, faces a separate court-martial on charges of
obstruction of justice stemming from allegations that he removed a
videotape from a video camera used by the crew during the fateful
flight. The aircraft navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 30, faces
a court-martial as well in late March.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said Italians ``are not asking for a scapegoat,''
adding: ``But we expect that at the end of this process it is clear
and it is determined who is responsible, and those who are found
responsible are punished through a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said Ashby's acquittal by a jury of eight Marine
officers ``gave the impression'' that the United States ``could
find no effective answer in terms of determination and punishment
of those responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is
responsible for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal and the accident have caused an uproar in Italy, a
close ally that permits American combat aircraft to use the air
base at Aviano to stage air patrols over Bosnia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and D'Alema, working to counter Italians' frustration
with the outcome of the court-martial, agreed that Defense
Secretary William Cohen and his Italian counterpart would review
procedures governing U.S. military operations in Italy to assure
the safety of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he would not press for changes in a 1952 provision
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that allows each of the
16 allies to try their own military personnel in their own
countries following accidents or misdeeds. Nor did D'Alema call for
a NATO-led review of the accident and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   But the Italian leader spared no criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is responsible for this terrible tragedy,''
he declared, adding that he was ``personally shocked and so is the
Italian public's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton folded his hands and stared down at his podium during
D'Alema's sharpest criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, declining comment on the specific case, restated U.S.
remorse for the tragedy and promised that the United States would
compensate the families of victims.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is committed by prior agreement to pay 75
percent of the amount of compensation claims filed with Italian
authorities by families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is ``profoundly regretful and apologetic''
about the incident and ``must clearly and unambiguously shoulder
the responsibility for what happened,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the U.S. goal in the ongoing military
courts-martial remains to ``determine responsibility and
accountability in an open and fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is responsible for this terrible tragedy.
... The United States is not trying to duck its responsibility,''
Clinton said.

UNDATED: from such activity. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women's sports remain a stepchild even as basketball emerges as
a high-revenue professional sport. It's not surprising to see pro
hoopster Sheryl Swoopes near tears when talking of how she used to
wear a Michael Jordan jersey but now sees young girls and boys
sporting Swoopes and Lisa Leslie jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know that we have finally reached the point to where little
girls know that it's OK,'' she says, ``it's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Didrikson deserves a documentary of her own, not to mention a
Jordanesque stature. Just as amazing as Jordan's comeback from
baseball and retirement was Didrikson's return to golf after a
15-month battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In her first tournament, playing in sharp pain, she won the
thing by an amazing 12 shots. She would die three years later, but
not before giving credence to the idea that female athletes
deserved an equal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Invisible Child'' (8 p.m. CST Monday, Lifetime) _ Here's an
interesting concept. When a couple hires a nanny, she accepts the
job with the understanding that the middle child is, well,
imaginary. This idea comes from the mother, who swears a child
actually exists, and the father, who tolerates his wife's seeming
madness by asking his children to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The drama, told with dignity and feeling, stars Rita Wilson as
the mother. Dad is Victor Garber, who played alongside Wilson in
``Sleepless in Seattle.'' Both turn in reserved, emotional
performances, particularly Wilson, who had the hardest task,
playing a women who may or may not be fighting psychological
demons.
</P>
<P>
   Tushka Bergen is Gillian, the nanny who at first is a team
player. But as she begins to care for the children, including the
imaginary Maggie, she becomes concerned for the youngest child, Sam
(David Dorfman), who appears bothered by the notion of having a
sister he cannot see.
</P>
<P>
   Torn between her fondness for the family and her common sense,
Gillian contacts child-protection authorities, an action that, as
you might imagine, gives this drama a different, compelling face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total Recall 2070'' (7 p.m. CST Sunday, Showtime) _ After
nearly 10 years, television finally weighs in on the mind-bending
sci-fi thriller that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. There's no
Arnold, no Sharon Stone, and the special effects aren't nearly as
spectacular. But it has cultlike moments.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Easton stars as police detective David Hume, and Karl
Pruner as his android partner, Ian. They're members of the Citizens
Protection Bureau, with the mission to defend innocent parties from
the bad folk roaming the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere, Hume and Farve are in pursuit of androids
implanted with illegal, temporary bio-technology that allows them
to experience emotion and memory. Fans of ``Stargate'' might find
``Total Recall 2070'' appealing because it works on the same
``yeah, right'' level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seasons of Love'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday and Tuesday, CBS) _
Miniseries standbys Peter Strauss and Rachel Ward team up for this
lackadaisical telling of George Dell's classic novel ``The Earth
Abideth.'' It's a family saga about 19th-century American pioneer
life through the eyes of Linthorne, a driven, somewhat pigheaded
man who heads a close-knit family.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and Ward look tired, as though this is merely a
paycheck. There's little emotion, especially from Ward and Rip
Torn, who sleepwalks through this as Linthorne's friend. That this
two-night miniseries is airing just after February sweeps says
something about how CBS feels about it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real Howard Spitz'' (7 p.m. CST Sunday, Fox Family
Channel) _ Kelsey Grammer looks bored in this drama about a
frustrated crime novelist who turns to writing children's books
with the help of a fatherless little girl. I don't know about you,
but a Grammer without a David Hyde Pierce doesn't sound all that
appealing to me.

AWARDS NIGHTS HAVE BECOME PARTY NIGHTS AMONG THE SMART SET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
(lh) 
 By FRANK DECARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to have been a birthday party for a
fashion designer turned theatrical producer at the home of a
respected Broadway choreographer. But it was the night of the
Grammy Awards, so the television was on, the sound was off and,
between the pasta pomodoro and the pound cake, the well-wishers
watched. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they were as vocal as the set was mute. Every time
Rosie O'Donnell appeared on screen, they put down their plates,
raised their wine glasses and launched into a full-throated group
sing of ``When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crowd as enamored of Kate Smith as of Paul Smith that
night, and no one at this fashionable party much cared who won.
They turned up the volume only once: to hear Mel Brooks and Carl
Reiner perform ``The 2,000-Year-Old Man,'' a nearly 40-year-old
routine, as they accepted a Grammy for their latest comedy album.
</P>
<P>
   These partygoers were interested in hearing only themselves as
they provided fashion commentary (``Who knew Shania was such a
hottie?'') and their own soundtrack (vintage Laura Nyro).
</P>
<P>
   They quite nimbly turned the awards into an evening not about
Lauryn Hill's history-making five-Grammy haul _ the most in one
night ever for a woman _ but about their own cleverness and style,
of which there was plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Award shows do that to people. They bring out not only the
critic in all of us but the performer, too. Faced with the Tonys or
the Oscars, we become as stinging as John Simon and as bitter as
Blackwell. But mostly we make like Joan and Melissa Rivers, merging
stand-up comedy and social commentary and saying it loud enough for
everyone to hear. We share our best barbs as we dig elbow deep into
the Knorr's spinach dip in a hollowed-out loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armani again, Jodie?'' has replaced ``What's with that outfit,
Geena?'' in recent years, but the routine is largely the same. Such
cattiness is part of the ritual of communal watching television. On
those special occasion evenings when we choose to watch it en masse
_ beauty pageants, Super Bowls, and the Barbara Walters interview
with Monica Lewinsky _ we take in the televised spectacle while
making spectacles of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We give viewing parties and wait for our cues to talk back to
the television. When Ms. Walters used the magic word ``cigar'' last
week, you bet your life, the Monicanudo jokes fired up crowded
living rooms across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Group television nights like those are so very different from
the way we usually watch. Today, audiences tailor their viewing to
their schedules, missing ``The Sopranos'' on Sunday to catch
``Alice in Wonderland,'' watching a replay two nights later, or
just taping shows to watch alone late at night.
</P>
<P>
   So there is something special about the nights when we do all
sit down together and watching television becomes a communal
experience. Anyone of a certain age remembers staying home for
eight nights to watch ``Roots'' in 1977. It was a bonding
experience to know that nearly half of the population of America
was watching it at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But with only a handful of channels then, it was easier to
attract such a wide audience. These days, in a fragmented viewing
world, we get that kind of mega-enthusiasm for only the Super Bowl
and the Oscars, which is why we make such a big deal about both.
Each event has become one of the biggest social nights of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try getting a cab after the Best Picture has been announced,
just try.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Never much for mandatory merriment _ New Year's Eve is not my
idea of fun _ I generally have boycotted viewing parties in the
past, whether for the ``Seinfeld'' finale or for an award show.
Instead, for years, I spent Oscar night in pajamas in a hotel room
with a pal. We would check into the Paramount with a backpack and a
bottle of Veuve Clicquot and order room service in courses
throughout the night. Hors d'oeuvres during the Barbara Walters
preview, entrees during the first half of the awards, flying saucer
ice cream sundaes during the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heavenly indulgence. Peace and quiet and glamour. But
after a few years, friends began calling the room _ even long
distance from Texas _ to hear what we were saying about the dress
Kim Basinger had designed for herself. We couldn't be alone even if
we tried.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of the pleasures of solitary, pampered viewing
when I read that Aretha Franklin, who was nominated for three
Grammys this year, didn't attend the awards ceremony because she is
said to be afraid of flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stayed home in Detroit watching the show and eating finger
food and drinking nonfat smoothies,'' her spokeswoman told The New
York Daily News. When Ms. Franklin didn't win, she was quoted as
saying, ``I'm going to get out the polish and polish my 17
Grammys.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of comment we all want to hear from our friends
while watching television together.

NO-COST DEALS ON THE NET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Has sidebar slugged FREE-SITES)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Economics 51, the professor always said there's
no such thing as a free lunch. Someone, somewhere was paying, even
for the ``free'' stuff. All you had to do was figure out what
people were paying how much and where.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Internet is busily trying to blow up this basic tenet
of economics, as it is with so many others.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a while, then, you can enjoy a digital dinner for
pretty much nothing, with free e-mail, free calendars, free data
backup, free Web space and even free computers at no cost.
Everywhere you go these days on the Internet, it seems, sites are
offering a bewildering array of stuff at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   But even free comes with a cost. In this case, you pay with your
attention, which some Information Age theorists say will be the
most valuable thing we each own in a media-saturated future.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are paying their way (or hope to, anyway) by
selling advertising. You keep going there to get your e-mail, or
check your calendar, and they get a guaranteed base of return
visitors to whom they can show ads. The more valuable the giveaway,
the more they ask of the user.
</P>
<P>
   For things like FreePC.com, the Pasadena company that made such
a splash last month with its plan to give away 10,000 (and perhaps
ultimately 1 million) computers, the requirements can be extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do you have to submit significant demographic details
about your life and buying habits, you have to agree to use the
included Internet service at least 10 hours a month. That
guarantees you'll be staring at oodles of perfectly targeted ads
flashing in a wrap-around border on your free computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of people seem willing to pay the price. FreePC was
swamped by 1.2 million applicants for its first round of offers.
</P>
<P>
   And other folks are using some of the lesser services in numbers
that are only possible on the Net, or at a Peking convention.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail, for instance, is the granddaddy of the free e-mail
services and now is part of Microsoft while busily fighting off
dozens of competitors. But Hotmail still has 35 million users,
roughly double the size of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of the smaller sites are offering free services too, often
with help from behind-the-scenes companies such as PeopleLink in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Scott Glenn, said people are drawn to
specific sites not for things like e-commerce, but ``for the
people. The content creates the context for a communications
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   PeopleLink provides the free e-mail, interest groups, chat rooms
and instant messaging services used by many major Web sites such as
AltaVista, Earthlink and Go.com, as well as dozens of small-timers.
The company's own Web site also provides direct access to many of
the services, though without the customization common on
specialized sites.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are willing to partner with PeopleLink for the
services because those give people a reason to visit _ and to stay
long enough to show them lots of ads.
</P>
<P>
   There are some advantages to these services.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll be able to access your e-mail from anywhere
in the world, as long as you can get online somehow, from anyone's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly useful for people who travel a lot; who
have company-supplied Internet access but want a personal address;
and for people who are tired of endless spam (unsolicited
commercial e-mail) and want a ``front'' e-mail address they can
walk away from should the advertising get too thick.
</P>
<P>
   They're handy as spam screens, too. If your home e-mail address
is starting to get a few too many unwelcome, unsolicitied junk
e-letters, using a free-mail virtual address to do such things as
register with sites online is a way to cut the gelatinized meat
byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't have Internet access through such common
outlets as a library, workplace or family member's home, most of
the free-mail services aren't much use.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, you might want to make a deal with NetZero Inc. in
Westlake Village. Again in exchange for your demographic
information, you get Internet access to go with the e-mail address,
saving you $20 or more a month in subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   You also get lots of ads, precisely targeted to you, in a
movable 1-by-3-inch window that can even show video clips tied in
some cases to the specific Web sites you visit.
</P>
<P>
   The excessively mobile also will benefit from such services as
always-available online calendars and address books, handy if
you're often jumping between computers in more than one place and
can't afford a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies will let you backup the contents of your hard
drive on their big storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   That provides a great deal of protection in case you live in a
tinder box. But the downside is someone else theoretically could
read all your files. And backing up over the Net can be
excruciatingly slow unless you have a very fast connection.
</P>
<P>
   InfoWorld columnist and editor Dylan Tweney warned that the
FreePC gambit and others like it will usher in ``an era of free
stuff and ceaseless advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   He posits a world where that model _ first embraced in radio and
television and now reaching its heights in the Internet _ would
lead to urban buses outfitted with TVs, plying city streets for
free while flashing ads at riders.
</P>
<P>
   And given the ads already plastered on milk cartons, can it be
far away before we see food given away as advertising platform?
</P>
<P>
   So even free comes with a price, just as the professor said. And
it didn't even take a ``calculus guy'' to figure it out. That said,
if you can abide by a little relentless commercialism in your
online meal, soup's on.

WHERE TO FIND THOSE FREEBIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Sidebar runs with FREE-MAIL)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Free e-mail. Free Web space. Free love. Well, two
out of three ain't bad, even for the Internet. Here's a brief list
of some of the free services offered online:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-MAIL AND WEB SPACE
</P>
<P>
   www.hotmail.com has about 35 million subscribers, making it the
world's most omnipresent letter slot. You may prefer something a
little more exclusive, so you can have exactly the e-mail handle
you want, but Hotmail lets you check up to five accounts at once,
though none can be your primary business account.
</P>
<P>
   Mail.com Inc. (www.mail.com) provides free e-mail services not
only directly but also through deals with big sites such as CNN
Interactive and the AltaVista search engine.
</P>
<P>
   LA.com (www.la.com) is a Los Angeles site that offers free local
e-mail services to go with its news, entertainment, wedding and
other items. And best of all, you can wear your Angelo-ness on your
virtual sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune City (www.fortunecity.com) offers both an e-mail address
and a whopping 20 megabytes of Web space, making it one of the more
generous free sites out there.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune City also just cut a deal with Warner Bros. to create
ACMEcity (www.acmecity.com), which allows users to create Web sites
that use tons of free art and photos from such Warner Bros.
franchises as Bugs Bunny and Batman.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities (www.geocities.com) has been a leader in providing not
only free e-mail and 11 megabytes of Web space, but grouping the
Web sites into 41 ``GeoAvenues,'' or areas of relatively
like-minded folks. And if you want more space, or to create a
commercial site, they'll provide that for modest prices. Yahoo!
just bought Geocities, so expect some interesting fallout as the
two operations merge more closely.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero Inc. (www.netzero.net) goes a step further than all
these services, offering complete Internet access that includes
e-mail and other services in exchange for your demographic
information and the requirement to always have a 1-by-3-inch ad
window playing on your screen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FREE INSTANT MESSAGING AND DISCUSSION AREAS
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (www.icq.com) has free instant-messaging capabilities
throughout the Net, just as America Online users can do within the
AOL universe. If a friend is online at the same time as you, ICQ
will let you ``chat'' (well, type) directly with them.
</P>
<P>
   Talk City (www.talkcity.com/) focuses on Net ``communities,''
with a wide array of subjects you can pick through, such as
knitting or sailing or whatever else appeals most to you. You can
also create a free home page, or check out their events calendar.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleLink (www.peoplelink.net) has message boards, discussion
areas connected to specific topics, chat rooms and instant
messaging, both on its own site and for a burgeoning number of big
clients.
</P>
<P>
   FREE CALENDARS AND APPOINTMENT BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Most of the portal sites _ such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and
Excite (www.excite.com) have numerous services to go with the
customized home pages they offer to their users, including calendar
reminders and more.
</P>
<P>
   For more extensive programs, though, Jump Networks' Jump site
offers free calendar, address book and e-mail services that link up
with your computer's programs, such as Microsoft's Schedule and
Outlook Express and Lotus' Organizer and Notes. You can also access
event listings, to-do lists and message boards, and even share
calendars with others. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FREE COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   Free PC (www.free-pc.com) made a big splash last month when it
proposed giving 10,000 (and perhaps up to 1 million) pretty good
PCs to people willing to reveal specific demographic information
and put up with a screen surrounded by flashing ads while using the
included Internet service at least 10 hours a month. Of course, you
have to be their kind of people, demographically speaking.
Nonetheless, 1.2 million people signed up for the first round.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The pope wasn't the only spiritual celebrity besieged by
teen-age fans during his visit to St. Louis in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mobbed,'' said Gotham Chopra, who was there covering the
papal pilgrimage for Channel One, the television news service that
broadcasts to schools around the country. ``They knew who I was. It
was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all that weird, considering that Chopra's father is Dr.
Deepak Chopra, the best-selling mind-body guru whose religion of
self-help and Eastern medicine has made him a Buddha of suburbia
and New Age Hollywood. Not weird at all considering that Gotham
Chopra, 24, has a captive teen-age audience _ eight million viewers
in 12,000 schools _ whose inchoate spiritual yearnings can range
from the church of their choosing to the latest Alanis Morissette
CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids I saw with the Pope weren't even
Catholics,'' Chopra said in a recent interview in Los Angeles.
``But they wanted to be plugged into something. They said, `This
guy is our closest connection to God, and we just want to be around
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some young seekers might have said much the same about Chopra,
who seems to be plugging in to their need for a sort of ``Deepak
2'' for Generation Y.
</P>
<P>
   He is story editor of a new monthly comic book, Bulletproof
Monk, about a kung fu-fighting Buddhist, the first issue of which
came out last month. He performed a reading on ``The Gift of
Love,'' an album released in December devoted to the poetry of the
13th-century Persian mystic Rumi, alongside Madonna, Demi Moore and
his father.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter and anchor for Channel One's network-style
newscasts, Chopra covers headline news and breaking stories for his
young audience. But he also does features with a spiritual and
mythical spin. He presented John Glenn as a latter-day Icarus. For
the Super Bowl, he took a crew to the site of ancient Mayan
handball courts in Mexico and traced a history of ``the warrior
impulse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Matthews, an 18-year-old senior at Genoa Central High
School in Genoa, Ark., is a fan of what he calls Chopra's
insightful reporting. ``His pieces often take a different tone than
the rest, maybe a more serious, mysterious tone,'' Matthews said.
``He's kind of intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of intrigue is not Chopra's famous father, whom
Matthews said he had never heard of until last week. As Scott
Garen, executive producer of Channel One news, said: ``I don't
think these kids know who Deepak is. And neither do a lot of middle
Americans where we broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gotham Chopra, the soft-spoken scion of his father's
wellness empire, seems to have inherited at least some of the job
requirements of a mini guru: ambition packaged with a blissed-out
aura, prolific energy (he's currently at work on three screenplays
and a second novel) and a knack for making famous friends.
</P>
<P>
   He and Michael Jackson are sufficiently tight that the
notoriously inaccessible pop star got on the phone to comment on
the young Chopra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I first met Gotham that he was a spiritual godsend
capable of inspiring and empowering the youth of this generation,''
Jackson said in his thin, high voice. ``He's a gift to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotham Chopra was 15 when his father first took him to Jackson's
Neverland ranch, where he became one of the many kids who hung out
with Jackson and, on occasion, slept in the same bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would play video games,'' Chopra said. ``We'd order pizza.
We'd eat candy, and we'd just act nuts until 5 in the morning, and
you'd fall asleep on the floor or the bed, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   It would later be charged in a lawsuit, eventually settled out
of court, that a member of this young entourage was sexually abused
by Jackson. But Chopra said he didn't witness any sexually
inappropriate activity. ``I never ever saw anything, felt awkward
or anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gautama, meaning the enlightened one, is the Hindi spelling of
Chopra's name. But he has adopted the Americanized spelling Gotham,
which with its cool New York and Batman associations fits his image
as a younger, hipper version of his dad, who quotes Puff Daddy
quicker than Vedic theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't identify as a Hindu,'' he said. Nor does he consider
himself New Age. His first novel, ``Child of the Dawn,'' was
published by the same New Age press, Amber-Allen, that issued the
Deepak Chopra best seller, ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.''
Chopra cringes at the memory of his callow parable about an Indian
orphan's search for wisdom. ``I'll be the first to admit: with the
first one, we were capitalizing on my father's name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I call spirituality for the next generation is full of
the sacred, but it's also got lots of the profane,'' he said,
sipping a soda at the poolside restaurant of the Sunset Marquis
Hotel, not far from his Beverly Hills apartment. His comic book's
superhero, the Bulletproof Monk, is a 20-year-old Hong Kong exile
in San Francisco whose path to inner peace is strewn with
casualties of his martial artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's first and foremost action-adventure, but it has this
really cool element of self-discovery as well,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On this unseasonably brisk winter day, he was attired and
accessorized in the casual-chic accouterments of the young
Hollywood comer: white T-shirt under a loose gray jacket, cargos,
silver bracelet, Tag Heuer watch, with a Nokia phone resting on the
table in front of him. His manner was so laid back, he seemed to
have just emerged from _ or ready to sink into _ a serious nap.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guber, the movie producer, has known Deepak and Gotham
Chopra for several years. ``He has a very endearing style,'' Guber
said of the younger Chopra. ``He's ambitious and aggressive, but he
has a welcoming attitude, rather than a competitive one, which is a
result of his father's training or impulse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an effective dichotomy: Chopra is self-effacingly
self-promotional, nonaggressively aggressive. He has been
meditating since he was a child, and yet has been fanatical about
sports for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   During the NFL playoffs last year, when the Chopra family was
traveling in Morocco, he laid his New England Patriots jersey on
his bed every night for good luck, said T. Trent Gegax, a reporter
at Newsweek and family friend, who shared a room with the younger
Chopra on the Morocco trip. Gegax said Chopra's sports
obsessiveness sometimes extended to non-Zen expressions of
frustration on the golf course. ``He'll throw clubs,'' Gegax said.
</P>
<P>
   Deepak Chopra said that his son was the more ``mature'' of the
two of them. ``I'm still a very excitable person,'' Chopra said.
``Gotham is more sober, more centered and less attached to outcome
than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotham and his older sister, Mallika lived in Boston. When he
was about 5, Chopra said, his father gave up ``smoking and drinking
and doing all the stuff doctors who work in the E.R. do.'' He
switched from Western to Eastern medicine and, around 1984, went on
``Oprah.'' Celebrities began seeking him out, and soon enough Dr.
Chopra became one himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously a certain shadow that it casts,'' the
younger Chopra said, not only regarding his father's fame, but also
his relentless productivity. Dr. Chopra has four books coming out
this year, a documentary and two feature films in development and a
single from the ``Gift of Love'' album ranked 32 on Billboard's Hot
Dance Music chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally will have a revelation and write a book about it
over a weekend,'' Chopra said.
</P>
<P>
   Gegax, whose family has gone on several vacations with the
Chopras, said Chopra managed to keep his patrimony in perspective.
``When his father starts spinning off on some tangent,'' Gegax
said, ``Gotham would look at me and kind of roll his eyes, like,
`There he goes again.'''

ECONOMIC VIEW: SOME ADVICE FOR MR. GATES: HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
(EDS: First two grafs should be in italics.) 
(lh) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both sides in the Microsoft trial have retreated to their
corners until mid-April, when the antitrust battle will resume in a
Washington courtroom. Then, both the government and Microsoft will
have the opportunity to call a couple of rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not ruled out the option of rolling out its
ultimate weapon, Bill Gates. Here is an example of an e-mail one of
his advisers might send, urging him to take the stand and
suggesting what he might say:
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BILL:
</P>
<P>
   It's not Paris, but Washington in April isn't bad. You should
show up in court and have your say.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, if an IBM corporate bureaucrat like Frank Cary could be a
star witness for his company in its successful defense against the
Justice Department, a field general of the future like you ought to
be able to wow 'em.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you got some bad advice for that taped deposition, which the
Justice Department has played endlessly at the trial. It seemed as
if some other guy showed up in your body _ evasive, forgetful and
out of the corporate loop. Everybody knows you ARE the loop at
Microsoft. The answer-nothing approach was a real mistake. Bad PR
and bad legal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So go to Washington to restore your credibility, and do what you
can to revive your legal defense. It needs help.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I've found puzzling is this: When Microsoft executives
have been asked whether they wanted to crush the Internet upstart,
Netscape Communications, they are almost apologetic. They speak of
trampling rivals as if it were a regrettable byproduct of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about undermining your own credibility! No one thinks that
anybody at Microsoft believes that for a nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   So when asked, you should just tell Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson what you believe with your every breath to be the truth:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we like nothing better at Microsoft than loosening the
bowels of our competitors. We get up early and we go to bed late to
create products, market them aggressively and revolutionize the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that capitalism, and, yes, we take our capitalism
pretty much straight-up in the New Economy. It's why things move so
fast in our industry, why companies succeed and fail quickly. Yes,
it can be brutal, but it also goes a long way toward explaining the
phenomenal dynamism of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson, you may think it makes sense, after hearing all
the tales of woe from our competitors, that something should be
done to level the playing field in our industry. And having the
government intervene to fashion a more controlled style of
capitalism can often seem humane. I know you're thinking about it.
And it may be that we got a little over-enthusiastic in the browser
wars, crossing the line here and there with a couple of our
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd urge you to be cautious. The Justice Department has
said it is using this case to establish new ground rules of
competition in the information age. But the economies where the
governments play a stronger role in fine-tuning the rules of
engagement are the economies now trying to emulate the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is finally being forced to dismantle its system of
corporate socialism, and the traditional social democratic model of
Europe is in retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, your honor, I would invite you to visit ground zero of
our alleged predation _ Silicon Valley. What do you see? A local
economy where there is virtually no unemployment, where
seven-figure home prices are the norm in many neighborhoods, and
where corporate parking lots are filled with $70,000 sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the government's economic witness, Frank Fisher of MIT,
had to acknowledge he could find no current consumer harm from what
our accusers call our monopolistic bullying of the entire computer
industry. He says he's worried about the future. Well, so am I _
which is why, if you want to observe the `quiet life' of the
monopolist, you shouldn't come to Redmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Bill, the bad news is that this would mainly be a speech,
not related directly to the specific charges in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the judge cuts you off, telling you to just answer
questions with a ``yes'' or a ``no,'' you would have a solid basis
for a ``judicial bias'' challenge on appeal _ given all the
digressive speeches he let the prosecution witnesses make.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson won't cut you off. He'll be flattered that you
showed up in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you'll give him plenty to think about, especially when
he is weighing whatever sanctions might be imposed on Microsoft if
you lose the case.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't been going well for Microsoft in the trial so
far. So at least in this first round _ before any appeal to a
federal appeals court or to the Supreme Court _ you're fighting to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Just do it.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7)  
 (af)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Chester Redhead opens his garage, walks to his green and tan
Rolls-Royce and bursts into a 1,000-watt grin. ``This is my baby,''
he says, opening the front door so a visitor can get a closer look.
``This is my toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, this black dentist showed off another passion: a
1,000-bottle wine cellar in his home, which is on a leafy block in
Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Harold Doley, the first black to own a seat on
the New York Stock Exchange, bought a 35-room mansion originally
built by Madam C.J. Walker, the first black self-made female
millionaire in America.
</P>
<P>
   She amassed a fortune from hair care products and beauty
schools. While building the 20,000-square-foot house in Irvington,
N.Y., she created quite a commotion. ``Impossible,'' one resident
exclaimed in an article in The New York Times Magazine of Nov. 4,
1917. ``No woman of her race could afford such a place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry Delany, the chairman of surgery at Jacobi Medical
Center in the Bronx, is fleet commander of a yacht club made up of
a dozen black doctors and lawyers. They call themselves the Rainbow
Club and sail up and down the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   All these men belong to what Lawrence Otis Graham calls
America's black elite in his new book, ``Our Kind of People: Inside
America's Black Upper Class'' (HarperCollins, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 37, a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law
School and the author of 12 other books, looks at the college
fraternities and sororities, social clubs for adults and summer
resorts tailored to a black aristocracy _ insular arenas unfamiliar
to the black underclass, working class and whites of any class.
</P>
<P>
   For women, there are sororities like Alpha Kappa Alpha and clubs
like the Links and the Smart Set; for men, there is Omega Psi Phi
on historically black campuses, which claims alumni from Vernon
Jordan to former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, and clubs like
the Guardsmen and the Boule. ( Graham is a member of the Boule,
which he says is the toughest to crack.)
</P>
<P>
   For children, there is Jack and Jill, a network of recreational
groups that cultivate African-American roots in largely white
suburbs. But don't rush to send resumes to any of these
organizations; they accept members by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Kind of People'' has been widely reviewed, and Graham has
just returned from a national press tour. The book has given
broader exposure than ever to institutions that have seemed
quasi-secret. Graham opens a door on fraternity houses that gave
many a politician a first power base, and he conducts a tour of an
enclave of summer homes in Sag Harbor, N.Y., where the black
president of American Express lives next to the black owner of a
Pepsi-Cola bottling plant and a black corporate headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer unfamiliarity and opulence of much of this terrain
raises a question: Are these groups gatekeepers to making it as a
black professional or politician? Do they play a heretofore
overlooked, but vital role in how blacks advance socially and
professionally? Do they constitute an old-boy (and old-girl)
network for African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Graham argues that they do, even though that is not their stated
intention. Most describe themselves as social clubs, committed to
backyard barbecues, teas and social service. But like country clubs
where golf is the pretext and making business connections is the
subtext, or like charity galas where social climbing is as much on
the agenda as philanthropy, these institutions, the author says,
help maintain a black upper class.
</P>
<P>
   He describes, for example, how he called on his contacts in
Boule, a national group of 4,000 prominent African-American men,
last year when he considered entering politics. ``If your Boule
friends will back you, people will know you're for real,'' the book
quotes Graham's uncle as advising him.
</P>
<P>
   The author continues: ``Although reluctant, within a half-hour,
I was on the phone with some of the most influential men in the
country _ all of them accomplished in their professions, all of
them members of a men's group into which I had been inducted three
years earlier. The fact that this national organization included
virtually every black mayor, congressman, banker or millionaire was
a reality that I should not have forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those prominent Boule members, former Mayor David N.
Dinkins, drew on the network himself when he first ran for New York
City-wide office. ``Individual people in the Boule backed my
candidacy,'' Dinkins said. ``Some wrote checks, and others
campaigned with me in the street. But the Boule as an organization
is not political, so they didn't back me.''
</P>
<P>
   If membership in an upper class is defined as simply having lots
of money, it's clear that a black upper class exists. The incomes
of African-American athletes and entertainers are as stratospheric
as those of their white counterparts, and among professionals and
entrepreneurs, blacks have increasingly attained affluence in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The number of black households earning $100,000 or more nearly
doubled from 220,400 in 1988 to 414,500 in 1998, Census Bureau
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes much more than money to belong to the upper class
as Graham uses the term, following the tradition of bulwarks of
white society like the Social Register.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the money,'' he said. ``It's where did this
person's grandfather go to medical school? How far does the family
go back in a certain city? Did you go to the right school, the
right boarding school? How far back were your family members
professionals? Have they been summering in Oaks Bluff and Sag
Harbor. Who are you married to?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is best known for rooting out racism in an all-white
country club in Greenwich, Conn. _ he posed as a busboy and his
experience landed him on the cover of New York magazine _ draws a
parallel to another group that would seem far removed from the
black elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use it, but they are like black WASPs,'' Graham said
by phone from his large home in Chappaqua, N.Y. It has a swimming
pool, tennis courts and a guest house. He left a corporate law firm
to write and lecture, and lives with his wife, Pamela Thomas-Graham
_ who is both a partner in McKinsey &AMP; Co., consultants, and a
mystery writer _ and their son.
</P>
<P>
   Graham grew up in an affluent family in White Plains and has
said he doesn't remember a time when his relatives didn't have
money. Jack and Jill skating parties, riding lessons and boating
excursions were part of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the book he identifies the right cotillions, camps and
private schools for the black upper class. The appropriate camp,
Graham writes, is Camp Atwater, a 70-acre spread on Lake Lashaway
in North Brookville, Mass. The boarding school of choice is Palmer
Memorial Institute in Sedalia, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Graham recounts how the world of black privilege was so insular
when he was a boy that, during summers in Oak Bluffs on Martha's
Vineyard, ``it never even occurred to me that white people had
summer homes on Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, dispute his notion that there is a black upper
class _ defined by wealth or as an influential old-boy network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no black Rockefellers, Vanderbilts or Kennedys,
families who have sustained great wealth for generations,'' said
Sam Fulwood III, a Los Angeles Times reporter who writes on race
relations and is the author of ``Waking From the Dream: My Life in
the Black Middle Class'' (Anchor, 1996). ``Members of the Boule,
the Links, and Jack and Jill represent such a small piece of black
America, they are insignificant. It may be interesting but no more
interesting than the way rare flowers are interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If blacks understand our experience in this country,
then they don't need to be validated by some artificial construct
like class.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, memberships have been growing, thanks to the
ballooning of the black upper middle class. The Boule membership
has more than tripled since 1970. The Links started with nine women
in one chapter in 1946 and has grown to 10,000 members in 270
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last 20 years, Jack and Jill chapters have doubled,
to 220, with 30,000 family members, reflecting the desire to have
well-off black children meet ``the right kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most calls I've received about Jack and Jill were from people
who've moved to the suburbs, whose kids might go to a private
school, who are looking to have their children exposed to children
with a similar culture and with similar goals,'' said Barbara
Brannen Newton, the executive director of Jack and Jill, who lives
in Isle of Catalina, Fla. ``We're here to educate future leaders
and to teach them to bring back to the local community.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the institutions explored in ``Our Kind of People''
have roots in the strict segregation era. The college fraternities,
clubs for adults and summer resorts paralleled enclaves for
successful whites, which prohibited blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Boule was created in 1904 to give college-educated black men
a forum for intellectual discourse. Jack and Jill was created in
1938 as a play group for the children of families that had moved to
the Philadelphia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, many blacks who were not included came to regard
the groups as snobbish, and worse _ upholding unwritten rules that
members have light skin and ``good hair,'' like that of Caucasians.
A few old-guard blacks, who were granted anonymity in Graham's
book, disparaged ``new money'' blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is scant evidence that skin color, hair and the source
of one's wealth still matter. ``I think the groups are much more
egalitarian than they used to be,'' said Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a
clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
``People in these organizations don't sit around putting down poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint is a former Boule member who left it because of
scheduling problems. He grew up in a gritty East Harlem
neighborhood. ``I'm not from an upper class family,'' he said.
``And I got in.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference between the institutions of Graham's black upper
class and its white counterparts is that the black groups have made
civil rights and support for poorer blacks a key goal. ``Take the
black sororities, AKA and Delta,'' Graham said, referring to Alpha
Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta, whose members often remain
close-knit in later life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black sororities have a much stronger tie to the less
privileged members of society,'' he said. ``White sororities don't
see themselves in a public service position. Black sororities see
themselves helping out relatives or people who look like us and are
in need of our financial support and mentoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Boule members are also expected to mentor schoolchildren or to
raise money for scholarships. And the Links last year raised $1
million for the United Negro College Fund and $1 million for the
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.

<P>
   That the head of the legal defense fund, Elaine Jones, is a
Links member herself probably didn't hurt when the club decided how
to divide funds _ an example of the mutual support and networking
that takes place in black elite groups, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Links existed to advance members socially and
professionally, Barbara Dixon Simpkins, the national president,
based in Washington, denied it. ``Most of our members have already
reached the pinnacle of success,'' she said. Among them are Reps.
Sheila Jackson-Lee and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas; Marian
Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund;
Johnnetta Cole, president of Spelman College; Sharon Pratt Kelly,
the former mayor of the District of Columbia, and Hazel O'Leary,
the Energy secretary. After some thought, Ms. Simpkins said
networking does take place.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Adams, an obstetrician-gynecologist who practices in
Bronxville, N.Y., and lives in Scarsdale, two of Westchester's
wealthiest communities, belongs to the Links and Delta Sigma Theta.
Her children, Peter, 10, and Annie, 17, are in Jack and Jill. And
her husband, Peter Adams, a lawyer, is president of Phi Beta Sigma,
one of four historically black fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet sometimes three or more times a month,'' Dr. Adams
said of her Links chapter. ``It's wonderful to be with women of
like minds, like interests. We sometimes meet in restaurants and
order some food. We talk about where we vacationed, have a glass of
wine and some cheese. And then get to work.''

   GRANITE FALLS, Wash. _ The cash-strapped former timber town of
Granite Falls wants to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists want bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Granite Falls has no public bathrooms and no money to build
them.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Throw a garage sale!
</P>
<P>
   Donations have been pouring into the Chamber of Commerce for a
gargantuan garage sale Saturday meant to raise money for a
six-stall restroom in Jack Webb Park.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope the boxes of books, kitchen supplies, and other
goodies will raise some cash for the city's share of a National
Forest Service grant to build the $91,000 structure.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are meant to help formerly timber-dependent cities
diversify their economies, and public bathrooms are a common
request, said rural community assistance coordinator Penny Falknor.
Towns are required to contribute at least 20 percent of the cost.
Some of Granite Falls' contribution will be donated labor, but it
will need about $5,000 cash for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A garage sale contribution is a first for the Forest Service,
but the community's support has been ``magical,'' Falknor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the spirit of helping their community get to where
they want to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The public bathrooms should help make the town attractive to a
growing number of tourists attracted by the old-fashioned downtown
near a wealth of outdoor recreation. Visitors now rely on
government offices or lenient business owners for bathroom breaks _
or they go without.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders saw the need for public toilets, but couldn't pull
the money from reserves or impose a new business tax like other
towns who've faced the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granite Falls is a small town. It's hard to generate enough
revenue just to run the city,'' said garage sale co-organizer
Charlotte Peterson, who is also credited with seeking out the
grant.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, business owners, town residents, and
even those from outlying areas have donated boxes upon boxes of
goods to make the garage sale shine.
</P>
<P>
   One elderly gentleman donated a lovely wooden buffet that had
belonged to his mother, Peterson said. Others came by with exercise
bikes, toys, baby clothes, boxes of paperbacks, and ``a lot of just
nickel and dime items.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, fittingly, donated a wood chipper for the sale. It
looks great, organizers said, and runs like new.
</P>
<P>
   The garage sale will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at town
community center at the corner of Pioneer and Granite Avenues.

DEVOUT ORTHODOX FAMILY BELIEVES IT'S `LIVING THE RIGHT WAY'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It's Sabbath eve at the home of the Rosenblums, an
Orthodox Jewish family in Jerusalem, and the public siren that
signals the start of the weekly holy day has just sounded.
</P>
<P>
   As the two-minute wail winds down, Judith Rosenblum lights
Sabbath candles, one for each member of her family. Her husband,
Jonathan, helps 4-year-old Elimelech, the youngest of the couple's
seven sons, who seems to have lost his shoes. On the dining room
table, a dozen prayer books and a loaf of bread sit next to a
half-dozen tiny chalices and the grape juice that will serve as
wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 25 hours _ from dusk Friday until dusk Saturday _
the Rosenblums, as ``Haredium,'' or ``God-fearing Jews,'' will
observe the elaborate Jewish laws of the Sabbath, laws that they
believe God commanded them to follow. They won't drive a car or use
an elevator. They won't spend money or cook a meal. They won't
write anything down.
</P>
<P>
   They will pray for the day when all Jews in Israel will observe
these laws with the same zeal. Then, they believe, God will protect
the Jewish people and Israel will prosper. That is why that even
though they are a minority, they oppose attempts by the country's
secular majority to live a nonobservant life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait all week for `Shabbat' to begin,'' says Rosenblum,
using the Hebrew word for the Sabbath. ``Every other day of the
week is called in Hebrew by a number _ Day One, Day Two, and so on.
`Shabbat' is the only day that has a name.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Haredium, the study of the Torah, or Jewish Bible, and
of the Talmud _ sets of books of Jewish law compiled by sages and
completed 1,500 years ago _ is a central part of their lives. They
observe 613 ``mitzvot,'' or commandments, found in the Scriptures
and refrain from 39 categories of activities that they believe
constitute work and therefore violate the Sabbath. They pray three
times a day, every day.
</P>
<P>
   And they accept the strictest interpretation of religious law:
There is no room for other interpretations, there is no following
some laws and not others, and there is no way to allow the state to
let non-Orthodox ways creep into what has always been the Orthodox
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are allowed to (observe) as much (of the law) as
they want, Judaism will continue to be less of a part of their
lives,'' says Rosenblum, a Yale-trained lawyer dressed in a black
suit and fedora. ``We care about every Jew. We want them to know
what Judaism is.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated around the table, each of Rosenblum's seven sons wears a
black suit and skullcap, or ``kippa,'' a reminder of God's
presence. Long white strings, called ``tsitsit,'' dangle from their
hips, a reminder of God's word.
</P>
<P>
   A small wisp of hair hangs in front of each boy's ears because
it is written in the Torah that a man should not cut the hair
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is One,'' the
family sings.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Jewish profession of faith, a prayer called the
``Shema.'' ``You shall love your God with all your heart and all
your soul and all your resources.''
</P>
<P>
   On the table, hot chicken soup and cholent, a stew of potatoes,
onions, beans and barley, send up whirls of steam. The smell of
garlic wafts through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish dietary laws require strict separation of meat and dairy
so none of the food tonight is made with milk or cheese. Judith
Rosenblum keeps two sets of dishes, two sponges, two drying racks
and two separate sinks in the kitchen to make sure that milk and
meat never touch.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the meal, the prayers the Rosenblums sing ask for
God's blessing and promise never to ``forget thee, O Jerusalem.''
The atmosphere is warm, like a hearty Thanksgiving, when the
comforts of home and family are cherished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we believe is right,'' says Judith Rosenblum,
who, like many ``Haredi'' women, tucks her real hair under a wig
cut into a simple bob as a sign of modesty. ``We usually eat dinner
together. But `Shabbat' is a special time for the family to be
together.''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the boys go with their father to pray at one of
four synagogues on their street. All around, the men and boys from
the 4,000 families of Har Nof, a crowded ``Haredi'' neighborhood of
apartment blocks built on the slopes of west Jerusalem, are doing
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rosenblum and her 16-year-old daughter, Naama, stay
behind with a neighbor to read from ``Guard Your Tongue,'' a book
that sets out Jewish laws against false speech. They discuss why
they believe the Orthodox must keep control over conversions
performed in Israel, a hotly debated topic here because Reform and
Conservative Jews are demanding that the state recognize their
converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have Orthodox conversions,'' says the neighbor.
``Otherwise, someone could be walking around thinking they were
Jewish, but they wouldn't be. No Orthodox would marry them. That's
why we say, `Let's keep it one way. Let's keep the laws we've had
for 3,500 years.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, the nation will be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys return, they play cards or read the Talmud. Like
most ``Haredium,'' the Rosenblums don't own a television set. They
don't take trips to the movies, and they don't listen to pop music,
though their boys have heard of Aviv Geffen, the Israeli teen-age
idol who wears thick black eye makeup and most symbolizes Israel's
apathetic and angry Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stupid,'' says 12-year-old Yechezkel, rolling his eyes in
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the boys know all about the famous rabbis with
heavy-rimmed glasses and long graying beards whose pictures hang on
the living room wall. ``He was Israel's chief rabbi,'' explains
Elisha, 14, wide-eyed in amazement that anyone could not know such
a thing. ``That one lived in Poland. The one over there lives in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 13 until their late 20s, and maybe all their
lives, the Rosenblum boys will study the Torah and the Talmud in a
``yeshiva,'' or Jewish seminary school. They will not study regular
subjects like math and science. They will not go on to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   They will not serve in the army, clearly the most heated, and
emotional, issue tearing at Israel's religious-secular divide, and
the one that generates the most animosity toward the ``Haredi''
community. When other young Israelis turn 18, they start a tour of
duty that will last three years for men and 18 months for women.
Yeshiva students get a deferral from the minister of defense so
they can study instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best study years of their lives,'' says Judith
Rosenblum, whose eldest son, Micha, started going to a ``yeshiva''
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son starts studying at 7 a.m. and doesn't stop until 11 at
night. If they go to the army, they lose invaluable years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Haredim say their sons are helping to protect the state of
Israel, not by going into the army, but through the kind of devout
prayer and observance of Jewish law that they believe will persuade
God to watch over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And by studying Torah, they say, they are carrying on a
tradition that has preserved the Jewish nation through centuries of
dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debate over army service began heating up, the
``Haredim'' community concedes that the blanket deferrals given to
30,000 ``yeshiva'' students can't last. Already, some sects have
entered the army. Many Haredium believe that within a few years,
their sons will do some kind of service.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Rosenblums visit neighbors. Jonathan Rosenblum
gives a sermon on how to find spiritual happiness. When they
return, some of the boys are asleep on the floor, having been
ousted from bed by grandma and grandpa, who are visiting from the
other side of town. The light is still on _ it is unlawful to turn
it off during the Sabbath _ but the boys sleep soundly. They will
awake at 6 a.m. to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that in the future, our boys will probably
serve,'' says Judith Rosenblum. She is aware of the enmity that
many secular Israelis feel toward the ``Haredi'' community. She
seems resigned and a little wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel sad that they hate us,'' she says. ``But I believe
we're living the right way. They are losing their tradition.''

JEWISH STATE INCREASINGLY TORN OVER RELIGION'S ROLE IN EVERYDAY
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARNACA, Cyprus _ Gal Lior and Elinor Aharonson, a young Israeli
couple, spent $1,000 to fly to Cyprus for a 10-minute marriage
ceremony by a justice of the peace. Aharonson wore a simple blue
dress. A stranger they met in the hallway served as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   As secular, or nonpracticing, Jews, the couple did not want to
observe Israel's strict wedding rules set by Orthodox rabbis, which
included separate visits to clergymen they had never met and a
pre-nuptial ritual bath by the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Israel does not acknowledge marriages performed by Reform and
Conservative rabbis, and civil marriages are not available. The
Orthodox ceremony is the only one recognized by the government as
legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lior and Aharonson joined a growing number of young
Israeli couples who go abroad to wed as a way of protesting the
Orthodox monopoly over marriage and family affairs, what secular
Israelis call ``religious coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of political statement,'' Aharonson said of her
wedding outside Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of Judaism as a culture, not as a religion,''
said the 23-year-old law school graduate who grew up on a kibbutz
outside Tel Aviv. ``But if you get married in Israel, you must do
it the Orthodox way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acts of opposition are part of a mounting struggle over the
identity of the Jewish state. At issue is whether the country
should be a secular, liberal democracy, or whether religion should
play a major role in determining how the state's Jewish citizens
live.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Israelis consider themselves Orthodox Jews.
Another 50 percent describe themselves as secular, and the
remaining 30 percent call themselves ``traditional'' Jews _ they
might go to synagogue Saturday morning, then drive to a soccer
match Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since Israel won its independence 50 years ago, Orthodox
rabbis have controlled marriages, divorces, burials and religious
conversions. If a Jew wants to marry or obtain a divorce in Israel,
he or she must do it according to the strict interpretations of the
Orthodox rabbis. Otherwise, it doesn't legally count.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, secular Israelis learned to live with Orthodox
strictures, often employing ingenious methods to circumvent
religious law. Kibbutzim, for instance, built pig farms on
10-foot-high wooden beams so that the animals, reviled in Judaism,
would not touch Israeli soil. Israelis seeking civil marriage
ceremonies either flew to Cyprus or sent applications to Paraguay
in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, challenges to the powers of the Orthodox are intensifying.
Reform and Conservative Jews, whose numbers are large in the United
States but minuscule in Israel, have demanded state recognition of
their marriages and conversions. Secular Jews, most of whom are
nonpracticing Orthodox, are opening more and more stores on the
Sabbath, despite objections by the Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a widening cultural chasm that some Israelis
describe as a crisis. Two weeks ago, the divide was visible when
more than 250,000 Orthodox protested in Jerusalem against the
Supreme Court rulings that have chipped away at Orthodox power and
privilege. Thousands of secular Jews held counter-demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel's Supreme Court justice, Aharon Barak, has ruled
against the Orthodox in several key challenges. In return, he has
received so many death threats that he travels with bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Reform and Conservative rabbis to sit on religious
councils that govern day-to-day religious affairs. He ruled that it
was ``unreasonable'' to issue blanket military deferrals to the
country's 30,000 Orthodox seminary students and gave Israel's
parliament one year to pass legislation specifying who was eligible
for deferral.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Barak agreed to hear a petition that would outlaw
male circumcision, a sacred Jewish rite of passage, on grounds that
it constitutes criminal assault. For Israel's religious community,
just agreeing to hear the case was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication that things have gone mad,'' said Aaron
Lerner, a columnist and opinion pollster who describes himself as
``regular'' Orthodox. ``If they're going to consider circumcision,
they'll consider anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means there are no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews argue that observing religious rituals their way
is the only way to keep the nation Jewish. Without one uniform and
accepted code of religious law, they say, Israel's identity as a
Jewish state is in danger of disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the state there was an understanding that
the glue that would hold the social fabric together was a glue
based on Jewish identity,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, an Orthodox
writer. ``Marriage under the jurisdiction of the rabbinate helps
preserve at least some level of that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis opposed to Orthodox control over their lives
say that rather than uniting the people, those rules are causing
resentment and creating a rift.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts, secular lawmakers have not been able
to break the grip of the Orthodox. Bills that would introduce a
measure of pluralism have repeatedly failed. ``There's no
separation of religion and state in Israel,'' said Naomi Chazan, a
member of the parliament from a left-wing party who has sponsored
unsuccessful bills for civil wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's precisely what we're fighting against,'' said Chazan,
who estimates that around 40 percent of secular Jews would select a
non-Orthodox wedding if the option were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying for years, and we'll continue to try to
institute secular marriage and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of secular couples have married overseas
each year for the past few years. Cyprus, close by and relatively
cheap, has become a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   So many Israeli couples fly here to tie the knot that a
flourishing tourism business has sprung up that caters to weddings.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to Israel, Lior and Aharonson held a wedding
ceremony in front of a Reform rabbi at their ``kibbutz.'' It didn't
look much different from an Orthodox ceremony, Aharonson said. But
the difference to the couple was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more equality our way,'' said Aharonson. ``We both
signed the marriage contract, instead of just the man signing it. I
got to speak at the ceremony, not just the groom.''
</P>
<P>
   But going abroad will not solve a problem that has gnawed at
Israel for half a century, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've delayed the solution to this problem for 50 years,''
said Aharonson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem didn't go away. It just got worse. Now is the
time for us to decide which way to turn.''

  &HT;    Top Baptists show confidence in Bush
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two native Texans that lead the nation's largest
Protestant denomination say they are comfortable a George W. Bush
presidential campaign will favor the conservative Christian agenda,
despite rumblings in religious-right circles that the governor may
be too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican nomination is his to lose,'' said the Rev.
Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Land, president of the commission that furthers
the denomination's position on public policy issues, said that
unless Bush changes his message somewhere along the presidential
hopeful road, the governor will more than likely get a strong
show-ing of support from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that most of the pro-life, conservative
evangelical Christians I know are very excited about some of the
things George W. Bush is saying and doing,'' said Land, whose
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission is holding its annual
conference in Austin through today.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Land are quick to point out they cannot endorse a
presidential candidate because of their high-profile positions in
the denomination, which never endorses political candidates. But
even a nod of confidence from the leaders of the almost 16
million-member Southern Baptist Convention may go a long way to
quell any concerns conservative Christians might have about a Bush
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be challenged from the right by several GOP
contenders, including commentator Pat Buchanan. Some Christian
conservatives in Texas have expressed concern about whether Bush is
a strong enough voice on their key issues, including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect I'm not going to appeal to all the people all the
time,'' Bush said Tuesday when he announced formation of an
exploratory committee for a probable presidential race. ``I've got
a record. It's a good solid record, and people can analyze it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a United Methodist, spoke to Land's conference Monday
night at Great Hills Baptist Church. His talk was closed to the
media at his request, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Land say they have a good relationship with the
Bush family, particularly with former President Bush. Patterson is
the president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C. Land works in the denomination's national headquarters
in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush has shown a remarkable ability to tell
some really hard truths to folks that lets them know he really
cares about them,'' Land said. ``I think what he is going to do is
couple that in inclusivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' slogan is getting across
to Americans what evangelical Christians have been advocating all
along, Land said. The governor is able to package the message in a
way that shows the conservative agenda is not a mean-spirited
critique of people's lives, but a way for the country to care for
its people and reclaim its values, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone like Governor Bush comes along and says, 'Look,
we all made mistakes and we all made poor judgments, and the
question is, what have we learned from them?' I think that kind of
helping hand will resonate enormously among conservative
evangelical Christians and the American population at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Flood, executive director of Austin Metropolitan
Ministries, a nonpartisan interfaith organization that represents
150 congregations, said the governor is well-received in the
religious community.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the jury is out in regards as to how individuals
are going to vote,'' Flood said. ``It is going to be interesting to
observe how he deals with the extremes in his own party.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush chooses to run and wins the nomination, Flood said
not to count out presidential hopeful and current Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a Southern Baptist, so how will that filter out?''

 &HT;    There is justice, after all
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is justice, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Barbie, what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the same features that made Barbie a mega beach babe
at 19 or 20 _ the suntan, the long neck, the sculpted, nearly
fat-free face _ worked against her as she aged.
</P>
<P>
   So says Kendra Mauldin, forensic artist for the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office. We commissioned Mauldin to apply
scientific principles in producing _ a la America's Most Wanted _ a
portrait of what Barbie would look like today, as a 40 year old.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin took nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She goes by Barbara now _ or Barb,'' she says, names befitting
a multicareer woman who dabbled in space exploration, dentistry and
fashion design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything basically loosens, gravity takes its toll,''
Mauldin says. ``Those aren't so much wrinkles as sagging skin. The
less fat you have, the more visible it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``big three'' signs of age on women's faces, she says, are
sagging under the eye sockets, ``smile'' lines beneath the nose and
folds at the corners of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And all that time in the Malibu sun took its toll on our girl,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin wasn't sure about this one, but she gave ``Barbara''
some vertical above-the-lip creases typically found on smokers in
their 40s. Hey _ you might smoke, too, if you had to juggle
payments on the Dream House, three or four pink convertibles, a
bright yellowhelicopter, and a vast, sequin-studded wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   That platinum blond hair now looks ever-so slightly silver in
Barb's professional bob. And those big eyes and slim, foot-long
neck . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I put the hair on her, I was looking at E.T.,'' Mauldin
says.

 &HT;    Sadly, Broadway requires Hollywood star to thrive
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the New York theater season ends this
spring, some sales record will surely be broken. Spiraling ticket
costs of $80 and above virtually ensure that. But if you judge
Broadway by the quality of its new American plays and musicals,
then the state of the Great White Way at mid-season is distinctly
dingy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the season lacks good new plays, but more and
more, if you have a serious drama _ and you don't have a movie star
as audience bait _ it lands off-Broadway. That is where you will
find ``Margaret Edson's Wit,'' a powerful, painful story of an
English lit professor diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer,
played stunningly by Kathleen Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Broadway thrived on the sensationalism and sizzle
of Nicole Kidman in David Hare's ``The Blue Room,'' a series of
sexual encounters loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's
turn-of-the-century ``La Ronde.'' Not that most of those in
attendance had classic literature on the brain. They went, like the
suckers P.T. Barnum once attracted, on the promise of a dimly lit
Kidman appearing nude for about six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is what passes for event theater on Broadway these
days. The Kidman peek-a-boo show, which closed a week early when
she got a bronchial infection, sold out its entire run long before
critics could warn that the emperor had no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any given play with a star can make it on Broadway,''
says Daryl Roth, producer of ``Wit.'' ``If people want to come and
see that person, they almost don't care what they're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth tried to buck the prevailing wisdom and take ``Wit'' to
Broadway but met with resistance from theater owners _ the true
gate-keepers of commercial culture. As she recalls, ``We pleaded
our case and everyone said to us, `You're crazy. This is not a play
that belongs on Broadway. This is about a woman dying of cancer. Do
you think people want to spend $65 or $75 to come and see this?
Absolutely not.'''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between Broadway and off-Broadway is widening, which
galls producers like Roth who get shut out of contention for Tony
Awards and their marketing boost. In fact, she petitioned the Tonys
committee to rule ``Wit'' eligible, but was turned down last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, there has been only one new American drama
to open and run on Broadway _ Warren Leight's ``Side Man,'' a
heartfelt, but overwrought memory play about jazz musicians, with a
cast led by another movie star _ Christian Slater. OK, there is
also a 61-year-old ``new'' play by Tennessee Williams, his
previously unseen prison drama, ``Not About Nightingales,'' first
produced in London.
</P>
<P>
   As with musicals in the 1980s, the flow of plays is decidedly
from Great Britain to the United States. Still to come this season
are two more scripts by Hare, ``Amy's View'' with Oscar nominee
Judi Dench and ``Via Dolorosa,'' a one-man monologue that Hare
performs. Also expected is ``Closer'' with last season's Tony
winner Natasha Richardson (``Cabaret'') and ``The Weir,'' the 1998
Olivier Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   And Kevin Spacey had to go to London to star in ``The Iceman
Cometh'' by America's greatest dramatist Eugene O'Neill, in order
to get the play on Broadway.

 &HT;    John Gray: Find `inner world' for happiness
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ John Gray's world is filled with
avalanches of simple metaphors that lead to greater truths.
</P>
<P>
   You'd expect that from the guy who penned the wildly successful
_ and metaphorically titled _ relationship book, ``Men Are From
Mars, Women Are From Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   So when a fire alarm tripped accidentally at his house near San
Francisco during a recent interview, even that became fodder for
Gray in promoting his latest book, ``How To Get What You Want and
Want What You Get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often, people feel that there's all these problems in
their life and there's nothing they can do about it,'' he said,
barely skipping a beat after squelching the alarm. ``What my book
is about is to point out the false alarms and say that there is
something you can do about it. It's not always as bad as you think
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray aims to build on his Mars/Venus ventures (which include
``Mars &AMP; Venus on a Date,'' Mars &AMP; Venus magazine and the Mars &AMP;
Venus board game) to succeed in the motivational writing arena.
``How To Get What You Want'' was the product of seminars he
conducted during a series of weekly appearances on Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   The way Gray sees it, Americans' approach to success is out of
balance and out of order. Total happiness, he says, can be achieved
``by focusing on our particular needs for love and support'' in our
``inner world'' rather than trying to fulfill what we haven't
achieved in the ``outer world.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to success starts with a healthy portion of
self-examination. Gray urges short sessions of morning meditation
to ``order the day'' and visualize the success you want to achieve.
During these internal powwows, you should:
</P>
<P>
   _Identify what your soul truly desires.
</P>
<P>
   _Learn how to get the love and support you need.
</P>
<P>
   _Understand how to get what you want without giving up being
true to your self.
</P>
<P>
   _Remove any obstacles to your personal success.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   If this has a familiar ring, there's a reason. Writers ranging
from Shakespeare to Norman Vincent Peale to Dr. Laura Schlessinger
have espoused the power of positive thought and honest
introspection as tools for reaching glory. Put another way Gray's
philosophy could be condensed into a combination of, ``To thine own
self be true'' (Shakespeare), and ``Go take on the day''
(Schlessinger).
</P>
<P>
   But Gray's book attacks what he says are the 12 blocks to
personal success (emotional speed bumps like blame, depression,
anxiety, self-pity and procrastination) by embracing them. By
facing these obstacles and identifying their true nature, such as a
fear of failure, you'll find a more direct way to success, just
like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I want to sell a billion books,'' he said,
hypothetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's impossible. So I'm going to be disappointed. And
when I feel disappointed, then I let go of those negative emotions
and what emerges is, `OK, I'll settle for 10 million.' I couldn't
have said that out loud or people would think I was nuts. Well,
I've done 10 million now. My next goal is 20 million and I'm going
to do my best to get out there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   See? Simple as that.

OCALAN'S FOLLOWERS PLEDGE TO STEP UP ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Although Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish
guerrilla leader, is reportedly cooperating with interrogators and
begging for mercy at his island prison, his guerrilla group pledged
Friday to step up its war.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement by its political wing, the group, the separatist
Kurdistan Workers Party, said it is determined to ``mobilize the
party, masses, armed forces and political resources for a victory
offensive that recognizes no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strike at the enemy with any means you can find,'' the party
urged its militants. ``Let us target the enemy everywhere and
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that about 350 members of the outlawed party
had recently met in ``northern Kurdistan,'' a term it uses to
describe southeastern Turkey, and had decided to step up its armed
campaign. It also called on Kurds in Western Europe and elsewhere
to take ``mass actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ocalan's capture in Kenya last month, his movement has
faced a leadership crisis. He held almost all power himself, and
there is no evident successor. In the clandestine world in which
the guerrillas and their factions operate, it is not possible to
determine whether the statement Friday reflected the sentiment of
the movement as a whole or only a part.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas took responsibility for the suicide bombing of a
police station Thursday in Batman, a provincial capital. Four
people were wounded in the attack and the bomber, a woman, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In another bomb attack, the governor of Cankiri province, Ayhan
Cevik, was severely wounded Friday and three people were killed,
including a 14-year-old girl. A non-Kurdish leftist group, the
Turkish Peasants and Workers Liberation Army, which had been
threatening to kill Cevik for years, took responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is being questioned in the prison on Imrali, an island in
the Sea of Marmara. Leaks to Turkish newspapers describe him as
sweating heavily and chain-smoking as he answers questions. The
headline over one article about the interrogation read, ``Don't
Hang Me, I'll Tell You Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkish law forbids the leaking of testimony given by
prisoners under detention, the major newspapers have been filled
with articles about what Ocalan has reportedly told his
interrogators. According to these reports, his statements bear a
remarkable similarity to what Turkish officials have been saying
for years about his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan has reportedly told investigators that hundreds of his
fighters were trained at camps ``just outside Athens.'' He is said
to have admitted that he got arms from Iraq and Syria, and that
Italy, where he was sheltered for several weeks before his arrest,
``gave us the plastic land mines we call `ankle cutters.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the power of the Turkish state,'' Ocalan is
reported to have said. ``But we were caught up with empty dreams,
we were walking down an endless road.''
</P>
<P>
   An 11-member delegation from the Council of Europe's antitorture
committee was allowed to visit Ocalan on Thursday. There were no
witnesses, making it the first time since his arrest that he has
spoken to anyone in private. The delegation made no statement
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has announced a $114 million
package of aid to the mostly Kurdish southeast, but several
commentators dismissed it as inadequate. In the Istanbul daily
Sabah, the commentator Gungor Mengi wrote, ``Turkey, which has
spent $65 billion fighting separatist terror in the last 14 years,
needs to be bolder and more generous.''

   TOURISTS-DANGER-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ The killing of tourists
by rebels in Uganda raises the questions of why weren't the
tourists warned that they were in a potentially dangerous region,
and were they crazy to be there in the first place? But the reality
is simple, and particularly relevant at a time of rising and

</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. crime rate is
plunging, but its prison population is exploding. No matter how
much crime drops, the U.S. will still have to add the equivalent of
one new jail or prison every week for perhaps another decade,
federal officials say. Some even believe the prison boom could be
permanent, at least for another generation. A big the reason is

   NUCLEAR-POWER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Twenty years after the meltdown
at Three Mile Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways
that were hard to imagine as Pennsylvania cowered in fear in March
1979 and plants around the country subsequently lost their luster
and scores of projects to build reactors were abandoned. The
industry is doing better now, ironically, because it is marching
ever faster toward extinction. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   PBS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent flap over proposed format
changes in `Washington Week in Review' revived a nagging question:
What is the mission of public television these days, and who needs
it? The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing the
sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call its
own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. By Walter Goodman.

   INTERNET-TIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet encompasses all

</P>
<P>
   COUNSEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Last week the Clinton
administration completed a remarkable turnaround in its thinking
about the independent counsel law, which President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno persuaded Congress to renew nearly five
years ago. Excerpts from congressional testimony and other
statements illustrate the history of flipflops on the statue.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-NEWSPAPERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Toronto) _ It's not easy being in
the news business in Canada. You stare at juicy American stories
nearly every day while your own pages fill with curling scores and
wheat quotas. Oh, for a big, page one blockbuster! In February, a
Canadian newspaper thought it had a real scoop when it reported:
`U.S. believes North Korea would target Montreal for a nuclear
strike.' Excerpts on how the story played out.

Films. The Top 100 Books. Now, a list of the top 100 most
unimportant news events of the century.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FOREIGNPOLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For six years, the
Clinton administration and its critics have flailed about for some
grand Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat
as the Cold War concept of containment to define priorities. Recent
U.S. actions on Kosovo and China have something odd in common: they
have come to mark the two extremes of the the administration's
struggle to bring coherence to U.S. foreign policy at a time that
often seems incoherent itself. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Japan seemed resentful and envious
as it watched China's economy boom last year. Japan was suffering
its worst slowdown in more than half a century, and China was the
only Asian country to survive the regional economic crisis
enhanced. But now that China's economy is showing signs of frailty,
Japanese executives and economists are viewing that situation with
apprehension. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While German scientists
conducted hideous experiments on concentration camp prisoners,
their lesser-known Japanese counterparts were waging full-scale
biological warfare and subjecting human beings to ghastly
experiments of their own _ on a far greater scale than the Germans.
Taking decades to emerge, the Japanese record of atrocities is
still producing revelations. The delay illustrates striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past. It has also thrown a harsh light on
Cold War rivalries. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a Guatemalan truth
commission implicated the U.S. in the creation of a killing machine
that ravaged Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised troubling
questions. How could a country that calls itself a beacon of
democracy link its military and intelligence agencies so intimately
to Guatemala's darkest reactionary forces? Some answers, or at
least clues, can be found in scores of declassified documents the
Clinton administration released to the National Security Archive.

   CLINTON-FOREIGNPOLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For six years, the
Clinton administration and its critics have flailed about for some
grand Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat
as the Cold War concept of containment to define priorities. Recent
U.S. actions on Kosovo and China have something odd in common: they
have come to mark the two extremes of the the administration's
struggle to bring coherence to U.S. foreign policy at a time that
often seems incoherent itself. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Japan seemed resentful and envious
as it watched China's economy boom last year. Japan was suffering
its worst slowdown in more than half a century, and China was the
only Asian country to survive the regional economic crisis
enhanced. But now that China's economy is showing signs of frailty,
Japanese executives and economists are viewing that situation with
apprehension. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While German scientists
conducted hideous experiments on concentration camp prisoners,
their lesser-known Japanese counterparts were waging full-scale
biological warfare and subjecting human beings to ghastly
experiments of their own _ on a far greater scale than the Germans.
Taking decades to emerge, the Japanese record of atrocities is
still producing revelations. The delay illustrates striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past. It has also thrown a harsh light on
Cold War rivalries. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a Guatemalan truth
commission implicated the U.S. in the creation of a killing machine
that ravaged Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised troubling
questions. How could a country that calls itself a beacon of
democracy link its military and intelligence agencies so intimately
to Guatemala's darkest reactionary forces? Some answers, or at
least clues, can be found in scores of declassified documents the
Clinton administration released to the National Security Archive.

dangerous woman in America. Federal agents followed her around,
writing down everything she said. She was briefly accused of
participating in the attempted murder of an official of Carnegie
Steel, then released and deported, much to the delight of J. Edgar
Hoover. When she died in Toronto in 1940, at age 69, Emma Goldman
was mourned as an ardent free speech advocate and government
critic. On Friday, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley scholar Candace Falk

'Texas Mafia,' a group of Texas Exes scattered all over the country
he met while a UT student. So, when Rod Caspers _ one of that Texas
Mafia _ signed on to do perhaps the biggest production of his

for help. (Shah, Austin American-Statesman).

GROUP PROMOTES VEGETARIANISM IN JESUS' NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GUTIERREZ-MIER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Some 2,000 years after Jesus Christ lived and
died, an animal rights group contends he was a devout vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical Jesus had complete passion for all animals, and
God's original intention was for humans to live together in peace
and harmony in the Garden of Eden,'' said Bruce Friedrich, who is
heading a national campaign for the Norfolk, Va.-based organization
called People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which campaigns against animal abuse and promotes
vegetarian diets, has erected billboards and purchased newspaper
advertising in several cities across the country. The message:
``Jesus was a vegetarian. Show respect for God's creatures _ Follow
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are dubious about Jesus' diet. This is something
new to people who've never considered it,'' said Friedrich, a Roman
Catholic whose claim is backed by several biblical scholars across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Research, Friedrich said, indicates that Christ belonged to a
Jewish religious sect known as the Essenes. The ancient sect
rejected animal sacrifices and were strict vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Samuel M. Stahl of Temple Beth-El in San Antonio said
discussing Jesus' diet was pure speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the menu that would've been prevalent at the time of
Jesus, there certainly is no evidence that he was vegetarian,''
Stahl said. ``The specific foods were not ones that we'd identify
with Jewish food of today like bagels, lox, cream cheese and things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich has petitioned the Catholic hierarchy to reinstitute
meatless Fridays throughout the year, not just at Lent, the 40-day
period that precedes Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer meatless days for all Catholics,'' said Friedrich,
a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Rosa Maria Icaza, a member of the pastoral staff at the
Mexican-American Cultural Center here, explained that after Vatican
II, Catholics were required to abstain from meat and meat products
on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Fridays during Lent, it's highly recommended that you don't
eat meat,'' said Icaza, adding that traditional Mexican Lenten
foods are meatless.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Maria Elena Gonzalez, the center's director, also doesn't
believe Christ was a vegetarian and discounts the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for me is his message,'' said Gonzalez, who
does not eat meat on Fridays as a personal sacrifice. ``If you
can't fast or must eat meat, it's important to sacrifice something
during Lent to remember what Christ did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich said PETA would continue it Jesus campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The organization plans to carry its billboard message to
Amarillo, in the heart of Texas cattle country, later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign has been phenomenally successful,'' Friedrich
said. ``As people of faith, every time we sit down and eat we
should consider what we're eating. We're all creations of God.''

Delta remained 7th out of 10 major airlines in ``involuntary denied
boardings,'' the same spot it occupied in 1997. Delta involuntarily
bumped 13,449 passengers, or 1.31 per 10,000. That was more than
Continental, US Airways, Northwest, American, United and America

   FIRSTUNION _ ATLANTA _ First Union will notify more employees

to help trim $400 million from a budget of $8.7 billion. First
Union's 26,000 employees in Georgia may have to hold their breath

Thursday. ``Others will be notified today, tomorrow and into next
week.'' (Waresh, Palm Beach Post)

   CAR-NASCAR 0304 _ It had been more than a year since owner
Richard Childress last had a driver atop the Winston Cup points
standings. That long drought ended after last month's Dura-Lube/Big
Kmart 400 at North Carolina Speedway; but the driver out front
isn't the one most expected to be reviving his career _ no, not
seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. It's 41-year-old
teammate Mike Skinner, who nearly lost his ride in Childress' No.
31 Chevrolet last year. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

explosive acting style has become half a joke itself _ hollow and
predictable dynamism. What once was original has become so stylized

   LOS ANGELES _ Trends, novelties and the very latest in cool
stuff:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WEALTH OF INFORMATION &LR; : Snap out of it! Daydreaming about
what you'd do if you were rolling in dough won't get you anywhere.
Learning how to become rich is a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ginie Sayles thinks she's got it down to a science. The
consultant to celebrities and the rich turned her financial life
around. She relied on welfare and a student loan to get through
college; now she's married to a Texas oil man. And she wants to
spread the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In ``How to Meet the Rich: For Business, Friendship, or
Romance'' (Berkley Trade; $14), due in stores March 15, Sayles
discusses everything from how to find rich clients for your
business to understanding the love patterns of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a caveat at the end of her book: Money
doesn't always lead to happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Daydreaming might be just as effective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAKING SMALL TALK: Ga-ga and goo-goo may sound like baby talk to
you and me, but in the new film ``Baby Geniuses,'' which opens
nationwide Friday, there's some real dialogue going on between
those babbling babies. We don't know for sure, but they could be
making small talk about the soft-as-a-baby's bottom line, meaning,
of course, the merchandise tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the clothes all those cuddly little darlings are
wearing. Every single baby is wearing clothes designed by Baby
Guess? _ including the little tuxedo ensemble worn by Sly, the
top-hatted ringleader of the baby geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   According to Guess? spokesman Michel Benasra, more than 4,000
garments were made (sometimes 40 sets of the same item) for the
film, and half of the designs are available at Baby Guess? stores.
</P>
<P>
   For those families without their own baby geniuses to dress or
talk to, Toy Biz Inc. has created ``Baby Geniuses'' dolls. Dolls
who follow the seen-and-not-heard rule include Bean Pals character
dolls (think of Beanie Babies) and plush toys with a suction cup
for the car window called Stick-Em-Up dolls; each priced at $6.99.
For parents who want two-way conversations, there's the
newborn-size Electronic Talking ``Baby Geniuses'' doll, which talks
at the pull of a string and is priced at $19.99. All of the dolls
are available at KB Toy Stores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HAIR CRYSTALS: That glitter goo we saw at the Oscars last year is
gone, and frankly, my dear, rhinestone barrettes are becoming passe
(unless they're dragonflies). What's new for show-offy types is
Mellies Sparkles, a handful of crystals that stick to your hair
with a tiny bit of Velcro. Designed by UCLA student Melody Kulp,
the crystals can be scattered throughout your hair or as a flashy
accent on a single strand. And since celebs such as Alanis
Morissette, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Lara Flynn Boyle are fans,
you'll be in good company.
</P>
<P>
   Mellies Sparkles are packaged in fruit-shaped compacts with the
colors corresponding to the fruit, such as red crystals in a red
velvety strawberry. They're priced at $25 to $40 (depending on the
number and size of crystals) at Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom
at the Westside Pavilion and beauty supply stores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONNECTED AT THE WAIST: Being a twin can be fun, unless you're a
cat, your brother's a dog _ and you're attached to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``CatDog,'' star of the kid series of the same name on
Nickelodeon's Nicktoons, is a lovable, quirky and tailless critter
that has been a late-afternoon treat for kids since its
introduction in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two-headed 'toon is headed to a toy store near you.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel is launching a series of plush toys based on the popular
series. They're scheduled to hit stores in March.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a Pull and Pose CatDog, with plush heads and a
stretchable accordion body, retailing for $19.99. Toon Team Packs
feature 6-inch plush figures, including the Greaser Dogs _ Cliff,
Shriek and Lube _ for $14.99. CatDog Ride-on Bicycle, sized for
CatDog, has loops attached to the bicycle's handles and pedals for
CatDog's paws for $10.99. And Stretchy CatDog, made entirely of
latex, sells for $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   And if you, or your kid, is a true fanatic, there's more news on
the CatDog front: Burger King's giving away toys from the series in
its Kids' Value Meals. And these go for just $1.99 to $2.79. The
promotion continues through mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   CatDog _ the ultimate odd couple, with opposites attached _
merges the innocent but rambunctious ``Dog,'' who loves rolling in
the mud and eating garbage, with the more sedate and dignified
``Cat,'' who wishes only to pursue the civil, easy life.
</P>
<P>
   They're proof positive that cats and dogs can get along _ if
they're stuck with each other.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose
in February, to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in January, even as
companies added jobs. Payrolls expanded by 275,000 jobs in
February, about 25,000 jobs more than expected. Workers' average

tragedy represents: the police union and black business executives.
As they left the meeting on Thursday in the cardinal's offices, the
two groups, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and 100 Black
Men, a civic group, agreed to sponsor a joint prayer service for
racial peace with the cardinal, possibly at St. Patrick's

 &HT;    Lewinsky puts stylists at ease, resulting in relaxed look
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monica Lewinsky walked into the photo
studio not with an entourage, as the hair stylist feared, but with
a couple of book reps and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in your hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hair stylist, Harry King, wasn't one to plan ahead. He ran
his fingers through Lewinsky's hair _ ``very, very thick, the lucky
thing'' _ and fiddled.
</P>
<P>
   It was December, the day of the cover shoot for Lewinsky's book,
Monica's Story. King wanted Monica's Hair to look normal, classy,
classic. And smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ ``Let's try something new'' _ he brushed her wavy hair
down, added a bit of pomade and tucked it all behind her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that changed everything!'' makeup artist Tatijana
Suljic-Shoan said Thursday, the morning after Lewinsky's ``20/20''
interview. ``When they put her hair behind her ears, she just
shone.''
</P>
<P>
   King and Suljic-Shoan are the ones behind the sleek, new
Lewinsky look. They were not invited to ``do'' her for ``20/20'' _
``I did find that a little funny,'' Suljic-Shoan says _ but the TV
look was a pretty good replica, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think her hair should have been pinned back,'' King
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concealer was a couple shades too light,'' Suljic-Shoan
says.
</P>
<P>
   (ABC says Lewinsky brought her own stylists to the interview.
Her publicist, John Scanlon, did not return phone calls.)
</P>
<P>
   King and Suljic-Shoan, who do free-lance hair and makeup in New
York, knew Lewinsky needed a look that said ``I am more under
control.'' The first thing the makeup artist did was study any
photo she could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always looked terrified, like she was running from
something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know what to expect the day of the shoot _ ``Can you
imagine?'' King says _ but Lewinsky put them at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `God, what are we gonna talk about, the
weather?''' Suljic-Shoan says. ``If you make small talk, it would
be obvious. But she was so sociable, we didn't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   King gave her extra pomade to take home and a little advice _
``let your hair grow a bit.'' (It looks like she did, he says.)
</P>
<P>
   But the women chatted about shopping, chocolate and jewelry. ``I
think she was thinking, `Finally! I can sit down and be pampered
and have a girl moment!''' Suljic-Shoan said.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup artist knew just what she wanted _ something fresh
and classic. ``I wanted people to see her. She is a very pretty
girl _ heart-shaped face, big eyes, little nose, full lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky wanted her eyes, her favorite feature, played up.
Suljic-Shoan didn't, and she won.
</P>
<P>
   She cleaned up Lewinsky's eyebrows (``I'm not for the plucked,
manicured look _ it's too Barbie-dollish''), put on only one coat
of mascara and didn't curl the eyelashes. She drew black eye liner
between Lewinsky's lashes to make them look thicker.
</P>
<P>
   For blush, she simply matched the peach color to Lewinsky's
natural flush. ``You don't want to be competing.''
</P>
<P>
   She used beige lip liner to color Lewinsky's entire lips to
avoid any lines, then applied honey beige lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does have a great mouth,'' Suljic-Shoan says. ``Usually,
you cheat on (drawing) mouths. I didn't have to cheat on hers.''
</P>
<P>
   The final look, Suljic-Shoan says, is something Lewinsky can
wear forever if she likes, hair and all. Afterward, the makeup
artist passed on a little advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `You don't have to create any illusion,'''
Suljic-Shoan says. ``Just pluck any stray eyebrows and keep the
lips a natural, healthy color.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky makeover was the best job she's ever been offered,
she says. Even if she had to watch ``20/20'' on the tube like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well,'' she says. ``The book's forever. The interview's
over.''

LEWINSKY SCORES IN DISPLAY OF STUPIDITY, IMMATURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Monica Lewinsky doesn't strike me as a ``revolting
specimen of humanity'' _ as she labeled one of Ken Starr's
prosecutors _ or as a ``disgusting, despicable, venomous and evil
human being'' _ her view of Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   No, her TV interview and book don't make her look quite that
bad. But they do show her to be childish, spoiled, narcissistic,
emotionally needy, impulsive, indulgent and, perhaps most of all,
dense. She resembles nothing more than an overachieving groupie
who, instead of hanging around a heavy-metal band, managed to worm
her way into the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Her apologies to Hillary and Chelsea may have impressed you
(most people saw her as sincere, according to an ABC News poll),
but they sounded hollow to me. After saying how sorry she felt, she
giggled and beamed about how sensuous she found Bill Clinton, what
a great kisser he was and how well they gratified each other
sexually.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the affair was all her fault. The president
flirted with her, led her on with talk of being alone in three
years, and faked romantic interest. He sized her up as someone he
could play with and eventually toss aside. He was both a cheating
husband and a counterfeit lover.
</P>
<P>
   How dim is Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   She said she regrets her decision to keep the semen-stained Gap
dress, calling all the attention over it ``just so embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello. That dress was what made Clinton finally come around and
tell the truth. He wouldn't admit a relationship with ``that
woman'' until Starr's team obtained the dress. Clinton knew the DNA
test would cook him. Without the evidence on the dress, he would
still be contradicting Lewinsky today, and she would be widely
perceived as the liar.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp may have been the worst friend anyone could ever have, but
her advice to save the dress was smart. Yet it wasn't just Tripp
alone that made Lewinsky keep the dress uncleaned, it was also the
weight problem that prompted the tabloids to call her a ``portly
pepperpot.''
</P>
<P>
   As she explains in ``Monica's Story,'' the dress was one of her
favorites, but because she soon gained so many pounds, it became
hard to button. Upset that it no longer fit, she put it back in the
closet and decided not to clean it until she lost weight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky showed even less maturity when asked during the TV
interview about her transfer from the White House to the Pentagon.
When she complained about the ``meanies'' who decided she need to
be moved away from the president, Barbara Walters responded
reasonably, ``They were right, weren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Lewinsky shot back. ``I don't think that
my relationship hurt the job he was doing. It didn't hurt the work
I was doing. It was between us.''
</P>
<P>
   These are words you might expect from a love-struck teenager,
not a college-educated woman who has had more than a year to
reflect on her affair with the president and its harsh impact on
their lives. She evidently still doesn't believe that what she did
or what he did was wrong, giving the lie to her pseudo-apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's current feelings about Clinton are also mixed up.
Near the end of her book, she gives this assessment:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he wasn't a very truthful person, but the events
of the last year have shown him to be a much bigger liar than I
ever thought. Now I see him as a selfish man who lies all the time.
That makes me very angry and resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few paragraphs away, she adds:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up some mornings and I have an instant moment where I
miss him with every ounce of my being, my head, heart and body. . .
. I cannot believe that my relationship with the president is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's revelations lead me to think she's more than
Clinton's ``sexual soul mate.'' They have a lot in common. Both are
accomplished fabricators, both like to use people, both showed more
remorse over being caught than over what they did, and both can
feign sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd make a good team,'' Lewinsky once told him, imagining
their life together after he left the White House. She was right.
They deserve each other. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, residents of Rochester, N.Y., were buried by
nearly two feet of snow as a late winter storm swept through the
interior Northeast. On Saturday, another winter storm will cross
the Northeast, bringing additional heavy snow to upstate New York
and other portions of the interior Northeast. Snowfall
accumulations will likely exceed six inches from southeastern
Michigan to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the low pressure center will strengthen off
the Maine coast, bringing additional heavy snow to interior New
England. Farther south, morning snow will change to rain near the
southern New England and Middle Atlantic coasts as milder air is
drawn into the low's circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A strong pressure difference between the intensifying Northeast
low and a cold high-pressure center over central Canada will
promote very gusty winds near the Great Lakes on Saturday. Snow
showers will taper from west to east across the lakes as drier air
arrives from the west. However, as the gusty winds import cold air
south across the unfrozen waters, narrow bands of snow will form
south of Lake Erie and Michigan overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few strong thunderstorms will precede a cold front
crossing the interior Southeast, while partly to mostly sunny and
warm weather persist over the Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty showers and higher-elevation snow will occur over
northern California and the interior West Saturday. Elsewhere,
partly sunny and dry conditions will remain near the Northwest
coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Snow Forecasting
</P>
<P>
   In the days before computer models, meteorologists relied more
heavily on rules of thumb to forecast the weather. The forecasting
rules were developed by observing the atmosphere over many years.
For example, it was determined that the heaviest snow in a winter
storm often falls about 150 miles to the north and west of the
center of the storm. At midweek, Rochester, N.Y., received two feet
of snow when a potent low moved about 150 miles east of the city.
On Saturday, another strong storm is forecast to move about 150
miles south of Rochester, raising the threat of another heavy
snowstorm.

 &HT;    Chaos is king when we blame God for our sinful actions
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sin is God's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Sinners, wretched folk that we are, are simply not responsible
for our acts. Nothing would seem more obvious given recent trends.
</P>
<P>
   Holding God responsible for our sin is the ultimate extension of
a hugely popular _ and highly successful _ plot to shift personal
responsibility to others.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works. The law keeps track of sin. God gave us
the law. Before we knew the law, there was no sin, said St. Paul in
his letter to the Romans. No law, no sin. The devil didn't make us
do it. God did.
</P>
<P>
   That biblical reasoning appears to have legal, if not rational
or theological, merit in the bizarre world in which we live.
</P>
<P>
   It seems no one is responsible for his own decisions. The
Marlboro Man is the most obvious heavy in that turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have found tobacco companies responsible for making
smokers choose to smoke. And that particular road to hell has been
paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   In February, in the latest example of madness, Philip Morris was
ordered to pay more than $50 million to Patricia Henley because,
the court declared, the company made her smoke cigarettes for 38
years.
</P>
<P>
   We have discovered a way to profit from our inability to stop
doing something we knew was bad for us and hold someone else
responsible for our dumb choices. That's Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers are next. Chicago and New Orleans are suing
gun makers because, mirabile dictu, their product kills people.
Miami-Dade, Atlanta and Bridgeport, Conn., follow in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   The person who buys, loads, aims, shoots and kills someone is
the real victim, these plaintiffs say. The gun maker is at fault
and should pay for his or her negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile companies could be a windfall for irresponsibility.
Cars kill people, too. The industry continues to make cars faster
and more powerful. And the corporations are loaded with money to
slake their guilt, enrich lawyers and compensate bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty foods, alcohol and computer keyboards that cause carpal
tunnel syndrome may soon join the list of things that corrupt us.
Their makers should be forced to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate culprit must be God.
</P>
<P>
   Sin came with Adam, Paul tells us. But no one knew it was sin.
</P>
<P>
   Without a list of taboo behavior, there is no basis on which to
judge right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Adam and Eve were naked, but they were not ashamed in the garden
of Eden. They didn't know they were supposed to be cloaked in
modesty and hide their bodies _ and their base natures _ from each
other. They didn't even know their natures were base.
</P>
<P>
   God gave the law as a means of discipline, Paul insists in his
letter to the Galatians.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that was to keep us from having too much fun. But
Paul says the law was a guardian until the Messiah came to set
things right.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Bible says God created the mechanism for
measuring sin. And, by the inane standards of current thinking, God
should be held accountable for all the misery he has caused.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies make cigarettes and have been found
responsible for smokers who get sick from smoking. Gun makers
produce guns and, some insist, are responsible when they go off and
kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   God gave the law. God must be responsible if anyone breaks it.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is irrefutable given the sad state of logic.
</P>
<P>
   When we hold God responsible for sin, we abdicate every pretense
of personal responsibility. And chaos reigns.

TEXAS GOV. BUSH CAUGHT IN A WEB OF EXCITEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, March 7) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Gov. George W. Bush officially explores whether to run for
president, you can use a computer to explore him _ through the
unofficial and often excessive offerings of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-mania affecting Republican voters is reflected in a
rush of Web sites about Bush, although a few are far from adoring.
</P>
<P>
   The most exhaustive site is ``Bush Watch,'' updated daily by
writer and retired teacher Jerry Barrett of Austin, Texas. Flavored
by a skeptical view of the governor, it summarizes newspaper and
magazine articles about Bush and provides links to related sites
and news media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush Watch'' (www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3750/bush.htm)
tags the governor as ``Bush-nocchio'' and ``Prince George.'' It has
separate pages for information about ``his soul,'' ``his friends''
and ``his rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who was active in Democratic Party politics decades ago
and now lists himself as unaligned, said he created and maintains
the site on his own, with no backing or encouragement from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone needs to look over Bush's shoulder and keep
him honest, and I elected myself to give it a shot,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's project is even-handed compared with ``Skeleton
Closet,'' a compendium of dirt on Bush and every other Republican
and Democratic would-be presidential candidate. It is sponsored by
Real People for Real Change, an Oregon group that says it provides
``all the dirt on all the candidates _ because character DOES
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   With documentation that draws from newspaper and magazine
articles, ``Skeleton Closet''  &UR;  &LR; (www.realchange.org) charges that
Bush is a ``spoiled rich kid and longtime party animal'' who ``made
millions off insider business deals with little work.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be no comfort to Bush, who has denied such accusations,
that the harsh tone is the same for the other candidates, too.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the ledger are sites such as ``Jennifer's Bush Family
News,'' a literally rose-colored collection of fluffy tidbits and
photos of the governor, his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although George was sidelined with knee surgery a few years
ago, he's back to jogging three miles a day on Town Lake trails,''
it confided last month.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer does not identify herself on the site
(www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hollow/1930) but she provides a way to
send her an e-mail message to ``keep those tips coming!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Internet fandom extends to Canada, which won't be voting in
the U.S. presidential election anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in Regina, Saskatchewan, political hobbyist
Michael McCafferty runs a Web site that lavishes Bush with praise,
a biography and Internet links. The site
(www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/4124/index.html) also
provides a way to send a ``personal message'' e-mail to Bush. It's
actually a link to the official Web site of the governor's state
office, where presidential campaign business is supposedly off
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The state site (www.governor. state.tx.us) features an
autographed image of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Need a transcript of Bush's recent statement on CNN that he
won't discuss whether he used marijuana or cocaine? Want to
participate in a straw poll on who Bush should pick as his vice
presidential running mate? Both are close at hand at a site
apparently launched by Bush backers in Iowa, where caucuses on a
presidential selection for each major party will be conducted next
January.
</P>
<P>
   The site (www.georgew.org) even offers a way to view videotape
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts by supporters in other states offer even more
Bush background.
</P>
<P>
   From New Hampshire, backers use a ``Bush 2000 Network'' site
(www.egroups.com/list/bush2000) as a kiosk for e-mail
pronouncements from people interested in Bush _ at a pace of 10 per
day.
</P>
<P>
   From California, some Republican legislators offer a site
(www.ca4bush.com) that displays color photos of Bush and text of
his statements about government issues.
</P>
<P>
   The only Internet site officially affiliated with Bush's
campaign is the one left over from this 1998 re-election effort.
The site (www.bush98.com) lists Bush's Election Night victory
statement and photos from the campaign trail, including a rear-end
view of the governor in a Fort Bend County, Texas, parade.
</P>
<P>
   The site does not mention his quest for the presidency.

EPA-ANTHEM (Washington) - The federal Environmental Protection
Agency packed up and left the New River, Ariz., area under pressure
from an influential developer and local militia types. The pressure
came from the Del Webb company through Gov. Jane Hull, who
infuriated the feds by going on the radio to denounce them, and
from a web site in which militia types were threatening the
personal safety of federal agents. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-RIPOFF (Phoenix) - There is the law and then there is justice.
In this case, the law was followed, but was it justice? Several
consumers who bought cars through legitimate dealerships have been
ordered to give them back without compensation because the cars
wound up at those lots via an auto-theft ring. By PAT FLANNERY.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AMWEST-BAGGAGE (Phoenix) - Angry baggage handlers say there might
be more misdirected luggage on Am West because the company stiffed
them on 1998 award pay because they voted in a union Jan.9, 1999.
The company is fighting the union vote, saying it was illegally
influenced, but at the same time say it won't give the bonus
because of the union. One worker says Am West won't be No. 1 next
year in ontime baggage. By PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the
``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILSON-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ Monica Lewinsky doesn't strike me as a
``revolting specimen of humanity'' _ as she labeled one of Ken
Starr's prosecutors. No, her TV interview and book don't make her
look quite that bad. But they do show her to be childish,
narcissistic, emotionally needy, impulsive, indulgent, and perhaps
most of all, dense. She resembles nothing more than an
overachieving groupie who, instead of hanging around a heavy metal
band, managed to worm her way into the Oval Office. By STEVE
WILSON. Column moved in the ``K'' category. &QL;

WHEN ONE CULTURE'S CUSTOM IS ANOTHER'S TABOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Wash., Ill., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Maine, a refugee from Afghanistan was seen kissing the penis
of his baby boy, a traditional expression of love by this father.
To his neighbors and the police, it was child abuse, and his son
was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a hospital tried to invent a harmless female
circumcision procedure to satisfy conservative Somali parents
wanting to keep an African practice alive in their community. The
idea got buried in criticism from an outraged public.
</P>
<P>
   How do democratic, pluralistic societies like the United States,
based on religious and cultural tolerance, respond to customs and
rituals that may be repellent to the majority? As new groups of
immigrants from Asia and Africa are added to the demographic mix in
the United States, Canada and Europe, balancing cultural variety
with mainstream values is becoming more and more tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Many American citizens now confront the issue of whether any
branch of government should have the power to intervene in the most
intimate details of family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are torn,'' said Richard Shweder, an anthropologist
at the University of Chicago and a leading advocate of the broadest
tolerance for cultural differences. ``It's a great dilemma right
now that's coming up again about how we're going to deal with
diversity in the United States and what it means to be an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists have waded deeply into this debate, which is
increasingly engaging scholars across academia, as well as social
workers, lawyers and judges who deal with new cultural dimensions
in immigration and asylum. Some, like Shweder, argue for
fundamental changes in American laws, if necessary, to accommodate
almost any practice accepted as valid in a radically different
society if it can be demonstrated to have some social or cultural
good.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although Shweder and others would strongly oppose
importing such practices as India's immolation of widows, they
defend other controversial practices, including the common African
ritual that opponents call female genital mutilation, which usually
involves removing the clitoris, at a minimum. They say that it is
no more harmful than male circumcision, and should be accommodated,
not deemed criminal, as it is now in the United States and several
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harvard Law School, Martha Minow, a professor who
specializes in family and school issues, said that intolerance
often arises when the behavior of immigrants seems to be
``nonmodern, nonscientific and nonrational.'' She cites as an
example the practice of ``coining'' among Cambodians, where hot
objects may be pressed on a child's forehead or back as cures for
various maladies, leaving alarming welts that for teachers and
social workers set off warnings of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are more than happy to accept new immigrants when
their traditions seem to reinforce mainstream ideals. There are few
cultural critics of the family values, work ethic or dedication to
education found among many East Asians, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But going more than half way to tolerate what look like
disturbing cultural practices unsettles some historians, aid
experts, economists and others with experience in developing
societies. Such relativism, they say, undermines the very notion of
progress. What's more, it raises the question of how far acceptance
can go before there is no core American culture, no shared values
left.
</P>
<P>
   Many years of living in a variety of cultures, said Urban
Jonsson, a Swede who directs the U.N. children's fund, UNICEF, in
sub-Saharan Africa, has led him to conclude that there is ``a
global moral minimum,'' which he has heard articulated by Asian
Buddhists and African thinkers as well as by Western human rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a nonethnocentric global morality,'' he said, and
scholars would be better occupied looking for it rather than
denying it. ``I am upset by the anthropological interest in
mystifying what we have already demystified. All cultures have
their bad and good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Murder was a legitimate form of expression in Europe centuries
ago when honor was involved, Jonsson points out. Those days may be
gone in most places, but in Afghanistan, a wronged family may
demand the death penalty and carry it out themselves with official
blessing. Does that restore it to respectability in the 21st
century?
</P>
<P>
   Scholars like Shweder are wary of attempts to catalog ``good''
and ``bad'' societies or practices. Working with the Social Science
Research Council in New York and supported by the Russell Sage
Foundation, he helped formed a group of about 15 legal and cultural
experts to investigate how American law affects ethnic customs
among African, Asian, Caribbean and Latin American immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   A statement of purpose written by the working group, headed by
Shweder and Ms. Minow, says that it intends to explore how to react
to ``official attempts to force compliance with the cultural and
legal norms of American middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our pluralistic ideals, something very much like a
cultural un-American activities list seems to have begun
circulating among powerful representatives and enforcers of
mainstream culture,'' the group says in its statement. ``Among the
ethnic minority activities at risk of being dubbed `un-American'
are the use of disciplinary techniques such as shaming and physical
punishment, parent/child co-sleeping arrangements, rituals of group
identity and ceremonies of initiation involving scarification,
piercing and genital alterations, arranged marriage, polygamy, the
segregation of gender roles, bilingualism and foreign language use
and many more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists and anthropologists on this behavioral
frontier argue that American laws and welfare services have often
left immigrants terrified of the intrusive power of government. The
Afghan father in Maine who lost his son to the well-meaning social
services, backed by a lower court, did not prevail until the matter
reached the state Supreme Court, which researched the family's
cultural heritage and decided in its favor _ while making clear
that this was an exceptional case, not a precedent.

 UNDATED: a precedent. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spanking, puberty rites, animal sacrifices, enforced dress
codes, leaving children unattended at home and sometimes the use of
narcotics have all been portrayed as acceptable cultural practices.
But who can claim to be culturally beyond the prevailing laws and
why?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow said that issues of cultural practice were appearing
in more law school curriculums as Americans experience the largest
wave of immigration since the 1880-1920 era. ``Immigration is now
becoming a mainstream subject,'' she said. ``There is also
definitely a revival of interest in law schools in religion,''
including a study of the relation of beliefs to social practices
and legal constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading thinkers in this debate will discuss the
issue at a conference at Harvard in April on the relationship
between culture and progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that there is such a thing as a successful
society and an unsuccessful society,'' said Lawrence Harrison, a
conference panelist, ``then you have to draw some conclusions about
what makes for a better society.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who wrote ``Underdevelopment as a State of Mind''
(Harvard) and ``Who Prospers?'' (Basic Books), said he believed
there were universal yearnings for ``progress'' and that to refrain
from judging every practice out there ignores those aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, while some Americans want judgment-free
considerations of immigrant practices and the traditional rituals
in countries they come from, asylum-seekers from those same
countries are turning up at American airports begging to escape
from tribal rites in the name of human rights. Immigration lawyers
and judges are thus drawn into a debate that is less and less
theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson of UNICEF, whose wife is from Tanzania, says he has had
to confront cultural relativism every day for years in the Third
World. He is outraged by suggestions that the industrial nations
should be asked to bend their laws and social norms, especially on
the genital cutting of girls, which UNICEF opposes.
</P>
<P>
   He labels those who would condemn many in the Third World to
practices they may desperately want to avoid as ``immoral and
unscientific.'' In their academic towers, Jonsson said, cultural
relativists become ``partners of the tormentors.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Neuwirth, an international lawyer who is director of
Equality Now, a New York-based organization aiding women's groups
in the developing world and immigrant women in this country, asks
why the practices that cultural relativists want to condone so
often involve women: how they dress, what they own, where they go,
how their bodies can be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture is male-patrolled in the way that it is created and
transmitted,'' she said. ``People who control culture tend to be
the people in power, and who constitutes that group is important.
Until we can break through that we can't take the measure of what
is really representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Other voices are often not being heard or are silenced. ``People
forget that inside every culture, there is a whole spectrum of
ideas and values,'' she said. ``There may be women in another
culture who defend the practice of female genital mutilation, but
in the same culture there will be women who oppose the practice.
And men, too.''

 &HT;    Scholar visits UGA to celebrate 19th century free speech
activist Emma Goldman
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When Emma Goldman was crisscrossing the nation,
speaking on topics as varied as free love, modern drama and birth
control, there was one area of the country where she never
ventured, because it was too dangerous _ the South.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Supreme Court didn't
enforce the First Amendment guaranteeing the right of free speech.
The states did, meaning that local authorities would routinely
suppress dissidents such as Goldman and others calling for great
social changes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, scholar Candace Falk, director of the Emma Goldman
Papers Project at the University of California at Berkeley, spoke
at the University of Georgia on Emma Goldman, saying she ``was glad
to come to correct this historical record.'' Falk was the keynote
speaker for the March celebration of Women's History Month at UGA.
The theme is ``Radical Departures.''
</P>
<P>
   There are special events and exhibits throughout the month,
including talks and movies on Simone de Beauvoir; a lecture by
artist-in-residence Joan Tower of the School of Music on March 24;
and a ``Roundtable on Radicalism'' on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lithuania who immigrated to the United States,
Goldman was a brilliant orator, a tireless champion of labor and an
advocate for women's rights. She drew thousands of people to her
speeches, and was capable of talking to a women's drama club one
evening and a group of coal miners the next day. Falk termed her
``an anarchist who felt that social harmony was within reach'' and
a great dramatist of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of appearances, Goldman was arrested in 1916 in
Cleveland for giving a talk on birth control and was imprisoned the
next year for speaking out against forced conscription during World
War I. She was deported to Russia in 1917 and died in Toronto in
1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time, in this age of complacency, that we look to
people who were willing to go to jail and be deported for their
ideas,'' said Heather Kleiner, associate director of the UGA
Women's Studies Program. ``(Goldman) was speaking to 10,000 people
at a pop. I think we have a lot to learn from her and others like
her.''
</P>

 &HT;    CLINTON RENOMINATES LEE AS CIVIL RIGHT CHIEF
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reopening a partisan battle over affirmative
action, the Clinton administration announced Friday it would
renominate Bill Lann Lee as assistant attorney general for civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been serving in the post for 14 months without Senate
approval, and over the objections of Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Lee's performance
proves he is a social moderate with an agenda for aggressive
enforcement of federal civil rights and anti-discrimination laws,
not the zealous liberal portrayed by some of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a person who is within the mainstream of civil rights
law, within civil
</P>
<P>
   rights thought,'' Holder told reporters at the White House. ``He
has spent a lifetime fighting for civil rights, and the fights that
he has led have improved the quality of life for many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, fired
back by accusing the White House of trying to ''play politics''
with Lee, and said his opposition to the civil rights attorney
remains firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him personally and would support him for almost any
other position in the government,'' Hatch said in a prepared
statement. ``But not one that allows him to implement
unconstitutional policies such as quotas which give preference to
one group at the expense of another.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House move was applauded by a wide range of civil
rights and Asian-American groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Lee in July 1997 to become assistant attorney
general for civil rights at the Justice Department. The position
requires Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination died four months later in the face of opposition
by Hatch and seven other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Lee's opponents cited his background as an NAACP
attorney who fought violators of affirmative action laws designed
to give some minorities an edge in areas ranging from employment to
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Making use of a temporary recess nomination that did not require
confirmation, Clinton placed Lee in post in an acting role in
December 1997. Since then, he has overseen the work of about 560
attorneys and paralegals charged with enforcing federal
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said Lee doesn't require Senate confirmation to continue
in his position indefinitely as acting assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing the issue against the grain of the Republican
majority in the Senate, however, Clinton is underscoring partisan
differences over the controversial issue of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a particularly contentious one in California, whose
electoral votes would be critical in a 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the Clinton administration has chosen
to re-nominate Bill Lann Lee and play politics with the Civil
Rights Division rather than put forward a consensus, confirmable
candidate,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Holder denied that Lee's renomination is meant to provoke a
fight with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a poke in the eye _ I think we're dealing
with a different set
</P>
<P>
   of circumstances,'' said Holder. ``Last year we did not know, we
did not have the ability to say 'Look at this nominee. Look at what
he has done. ... There are a new set of facts, it seems to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted that Lee's
reconfirmation would get a favorable hearing before the Judiciary
Committee this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that are aligned against Bill Lann Lee, their problem is
not with Bill Lann Lee, but it is with the Supreme Court of the
United States or with the laws of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Lann Lee's life has been for the enforcement of the law,
nothing more, nothing less,'' said Kennedy, a member of the
Judiciary Committee. ``He has in a very quiet, effective way worked
to make America a fairer, a more just country.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and several other civil rights and Asian-American
groups were on hand at the White House to urge support for Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our democracy, we should expect that laws, once passed,
will be enforced,'' Dorothy Height, chairperson of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, told reporters at the White House.
''It's his commitment to the enforcement of some of the laws that
has put him in question,'' said Height, whose group counts as
members 178 civil rights and anti-discrimination organizations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a laundry business in New
York City, Lee graduated from Yale University, then from Columbia
University Law School in 1974. He did public interest law work
before joining, in 1988, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which he
served as western regional counsel in Los Angeles.

who were granted an extended stay in the United States after
Hurricane Mitch devastated their homelands must go home by Monday,

from those countries, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has evaluated the situation on the ground
in both countries and has concluded that they are both capable of
beginning to receive their nationals,'' the INS said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, the most destructive hurricane to hit the
Western Hemisphere in 200 years, swept through El Salvador,
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras last fall. It killed more than
9,000 people and caused about $6 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, the INS decided to grant illegal immigrants
from Central America an extended stay. Hondurans and Nicaraguans
were allowed to stay until June 30, 2000, while Guatemalans and
Salvadorans were allowed to stay only through through March 8 of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although immigrants with temporary protection from deportation
often are ordered to leave the country after their extension
expires, it is unclear how many actually leave because the INS does
not keep such records, INS General Counsel Paul Virtue said at a
recent subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Reyes, director of the Central American Refugee Center in
Houston, said he recently toured the area and does not think any of
the countries are ready to accept nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they're going to return to a different country,''
he said. ``We're talking about the devastation of the whole region.
Everybody suffers the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said families still living in Central America will
suffer because their relatives, who have been working in the United
States, no longer will be able to send money back home once they
are deported.
</P>
<P>
   Money sent home from the United States by expatriates is the No.
1 source of revenue in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease financial strains, the Clinton administration has
proposed a package that would give the four affected countries $956
million in direct aid as well as lift trade barriers on some
products from the region, including textiles.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also helped secure $6 billion in commitments
from the World Bank and other international financial
organizations.

 &HT;    Delta's rate of bumping passengers remains high
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The chances of getting involuntarily bumped from an
overbooked Delta Air Lines flight, though small, remained well
above average for the industry in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Year-end figures show Atlanta's dominant carrier was seventh out
of 10 major airlines in ``involuntary denied boardings,'' ranked
from lowest to highest rate. Delta held the same spot in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Delta involuntarily bumped 13,449 passengers _ more
than the combined total for Continental, US Airways, Northwest,
American, United and America West, which finished first through
sixth, respectively, in the Department of Transportation ranking.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta handled more passengers, 102 million, than any of
those carriers, its rate of involuntary bumping was significantly
higher at 1.31 per 10,000 customers. The industrywide rate was
0.87.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Delta's rate fell from 1.53 in 1997, the first
decline since 1991, when its rate was just 0.37.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Delta's bumping rate was highlighted a year ago in
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and executives said steps were
under way to assure improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to take aggressive steps and our rate of
improvement has been fastest in Atlanta,'' spokesman John Kennedy
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously released DOT figures showed Delta improved last year
in other service measures _ especially on-time performance, where
it jumped from 10th to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bumping stems from overbooking flights to protect against
no-shows and the lost value of the unfilled seats. Airlines contend
they would lose billions, and be forced to charge more, without
overbooking.
</P>
<P>
   Bumping affects few travelers, but it can create gate pile-ups
and confusion while agents sort things out. Before resorting to
involuntary bumping, airlines ask for volunteers willing to take a
later flight. In return, they get credit on a future trip.
</P>
<P>
   Delta reported 233,732 voluntary bumpings in 1998, more than any
airline but down from 259,413 a year earlier. American was next,
with 221,826, followed by United with 142,057.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary bumping essentially measures how far off an airline
is in estimating how much it can overbook and how many volunteers
can be persuaded to take later flights.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said new computer programs being used by Delta will
improve its performance in both regards.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines led the industry for the second straight
year, while US Airways showed the best improvement by jumping to
second from fifth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TATITLEK, Alaska _ It was a few minutes after midnight when the
big ship fetched up on Bligh Reef in the icy waters of Prince
William Sound. ``Evidently, we're leaking some oil, and we're going
to be here for quite a while,'' the captain reported to the Coast
Guard. And even today, nearing the 10th anniversary of one of the
nation's worst environmental disasters, the oil spill by Exxon
Valdez, which is barred by law from ever returning, is in many ways
still here.
</P>
<P>
   In environmental terms, the sound is still recovering, according
to a report issued recently by the joint federal and state council
that monitors the continuing effects of the tanker accident, which
dumped at least 10.8 million gallons of North Slope crude into the
sound and blackened 1,500 miles of the magnificent Gulf of Alaska
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 species listed in the report, only two _ the bald
eagle and the river otter _ are considered to be ``fully
recovered'' a decade later. For the ecosystem in general and for
most other species, substantial progress has been made toward
recovery but ``there is a long way yet to go,'' according to the
council's director.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the Valdez case drags on. Five years after a federal
jury ordered Exxon to pay a record $5 billion in punitive fines to
the thousands of villagers and commercial fishermen hurt by the
spill, the company has yet to pay any of the judgment, challenging
it in an appeals process that may continue for years. Exxon, which
spent an estimated $2.3 billion on cleanup activities and another
$1 billion in a federal settlement, says the award sends a
``perverse message'' after all the company did to mitigate the
spill's effects.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another continuing reminder of the spill, the tanker's
skipper, Joseph J. Hazelwood, is also still a presence here in
Alaska. After years of fighting his state conviction on the
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, the former
captain, who lives on Long Island, N.Y., will at last return this
summer to begin a court-ordered community service program. He has
been assigned to pick up trash on the streets of Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   And even the ship itself remains in the news. It has long since
been repaired and renamed the SeaRiver Mediterranean, and the Exxon
subsidiary that owns it, challenging the federal law that prohibits
the tanker from returning to Alaska, has been seeking permission
for it to come back to the waters of Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people who live here, the idea of the tanker's
returning is ``just too much,'' in the words of Gary P. Kompkoff,
president of the village council here in Tatitlek, a small Aleut
community just three miles from where the Exxon Valdez went
aground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still struggling with what happened here,'' Kompkoff
said. ``Eleven million gallons of oil, from the bottom of the food
chain to the top. I'm not sure I understand how we could ever
totally recover from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the spill, on March 24, 1989, Exxon and most of
the people who live in the area around the sound here were in
disagreement over just how bad its effects would be, and 10 years
later, they still are.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon says the area has ``essentially recovered'' by any
reasonable measure, and the company's vice president for
environment and safety, Frank B. Sprow, said that while any oil
spill is an unfortunate event, exhaustive studies by the company
and independent scientists have found no long-term harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find is acute short-term impacts,'' Sprow said, ``but
the environment &UR;  &LR; _ Mother Nature, if you will _ has remarkable
powers of recovery, whether aided by man or not, and the natural
order does re-establish itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to tourists who pass by in cruise ships or to a visitor
flying over the snowy tundra and vast blue glacial fields in a bush
plane, the sound looks as clean and spectacular as it ever did. And
some steps taken because of the spill may protect it all the more.
For instance, some of the money from Exxon's federal settlement has
been used for conservation programs protecting about 650,000 acres
of land, including sensitive habitat along 61 salmon and trout
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the disaster clearly galvanized the environmental
movement, capturing public awareness and spurring the passage,
among other things, of a range of new safety measures. Programs put
in place since then have, by wide agreement, made the shipping
process less prone to an accident than it was before, though no one
can guarantee it will never happen again. An elaborate escort
program with tugboats, on-board harbor pilots, radar tracking and
other measures is in place for the tankers that routinely pass in
and out of the port of Valdez, ferrying oil from the trans-Alaska
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion that the sound has recovered is deeply and
bitterly disputed by many of the roughly 20,000 people who live in
the areas that were most directly affected by the spill, which
killed 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250
bald eagles and up to 22 killer whales, according to the Exxon
Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the federal-state monitoring
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not back to what it was _ no way at all,'' said Gail
Evanoff, the council president in tiny Chenega Bay, a village that
lay directly in the the path of the westward flow of the oil.
``There's life there, but not what you saw before.'' Ms. Evanoff,
as well as officials of the trustee council, said there were still
small pockets along the beaches and in rock crevices where small
pools of oil and tar balls can be found _ and smelled.

 TATITLEK, Alaska: and smelled.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Cordova, a fishing village with a postcard harbor nestled up
against the Chugach Mountains, there is still visceral anger at
Exxon, and many people blame the oil company for a downturn in
their fortunes _ declining Pacific herring runs and a sharp falloff
in the value of commercial fishing permits, particularly for
herring. ``The fabric of this community was pulled apart, ripped,
torn, shredded, kicked,'' said a former mayor, Kelley Weaverling.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lange, 46, who comes from a longtime fishing family and
with her husband has been struggling to maintain a fish-processing
plant in Cordova, said she believed the damage to the sound and the
people who make their living from it could be compared in many ways
to the trauma of a rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say with utmost certainty that there is no such thing as
a true `cleanup' here,'' Mrs. Lange said. ``You can put on makeup
and make a show of it and say, `Oh, it must be better again.' But
it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon vigorously disputes such claims and notes that many of the
people who are still complaining about the spill received
compensatory payments in 1989 and 1990 that amounted to several
times their normal annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Herring spawning has indeed sharply declined since 1989 _ from
100,000 metric tons to 16,000 by 1993 and now around 30,000, said
Stan Senner, science coordinator of the trustee council. But Exxon
says that such declines are part of normal fluctuations in the
ocean and cannot be attributed to the spill. Runs of salmon, which
make vast migrations and were much less directly affected by the
spill, have remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   Given that most areas of the sound do not show obvious reminders
of the spill like the oil puddles in Chenega Bay, the broader
question is whether it is showing other continuing effects. It is
not an easy question to answer, in part, scientists point out,
because there is not a lot of detailed ``baseline data''
quantifying exactly what the sound was like before the Valdez hit
the jagged shoals of Bligh Reef.
</P>
<P>
   But the trustee council, which was financed with money from the
government's settlement, did reach several conclusions in the
recent report. The good news was that bald eagles, which can be
seen all around here and which were enumerated in surveys before
the spill, are flourishing and are thus considered ``recovered.''
River otters no longer indicate elevated levels of the blood
chemicals that indicate oil exposure, and so they too were declared
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But several bird species and marine mammals _ including common
loons, three species of cormorants, harbor seals, harlequin ducks
and the killer whales of Prince William Sound _ have shown no
significant recovery, according to the report. The stellar sea lion
remains an endangered species, though its numbers had been entering
into a serious decline in the northern Gulf of Alaska even before
1989, meaning that the spill's responsibility for the continued
decline remains a subject of fierce contention.
</P>
<P>
   Many villagers rely on the fish, mammals and wild plants for a
subsistence diet here, and the report found that their gathering
methods had changed after the spill, with many vital foods being
much harder to find in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the ecological conditions remain under debate, the
legal terrain of the case remains a battlefield as well, and
recently, plaintiffs have been pressing Congress to intervene by
holding up the proposed $80 billion merger of Exxon and Mobil until
the case gets resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Exxon's arrogance in refusing to pay us what it owes us,
the government should not let Exxon amass any more power or
arrogance,'' said Patience Andersen Faulkner, a Cordova resident,
showing a visitor a letter she sent recently to her senators on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 federal jury award to about 33,000 fishermen, villagers
and other Alaskans was the largest pollution award in history, but
it remains unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is currently under appeal, and it might wind up
before the Supreme Court, though the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, Brian
O'Neill, says there is no reason for it to do so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's basically a big drunk-driving case,'' said O'Neill, who
is based in Minneapolis. ``There are no big constitutional issues
involved. We don't need the Supreme Court _ Exxon should pay up.''
(The ship's captain was seen having drinks in the hours before the
Valdez left port and failed an initial blood-alcohol test by the
Coast Guard, but he has steadfastly denied being drunk when the
tanker hit the reef, and the state jury acquitted him of
intoxication charges.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plaintiffs in Cordova and Tatitlek seem prepared to
fight on in the courts for years or longer, while other shrug off
the whole case and say they doubt they will ever see any money from
the judgment. A few say Exxon tried to make amends and no longer
deserves to be the object of communal wrath. And still others say
that in the most important way, the case will never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has fished with me since she was a toddler, and
one thing I know we've lost is my ability to tell her, `Oh, it'll
be OK, the sound will always be OK,''' said Steve Riedel, a
42-year-old fisherman who notes ruefully that his fishing boat,
Lucky Lady, was so named before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Diana, is 16 now, and she has a collection of
rocks, including some oil-covered ones she pulled from the beaches
just last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just isn't the same,'' Riedel said, ``and she knows it. And
so when she's deciding what she's going to do with her life, I
think I'm probably going to tell her, keep your fond memories, but
find something to do other than fishing in Prince William Sound.''

STUDY SAYING KANSAS CITY TOPS LIST IN TRAFFIC DEATHS OVERSTATES
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ However you figure it, road deaths in Kansas
City reflect a high rate of carnage and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But a widely publicized report released Thursday that pegged
Kansas City as the worst large city for traffic fatalities
overstated the case. The rankings were announced by The Road
Information Group (TRIP), a research organization funded by highway
interests. The group used statistics from the National Highway
Traffic Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reviewed the statistics and found problems
in the TRIP study's methodology. The paper's review of the federal
statistics indicates that Kansas City ranks third worst among the
60 largest cities in the country, behind Memphis and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy in the two rankings stems from the fact that
Memphis and Nashville were not included on the TRIP list. The TRIP
study sought to rank urban areas of more than 1 million people by
their number of traffic-related deaths. But 1999 almanacs show that
both Tennessee cities rank above 1 million in 1996 metro area
populations.
</P>
<P>
   The highway administration figures rank the cities according to
traffic deaths per 100,000 population. And the federal highway
administration rankings were based on 1996 population figures for
individual cities, not their metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Moretti of TRIP acknowledged late Thursday that he did not
realize that information he used was based on individual city
populations.
</P>
<P>
   TRIP reported accurately that Kansas City's traffic-related
deaths in 1997 _ the latest year for which the federal data are
available _ calculated to 18.8 deaths per 100,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   That is high, but the federal numbers show that Memphis and
Nashville were higher with 20.1 and 19.6 per 100,000, respectively.
Oklahoma City, with 18.5 per 100,000, would rank just below Kansas
City, but it is not on TRIP's list, either.
</P>
<P>
   Moretti said those cities were not included because their metro
areas were not believed to have 1 million population, which he said
was an arbitrary cutoff made by the organization. But current
almanacs list the 1996 metro area populations of all four cities as
above 1 million, and the individual city populations of all four as
well below 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The TRIP study ranked the 10 worst cities as Kansas City (1),
Tampa-St. Petersburg (2), Phoenix (3), Detroit (4), Dallas (5),
Atlanta (6), Miami (7), Denver (8), St. Louis (9) and Las Vegas
(10). The federal highway statistics rank the 10 worst cities among
the 60 biggest cities as Memphis (1), Nashville (2), Kansas City
(3), Oklahoma City (4), Tampa (5), Phoenix (6), Detroit (7),
Newark, N.J. (8), Dallas (9) and Atlanta (10).
</P>
<P>
   Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, said she had not seen the TRIP report, but she
noted that any study of highway safety should ideally be done over
time rather than during a single year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of fatalities can vary widely from year to year.
Kansas City's records show 81 fatalities in 1997 and 68 in 1998. So
far this year, the city has logged 12 fatalities compared with 16
at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the city's high traffic-death rate could
be because, at 322 square miles, it is one of the largest cities in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers offered a variety of reasons for the
fatality count.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Police Officer Craig Schultz said the top reason he
sees for fatality wrecks is excessive speed. Impairment from drugs
or alcohol ranks second, he said, followed by failure to wear seat
belts and inattention.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Officer Erich Hellerich said his biggest complaint
about dangerous drivers is that they change lanes at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they lose control of their vehicle,'' he said. ``That's a
big problem I see. If people would slow down a little bit, they'd
have a better chance of getting where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Doug Alexander of the Missouri Highway Patrol said many
drivers never check their rear-view mirrors, even when changing
lanes. He said driver inattention was the most cited reason for
fatality wrecks statewide in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander recommended drivers increase the following distance
between their vehicle and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should always be thinking, `What can I do if an accident
happens in front of me? Will I be able to stop? Will I be able to
change lanes?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cites improper lane use and speeding as the most
common factors in roadway deaths nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The organization promotes seat-belt use, strengthening
enforcement against drunken driving and encouraging drivers to stay
calm and avoid aggressive behavior. TRIP also promotes building
safer highways by widening lanes and shoulders, adding lanes and
medians and improving intersections.
</P>
<P>
   But some suggest that more and better highways themselves may be
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeways entice people to go faster,'' said Craig Volland,
conservation chairman of the Kansas Chapter of the Sierra Club.
``If you develop a really good public transit system you would also
save lives. People would get off the highways.''
</P>
<P>
   Rochman of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety agreed.
She said cities with effective mass transit systems tend to have
lower traffic fatality rates.

CITY OFFICIALS ARE NEGLECTING THEIR CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ If the primary rationale for having
governments is to help ensure the orderly existence and welfare of
the citizenry, Leawood's city government appears prepared to defy a
critical justification for its existence.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent unwillingness of the Leawood City Council to
expedite a proposal from neighboring Overland Park to widen Nall
Avenue from Interstate 435 to 119th Street threatens to jeopardize
the quality of life and the economic fortunes of its city in
particular and that area of Johnson County in general.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, if that's the appropriate characterization, is the
corporate headquarters campus under construction by Sprint near
119th Street and Nall.
</P>
<P>
   When it's fully operational in three years or so, it will
represent the creation of a city of some 14,000 souls and all the
infrastructure burdens such a huge development implies.
</P>
<P>
   The main roadways in the neighborhood already are at critical
mass during peak traffic hours. After Sprint's company town within
the city of Overland Park becomes a reality, gridlock will become a
horrendous fact of life unless the main adjacent roads are upgraded
to handle what promises to be a potentially paralyzing increase in
traffic day, night and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Leawood council members Monday rejected a cost-sharing proposal
aimed at speeding up the widening of the road separating the two
cities. While council members acknowledged its necessity, there was
concern about Overland Park's greater economic benefit from the
Sprint development and the need for county participation.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the citizenry's pocketbook is no doubt a legitimate
government responsibility, but so is protecting the citizenry's
quality of personal and commercial life.
</P>
<P>
   One council member tried to justify the council's intransigence
by contending Sprint's development ``does precious little for
Leawood but add congestion to Nall Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   That not only is a stunningly mistaken perspective, but it also
ignores the fact that increasing congestion on Nall poses a
precious lot of hassle for nearby Leawood residents and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economic benefit of Sprint's arrival to the
neighborhood will not be restricted to commercial interests west of
Nall. Town Center Plaza in Leawood, for instance, will get a
tremendous boost from its new neighbors. Second, refusing to do as
much as possible to help alleviate Nall's inevitable congestion
problems would amount to nonfeasance of office by Leawood
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In short, failure to act as expeditiously as possible to ensure
smooth traffic flows in the area would do egregious damage to the
daily lives of Leawood residents who work, live, shop and recreate
in the area. This is true regardless of which city ultimately gets
the most economic benefit from the development, and it's the duty
of Leawood's government to respond to the reality of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it do to tarry too long while trying to cut a better
deal. Three years isn't a long time in the road-building business,
and any delay that caused construction to overlap with Sprint's
occupancy would be justification for Leawoodians to run those
responsible out of town on a rail.

 &HT;    Elizabeth Dole confirms presidency exploration
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elizabeth Dole confirmed in Atlanta on Friday her
plans to form a committee to explore her potential presidential
candidacy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dole spoke to a luncheon crowd of 1,200 celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the Atlanta Women's Network at the Marriott Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   She had her mostly female audience chuckling at anecdotes about
her experiences on the campaign trail in 1996. Although her talk
was about women in the workplace, she made subtle references to her
political ambitions throughout the speech, confirming her interest
in a presidential campaign in response to a question after she left
the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman's style of management _ mediation, negotiation,
listening and communicating _ skills and values our country needs
most at this time ... makes women perfect for political life,''
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole will set up the exploratory committee in Iowa on Wednesday,
then travel to Nevada, Arizona, and New Hampshire before returning
to her hometown of Salisbury, N.C., to announce her decision on a
presidential candidacy. She said she would have to raise $20
million by the end of the year, and at least one supporter wrote a
check and gave it to her on the spot.

KANSAS STUDENTS SCORE ABOVE NATIONAL AVERAGE ON READING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas pupils logged some of the highest
scores in the country on a national reading test given last winter,
the state Board of Education announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's first participation in the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, Kansas fourth- and eighth-graders scored
significantly above the national average in reading comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in 39 states, including Missouri, took part in the test,
overseen by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for
Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas fourth-graders scored 222 out of 500, tying with those in
Colorado and Minnesota for eighth nationally. Eighth-graders scored
268, ranking fifth, behind Maine, Connecticut, Montana and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri fourth-graders scored 216, tying for 20th with West
Virginia and New York. Eighth-graders scored 263, ranking 15th.
Both grades scored slightly above the national average. For fourth
grade, the national average was 215. For eighth grade, the national
average was 261.
</P>
<P>
   The results reinforce efforts the Kansas Board of Education has
made to bolster student reading skills, said Linda Holloway,
chairwoman of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are working,'' said Holloway, of Shawnee, Kan. ``Kansas
has been aiming for high standards and focusing in on our
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   And some local school officials said the results prove what
they've been saying for five years: Kansas students are improving
and fare as well or better than students in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always need to improve,'' said Beverly Nichols, assessment
coordinator for the Shawnee Mission School District, based in
Overland Park, Kan. ``But we shouldn't be discouraged. We really
are doing a good job as a state.''
</P>
<P>
   The state board, for example, has mandated diagnostic reading
tests for second-graders to gauge how well pupils are learning to
read. The tests will be given for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   One area the state board is concentrating on is closing the
achievement gap between poor students and their better-off peers,
Holloway said. Although minority and lower-income Kansas pupils
scored higher on the test than similar pupils around the country,
their scores were lower than those of white Kansas pupils who took
the test. That echoes results of the 1998 Kansas assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials viewed the test results as steady, with
little statistical difference between the reading scores this year
and those from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri schools have participated in the test since 1992, said
Jim Friedebach, director of assessments for the Missouri Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education.
</P>
<P>
   Although Missouri's overall scores are slightly lower than
Kansas', they are not statistically different, said Cherie Mercer,
an assessment specialist with the Kansas Department of Education.
The margin of error for the test overall was five points, Mercer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500,000 pupils across the country took the test last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The exam followed a format used when the test was previously
given, in 1992 and 1994, to allow comparisons. Pupils had 50
minutes to read passages and answer questions, both multiple-choice
and written response.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, fourth- and eighth-graders from 160 of the state's
1,500 public schools took the test. In each grade, about 1,500
pupils were tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Board of Education agreed in 1997 to participate in
the national test. Some board members had said the results would
allow Kansas to compare itself with other states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics had decried the test's costs, which officials had
estimated at $60,000 for materials. Those costs went down
considerably in 1998 when the federal government paid for
materials, leaving local districts to pay for administering the
test.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, participation was voluntary. Some districts, such as
De Soto, declined to give it, citing other tests, including the
state assessments, that keep teachers and students from regular
classwork.

CHANNEL CATFISH NEARER DESIGNATION AS KANSAS' STATE FISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The channel catfish, a favorite of anglers, is on
its way to becoming the official Kansas state fish, thanks to the
urging of seventh-graders in the town of Olpe.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Kansas House gave first-round approval to
legislation giving the official designation to Ictalurus punctatus,
the scientific name for the whiskered channel cat. The preliminary
vote was 66-42, with final House action set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The channel catfish has caught on,'' said Rep. Peggy Long, a
Hamilton Republican who is the lone sponsor of the bill. ``I've
received over 200 letters in support of the channel catfish and
only one against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the bill become law, on July 1 the fish will find its
place on the state's official list naming the buffalo as state
animal; sunflower, state flower; ``Home on the Range,'' state song;
ornate box turtle, state reptile; honeybee, state insect;
cottonwood, state tree; meadowlark, state bird; and barred tiger
salamander, state amphibian.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren were responsible for persuading the Legislature
to give the official designation to the honeybee, ornate box turtle
and barred tiger salamander.
</P>
<P>
   The students from Olpe, about 10 miles south of Emporia, did a
little personal lobbying before the debate began.
</P>
<P>
   Long distributed fliers with pictures of channel catfish, each
with a personalized note from an Olpe student.
</P>
<P>
   On one of them, Rachel Farr reminded lawmakers that ``a channel
cat eats little fish so there's not so many in lakes, streams and
ponds.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beam, chief of hatcheries for the state, is in charge of
replenishing the channel catfish in state waters as fishermen fill
their stringers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state hatcheries produced more than a million 3- to
6-inch fingerlings. At the same time, 205,000 channel cats between
10 inches and 11 inches were released, mostly in state fishing
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic strain of channel catfish reared in the state is
known nationally as the Kansas strain, and it results in
fast-growing and relatively disease-resistant fish, Beam said.
</P>
<P>
   The channel cat is the most popular fish among Kansas anglers
after the large-mouthed bass.
</P>
<P>
   As the House began debating their bill, Pat Stevenson's
seventh-graders from Olpe Middle School watched from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone supported the push for the channel cat. Rep. Bob
Tomlinson, a Roeland Park Republican, said such legislation costs
taxpayers money and clutters the statute books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we stand up and be responsible and deal only with
the state's business,'' he said. ``To the young people in the
balcony, I say I'm a schoolteacher and used to saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   But later in the debate, Rep. John Toplikar, an Olathe
Republican, came to the bill's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of an artsy thing, a cultural thing,'' he
said of the channel cat designation. ``I really do like arts and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the catfish. I like catfish.''

SOLVING INDONESIA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS NOT GETTING ANY EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With riots raging in one of Indonesia's
provinces and a bruising election just four months away, it's clear
that nursing this economically ruined country back to health will
not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to overhaul Indonesia's devastated banking system
have discouraged even the most hardened realists, who say the
convoluted events of this last week are a telling example of why
the country will take so long to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the government was supposed to announce a
landmark step in bank system rehabilitation _ shutting down 38
banks and rescuing dozens of others with fresh capital. But at the
last minute, President B.J. Habibie postponed the decision for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of that announcement caught even the finance minister
and the central bank governor by surprise. And it has led to a
storm of criticism that Habibie is catering to politically
connected bankers, who had lobbied for the delay because their
banks were likely to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 months after a collapsing economy and violent social
unrest toppled President Suharto, people here say Suharto-style
cronyism is now stalling the recovery of the world's fourth most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fall of Suharto, you might have expected that
Suharto-isms would be reduced,'' said Rizal Ramli, a prominent
economist. ``But it hasn't worked out that way. The game is the
same; only the players have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials deny that political favoritism played a
part in the delay. The governor of Indonesia's central bank,
Syahril Sabirin, said in an interview that some banks did not have
enough time to submit business plans to the government. He said it
would have been unfair to close those banks without giving them the
chance to raise enough capital to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sabirin said he understood why outsiders might be
suspicious of the government's motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I think I understand that very well,'' he said,
``because for one thing, it is kind of unfortunate that one of the
concerned parties in this process is a member of the president's
resilience council.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabirin was referring to Aburizal Bakrie, a prominent banker who
sits on an economic recovery council led by Habibie. Bakrie did not
deny that he lobbied on behalf of his bank, PT Bank Nusa Nasional,
which analysts said was scheduled to be closed in the Saturday
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with a local newspaper, Business Indonesia,
Bakrie scoffed at the suggestion that a single business executive
could delay a major government decision. Banking executives here
said that in the last few days, Bank Nusa Nasional had raised
enough capital to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's plan, it would carve bad loans out of the
banks and inject $34 billion in fresh capital into them. But first,
it would weed out banks that are hopelessly indebted.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid closing, the banks must prove they can increase their
capital to 4 percent of their total assets. The government would
provide 80 percent of the funds to do that. But the banks must
raise the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such extensive government support, that is an
impossible task for many Indonesian banks. Most potential investors
in Indonesia are insolvent, while foreign investors continue to
spurn the country because of fears about political uncertainty and
social unrest before the June elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fundamental fork in the road for this
government,'' said Mark E. Hansen, a managing director at Booz
Allen &AMP; Hamilton in Jakarta. ``They could have nationalized the
entire banking system, or they could try to maintain minority
private ownership in the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   By preserving stakes for the existing owners, Jakarta hopes to
reduce its exposure to bad loans. With more than 60 percent of all
Indonesian bank loans unlikely ever to be repaid, banking analysts
estimate the total amount of bad loans in this country at close to
$33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But by choosing winners and losers, the government has
politicized the process and dredged up ethnic animosities.
Indigenous Indonesians, known as pribumis, harshly criticized the
government earlier this year when it agreed to recapitalize Lippo
Bank, a bank controlled by James Riady, a prominent ethnic Chinese
tycoon. Riady is also known for his ties to the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the ethnic Chinese-owned banks had better access to
capital than the banks owned by pribumis, because the Chinese banks
were larger and were often part of even-larger conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the original deal, the big banks owned by the Chinese
would have been recapitalized, while the smaller pribumi-owned
banks would have been shut down,'' said Umar Juoro, an economic
adviser to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Politics colors the government's decisions in another way.
Shutting 38 banks would throw an estimated 20,000 people out of
work. Political analysts said Habibie was loath to raise the number
of jobless people prior to an election _ especially since they may
take their grievances to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this is one factor which worries us,'' Sabirin
said. ``But the other alternative would be much harder for the
economy. So we have to make these decisions, although they are very
difficult.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the fear of causing panic among Indonesia's
depositors. The last time Jakarta announced a widespread closing of
banks, in April 1998, it resulted in runs on banks throughout the
country, and contributed to a perception that Indonesia was in an
economic death spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Sabirin said Indonesia would not repeat that experience because
the central bank now guaranteed all deposits. ``Once we complete
this process,'' he said, ``the economy will be able to begin its
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Jakarta must convince skeptics it is still
committed to reform. The government's explanation for the delay was
rejected by the deputy chairman of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency. And it elicited clucks of disapproval from
the International Monetary Fund, which is holding back the next $1
billion of its $43 billion rescue package for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the IMF said the government had shown a ``lack
of clarity'' in reporting on its overhaul of the banks. ``This is
certainly something we thought would be worked out by now,'' said
the spokesman, Vasuki Shastry.

BAKER IS A TOP MOTIVATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ From his perch atop a mini-tower behind home
plate, San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker has an excellent
view of the team's spring training practice field. He can monitor
his pitchers as they stretch their arms. He can watch his hitters
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, Baker has a podium where can remind his
troops _ in no uncertain terms _ that they are in spring training
to work, not goof around. There is precious little time to mold
what he calls his ``blue-collar team.'' They must prepare
themselves for the long haul. With a $45 million payroll ceiling,
these players can't expect help from a blockbuster trade or a
high-priced free agent. That's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major difference between mid-salary teams and the
high-salary teams comes down to your pitching staff and your
bench,'' said Baker, who was National League manager of the year in
1993. ``That's why what we do here is important. With high-salary
teams, if you make a mistake in evaluating a player you can cover
it with another high-priced player in the middle of the season. We
just don't have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be scary. You can be playing your butt off but then
somebody goes out and picks up some high-priced dudes. Average
teams can't do that. We spend a whole lot of time working
physically in spring training because we know we can't sustain the
injuries that others can.''
</P>
<P>
   With the payroll limitations, Baker and his Giants stress being
prepared. Sure, they have Barry Bonds, who will make $22.9 million
in the next two years. But the rest of the team must overachieve,
which is something most clubs managed by Baker seem to do. Last
year, the Giants trailed in the NL wild-card race by five games
with 10 to play. Yet they managed to force a one-game playoff
against the Chicago Cubs, who won, 5-3, at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have rallied around Baker, whose 472-436 record in
six years puts him second on the team's all-time list behind Roger
Craig (586-566). Baker drew praise in 1997 when San Francisco
became only the fourth team to go from last place to a division
title in consecutive seasons. But elimination by the Florida
Marlins in the division playoffs followed by a second-place finish
in the NL West last season has created doubts about a team that
some feel is losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how quickly people forget the near-misses of a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why this is so,'' said Baker, ``but I
don't think it really matters. Nobody believed in our pitching and
it turned out to be very good. Nobody believed Jeff Kent was that
good and all he did was hit 31 home runs and drive in 128 runs. And
he missed 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't tell you why. We are in a hell of a division
with the Dodgers, San Diego, Colorado, and now the Diamondbacks.
They suddenly have front-line pitching. Arizona is spending a lot
of money. The Dodgers have pitchers like Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park,
and Ismael Valdes. In fact, there's good pitching on every club in
the division.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody in Giants country is counting the team out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff like this can actually motivate you,'' Baker said. ``I
don't think people who say we're underdogs have factored how much
desire and team play counts into the equation. We have more
individual accomplishments and more great players than just Barry
Bonds. We're a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear anybody complaining about a lack of respect,
although we know it's out there. We don't make predictions. We go
out and play good baseball. We're a blue-collar type team. We
understand that it is rare that blue-collar teams get credit.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Bonds, 34, is still the heart and soul
of San Francisco. The three-time MVP batted .303 with 37 home runs
and 122 RBIs last season. He will start the season as the only
player with at least 400 career home runs (411) and 400 career
stolen bases (445). The Giants will have respect as long as he's
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pay attention to other people's opinions,'' said
Bonds, who arrived in camp a week early. ``It's just the view of
those who get to pick. That's gambling, like going to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we good enough? I don't know. Are we the best on paper?
No. But as to how good we are, that's something that will be
determined by us. The clubhouse is relaxed. We like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have decent, but certainly not overpowering,
pitching. The starting rotation includes Mark Gardner (13-6), Shawn
Estes (7-12), Kirk Rueter (16-9), and Russ Ortiz (4-4). With Orel
Hershiser gone, veteran Trevor Wilson is back for another tour and
has the early nod as the fifth starter. General manager Brian
Sabean won't rule out a trade, possibly involving outfielder Stan
Javier, for another pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, who has provided tremendous power for a middle infielder,
must stay healthy. On June 10, the Giants were in first place with
a 41-24 record. Then Kent went on the disabled list, missing 24
games with a sprained ankle. When Kent returned, following the
All-Star break, the Giants trailed San Diego by five games. They
finished second, 9 1/2 games behind the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's everyday lineup, save Bonds and Kent, won't intimidate
anyone. You see names like Marvin Benard, Billy Mueller, J.T. Snow,
Rich Aurilia, and Charlie Hayes and you wonder how San Francisco
won 89 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this team is never picked to win,'' said former
Red Sox outfielder Ellis Burks, who was dealt to the Giants at the
trading deadline last season and re-signed with the team, ``they
always seem to be right there at the end of the season. I don't
know if it's a case of a manager getting the most out of his
players or not. I know he has a great relationship with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is motivated. When I was at Colorado, we played them
and they'd come in and kick our butts. We're serious. But whenever
you come into the clubhouse you find a loose atmosphere. Everyone
gets along.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the point, said Baker. A happy clubhouse is usually a
healthy clubhouse. And a healthy clubhouse is a key to the Giants'
fortunes. San Francisco had 16 players make a total of 22 trips to
the disabled list in 1996, when it finished fourth (68-94).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years we're among the lowest three in
time lost by players to the DL,'' said Baker. ``If you can stay
healthy, you're much better off. Now I'm playing my front line
against your second-line team.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good we are? Most times you don't know until later. The
late Al Campanis used to tell me as a player that you don't know
how good you are until you go around the league one time. It's not
always there on paper. Sometimes it's about continuity. Other
times, it's about how you play together and how the guys accept
their roles on the team. It's all part of having a good season.''

DOW JONES UP 3 PERCENT ON JOBS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors pushed the stock market index up 268.68 points to an
all-time high Friday in reaction to a federal jobs report for
February that indicated inflation would remain tame.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial index of stocks rose nearly 3 percent,
closing at a record 9736.08 _ less than 300 points shy of the
elusive 10,000 mark. Friday's gains were on top of the market's
191-point rise on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Friday's rise occurred in the first half-hour of trading
when the market shot up in reaction to a report by the Labor
Department showing that the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 4.4
percent in February, from 4.3 percent in January, and that wage
inflation was extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been concerned that the Federal Reserve might be
forced to raise interest rates to cool things down. The economy
grew at a scorching 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's steady as you go,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist for
BankBoston Corp. ``The economy continues to expand, with few signs
of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an uptick in the unemployment rate, the economy
continued to generate jobs at a steady clip. Another 275,000 people
were added to the employment rolls in February.
</P>
<P>
   But other data contained in the government's report signaled to
Wall Street that inflation was under control. Most important to
investors, average wages increased last month by only 1 cent, to
$13.04 an hour. Economists said wage inflation _ 3.6 percent over
the past year _ is now lower than it was last spring.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of moderation, the government revised downward
its estimate of job growth in January. It had first reported a gain
of 245,000 jobs in January but said that just 217,000 jobs were
created.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the Labor Department's report ``is good,'' said
Robert Mellman, senior economist at J.P. Morgan, a New York
investment banking firm. ``If you're working in a factory, it's not
so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, manufacturing continued to shrink, shedding 50,000 jobs
in February. In the aftermath of a global financial crisis that has
crippled America's trading partners in Asia, employment at US
aircraft, industrial machinery and other manufacturing plants has
dropped 337,000 jobs since March.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case all year, lower factory employment last
month was more than offset by strong gains throughout the economy.
Construction and retail growth were especially strong for this time
of year, due to an unusually mild winter across much of the
country, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry added 72,000 jobs in February; retail
added 123,000 jobs, the government said. The service industry, a
primary source of jobs in the eight-year economic expansion, added
87,000 jobs last month, slightly fewer than the industry has gained
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication the economy has lost any momentum,''
said Denis McSweeney, regional commissioner of the government's
Bureau of Labor Statisti cs.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney said the economy in the past three months has produced
jobs at a rate that far exceeds last year's rate: 269,000 jobs were
added each month, on average, in December, January and February,
compared with 224,000 monthly job growth during the first 10 months
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment rates among minority workers, which had hit new
lows in January, were virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tight labor market, wages, which can drive up
inflation throughout the economy, ``have dropped back down to where
they were in July 1997,'' said Jonathan Francis, head of global
investment strategy for Putnam Investments, a Boston mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much better than that,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that the wage report was the single most
important explanation for Friday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Investors registered their glee immediately. Within half an hour
of opening at 9:30 a.m., the Dow rocketed up 205.38 points, or 2.1
percent, and surpassed its Jan. 8 record close of 9643.32. For the
week, the Dow was up 429.50 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market also rallied. The bellwether, long-term Treasury
bond posted its best day since last October. Yields on the 30-year
Treasury declined 10 basis points to 5.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing is driving both those markets,'' Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market analysts said stock-market rallies are becoming
increasingly confined to Blue Chip stocks _ possibly making the
entire market more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the economy is still strong,'' said
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
But he is concerned about weakness in the corporate sector, which
is unable to raise its prices. ``Profits are weak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was reflected in much higher share prices for
Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co. and Wal-Mart Stores, widening
the disparity between performance of large-company stocks and that
of small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The broad Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 28.83, or 2.3
percent, closing at 1,275.47. But the Russell 2000 index of small
stocks rose 3.99 point, or 1 percent, to 398.01.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock index, which is heavily represented by
technology stocks, rose 44.22 percent, or 2 percent, to 2337.11.
Shares of International Business Machines Corp. had a good day,
rising 7 3/8 to 178 3/8. On Thursday, IBM announced an agreement to
sell $16 billion worth of disks and other computer components to
Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, a stock rally had stumbled in part because a
report of unexpectedly-strong economic growth in the fourth quarter
drove bond yields and general interest rates higher. Those fears
were reinforced in recent testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, that he was watching for signs of inflation.

S&AMP;P CUTS BOND RATINGS OF HARVARD PILGRIM HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a sign of hard financial times at New England's
largest health maintenance organization, Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care's bond ratings were downgraded by Standard &AMP; Poor's, one of
the nation's premier bond rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Harvard Pilgrim officials Friday said the HMO
is expected to report net losses in excess of $35 million on
revenue of about $2.8 billion for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The downgrade, from A-minus to BBB, could boost the interest
rate Harvard Pilgrim must pay on future borrowing, but does not
affect the interest rates it pays on current debt. While the new
rating is considered ``investment grade,'' it also reflects less
confidence in the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   In lowering Harvard Pilgrim's credit rating, Standard &AMP; Poor's
in New York cited poor earnings over the last two years, which have
eroded the company's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operating loss will reduce capital adequacy below levels
considered good,'' wrote Jack Reichman, director of insurance
rating services at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim says it has taken measures to control costs and
intends to break even this year. One of the measures included a
layoff of 100 employees last year that swept out some senior
managers, including Dr. Patrick Mattingly, who was widely regarded
as the No. 2 executive at Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Reichman commended the HMO for moving swiftly to cut costs.
Still, Reichman called Harvard Pilgrim's outlook ``negative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A return to profitability is not expected until 2000, but the
operating environment is expected to remain intensely competitive
and some uncertainty remains as to the ability of the company to
reach its target margins by 2000,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's financial woes stem from simple math: the HMO
spent more than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, medical expenses soared, particularly
pharmaceutical drug spending, which grew between 15 percent and 17
percent last year, according to Dr. Joseph Dorsey, Harvard
Pilgrim's corporate medical director. Drugs are close to one-fifth
of Harvard Pilgrim's total spending for health care.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Harvard Pilgrim was unable to make up the
difference with higher revenue because it was locked into contracts
that called for just 3 percent increase in premiums on average.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey said the company was taking steps to return to financial
health, including raising premiums between 6 percent and 8 percent
on average. The HMO is also monitoring more closely its sicker
patients and performing more preventive care that would save money
in the long run, Dorsey said. To control drug spending, Harvard
Pilgrim is considering a possibility of implementing a three-tier
copayment plan to encourage the use of less costly but equally
effective drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company said no additional layoffs are expected.

  WASHINGTON _ In the initial skirmishes last year over how to
allocate potentially huge federal budget surpluses, President
Clinton triumphed by casting himself as the prudent protector of
Social Security against irresponsible Republican tax cutters.

   Now Republican leaders have taken a shot at turning that dynamic
on its head. Putting aside more than a year of squabbling among
themselves, they presented a broad budget outline on Thursday that
will almost certainly prove impossible to turn into detailed
legislation but that gives the party a unified set of principles
with which to face the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Republican approach is a pledge to be even
purer than Clinton when it comes to Social Security. The Republican
plan would end the long-standing practice by Congress and
successive administrations of spending money earmarked for the
retirement system and instead would set it aside either to be used
in any plan to shore up the system's finances or to reduce the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   By taking Social Security out of the equation, Republicans hope,
they no longer have to worry that tax cuts will be portrayed as
benefitting the wealthy at the expense of the elderly. At last,
they say, they have a shot at neutralizing an issue that has played
to the political advantage of Democrats since Franklin D. Roosevelt
signed Social Security into law 64 years ago and that Clinton has
used with particularly skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've escaped from the box Bill Clinton built for us,'' a
senior Republican aide said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. Or at least, not completely.
</P>
<P>
   The White House pivoted neatly on Friday and turned the debate
to whether Republicans were now doing enough to ensure that
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and a
political touchstone second only to Social Security, could weather
the aging of the population. (There is plenty in their plan for
Medicare, Republicans responded.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biggest legislative battles are still ahead,
especially the fight over whether Social Security should be remade
to include private investment accounts, as most Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Republican budget framework, however effective and
appealing in the abstract, could face difficulties when it comes to
putting it into the form of a budget resolution _ the tax and
spending guideline that Congress plans to vote on within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing problem for Republicans is that their plan
will require deep domestic cuts to live up to the party's pledge to
stick to strict spending limits imposed by the 1997 bipartisan
budget deal. That is ground on which Republicans have fought
several times and lost _ badly _ since they won control of Congress
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Belt tightening makes sense to many Republicans as a negotiating
position across the table from a president who has repeatedly
outfoxed them to win financing for political and policy priorities.
But there is limited enthusiasm within the party for wading back
into an ideological battle over the size of government.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans, who hold the key to passing the party's
legislation, are especially wary of such a fight. And Republicans
on the appropriations committees, which have to pass specific
spending bills, said the budget outline left them in an impossible
situation, since they see no realistic way to remain with the
spending caps while also accommodating calls from within their own
party for increased spending on the military and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's some magic way to make it work,'' said one
Republican aide to the House appropriations committee. ``If so,
we're eager to hear what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would also make it difficult to enact a
sizable tax cut for next year, a goal that only a month ago the
party considered non-negotiable. Taking Social Security revenues
out of the budget equation will leave the federal government
running a $5 billion deficit next year, according to the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   There are various ways of paying for a moderate tax cut next
year, including closing loopholes or cutting the capital gains tax
rate, a step that paradoxically increases revenues for the first
year or two as investors rush to sell stocks that have appreciated
in value. But Republicans said their secret weapon when it comes to
tax cuts is the economy, which continues to grow faster than
expected and therefore to generate more tax revenue than the budget
office has so far recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said on Friday that the party's leadership
expected the projection of a deficit (not counting Social Security)
for next year to be transformed into a sizable surplus by the time
Congress turns to writing a tax bill this summer. Such a surplus,
one House aide said, would provide enough money both to ease the
pressure on the spending limits and enact the first phase of what
would grow to be a substantial tax cut over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has become clear is that surplus politics could
be just as bitter and complicated as deficit politics were over the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``GOP Stops Clinton Raid on Social Security,'' proclaimed the
headline on a statement on Friday from Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a presidential
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials praised the Republicans for agreeing to
save a big portion of the surplus for Social Security. But
administration officials are confident of their ability to hold the
fiscal high ground by concentrating their attacks on the vagueness
of Republicans when it comes to providing new money for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think of something that would be more
irresponsible fiscal policy,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House
economic policy director, than to commit all of the projected
surpluses ``to other things when we know Medicare is running out of
money in 2008.''

BRITISH DECRY US TRADE SANCTIONS IN BANANA DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bill Clinton-Tony Blair love-in is officially over,
all because of bananas.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the US ambassador to Britain,
Philip Lader, was summoned to Whitehall Friday so a government
minister could express Britain's outrage over Washington's decision
to impose trade sanctions on 14 European products, launching a new
offensive in an escalating trade war over bananas. Before Thursday,
no US ambassador in memory had ever been subjected here to such
diplomatic humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Blair government has been the Clinton administration's
staunchest ally over the last two years, and the only one willing
to join in the bombing of Iraq, Anglo-American relations have been
rocked by the banana dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who also was the one leader who went out of his way to
support Clinton when the president's position looked vulnerable
because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, has been trying to persuade
Clinton to lift the trade sanctions. So far, it appears, Blair is
getting nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is especially sensitive for the prime minister,
who has positioned himself as the chief mediator between Washington
and other European leaders, who are far more suspicious of American
motives in trade and foreign policy. On Tuesday, during a speech in
Italy, Blair had urged the 11 other socialist leaders of European
Union nations to emulate the American economic system as a way to
stimulate job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's anger with the Clinton administration is only the most
dramatic example of what has been an especially bad week for
Washington in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, and especially the Italian people, are
outraged that a US military court acquitted the US Marine pilot
whose jet severed the cables of a gondola in Italy last year,
plunging 20 people to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, meanwhile, is furious over the refusal of
Arizona officials to halt the executions of two German brothers who
died in the gas chamber last week for the 1982 murder of an Arizona
bank manager. Arizona officials ignored a personal plea by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to spare their lives. Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin, Germany's justice minister, described the
executions as ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Germans favor the World Trade Organization
ruling that the European Union has given unfair preferential
treatment to bananas grown in former British and French colonies,
because opening the market would mean lower prices for consumers.
But the European Union as a whole is standing against the American
complaint that the European quotas restrict free trade of bananas
grown by American firms in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, arguing a case that is important mostly to the
British and French, and to a lesser extent the Irish, who have a
company that ships bananas, say they have a moral obligation to buy
the bananas from former colonies even if they are more expensive.
The Americans say this is nonsense and consider it a clear
violation of free trade provisions. The retaliatory trade sanctions
imposed by the Americans, meanwhile, apply to luxury products from
all across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are angered that the Clinton administration did
not wait for a pending WTO ruling, expected sometime between March
15 and April 12, on whether recent changes to European import
regulations went far enough to assuage American complaints about
the quota system.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the dispute over bananas is minor. The 100 percent
tariffs imposed by the United States, which would double the cost
of things such as cashmere sweaters from Scotland, Louis Vuitton
handbags from France and pecorino cheese from Italy, affect about
$500 million out of the annual $400 billion in trade between the
European Union and United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the political row it has touched off, especially between
Britain and the United States, threatens longstanding relations and
alliances that are far more important than bananas and Parma ham,
another of the imports targeted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, coincidentally, US officials and their European
allies are to meet in France to resume their suspended attempts to
end the fighting in Kosovo. The Europeans are already less
enthusiastic than the Americans about using force to pressure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into accepting an agreement,
a rift that can only be widened by an escalating trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that foreign policy and trade are not connected
should consider the agenda of a meeting scheduled for Sunday
between US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook. At the top of the agenda, say Foreign
Office officials, is the trade war _ not Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British are especially angry at the Americans because
Washington's trade sanctions jeopardize at least 3,000 jobs in
British industries such as cashmere, cookies, and car batteries,
which have nothing to do with bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, the British minister in charge of trade, called
the US sanctions ``irrational and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lader, meanwhile, is trying to put the best spin on the
confrontation with Byers, whom he calls a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about bananas,'' said Lader. ``It's about playing by
the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the dispute over bananas, meanwhile, are perhaps
even more difficult disputes over the European refusal to allow
imports from America of genetically modified food and beef from
hormone-fed cattle. The Americans, meanwhile, complain that the
European Union subsidizes manufacture of the popular Airbus
jetliners, chief rival to Boeing's planes. In that dispute, the
Americans are threatening to bar landings by the Concorde
supersonic jet that flies from London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It also irks the Europeans that the Clinton administration is
pursuing its banana campaign at the behest of Chicquita boss Carl
Lindner, the Cincinnati businessman who has made generous campaign
contributions to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, political observers here are calling this the lowest
point in Anglo-American relations since 1994, when then-Prime
Minister John Major was furious after Clinton granted a visa to
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams so Adams could make a publicity trip
to the United States. Major, whose government at the time was
trying to get Adams to renounce violence in exchange for perks such
as traveling to the US, was so angry that he refused to take
Clinton's phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Blair is doing the opposite, calling Clinton
repeatedly, looking for political payback for his record of support
for US foreign policy.

 &HT;    FLORIDA SENATOR MACK WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION
 &HT;    390&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, the third-ranking
Republican in the Senate, will not seek re-election next year,
sources close to the senator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, 58, chairman of the Republican Senate Conference, began
calling friends and relatives Friday and is expected to make a
formal announcement of his decision in Fort Myers, his home town,
on March 13. Mack is beginning his 11th year in the Senate. ``He
simply feels it is time to move on,'' said one source, who asked
not to be identified. ``It was a personal decision not to run. It
was a decision he and Priscilla have come to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack will join Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey and Richard Bryan of Nevada _ all
Democrats _ on the list of incumbents who won't seek re-election
next year. So far, Mack is the only Republican who won't be running
again, although Sen. William Roth of Delaware has hinted he will
not seek another term.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate. Because 19
Republicans face re-election in 2000 compared to only 14 Democrats,
observers see a chance that Democrats could regain control of the
chamber in that election.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said neither Mack nor his wife, Priscilla, is in ill
health, and that their health was not a factor in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mack and his wife have both suffered from cancer, which killed
his brother and both his parents. Mack had a melanoma removed from
his side shortly after coming to the Senate, and his wife underwent
a mastectomy for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Both have led efforts to boost spending for medical research,
and his wife has been an advocate of preventive screenings for
breast cancer. Their daughter has survived cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mack does not have any plans for what he will do after he
retires, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Mack spoke with Friday afternoon was Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has been Mack's closest friend in
the capital since he was a newly elected congressman in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Wilson, executive director of the Republican Party of
Florida, said ``this was obviously a very difficult decision that
the senator and Mrs. Mack came to. They decided it's time to do
something different with their life. Senator Mack is an outstanding
senator from Florida, and we look forward to working with him until
his term is complete.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A banker whose full name is Cornelius MacGillicuddy III, Mack
had virtually universal name recognition in Florida as the grandson
of baseball Hall of Famer and former Philadelphia Athletics
owner-manager Connie Mack. His maternal grandfather was Morris
Sheppard, a Democratic senator from Texas from 1913 to 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Some attribute Mack's political success to the decision of
another popular Senate incumbent not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after three terms in the House, Mack announced his
intention to challenge Sen. Lawton Chiles, then nearing the end of
his third term. Shortly after Chiles began campaigning, he made a
stunning withdrawal from the race.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats waged a costly and bitter struggle that
didn't end until mid-October, Mack was quietly stumping the state
and raising money. When Rep. Buddy MacKay emerged as the Democratic
nominee, Mack unleashed a barrage of television ads with the
memorable slogan: ``Hey, Buddy. You're a liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's slogan for himself was ``less taxes, less government,
more freedom.'' Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., stumping on MacKay's
behalf, labeled Mack an ``ideological wacko.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was a cliffhanger that wasn't decided until a
recount. With a boost from absentee ballots, Mack won by less than
1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, after developing a reputation as one of the
Senate's most conservative members _ but with flashes of
unpredictably, such as when he defended the rap group 2 Live Crew
from charges of objectionable lyrics _ Mack was re-elected with 71
percent of the vote. His nearly invisible Democratic opponent was
Hugh Rodham, brother of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mack was on the short list of candidates being
considered by GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole as his running
mate. Mack had been frequently mentioned as a political
ticket-balancer for the Republican candidate in 2000.

   Six years later, after developing a reputation as one of the
Senate's most conservative members _ but with flashes of
unpredictably, such as when he defended the rap group 2 Live Crew
from charges of objectionable lyrics _ Mack was re-elected with 71
percent of the vote. His nearly invisible Democratic opponent was
Hugh Rodham, brother of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mack was on the short list of candidates being
considered by GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole as his running
mate. Mack had been frequently mentioned as a political
ticket-balancer for the Republican candidate in 2000.

<P>
   Ford Motor Co. quietly announced last month that it would be
building the biggest sport utility vehicle yet, the Excursion. The
company adroitly spun the news, announcing to the Saturday papers
that it planned to incorprate into its design some hollow steel
bars below the bumpers, so that in collisions the vehicle won't
routinely ride up over hoods and through the windshields of smaller
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that with a base price of around $50,000,
the Excursion will be the equivalent of a small tank _ more than
three tons of metal, seven feet tall and nearly seven feet wide. At
80 inches, another half an inch would turn it into an extra-wide
vehicle, requiring special running lights.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that, in the seventeenth year of a great asset boom,
we are engaged among ourselves in something of an automotive arms
race. On what scale it is hard to say. Many smart people crave a
Land Rover or a Chevy Suburban and the reasons they give make
sense: to haul the soccer team to matches, to permit the kids to
sleep on long trips, to be safe from injury at the hands of others
driving those huge cars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is impossible to avoid the feeling that their desire to
demonstrate membership in the upper ranks of income has something
to do with it too. Thorstein Veblen coined the term conspicuous
consumption to describe the specular excesses of America's gilded
age at the turn of the last century; today it means getting 10
miles per gallon with a V-10 engine.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the race to drive bigger and bigger autos seems
symptomatic of a subtle and widespread mania involving nearly every
sort of personal consumption good, argues Robert H. Frank,
professor of Economics at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an
Era of Excess,'' Frank reviews the proliferation of top-of the-line
items _ the $5,000 gas grill, the 14,000 square foot house, the
$20,000 wristwatch, the $100 knickers from Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Items for Silicon Valley magnates and Wall Street tycoons? Sure,
says Frank _ but while the spiral in spending patterns may begin
with the rich, it affects low- and middle-income families as well.
No one can escape the effects of changes in the spending evironment
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among other things,'' he writes, ``they affect the kinds of
gifts you must give at weddings and birthdays, and the amounts you
must spend for anniversary dinners; the price you must pay for a
house in a neighborhood with a good school; the size your vehicle
must be if you want your family to be reltively safe from injury;
the kinds of sneakers your children will demand; the universities
they'll need to attend if you want them to face good prospects
after graduation; the kinds of wines you'll want to serve to mark
special occasions; and the kind of suit you'll choose to wear to a
job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism through which the contagion works is the
apparently universal human concern with relative position. On the
propensity for keeping up with the Joneses, Frank quotes no less an
authority than Karl Marx: ``A house may be large or small; as long
as the surrounding houses are equally small, it satisfies all
social demands for a dwelling. But if a palace rises beside the
little house, the little house shrinks into a hut.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx would say that, you snort. But Frank cites a welter of
other evidence, drawn from neoclassical economics and evolutionary
psychology, to buttress his case that concerns about relative
position are deeply ingrained in our thinking about success _ a
deep-rooted and ineradicable element of human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   On this analysis, says Frank, ``both the things we need and the
things available for us to buy depend largely -- beyond some point,
almost entirely -- on the things others choose to buy.'' When
people at the top spend more, so will people in the middle and the
bottom. Once a status race starts, spending patterns may become
wasteful. ``Simpler versions of products that once served perfectly
well often fall by the wayside,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, of course, that one person's waste may be
another's bare necessity. This is hard turf, full of value
judgements, and while it is intuitively obvious that there must be
manias in consumption goods, every bit as much as in share prices
or tulip bulbs, it is hard to know how to guage them without some
sort of a benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what to make of the fact that Frank reports that
the price of a car has risen to an average of around $22,000, 75
percent more than a decade ago? Adjust that price for inflation,
for improvements in comfort, reliability and safety, and it just
could be we are getting more car for less money, not more. And as
for comparing the utility of that go-anywhere automobile to a
well-developed national system of rapid transit? That's anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is one of the leading economists of his generation. (He
was born in 1945.) But he has little patience for measurement
issues like this one. He is not one of the crowd at the National
Bureau of Economic Research, seeking to narrow differences of
opinion through careful empirical work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has made his way with a series of books: ``Choosing
the Right Pond,'' about status; ``Passions Within Reason,''about
the role of emotions in enforcing behavior; and ``The Winner Take
All Sociey '' with Philip Cook, about the significance of markets
in which a few top superstars take a disproportionate share of the
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is not looking to close an argument but to start one. He
knows that his Rx for the present situation _ a steep consumption
tax to replace the income tax _ does not yet command widespread
support. Few persons contemplating a Ford Excursion bearing down in
their rear-view mirror would dispute his diagnosis that US
econonomy is running a luxury fever of some degree of severity. The
question is, how high?

ETHNIC ALBANIANS MAY SPEED UP TIMETABLE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Western envoys flew into the Balkans
Friday to pressure the warring sides in Kosovo to agree to a peace
accord as the province suffered another day of shelling and
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian tanks lined up along a lonely stretch of road west of
here and shelled hills to the north, where hamlets are nestled
among the woods. To the south, 11 Serbian police officers were
injured in an ambush by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole arrived in Skopje, Macedonia, to meet
ethnic Albanian delegates to the peace talks. His trip is at the
request of President Clinton and is part of a renewed American
effort to ensure that the next round of peace talks, in France,
secures results, after the first round failed.
</P>
<P>
   Dole urged the group to sign the agreement worked out in
Rambouillet, France, after 17 days of negotiations. By signing the
deal, he said, they would maintain pressure on the Serbian
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was met with positive assurances, Reuters reported. ``The
delegation assured me they intend to meet their timetable and,
perhaps, speed it up,'' Dole said standing beside 10 of the 16
delegation members.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians are planning a final consultation on Sunday
and would sign the accord after that, within the two-week timetable
that they had promised, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Veton Surroi, a newspaper publisher and member of the
delegation, said in an interview that the ethnic Albanian leaders
would hold a general meeting and announce their decision by
Wednesday, before the talks resume on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had earlier conceded that Washington had been frustrated
over the delay in signing. ``The longer they wait, the less likely
we will be able to apply pressure on the Serbian government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If they do sign, Dole held out a reward: a visit to Washington
for some of the leaders to discuss the future of Kosovo and, in
particular, the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in their interests to sign the agreement and then come
to Washington. There would be greater receptivity to matters they
would like to discuss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A champion of the ethnic Albanians since visiting Kosovo in the
early 1990s, Dole had to abandon his plans to drive to Pristina,
the capital of Kosovo, since Belgrade did not grant him a visa.
Instead he held meetings in neighboring Macedonia, just south of
Kosovo, meeting with political leaders and a representative of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   He made a swipe at President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
``I want to remind everybody that Slobodan Milosevic is a
problem,'' he said. ``His troops are stepping up Kosovo operations,
and once the Albanian leadership signs this agreement we can turn
our full attention to Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is clearly determined to keep the pressure on all
sides. The peace talks are to be held in Paris this time, it was
announced, in a change from the relaxed and luxurious settings of
the chateau of Rambouillet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An Austrian diplomat, Wolfgang Petritsch, one of the mediators
of the peace talks, meanwhile met with Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, of Yugoslavia, in Pristina to discuss Serbia's position
on the political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is planning to stop in
London on Saturday on her way home from an Asian tour to set up
meetings on Kosovo with British officials. British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook is another mediator of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the wings is Richard Holbrooke, who forged the
Dayton peace deal for Bosnia and the less successful October
agreement for Kosovo that is now in tatters as troops of both the
Serbian army and the KLA regularly break the ceasefire. Holbrooke
is waiting to go to Belgrade to meet with President Slobodan
Milosevic within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have invited both Albanian leaders and Serbian
authorities to visit its headquarters outside Brussels for a
briefing on the peacekeeping force that would enforce any
settlement reached, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which could happen within days, would be for
``technical discussions'' regarding possible deployment of a NATO
Kosovo force, diplomats said. The move is aimed primarily at
persuading the Serbs to accept the deployment of the force, which
Belgrade has so far refused to do, while reassuring the ethnic
Albanians that it can protect them.
</P>
<P>
   If both sides sign the agreement, some 20,000 NATO-led troops
would arrive within days to oversee the settlement and enforce a
formal cease-fire.

BRITISH DECRY US TRADE SANCTIONS IN BANANA DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bill Clinton-Tony Blair love-in is officially over,
all because of bananas.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the US ambassador to Britain,
Philip Lader, was summoned to Whitehall Friday so a government
minister could express Britain's outrage over Washington's decision
to impose trade sanctions on 14 European products, launching a new
offensive in an escalating trade war over bananas. Before Thursday,
no US ambassador in memory had ever been subjected here to such
diplomatic humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Blair government has been the Clinton administration's
staunchest ally over the last two years, and the only one willing
to join in the bombing of Iraq, Anglo-American relations have been
rocked by the banana dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who also was the one leader who went out of his way to
support Clinton when the president's position looked vulnerable
because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, has been trying to persuade
Clinton to lift the trade sanctions. So far, it appears, Blair is
getting nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is especially sensitive for the prime minister,
who has positioned himself as the chief mediator between Washington
and other European leaders, who are far more suspicious of American
motives in trade and foreign policy. On Tuesday, during a speech in
Italy, Blair had urged the 11 other socialist leaders of European
Union nations to emulate the American economic system as a way to
stimulate job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's anger with the Clinton administration is only the most
dramatic example of what has been an especially bad week for
Washington in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, and especially the Italian people, are
outraged that a US military court acquitted the US Marine pilot
whose jet severed the cables of a gondola in Italy last year,
plunging 20 people to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, meanwhile, is furious over the refusal of
Arizona officials to halt the executions of two German brothers who
died in the gas chamber last week for the 1982 murder of an Arizona
bank manager. Arizona officials ignored a personal plea by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to spare their lives. Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin, Germany's justice minister, described the
executions as ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Germans favor the World Trade Organization
ruling that the European Union has given unfair preferential
treatment to bananas grown in former British and French colonies,
because opening the market would mean lower prices for consumers.
But the European Union as a whole is standing against the American
complaint that the European quotas restrict free trade of bananas
grown by American firms in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, arguing a case that is important mostly to the
British and French, and to a lesser extent the Irish, who have a
company that ships bananas, say they have a moral obligation to buy
the bananas from former colonies even if they are more expensive.
The Americans say this is nonsense and consider it a clear
violation of free trade provisions. The retaliatory trade sanctions
imposed by the Americans, meanwhile, apply to luxury products from
all across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are angered that the Clinton administration did
not wait for a pending WTO ruling, expected sometime between March
15 and April 12, on whether recent changes to European import
regulations went far enough to assuage American complaints about
the quota system.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the dispute over bananas is minor. The 100 percent
tariffs imposed by the United States, which would double the cost
of things such as cashmere sweaters from Scotland, Louis Vuitton
handbags from France and pecorino cheese from Italy, affect about
$500 million out of the annual $400 billion in trade between the
European Union and United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the political row it has touched off, especially between
Britain and the United States, threatens longstanding relations and
alliances that are far more important than bananas and Parma ham,
another of the imports targeted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, coincidentally, US officials and their European
allies are to meet in France to resume their suspended attempts to
end the fighting in Kosovo. The Europeans are already less
enthusiastic than the Americans about using force to pressure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into accepting an agreement,
a rift that can only be widened by an escalating trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that foreign policy and trade are not connected
should consider the agenda of a meeting scheduled for Sunday
between US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and British
Foreign Minister Robin Cook. At the top of the agenda, say Foreign
Office officials, is the trade war _ not Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British are especially angry at the Americans because
Washington's trade sanctions jeopardize at least 3,000 jobs in
British industries such as cashmere, cookies, and car batteries,
which have nothing to do with bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, the British minister in charge of trade, called
the US sanctions ``irrational and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lader, meanwhile, is trying to put the best spin on the
confrontation with Byers, whom he calls a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about bananas,'' said Lader. ``It's about playing by
the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the dispute over bananas, meanwhile, are perhaps
even more difficult disputes over the European refusal to allow
imports from America of genetically modified food and beef from
hormone-fed cattle. The Americans, meanwhile, complain that the
European Union subsidizes manufacture of the popular Airbus
jetliners, chief rival to Boeing's planes. In that dispute, the
Americans are threatening to bar landings by the Concorde
supersonic jet that flies from London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It also irks the Europeans that the Clinton administration is
pursuing its banana campaign at the behest of Chicquita boss Carl
Lindner, the Cincinnati businessman who has made generous campaign
contributions to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, political observers here are calling this the lowest
point in Anglo-American relations since 1994, when then-Prime
Minister John Major was furious after Clinton granted a visa to
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams so Adams could make a publicity trip
to the United States. Major, whose government at the time was
trying to get Adams to renounce violence in exchange for perks such
as traveling to the US, was so angry that he refused to take
Clinton's phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Blair is doing the opposite, calling Clinton
repeatedly, looking for political payback for his record of support
for US foreign policy.

ITALY CALLS FOR JUSTICE IN SKI DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Friday
he was ``shocked'' by the acquittal of a Marine pilot whose jet
snapped the cables of a ski gondola, killing 20 people in Italy
last year, and will not be satisfied until ``whoever is responsible
for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who stood at D'Alema's side, said Americans
are ``heartbroken and horrified'' by the deaths. Although he
refused to comment on Thursday's acquittal because other charges
are pending, Clinton said, ``The United States is not trying to
duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' comments came at a joint news conference
following their long-scheduled private meeting that coincidentally
fell on the day after a US military court found Marine Captain
Richard J. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., not guilty of
involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict outraged Italians and made Clinton's visit with a
critical US ally exceedingly awkward. They stiffly posed for
pictures in the Oval Office at the beginning of their meeting
Friday and did not shake hands for the cameras as frequently
happens during such foreign visits. There also was little warmth
between the two men when they faced reporters, in their first
face-to-face since D'Alema became Italy's prime minster.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened respectfully but without expression as D'Alema
stated his disappointment with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did, however, agree to have their defense
secretaries review operational and safety measures to determine
steps that can be taken so such an accident never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he was ``personally shocked, and so is Italian
public opinion'' by Ashby's acquittal. He said Italians were not
``asking for a scapegoat.'' But he said it was ``not normal for a
military aircraft to fly in a valley 300 feet from the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is neither normal nor acceptable that this leads to the
consequences it did lead to,'' D'Alema continued. ``We expect that
at the end of the process, it is made clear who was responsible for
this accident and that these people are punished for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3, 1998, accident occurred during a training flight in
the Italian Alps when Ashby's jet severed two cables holding a
gondola packed with tourists preparing to ski. The accident
triggered angry criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and
flying too low, and blatantly disregarding the safety of the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was supposed to stay 1,000 feet above the ground, but
struck the cables at about 360 feet. The crew acknowledged having
flown at up to 644 miles per hour, but reportedly did not know they
were not supposed fly faster than 518 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and his navigator, Capital Joseph P. Schweitzer, 30, of
Westbury, N.Y., still face a charge of obstruction of justice for
allegedly concealing a videotaped recording of part of the flight.
The videotape, which has not been found, was considered potentially
useful for investigators to determine what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't want to comment on the verdict for fear
it would affect the pending court-martial proceedings, but as he
did when the accident first happened, he said Americans ``are
profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, he said, ``To me, the important thing now is that
the United States must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the
responsibility for what happened. Our presence in Italy, our air
operations, our training operations were the context, the
environment in which this horrible thing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants to ``reduce the prospect to zero that
something like this will occur again.'' He wants the United States
to do ``what is appropriate by the families'' in terms of a modest
cash settlement. And Clinton said he wants to ``do everything we
can to have a just disposition'' on the pending charges. ``I am
committed to all three things. I will do the best I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, the US government gave each family $5,000 to
cover travel and burial costs. They also received $60,000 from the
Italian government that the United States reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my words could ever ease the pain of someone
who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a spouse in that
terrible accident,'' Clinton said. ``But at least it's important
for the people of Italy and for those families to know that the
United States is not trying to duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he appreciated ``the great human sincerity with
which President Clinton has shared this tragedy with no arrogance,
with no sense of detachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed confidence that those responsible will be
punished. ``I do not know who was responsible for what happened,''
D'Alema said. ``It is up to the justice system to determine who was
responsible and who is guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is
responsible for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the verdict in the ski accident dominated their news
conference, Clinton and D'Alema both urged warring factions in
Serbia and Kosovo to accept the terms of the peace agreement
negotiated last month in Rambouillet, France. The talks recessed
with no agreement, but the next round of negotiations is set to
begin March 15.

in February, to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in January, even as
companies added jobs. Payrolls expanded by 275,000 jobs in
February, about 25,000 jobs more than expected. Workers' average
hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent during February, to $13.04,
slower than January's increase of 0.4 percent. The data indicated
that inflation remained well under control _ but the report also

ITALY CALLS FOR JUSTICE IN SKI DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Friday
he was ``shocked'' by the acquittal of a Marine pilot whose jet
snapped the cables of a ski gondola, killing 20 people in Italy
last year, and will not be satisfied until ``whoever is responsible
for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who stood at D'Alema's side, said Americans
are ``heartbroken and horrified'' by the deaths. Although he
refused to comment on Thursday's acquittal because other charges
are pending, Clinton said, ``The United States is not trying to
duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' comments came at a joint news conference
following their long-scheduled private meeting that coincidentally
fell on the day after a US military court found Marine Captain
Richard J. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., not guilty of
involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict outraged Italians and made Clinton's visit with a
critical US ally exceedingly awkward. They stiffly posed for
pictures in the Oval Office at the beginning of their meeting
Friday and did not shake hands for the cameras as frequently
happens during such foreign visits. There also was little warmth
between the two men when they faced reporters, in their first
face-to-face since D'Alema became Italy's prime minster.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened respectfully but without expression as D'Alema
stated his disappointment with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did, however, agree to have their defense
secretaries review operational and safety measures to determine
steps that can be taken so such an accident never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he was ``personally shocked, and so is Italian
public opinion'' by Ashby's acquittal. He said Italians were not
``asking for a scapegoat.'' But he said it was ``not normal for a
military aircraft to fly in a valley 300 feet from the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is neither normal nor acceptable that this leads to the
consequences it did lead to,'' D'Alema continued. ``We expect that
at the end of the process, it is made clear who was responsible for
this accident and that these people are punished for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3, 1998, accident occurred during a training flight in
the Italian Alps when Ashby's jet severed two cables holding a
gondola packed with tourists preparing to ski. The accident
triggered angry criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and
flying too low, and blatantly disregarding the safety of the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was supposed to stay 1,000 feet above the ground, but
struck the cables at about 360 feet. The crew acknowledged having
flown at up to 644 miles per hour, but reportedly did not know they
were not supposed fly faster than 518 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and his navigator, Capital Joseph P. Schweitzer, 30, of
Westbury, N.Y., still face a charge of obstruction of justice for
allegedly concealing a videotaped recording of part of the flight.
The videotape, which has not been found, was considered potentially
useful for investigators to determine what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't want to comment on the verdict for fear
it would affect the pending court-martial proceedings, but as he
did when the accident first happened, he said Americans ``are
profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, he said, ``To me, the important thing now is that
the United States must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the
responsibility for what happened. Our presence in Italy, our air
operations, our training operations were the context, the
environment in which this horrible thing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants to ``reduce the prospect to zero that
something like this will occur again.'' He wants the United States
to do ``what is appropriate by the families'' in terms of a modest
cash settlement. And Clinton said he wants to ``do everything we
can to have a just disposition'' on the pending charges. ``I am
committed to all three things. I will do the best I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, the US government gave each family $5,000 to
cover travel and burial costs. They also received $60,000 from the
Italian government that the United States reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my words could ever ease the pain of someone
who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a spouse in that
terrible accident,'' Clinton said. ``But at least it's important
for the people of Italy and for those families to know that the
United States is not trying to duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he appreciated ``the great human sincerity with
which President Clinton has shared this tragedy with no arrogance,
with no sense of detachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed confidence that those responsible will be
punished. ``I do not know who was responsible for what happened,''
D'Alema said. ``It is up to the justice system to determine who was
responsible and who is guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is
responsible for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the verdict in the ski accident dominated their news
conference, Clinton and D'Alema both urged warring factions in
Serbia and Kosovo to accept the terms of the peace agreement
negotiated last month in Rambouillet, France. The talks recessed
with no agreement, but the next round of negotiations is set to
begin March 15.

<P>
   How now, Dow Theory? This market timing strategy _ based on the
synchronism, or lack thereof, of the Dow Jones industrial and
transportation averages _ turned bearish last August. Yet it stayed
bearish through the 30 percent rally in stocks in the last quarter
and has remained that way during this year's market gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Dow Theory looked good in the eight weeks after
Aug. 4, when it flashed a sell signal; the market dropped a
thousand points on the Dow as part of its summer swoon. But the Dow
later bounced back and then some; despite its February weakness, it
is still up nearly 10 percent since Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dow theorists don't always agree on their
interpretations, the Dow Theory newsletters that I monitor are
unanimous in advising that investors should act as if they were
still in a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   To turn bullish, the Dow Theory requires that both the
industrial and transportation indexes move higher in strong trends
_ and that is currently not the case. When the industrials rallied
in January to new highs, the transports lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   At around 3,300, the transportation index is 11 percent below
its record high of 3,686 nearly a year ago. (Though investors who
follow the theory generally don't spend much time on the underlying
logic, it makes sense that in a healthy market the fortunes of
manufacturing companies, the industrials, should generally be
aligned with those of the companies that ship their goods, the
transports.)
</P>
<P>
   Tracking this divergence between the indexes is all well and
good, say many frustrated adherents of the Dow Theory.
</P>
<P>
   But, having been on the sidelines during the fall and winter
market rally, they have a burning question: Should they keep
following a theory that has been so out of sync with the recent
market? Or would sticking with it be an example of what Ralph Waldo
Emerson meant when he described the foolish consistency that is the
hobgoblin of little minds?
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, all investors confront such questions about
their strategies. After all, no system makes money in all market
environments.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Try standing back from your short-term frustration
by focusing on long-term performance. Make sure your strategy has
proved itself over many years and in different situations.
</P>
<P>
   In no event should you judge its performance over anything less
than five years. And even that may be too little if, like the last
five years, the period hasn't encompassed a full market cycle.
</P>
<P>
   After evaluating your system over the long term, you may
conclude that you shouldn't have adopted it in the first place. But
if you originally chose your strategy based on its long-term
returns, the chances are good that recent performance won't justify
throwing in the towel. You should dump your system only if you
wouldn't choose it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   If adherents to the Dow Theory studied its record, they would
likely stick to their guns. Its long-term performance has been
superb, even if it missed the market's strong rally late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of Dow Theory Letters. The best-known
such newsletter, it has been applying the theory, as interpreted by
its editor, Richard Russell, for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-1980, when the Hulbert Financial Digest began
monitoring the newsletter industry, a portfolio that followed
Russell's signals, switching between a stock index fund and
Treasury bills, gained an average of 13.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Though this is less than the 16.8 percent that would have been
produced by buying and holding, Russell's return was produced with
37 percent less risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, in fact, Russell's
timing advice has actually beaten the market.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the newsletter's current performance today doesn't look as
good as it did last fall. But Russell's long-term track record is
still excellent. Assuming that you're following the Dow Theory
because it reduces risk while furnishing competitive long-term
performance, you have no reason not to stay the course. &QL;

SEEING A FOREST TO SAVE THE TREES

 By JON CHRISTENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ While environmentalists were chained to
thousand-year-old redwood trees in the Headwaters forest of
northern California, Thomas S. Reid was chained to his computer.
</P>
<P>
   He was putting those same trees, along with seabird nesting
areas and salmon streams, into a simulation that proved essential
to protecting the forest, the largest privately owned grove of
ancient redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the towering trees were saved from the chain saws and
mills in a last-minute deal involving the federal government, the
state of California, and the Pacific Lumber Co., owned by Maxxam, a
holding company based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government agreed to pay $250 million and California
$242 million to acquire the Headwaters forest, whose 10,000 acres
are two-thirds the size of Manhattan. The company also agreed to
forgo logging for at least 50 years in a dozen other old-growth
groves covering an additional 7,900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the deal was reached, Reid, dressed in his usual
working attire of casual pants and running shoes, was on the phone
trading congratulations and gossip with key negotiators. He is on
good terms with all of them, in no small measure because he says he
is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides agree that his contribution was crucial. His
richly detailed, computerized maps with color overlays showing
those trees, bird habitats and fish streams gave the players a
common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't at the negotiating table,'' Reid said, ``but we
helped build the table back in the shop so that others could
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, but earnest and direct, Reid in fact conducted the
negotiations behind the negotiations. He shuttled between the
California officials who hired his environmental consulting
company, their federal allies and company executives to secure
common understandings on environmental and economic facts and
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 51, is one of a new breed of environmentalists who rely on
the power of scientific and economic information in their quest to
save endangered species or limit pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Using software originally developed for the oil industry, he
enabled the negotiators to calculate precisely the trade-offs
between cutting timber and saving birds and fish. As each proposal
was mapped on his laptop, they could see the economic and
environmental gains and losses.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, Thomas Reid Associates, is based in a warren of
offices on the second floor of a rundown building in downtown Palo
Alto. Its space is crowded with three computers, boxes of documents
and a library of environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of Reid's passion for the environment is an
inconspicuous poster of a redwood tree that says in small type:
``Should something that has lived for 2,000 years die for next
quarter's earnings?''
</P>
<P>
   Reid is proud of his ability to keep his passion out of his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not out in the woods hugging trees,'' he said. ``The
role that is more useful for us to play is to sustain some
objectivity and perceived independence, so that we could give
information and not have anybody worry that we're cooking the
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, called a habitat conservation plan, was designed
to protect coho salmon and the marbled murrelet, a seabird that
lays its eggs only on the huge branches of redwood trees that are
hundreds of years old. Both are listed as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of participants framed the agreement, from Charles
Hurwitz, Maxxam's chairman, to the Interior secretary, Bruce
Babbitt, to the teams of federal, state and corporate officials,
lawyers and biologists.
</P>
<P>
   But those involved say Reid's work was the foundation for their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendously powerful tool,'' said Phillip J.
Detrich, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service and the lead scientist on the federal negotiating team.
``Without it, I can't envision how we could have done this whole
process. Those maps that Tom made were the core of that
negotiation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber in Scotia, Calif.,
said Reid's work allowed the balancing of competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He produced an image that people could interpret and
understand,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is no stranger to such deals. In fact, he has made them his
business. He left a graduate program in biology at Stanford
University in 1972 to start his own consulting company. In 1983, he
developed the nation's first endangered species habitat
conservation plan to save the Mission Blue butterfly on San Bruno
Mountain in South San Francisco, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A result was 2,750 acres of open space, but also eight
development projects _ including homes, offices and hotels _ that
were approved on 600 acres. His firm still manages this grassy
habitat and its restoration for San Mateo County.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's company has helped create nine other conservation plans
in California. His consulting business has grown to about $1.2
million in annual billings, with 16 employees. The Headwaters
project was done under a $470,000 contract with the California
Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Business Council, representing 500 businesses in the
Sierra Nevada region, recently hired Reid to help plan for economic
development and growth while protecting open spaces and threatened
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a biologist, but he's a realist,'' said the council's
director, Lucy Blake. ``He understands the economics. He is
committed to habitat planning within the constraints of landowners.
He is trying to get as much for the resource as he can without
having a deal fall apart, which is tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some environmentalists deride the results of Reid's
efforts. The Environmental Protection Information Center in
Garberville, Calif., is considering a lawsuit to stop the
Headwaters plan, which allows logging on some land in order to
protect the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to 9,000 acres of marbled murrelet habitat will be
liquidated under this plan,'' said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the
organization. ``Killing endangered species in order to save them
doesn't seem that rational.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Bundy praised Reid's expertise. ``I found his work more
useful than anyone else's in figuring out what this plan will do,''
Bundy said. ``I think he did a good job of making clear what this
plan sacrifices. The numbers don't lie.''

BEYOND THE BOUNCE IN BOND YIELDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the weather. Or the post-Christmas, pre-April 15th
blues. Whatever the cause, over the last 15 years bond traders have
tended to push up interest rates, in some cases quite sharply, in
the first few months of the year, and in the process have unsettled
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse hasn't lasted long, though, because rates have been
in a general decline since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the chagrin of equity investors and would-be home
buyers, bond yields have moved up again this winter, with the
30-year Treasury at 5.60 percent. Worries abound that the Federal
Reserve will exacerbate the trend by tightening credit conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ian A. MacKinnon, a managing director of the Vanguard Group and
head of its fixed-income funds, spent some time last week to share
his views on the state of Bondland. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is your explanation for the recent increase in
interest rates?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the fall, after Russia defaulted and Long-Term Capital
almost collapsed, it looked like the world was going to hell in a
handbasket. The Federal Reserve Board responded by cutting
short-term interest rates three times. But there was a feeling the
Fed would need to do more. What we have seen over the last several
months is a dissipation of that feeling. In the Treasury market,
that has led to the unwinding of flight-to-quality positions
established during the crisis. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So bond traders are putting primary importance on
what is happening in the American economy?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Last fall there was a feeling the economy would falter. But
it has proven to be amazingly resilient, impervious to any sort of
shocks from abroad. So the bet no longer is that the economy will
weaken. If anything, people are now factoring in some fear that the
Fed will tighten monetary policy. But we don't think that is going
to happen. The Fed is blessed with a miraculous economy that will
grow at a 3 percent rate this year with no inflation to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four or five months, long-term Treasury bond
yields have risen by almost a full percentage point. But in no way
has the inflation outlook worsened by that much. Treasuries
represent a very good bargain relative to inflation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Corporate and municipal bond yields didn't fall much
at all last fall. How have those groups held up during the recent
rise in Treasury yields?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When there was the flight to quality, all of it went into
Treasuries and virtually nothing into corporates. So Treasuries
have backed up in yield and corporates have been pretty stalwart in
the face of that. In fact, corporate securities have outperformed
Treasuries quite significantly over the last couple of months. And
with expectations that the economy will do better this year,
corporates ought to do pretty well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which sectors of the investment-grade corporate bond
market do you like?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In certain sectors, like real estate investment trusts, you
can get bonds with yields of close to 7 percent. We also like
electric utility bonds, and companies in some cyclically
insensitive areas, like telecom, cable and supermarkets. All of
those ought to do pretty well this year, given that we are looking
for moderate-to-brisk growth in the economy and no acceleration of
inflation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Last fall, the thinking was that we might fall into
a recession in 1999. As you said, that is no longer the prevailing
wisdom. Shouldn't a growing economy be good news for high-yield
junk bonds as well?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it should. The only caveat with junk is you have to be
mindful of the earnings pressure these companies are under. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Last fall, interest rate spreads between Treasuries
and high-quality municipal bonds disappeared. Are munis still a
buy?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Municipal bonds are still attractive, but not as attractive
as they were for weeks and weeks during the fall. Now, with the
backup in Treasury yields, AAA municipal bonds yield about 92
percent of Treasuries. If your perspective is longer than the last
six months or a year, that is screamingly attractive. But for weeks
and weeks last fall those yields were 102 percent of Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an insured municipal bond due in 2020 can be had at a
5.10 percent yield. For people in the 28 percent tax bracket, that
is a pre-tax equivalent yield of 7.10 percent. So there are still
good deals. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italicsGiven your economic outlook, have bond yields reached
their peak?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think they have, and I think you will see them move
lower during the spring and summer. But I see a couple of speed
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   One is Y2K. I think there is some likelihood companies will beef
up production before year-end, and that the increase in inventories
will artificially boost gross domestic product, perhaps by
one-quarter percentage point or more in the fourth quarter. That
might frighten the market.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if we continue to see robust strength in employment, that
would make us less positive.

   2 Lewinsky Interviews, 2 Marketing Approaches &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Controversial television programs present a ticklish challenge
for marketers. Advertising on them can turn counterproductive by
striking the audience as intrusive, inappropriate, tasteless or,
worst of all, an implicit taking of sides in the controversy. But
oh, those ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster Monica Lewinsky interviews must have been doubly
tempting, with the near certainty of a huge audience tuning in to a
familiar story full of obvious opportunities for product
``adjacencies'' _ lingerie ads near the part about the thong
underwear, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Separate arms of one advertiser, S.C. Johnson, seem to have come
to different conclusions about the value of such adjacencies. The
interview broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain, where the public has
reacted with bemusement to the Lewinsky matter, featured a
strategically timed spot for the company's Vanish stain remover,
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the interview with Barbara Walters shown on ABC in the
United States instead promoted Glade candles and Windex glass
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Was the difference a result of delicate calculations about
differing audience sensibilities? A company spokesman said the
British subsidiary made its own independent advertising decisions;
an executive at the company's American media-buying agency said
Glade and Windex just happened to be the products scheduled for a
push in the United States last week, and adjacency placement was
never seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they got it anyway: The Glade ad was shown near the
end of the program _ and scandal-weary Americans have been telling
pollsters for months that all they really want is to clear the air
and put the whole mess behind them.

   NEW YORK _ When Wall Street competitors start growling and
snapping at one another, the safest place for the general public is
usually a good block away. As the folks down home would say, we
probably don't have a dog in that fight.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent squabbling among the New York Stock Exchange,
NASDAQ and the host of private stock trading services known as
electronic communications networks, or ECNs, is an exception to the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   They are fighting for shares of America's stock-trading
business. And before any more fur flies, some informed bystanders
think everyone should take a deep breath and focus on one thing the
combatants must do cooperatively: police the market to protect the
rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets are not just places to trade stock; they are also
what are known to the wonkish as ``self-regulatory organizations.''
That means the New York Stock Exchange and the parent of NASDAQ,
the National Association of Securities Dealers, have a legal duty
to stop their members _ which include the ECNs _ from going too far
in the heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   (How tricky is this? Try to imagine an ice hockey game in which
the coaches have to decide themselves who should be thrown into the
penalty box during the final game for the Stanley Cup.)
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong self-regulatory force, the troops of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department begin
to look pretty thin on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, Wall Street history shows that even the
toughest rules will bend under the blowtorch of life-or-death
competition, said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan
College and the author of ``Wall Street: A History'' (Oxford
University Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, tough standards can drive away some
business, and thus reduce commission income. For another, a strong
police force is expensive _and hence a tempting target as
competitors seek to lower their trading costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some combatants see a third vulnerability of the current
self-regulation model: conflicts of interest. Both NASDAQ and the
Big Board are trying to compete more effectively against the ECNs _
which fear, as a result, that they are being forced to compete
against their own regulators.
</P>
<P>
   As one ECN's founder complained in a letter to the SEC last
year, letting the NASD regulate his business these days would be
like letting the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the
airline industry while operating a competing carrier.
</P>
<P>
   It is a healthy sign, then, that some market leaders are
starting to talk seriously, albeit still privately, about ways to
insulate their police functions from this dog fight.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD has already taken a step in the right direction by
setting up a regulatory arm, NASD-Regulation, separate from the
NASDAQ market. It would take several more steps _ and big ones, at
that _ to create a single industry-supported regulatory
organization that would monitor NASDAQ, the Big Board and all the
virtual stock exchanges popping up in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for that unified self-regulator ``does become more
compelling,'' one senior market official acknowledged last week.
Indeed, that possibility has already been discussed jointly by the
Big Board and NASDAQ, several officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much time to get this sorted out. Soon, the
burgeoning ECNs will have the option of seeking to be regulated by
the SEC as ``stock exchanges,'' rather than stockbrokers. That step
could make them their own self-regulators, a role that seems
problematic, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   So the public actually has a number of dogs in this Wall Street
fight. One of them is a watchdog. And it had better win, or
everyone loses.

UNTANGLING GRIDLOCK ON THE UNION PACIFIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Calif., Neb.)   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For Troy Slinkard, the worst days of the Union Pacific
Railroad's service crisis came in late 1997. About a year after the
UP had merged with the Southern Pacific, the two railroads'
combined train traffic was choking to a standstill in the crucial
nest of tracks around and through Houston, the heart of the region
that Slinkard helped direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 12 to 15 hours a day of complete misery, doing
everything in your power to clear it up,'' he remembered. ``And it
went on day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis, which flared on and off for 18
months, the gridlock in Houston backed up trains as far away as
California and Chicago. The sidings that allow trains to pass each
other were persistently full. Freight cars were left stranded for
days or weeks, or temporarily lost. Shippers screamed about
millions of dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the worst of those headaches are behind Slinkard. The
Union Pacific has become much more adept at managing the country's
largest railroad, with 36,000 miles of track sprawling across 23
states in the West and South.
</P>
<P>
   Train speeds through Houston have rebounded from an average of
just 12.5 miles an hour last March to 18.2 mph for the week ended
Saturday, Feb. 20, about what they were before the merger,
according to the railroad's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several major shippers' claims arising from the debacle have
been settled out of court, and safety problems related to the snarl
have abated.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the crisis led some critics to call for greater
regulation of railroads, coping with it has taken the Union Pacific
beyond tactical problem-solving to making fundamental changes in
the way it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up on centralized control came first. ``We learned this
is such a large company that we could not manage it from a single
center in Omaha,'' said Dick Davidson, chairman of the Union
Pacific. So it delegated operational control to regional centers in
Houston, Omaha and Roseville, Calif., near Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   And in Houston, the epicenter of the crisis, the UP went even
further, creating a joint operating center with the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe, its main rival.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Slinkard works now, as a joint director, reporting
to both railroads. He is a referee of sorts, making sure that the
two sides' dispatchers, who now sit in the same room, coordinate
their train movements, and that all trains are handled fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying here,'' Slinkard said. ``We don't care what
color the locomotive is, as long as it's pulling cars and leaving
town.''
</P>
<P>
   So pleased were the railroads with the improvements in Houston
that they are planning similar joint operations centers to control
trackage in the Powder River Basin in eastern Wyoming and the areas
around Los Angeles and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Pacific also simplified train routing in Houston by
designating certain tracks for permanent one-way traffic. It
stepped up capital spending and hired 6,000 new workers, 1,100 in
the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   And Davidson dispatched a personal representative, Joe Adams, to
mend fences in Houston. ``We do a great deal of business here, and
we want to be partners with Houston and participate in economic
development,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   While shippers and government officials generally compliment the
Union Pacific on its steps to end the crisis, there is still
backing for a rethinking of railroad deregulation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened with the Union Pacific crisis, the
industry has consolidated beyond where it makes sense,'' said Diane
C. Duff, executive director of the Alliance for Rail Competition, a
Washington-based lobbying group representing shippers who depend
heavily on rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff said service is still substantially worse than before
the merger. The Society of the Plastics Industry, which represents
a large number of rail shippers, said its members' bulk rail
shipments took an average of 11 days in December, better than the
15-day average in March 1998 but nowhere near the 6-day average in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers' groups say lack of competition is to blame: The
country's major railroads have dwindled from 42 in 1980 to just 4
today.
</P>
<P>
   Before regulations were lifted by the Staggers Act, enacted in
1980, the government controlled many aspects of railroad rate
setting. The Surface Transportation Board still oversees matters
like railroad safety but, critics say, no longer does much to
combat unfair pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   During the service crisis, a coalition of smaller railroads,
shippers and state and local representatives asked the board to
force the Union Pacific to relax its grip on Houston, where it
controls about 80 percent of all track.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition wanted running rights on UP track for rival
railroads and a new independent entity to move traffic through
Houston. The UP objected that these measures were unnecessarily
drastic, and that any area customer served by two railroads before
the merger still had access to a second carrier. In the end, the
board ordered a few minor measures.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the railroads have now turned to Congress, backing
legislation that would require the board to promote competition
among railroads and assure that ``captive shippers'' served by only
one railroad were charged reasonable rates; studies suggest that
such shippers now pay 30 percent more, on average, than other rail
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson called the bill shortsighted and said customers would
benefit as the Union Pacific corrected mistakes. ``We went to hell,
looked the devil in the eye and came back,'' he said. ``It has been
a profound experience. We have all made a blood-oath commitment
that we're going to learn from the desperate situation we were in
and come out of it a far better railroad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Senior Chinese officials Friday reaffirmed their
determination to squeeze dead wood and red ink out of bloated
state-owned enterprises, vowing to make nearly all of them
competitive and profitable by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on his first year as prime minister, Zhu Rongji told
the annual session of the National People's Congress that, despite
the ``grim environment at home and abroad,'' China would forge
ahead with the overhaul of state industries as well as a
streamlining of government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   While his speech was mainly devoted to economic policy, Zhu
implicitly acknowledged the social unrest that has flared as urban
unemployment grows and farmers protest taxes and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that seemed to be aimed as much at local
officials and the police as at potential protesters, Zhu said such
conflicts should be resolved promptly, ``eliminating them before
they grow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances should we intensify them by handling
them in an oversimplified or crude way,'' he said. ``Still less
should we use dictatorial means against the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said the government projected 7 percent economic growth for
China in 1999, compared with an official figure of 7.8 percent for
1998, and would continue its efforts to stimulate the economy _
which has been battered by the Asian financial crisis and a
shrinkage of domestic demand _ by pumping large sums into capital
investments.
</P>
<P>
   But the determination to wring out state-owned enterprises,
despite the risks and pain, was the clear theme of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after Friday's opening of the congress, the
official in charge of revamping state industry sought to rebut the
perception that economic reforms had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have continued to quicken the pace of state enterprise
reform,'' said the official, Sheng Huaren, chairman of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, noting progress in closing of excess
textile mills and coal mines, and restructuring of the petroleum,
petrochemical and metallurgical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng gave a surprisingly upbeat assessment of some of the
challenges facing the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Zhu promised that through a combination of better
management, mergers, bankruptcies and pruning of staff, the giant
state-owned sector would be solvent by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998, as the economy slowed, more state industries than
ever lost money. To boost growth and forestall mounting protests by
unpaid workers, the government instructed banks to lend more freely
to state companies _ which some foreign economists warned would
perpetuate outdated factories and deepen future losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheng said Friday that state industry losses had slowed in
the latter half of 1998 and added that he was ``confident the
situation will improve this year.'' He also asserted, in the face
of reports of soaring unemployment and unpaid welfare stipends,
that most laid-off workers had been helped to find new jobs, and
that others were receiving living allowances.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government aimed to stabilize some 7,680 large and
medium-sized public companies. Of those, about 2,300 are now losing
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Sheng said, is to end the losses of one-third of those
companies this year, and the losses of an additional one-third next
year, leaving no more than 15 percent of the surviving large and
medium-sized companies in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Those larger enterprises are expected to remain under public
control, but operate in a market environment increasingly open to
global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 48,000 company officials were demoted or fired for
poor management, Sheng said, and under a system of inspection by
outside auditors, more incompetent or corrupt managers will be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller public enterprises, often owned by local governments,
had been told to sink or swim. Many local officials began selling
off such companies _ to themselves or their friends _ for little or
nothing even when the companies had valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   Such sales were halted, Sheng said, to prevent further losses of
state assets as well as the evasion of bank payments and
obligations to workers. At this point, it is unclear how the
government will dispose of tens of thousands of unwanted, often
unprofitable small companies.

   WASHINGTON President Clinton vowed Friday the United States
would not ''duck'' its responsibility for a military accident that
killed 20 people on an Italian ski slope last year. He said he
intends further compensation for the victims' families and wants
changes to reduce to ''zero'' the odds of another such tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the
responsibility for what happened,'' Clinton said. ``Our presence in
Italy, our air operations, our training operations were the
context, the environment in which this horrible thing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, appearing with Clinton,
said he was ''shocked,'' by the acquittal Thursday of Marine Capt.
Richard Ashby, the pilot whose low-flying jet severed two steel
cables, sending a gondola full of tourists to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for a scapegoat,'' he said. ``But we expect
that at the end of this process, it is clear and it is determined
who is responsible, and those who are found responsible are
punished through a fair trial. We are confident that this will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident has caused serious strains between the United
States and Italy, a NATO member and an important U.S. ally in
southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots fly training missions from Aviano, Italy, the base
for Air Force flights in support of the NATO peacekeeping mission
in Bosnia, just across the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Aviano would be a likely staging ground for similar support
should a NATO operation be launched in the Serb province of Kosovo,
as is being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   While both Clinton and D'Alema insisted Friday that the two
countries' economic, political and military alliance remains sound,
D'Alema made no effort to submerge the outrage felt by many
Italians over Ashby's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally shocked, and so is Italian public opinion,''
said D'Alema. ``It is not normal for a military aircraft to fly in
a valley 300 feet from the ground. It is neither normal nor
acceptable that this leads to the consequences it did lead to.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosectors in Ashby's court-martial said his jet which hit the
cables about 370 feet above ground was flying lower and faster than
training rules permit. He was acquitted of charges of involuntary
homicide and manslaughter, however, by a jury of Marines at Camp
Lejeune, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to comment on the verdict, and was somber but
otherwise expressionless as D'Alema addressed it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to pains, however, to stress to D'Alema, and, by
extension, to the Italian public, that he took from the verdict no
vindication for the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not trying to duck its responsibility,''
Clinton said. ``We are heartbroken and horrified by what happened,
and we're going to do our best to make sure that nothing like that
ever happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has instructed Defense Secretary William Cohen to work
with his Italian counterpart to change training tactics and flight
regulations that would, in the president's words, ``reduce the
prospect to zero that something like this will occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also offered his assurance that the United States would
work with the Italian government to ensure that victims' families
are compensated in accordance with policies agreed upon by both
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement governing U.S. military operations in Italy,
the families of the victims may apply to the Italian government for
compensation. At least 10 families have done so already, and more
are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government must determine equitable compensation.
The United States must to pay 75 percent of the compensation
awarded by the Italian government, which would be responsible for
paying the remaining 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already the United States has provided two separate payments to
each victim's estate: a $5,000 to cover transportation and burial
expenses and a $60,000 lump sum payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my words could ever ease the pain of someone
who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a spouse in that
terrible accident,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has
occurred, to the families and to all the people of Italy.''

ITALY CALLS FOR JUSTICE IN SKI DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Friday
he was ``shocked'' by the acquittal of a Marine pilot whose jet
snapped the cables of a ski gondola, killing 20 people in Italy
last year, and will not be satisfied until ``whoever is responsible
for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who stood at D'Alema's side, said Americans
are ``heartbroken and horrified'' by the deaths. Although he
refused to comment on Thursday's acquittal because other charges
are pending, Clinton said, ``The United States is not trying to
duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' comments came at a joint news conference
following their long-scheduled private meeting that coincidentally
fell on the day after a US military court found Marine Captain
Richard J. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., not guilty of
involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict outraged Italians and made Clinton's visit with a
critical US ally exceedingly awkward. They stiffly posed for
pictures in the Oval Office at the beginning of their meeting
Friday and did not shake hands for the cameras as frequently
happens during such foreign visits. There also was little warmth
between the two men when they faced reporters, in their first
face-to-face since D'Alema became Italy's prime minster.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listened respectfully but without expression as D'Alema
stated his disappointment with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did, however, agree to have their defense
secretaries review operational and safety measures to determine
steps that can be taken so such an accident never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he was ``personally shocked, and so is Italian
public opinion'' by Ashby's acquittal. He said Italians were not
``asking for a scapegoat.'' But he said it was ``not normal for a
military aircraft to fly in a valley 300 feet from the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is neither normal nor acceptable that this leads to the
consequences it did lead to,'' D'Alema continued. ``We expect that
at the end of the process, it is made clear who was responsible for
this accident and that these people are punished for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3, 1998, accident occurred during a training flight in
the Italian Alps when Ashby's jet severed two cables holding a
gondola packed with tourists preparing to ski. The accident
triggered angry criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and
flying too low, and blatantly disregarding the safety of the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was supposed to stay 1,000 feet above the ground, but
struck the cables at about 360 feet. The crew acknowledged having
flown at up to 644 miles per hour, but reportedly did not know they
were not supposed fly faster than 518 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and his navigator, Capital Joseph P. Schweitzer, 30, of
Westbury, N.Y., still face a charge of obstruction of justice for
allegedly concealing a videotaped recording of part of the flight.
The videotape, which has not been found, was considered potentially
useful for investigators to determine what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't want to comment on the verdict for fear
it would affect the pending court-martial proceedings, but as he
did when the accident first happened, he said Americans ``are
profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, he said, ``To me, the important thing now is that
the United States must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the
responsibility for what happened. Our presence in Italy, our air
operations, our training operations were the context, the
environment in which this horrible thing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants to ``reduce the prospect to zero that
something like this will occur again.'' He wants the United States
to do ``what is appropriate by the families'' in terms of a modest
cash settlement. And Clinton said he wants to ``do everything we
can to have a just disposition'' on the pending charges. ``I am
committed to all three things. I will do the best I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, the US government gave each family $5,000 to
cover travel and burial costs. They also received $60,000 from the
Italian government that the United States reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my words could ever ease the pain of someone
who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a spouse in that
terrible accident,'' Clinton said. ``But at least it's important
for the people of Italy and for those families to know that the
United States is not trying to duck its responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said he appreciated ``the great human sincerity with
which President Clinton has shared this tragedy with no arrogance,
with no sense of detachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed confidence that those responsible will be
punished. ``I do not know who was responsible for what happened,''
D'Alema said. ``It is up to the justice system to determine who was
responsible and who is guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is
responsible for what happened is found guilty and punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the verdict in the ski accident dominated their news
conference, Clinton and D'Alema both urged warring factions in
Serbia and Kosovo to accept the terms of the peace agreement
negotiated last month in Rambouillet, France. The talks recessed
with no agreement, but the next round of negotiations is set to
begin March 15.

RESEARCHER NOTES CHALLENGE OF DEFINING FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Note language in last paragraph.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   While a study published Friday might seem to cast doubt on the
ability of wonder drug Viagra to promote sexual response in women,
the author of the study says the results underlie a key truism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the heck female sexual dysfunction is,''
said Dr. Steven Kaplan, a urologist at Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center in New York. ``That's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 25 percent of the 36 women Kaplan studied reported
``overall improvement'' in sexual function after downing Pfizer's
little blue pills, which retail for about $7 a pop and are now
widely prescribed for impotence in men.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ which appeared in the medical journal Urology _ is
the first published study on women and Viagra, though several
others are currently under way.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, also known as sildenafil, works by enhancing the effects
of nitric oxide, thereby increasing blood flow to the genitals. In
men, the measure of the drug's effectiveness is an ability to
achieve erection. In women, its potential utility is more difficult
to discern.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million prescriptions have been written for Viagra
worldwide, $788 million worth last year alone, according to Pfizer.
The cultural phenomenon even has its own television spokesperson:
former presidential candidate Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug has been marketed to men, many women who suffer
from sexual problems _ from dryness to a lack of sensation or
painful intercourse _ are hoping it might make a difference for
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who did not administer placebos in his study, says more
research needs to be conducted on women and their definition of
sexual dysfunction before the effectiveness of Viagra in women can
be determined with certainty. Researchers who follow women's
sexuality have wrestled with this dilemma for years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With men its easier _ with men it's like `Uh-oh, they don't
have an erection,' '' Kaplan said. ``With women it's more
complicated: Some define it as not in the mood, some can't be
aroused, some say they don't lubricate well, some say they can't
get an orgasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Berman, a urologist at Boston University Medical
School who has studied the use of Viagra in women, says Kaplan's
study is inconclusive because it doesn't take into account such
complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with it is that issues surrounding emotional
relationships and psychological factors were not addressed,'' said
Berman, who also directs BU's Women's Sexual Health Clinic. ``As we
know, you cannot just treat women with pills and send them out
hoping things will approve.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who has administered Viagra to women as part of an
ongoing University of Maryland study, believes the drug ``does
significantly improve sexual response'' in some women.
</P>
<P>
   At the BU clinic, the drug is prescribed as part of a
comprehensive program that includes counseling and sex therapy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants in that program is a Massachusetts woman
in her early 50s who began using Viagra last July, four years after
a hysterectomy rendered her unable to achieve a full orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is helpful for women,'' Mary says. ``It's not
that it makes you horny, it's that when a woman is being stimulated
it's very helpful to have more intense sensations. . . . It's more
like if you were 22 again.''

THE LOVELORN LEARN TO LASH OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
(lh) 
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Suzanne Yalof was brusquely informed by her boyfriend that
their romance had run its course, she did what lots of jilted women
do: She shed copious tears, took to her bed and ate more Oreos than
were good for her. When those time-tested remedies failed, she
confided in friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get out of my funk,'' recalled Ms. Yalof, 31,
the senior fashion editor at Glamour magazine. ``But I was telling
the same stories over and over, and I could see that my friends
couldn't deal with me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she committed her misery to a spiral-bound notebook. Her
late-night jottings, by turns doleful and caustically funny, begat
``Getting Over John Doe: A Story of Love, Heartache and Surviving
With Style'' (Morrow), aimed at women in their 20s and 30s. With
her book's publication this month, Ms. Yalof added her voice to a
swelling chorus of the lovelorn: performance artists, Internet
entrepreneurs, comedians and writers, all determined to bear their
pain, and to bare it, in the most public way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a minitrend in book publishing that has women coming
out and saying, `We've been dumped, and we're not going to take it
quietly,''' said Laura Mathews, formerly Glamour's book editor, who
is now a senior editor at G.P. Putnam's Sons. The mother of all
score-settling breakup memoirs is now landing in stores: ``Monica's
Story'' by Andrew Morton (St. Martin's), in which the former White
House intern hauls out the heavy artillery to describe the last day
of her relationship with the president, which she calls D-Day,
short for Dump Day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest twist on breakup memoirs blends racy confession with
self-help (although Ms. Lewinsky's book, strictly speaking, is not
meant as an advice tome). Building on last year's successful advice
guides like ``How to Dump a Guy'' (Workman) and ``How to Heal the
Hurt by Hating'' (Ballantine), a flurry of new titles has arrived,
including ``The Breakup Book'' (Warner Books) and the forthcoming
``Breakup Girl'' (Little, Brown).
</P>
<P>
   All offer sympathy spiked with vitriol. Their writers engage in
a kind of venting that they seem to regard as a birthright,
gleefully outing their boyfriends as cads, and inciting readers to
act out revenge fantasies. If their message isn't radical, their
tone assuredly is: the young authors lash out with a candor that
even their mothers, from the feminist generation of the 1970s,
could not have matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an era of personal filibustering,'' said Lynn
Harris, whose alter ego is Breakup Girl, of the book and the Web
site. ``That didn't happen in our mothers' time. We didn't share so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were women so self-vindicating. In a typical passage, Ms.
Yalof is only half joking when she urges her readers: ``Stop
questioning yourself. You must never lose perspective; it's all his
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yalof confides in one chapter that in the weeks just after
her breakup, she stooped to such tactics as grilling her friends
about her ex and imploring her housekeeper to spy on him.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Ms. Yalof's brand of confession was rare. But
now it is standard fare on daytime talk shows, television sitcoms
and in pseudo-memoirs like ``Bridget Jones' Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   The new books drop the mask of fiction, buttonholing readers
with gory real-life details. More significant, they dispense with
the platitudes on which conventional self-help books thrive. Monica
Sheehan said she wrote ``The Breakup Book'' as an antidote to the
kinds of manuals that encourage women to salve their wounds by
taking solitary walks and consulting their ``inner child.'' Ms.
Sheehan has little use for such advice, which she lumps under
psychobabble and ersatz spirituality. ``When you've been dumped,
you don't walk in the woods and meditate,'' she said. ``Who has
time?''
</P>
<P>
   In her greeting-card-size paperback, subtitled ``To Keep
Yourself Together the First 28 Days,'' Ms. Sheehan doesn't
prescribe solutions; instead, she commiserates. She outlines
standard acts of self-indulgence: a day in bed watching the Home
Shopping Network (Day 3), discovering an affinity for Gloria
Estefan and the Carpenters (Day 4) or shearing off your hair (Day
13).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yalof, a self-styled Elisabeth Kuebler-Ross of post-breakup
trauma, ushers her readers through her own version of the stages of
mourning: denial, depression, self-castigation and acceptance. In
``John Doe,'' she dispenses homilies like hot chicken soup: ``Do
all the things he always hated,'' she enjoins. ``Eat beef jerky.
Don't shave your legs for a week.'' She also cautions readers:
``Don't drink and dial. There's no bigger turnoff than a woman who
is slurring over the phone, begging for sex.'' Instead, she urges
fellow sufferers to ``misbehave a little'' and to ``have the last
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yalof has hers, taking an occasional swipe at her former
boyfriend in her book. In a section that assigns names of states to
the varieties of lovemaking _ Louisiana ranks high as ``spicy and
erotic'' _ her ex is Connecticut, ``predictable and bland.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts view such outbursts as a healthy expression of
solidarity among women. These authors ``are making connections,''
said Lyn Mikel Brown, who wrote the recent ``Raising Their Voices:
The Politics of Girls' Anger'' (Harvard University Press). ``They
begin to understand that this isn't just about them and their hurt
feelings that day. It's a generational thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new fervor for ex-bashing and public hair tearing has
some people baffled. Wendy Shalit, the author of ``A Return to
Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue'' (Free Press), an argument
for the sexual decorum of the 1950s, pines for an era when women
shared their romantic bereavement only with those they loved and
trusted. ``In recent times, people have lost the habit of confiding
in their friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest self-help guides may have no new cure for heartbreak.
But they prove, once again, that writing about it is the best
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every person who is bemoaning a breakup, there's someone
composing a hilarious haiku about their breakup,'' Ms. Harris
observed. ``If you can write a witty poem about your sorrow, then
you must be doing OK.''

<P>
   Stocks under rocks. They're every investor's dream _ potentially
lucrative companies that for one reason or another have failed to
garner Wall Street's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But for a group of graduate and undergraduate students at Tulane
University in New Orleans, the thrill of unearthing such companies
is part of the academic regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The students publish the Burkenroad Reports, which provide
investment research on various Southern companies. The program
issues an annual compendium, roughly 40 pages long, and individual
reports in the fall and winter; quarterly updates are being
planned. The students' work looks and reads much like Wall Street
analyst reports.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the program's success is that money managers
and individual investors seem to be paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bryan Dutt, managing partner at Ironman Energy Capital,
an investment firm in Houston, and Jeremy T. Crigler, who runs
Trusten Capital Partners, a hedge fund in Durham, N.C. Both have
subscribed to Burkenroad Reports for several years.
</P>
<P>
   They like the reports' emphasis on small companies that because
of their location, size or line of business have received the cold
shoulder from most Wall Street analysts. And both say the reports
offer an objectivity they don't find in other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street research is virtually meaningless, because it's
typically geared toward generating underwriting business,'' said
Dutt, who typically buys one or two stocks the students recommend
each year. ``With the students' reports, we at least feel we're
getting an unbiased, impartial stock opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Crigler agreed. ``Unlike the rest of Wall Street, the students
don't have a `buy' rating on everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The students write the publications, named after William B.
Burkenroad, an alumnus and benefactor of the university's A.B.
Freeman School of Business, as part of a finance class at the
school. Investors can pull the reports off the students' Web page
(www.burkenroad.org) or receive a year's paper copies for a $100
contribution, meant to defray printing and mailing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are mailed to 2,500 professional money managers and
1,000 other subscribers. Charles Hickman, a project director at the
International Association for Management Education, which
represents 900 business schools worldwide, said Burkenroad Reports
may be the only student equity-analysis program to which outside
investors subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   The program was started in 1993 with the encouragement of Peter
Ricchiuti, a former Kidder Peabody stockbroker who is still the
high-energy director of the program as well as an assistant dean at
the Freeman school. The initial goals were to expose Tulane's
business students to the rigors of Wall Street-style analysis and
to generate some publicity for the school. Since the start of the
program, 400 students have contributed to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 36 companies covered in the latest reports will not
win awards for glamour. The crop includes manufacturers of
wrought-iron lawn furniture, rice mixes, auto parts, pool supplies
and industrial valves.
</P>
<P>
   The students have a ``buy'' rating on Cal-Maine Foods, a large
producer of eggs. Its stock has shown weakness over the past year,
closing on Friday at just $5.25 a share. But the students say that
the company, based in Jackson, Miss., is likely to benefit from
consolidation in its industry and that it has a healthy balance
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   They also like Rankin Automotive, a regional auto parts supplier
in Alexandria, La., that has reduced costs by building a new
distribution facility. Another favorite, Bayou Steel, a steel
producer in Laplace, La., has managed to solve nagging labor
problems but trades at a low price; it closed on Friday at $3.875,
or just 2.2 times the students' earnings estimate of $1.75 a share
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the students, the analysis means considerable
number-crunching, a visit to each company in the fall, and calls to
competitors and customers. In their research, the students have run
into their share of sweet-talking executives, as well as some
adventures: They got lost in a sugar cane field, watched the
slaughter of thousands of chickens at a processing plant and
visited an offshore oil rig by helicopter as a hurricane
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Ricchiuti typically picks the companies that the students cover,
basing his choices on the businesses' long-term prospects. Since
1994, the recommended stocks have returned 12.4 percent a year on
average, compared with 10.1 percent for the Russell 2000 index of
small-capitalization stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricchiuti said many recommended stocks had suffered recently
because so many are small-capitalization or energy stocks _
categories that have been poor performers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is the students' secret to success? Paul Vallone, a
graduate student, says part of it is the focused approach to
investing. ``We don't cover the Dells or Intels of the world,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Ricchiuti usually chooses companies near New Orleans so that
they can be visited easily. But he also sticks to small and
medium-sized companies that have less than $500 million in market
capitalization and are being followed by no more than two or three
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the reports focused on just six Louisiana companies.
Now, the 36 companies they cover are in four states: Louisiana,
Texas, Mississippi and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   One big hit is Books-a-Million, a regional bookseller based in
Birmingham, Ala. The students stumbled on it last year, in part
because air fares between New Orleans to Birmingham were
appealingly low. When the students visited the company in early
September, its stock had been trading in the range of $2 to $4 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   In November, however, the company announced that it was
broadening its ability to sell over the Internet, and the stock
soared from $3 to $47 in two days. Lately, the stock has fallen
back to earth, closing on Friday at $10.625, but the students think
it still holds value.
</P>
<P>
   The students have yet to issue a ``sell'' recommendation on any
company in their universe, in part because Ricchiuti's initial
screening keeps out marginal companies. But as of last week, they
had ``market underperformer'' ratings on 6 of their 36 stocks,
indicating that they expected them to be laggards over the near
term. Among them are Wireless One, a Jackson, Miss., communications
company, and Omni Energy Services, a Carencro, La., oil services
company.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the students have stumbled. Some money managers
fault them for having been as overly bullish as the rest of Wall
Street on energy stocks in 1997; others think the students could
benefit from having broader knowledge of the industries they cover.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Ricchiuti began addressing the second concern by
rejiggering the research program to include eight former students,
who now function as industry experts for the rest of the class.
</P>
<P>
   A pedigree from the Burkenroad program certainly doesn't hurt on
the job-hunting front. According to Ricchiuti, about a third of the
students who have produced the reports have landed jobs in stock
analysis or corporate finance at firms like Goldman Sachs, Merrill
Lynch and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   One satisfied alumnus is Michael J. Sison, who graduated from
the business school last May and accepted a position as an
associate research analyst at McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
``The reports were definitely a selling point,'' Sison said.
</P>
<P>
   Crigler at Trusten Capital Partners is looking at hiring a
current student in the Burkenroad program. ``The students do a
pretty good job,'' he said.

WITHDRAWING FROM LEBANON BECOMES HOT ISSUE IN ISRAELI ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Labor Party candidate for prime minister, Ehud
Barak, succeeded this week in inserting new momentum into the
volatile, personality-based election campaign by introducing an
actual issue into the race, withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   At Barak's initiative, bringing the boys home from southern
Lebanon emerged as the all-Israeli issue of the campaign, after a
rapid growth of the conflict earlier in the week. One after
another, each of the candidates, all of whom have played a direct
role in keeping the Israeli military entrenched in southern
Lebanon, proclaimed that he would move out the army soonest or most
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls published Friday showed that most Israelis
surveyed reacted suspiciously to the candidates, seeing their
promises as election gimmickry, attempts to capitalize on the grief
that followed the deaths of seven Israelis in southern Lebanon
within a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of Israel's major parties are now misleading an
entire people, allowing themselves to play with the public's
emotions on a life-and-death matter,'' Uzi Benziman, a columnist
for the Haaretz newspaper, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Barak ignited a genuinely substantive debate on the
longstanding military presence in Lebanon that pointed up not only
differences between the candidates, but also disagreements within
the military.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Barak, a former general, promised early in the
week that if elected he would withdraw the army in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you that if we create the next government we will be
out of Lebanon by June 2000, with security assurances, and deep
into talks with Syria,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate and another former
general, followed suit, saying he would have the troops out even
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Another former general, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, went
further. He proposed a delay in the election, scheduled for May 17,
and the formation of an emergency unity government to move out the
troops even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Sharon had floated a trial balloon with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's consent or acted on his own.
For his part, Netanyahu railed against the idea of setting
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates, and almost everyone in Israel, want to see
the troops come home after 17 years of fighting a low-level war
against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates say they believe that Syria controls
Hezbollah and that Syria wants the Golan Heights returned in
exchange for ending the guerrillas' fight against Israel. All three
say a withdrawal from Lebanon has to involve Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to Netanyahu, Barak and Mordechai pledge to
restart negotiations with Syria as an integral part of a withdrawal
plan. They are buoyed by opinion polls, which consistently show
that most Israelis support returning part of the Golan Heights to
Syria to bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Syrians see that they are up against an honest and
truthful negotiator who is capable of making decisions and carrying
them out, we will be able to carry out speedy negotiations,''
Mordechai said in a policy statement printed Friday in the Yedioth
Ahronoth newspaper. ``I can reveal here that had we carried out the
Wye agreements, the Syrians, with American support, would have been
ready to restart negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai was referring to the land-for-security peace pact
negotiated in Wye, Md., in October, before he was dismissed as
defense minister. The agreement has been frozen by the Netanyahu
government, which says the Palestinians are not complying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than Syria, Netanyahu prefers to deal with Beirut,
seeking Lebanese cooperation for the secure withdrawal of Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is now in the Lebanese court,'' Netanyahu wrote in a
policy statement in Yedioth Ahronoth.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates advocates a unilateral withdrawal, a move
supported by a substantial minority of Israelis who say a decisive
action has to be taken to extricate Israel from a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates accept the Israeli army position _ that such a
withdrawal would serve to pull the fighting into northern Israel,
because Hezbollah does not recognize the border and sets its sights
on the Galilee, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, acknowledged this
week that there is disagreement within the army on that assessment,
especially as casualties mount and some officers come to believe
that a war against a guerrilla army in a foreign country cannot be
won.
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview in Haaretz Friday, a senior army officer who
was not identified said: ``Have you been to South Lebanon lately?
Have you seen what kind of outposts we've built there? We are
sitting in these huge armored fortresses, which, of course, invite
enemy shelling, and we make the convoys leading to them into easy
targets. Little by little, we're becoming crusaders who primarily
guard ourselves.''

ADS OFFERING $50,000 TO HIGH-IQ EGG DONORS STIR DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The wealthy suitor advertising in the Harvard
Crimson seeks a woman who is tall, athletic, and smart. This,
thought freshman Kat Naessen as she read it, could be describing
her. She's 5 feet 11. She swims. Her college board scores topped
1400. For a week she struggled to decide whether to answer the
stranger. Finally, she replied with a feeler via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This suitor is no love-starved man seeking someone to share
caviar by candlelight. This is a childless couple offering $50,000
to an ``intelligent, athletic egg donor'' who ``must be at least
5'10,'' have a 1400+ SAT score (and) possess no major family
medical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Naessen is among about 200 women who have responded to the
half-page ads that appeared in the Crimson and student papers in
six other top universities. As three-quarters of the women are
expected to do, the 19-year-old pre-med student from Belgium ended
up withdrawing her name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   What tempted Naessen _ and what troubles ethicists _ is the
amount of money offered. The figure is so high it suddenly ups the
ante for egg donation into the realm of paying handsomely for the
gamete itself, not merely compensating the donor for her time and
trouble. What dissuaded Naessen were the invasiveness of the
medical procedure to harvest eggs and a growing uneasiness about
the very money that attracted her in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty thousand dollars is halfway through medical school,''
says Naessen. ``But I kind of felt weird about it. It's kind of
like prostitution, selling part of your body.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertised compensation, combined with the specificity of
traits the couple seek, has reignited debate about the ethics of
genetics and money in high-tech fertility treatments. Until now,
fees to egg donors of $7,500 were considered high. Last summer, the
ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,
which holds that compensation for the inconvenience of donating
eggs is OK, reopened the issue after some New York clinics doubled
their fees from $2,500 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really forces the question of whether you want a market
in human eggs,'' says Boston University medical ethicist George
Annas. ``With $50,000 there's no illusion that you're doing
anything but buying eggs that have the possibility of producing a
child with certain characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it unethical to help someone who's helping you? No,'' says
Darlene Pinkerton, a representative of the San Diego law firm, Hitt
&AMP; Pinkerton, that is brokering the arrangement Naessen saw offered
in the Crimson. ``The family is a family of means. They understand
the cost of college. They're trying to find someone who resembles
their family and they want to be kind in return.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Crimson, Pinkerton put the ad, in staggered
placements from late February to early March, in student newspapers
at MIT, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, and
the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the couple, who Pinkerton says do not plan to meet
the donor, will make a selection after screening candidates'
physical and psychological health. The donor will then take
hormones to stimulate her ovaries and her eggs will be harvested
via vaginal ultrasound. The entire process is not without some
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Like Naessen, Harvard freshman Laura Barnard, 18, meets the
requirements spelled out in the advertisement. A varsity basketball
player from Chicago, she's 5 feet 10 inches tall. ``It's something
I would never consider. It's kind of scary,'' she says. ``It seems
like easy money but it's not. The emotional damage you don't really
consider when you look at an ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day the topic came up again at lunch. A friend of
Barnard's, 18-year-old Abigail Tucker of Connecticut, would
consider it if she weren't 2 inches shy of the height requirement.
After the ad appeared, Tucker left a message on her mother's
answering machine saying she'd found a way to make a quick 50
grand. She wouldn't have to work in CVS this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained it in a more serious way when she called back. She
was more against it morally. She thought I would have some
responsibility to some kid who had half my DNA,'' Tucker says. ``I
said that was ridiculous. The sperm is just as responsible as the
egg for creating the child and there's really no taboo against
sperm banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problems with it morally, but it's dangerous,'' she
says. ``When I saw that price up to $50,000, it festered in my mind
and I began to consider it. But I don't want to be a subpar egg
donor. They're paying $50,000 and they have certain criteria in
mind and I don't possess all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Pinkerton placed virtually the same ad for the
same couple in the Crimson and MIT's paper, promising a ``large
financial incentive'' but not listing the $50,000 fee. The ads
yielded few results.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Pinkerton says, she approached Harvard's women's
basketball coach, Kathleen Delaney-Smith, about distributing
literature to the team. Delaney-Smith turned her down, but while on
campus, Pinkerton made a quiet overture to one athlete, which
ultimately did not lead to a match.
</P>
<P>
   Ads for egg donors are nothing new in college newspapers. The
OPTIONS National Fertility Registry, for instance, has been seeking
egg donors through student papers since 1992. About 18 months ago,
spurred by client demand for a more direct approach, OPTIONS began
running individualized ads in Ivy League papers. One January ad in
the Crimson offered $7,500 to a donor who is ``5'5'' or taller,
Caucasian, slim, with dark hair, intelligent and kind,'' and
another offered $5,000 for ``that special person who is 5'1''-5'6''
with blond, red, strawberry blond or light brown hair and blue,
green or hazel eyes.'' Since then the registry, fearing bidding
wars, has capped fees at $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also crept into classrooms at Harvard. Government
professor Michael Sandel includes a lesson on sperm banks,
surrogate mothers, and egg donors in his popular moral reasoning
course, ``Justice,'' which draws 700 students. Each year he polls
his class on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the readiness of a large majority of students to
allow the buying and selling of sperm and eggs and of surrogacy,''
Sandel says. ``They see the moral issues, but they think the
principle of individual choice outweighs the moral importance of
preserving certain spheres of life from markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Naessen answered the ad after ``big ethical discussions'' with
friends. ``Nobody likes the idea of having a child walking around
somewhere. We were wondering if the child would ever know,'' she
says. ``A couple of people said it's a good cause. It's helping
people who want to have babies. I wouldn't have responded if two of
my friends hadn't been really positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The way varsity volleyball player Katherine Hart sees it, ``the
audience they're trying to reach is a pretty small one and they
wanted to make sure the compensation made them take notice.'' It
did. Hart, who is 19, and her 21-year-old teammate Linda Jellison,
who meet the specifications for height and SAT scores, both saw the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   For a day, Hart, a 6-foot sophomore from California, considered
answering. ``It was like, wow, $50,000. That might be useful,'' she
says. ``But just knowing I might have a child somewhere is slightly
more than I want to deal with right now. It's almost like they're
paying for these tall, athletic genes. That's kind of stretching
the limits of what I think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jellison, a 5-foot-11-inch junior from Quincy, was curious
enough that she called her mother, a nurse, to find out more about
the medical risks. ``Would they be satisfied if they got my
mother's side of the genes, who's 5 feet 5?'' Jellison wonders. ``I
think this crosses my boundary of morals a little. Having a child
out there that's biologically mine would call into question things
I believe, even though I'm not really sure what. I really wouldn't
want to find out down the road what those things are.''

CLINTON SAYS HE DIDN'T WATCH LEWINSKY INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in some of his most expansive
public comments recently on Monica S. Lewinsky, said Friday he
hoped the former White House intern ``will be permitted to go on
with her life, and I hope it will be a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this was a pretty tough thing for everybody
involved, and I wish her well,'' said Clinton, referring to the
13-month sex scandal that rocked his presidency and led to the
first Senate impeachment trial in 131 years. ``I hope it works out
all right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's made his comments in response to a question asked at a
joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not see Lewinsky's television interview Wednesday
night on ABC with Barbara Walters, which attracted about 50 million
viewers, and, therefore, could not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was not paid for the Walters interview, but she is
expected to make millions from distribution rights from a British
television interview, for which she was paid, and a new book titled
``Monica's Story'' that details her relationship with Clinton and
the resulting investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Lewinsky should profit financially from the
ordeal, Clinton said, ``You know, that's not a decision for me to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't wish anyone ill who was caught up in this,
and she paid quite a high price for a long time, and I feel badly
for that. So I just hope it works out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said, ``The American people are virtually screaming
at us to get on with their lives and their business and do their
business, and I'm going to do my best to do that as well as I
possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stated his desire to move beyond the scandal at home and
at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the efforts that I have made and that I continue
to make every day at home and at work will bear fruit,'' the
president said. ``And I hope that all the people who have been hurt
by this, including totally innocent people who have massive legal
bills, will get the help they need. And I'm determined to do what I
can to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``One of the things I've learned, that I've had to
relearn all over again....is that all I can control in life is what
I do and what I say. And if I do and say the right things, then
that's the thing that's best for me and and my family and for the
American people. And that's what I'm concentrating on doing.''

GERMANS CONDUCT A TORTUOUS DEBATE ON THEIR RETURN TO THE
REICHSTAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ E. Kenedy, an American soldier, was here on May 13,
1945. So, too, a couple of days later, was one Lucia Petrova of the
Red army. Both wrote their names on the walls of the Reichstag just
after its capture at the end of World War II, and today their
jubilant graffiti are visible once again.
</P>
<P>
   History _ a staggering concentration of it _ has been laid bare
in the Reichstag before it becomes the seat of the German
Parliament again next month, 66 years after a fire there summed up
Hitler's view of parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So bare lies the past, in fact, that even the vulgar anti-German
insults of victorious Soviet soldiers, scrawled across the interior
of the building in 1945, have been exposed by removing fake
plasterboard walls put up to cover them in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach was radical, based in the view that the history
of the building should not be sanitized,'' said Sir Norman Foster,
the British architect who has rebuilt the Reichstag. ``And the fact
that Germany accepted this approach shows to me what an
extraordinarily open and progressive society it has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there is something ``open,'' if not plain
masochistic, about Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's going past
Russian obscenities to reach his blue-doored parliamentary office.
Schroeder's father died in 1944 on his way back from the Russian
front.
</P>
<P>
   The new glass dome on the building also speaks of postwar
Germany's overriding preoccupation with transparency. It is an
architectural coup that has become the symbol of the new Berlin
skyline and is as bold as I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But openness is by no means the whole story. The return to the
Reichstag, symbol of German democracy but also of disaster, has
provided the occasion for a national debate of quintessentially
German tortuousness.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was inevitable, for when Foster hands over a
symbolic Reichstag key to Wolfgang Thierse, the parliamentary
speaker, on April 19, the gesture will at once open the new
Parliament and usher in the new ``Berlin Republic,'' rising where
the ruins of Nazi Germany lay 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the nonsense about some evil spirit lurking
there,'' said Michael Cullen, a Berlin-based historian. ``Hitler
only set foot in the place three times. But this is a new beginning
for Germany, one decided without a plebiscite, so the tension
between past and future is understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the debate lies an evident concern that bringing
Parliament back to the massive gray stone edifice erected under
Bismarck in 1894 may tempt the various ghosts _ of imperialism, of
fascism, of communism and of plain old tragedy _ that have
inhabited or surrounded the Reichstag in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, said Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig, a former justice
minister, demonstrate that Germans still ``face their history with
mental tension.'' The tension has taken several forms.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the problem of the eagle, symbol of Germany. A
bird, in most places, is a bird. But not in Germany, where the fact
that Hitler often spoke, as at Nuremberg in 1934, in front of
towering, sharp-clawed eagles has imbued ornithological questions
with a special sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Should the eagle remain the pudgy thing, known affectionately as
``the fat hen,'' that has long adorned the glass Bundestag building
in Bonn, or should the eagle recover a touch of Prussian virility
for the return to the Reichstag in Berlin?
</P>
<P>
   Foster favored virility. After studying more than 235 eagles
that have appeared in Prussian and German history, he came up with
a creature that was ``leaner and keener.'' The bird, he said, had
``a twinkle in its eye and was more dynamic, a touch playful, not
in repose but in flight.'' In short, a post-neurotic, aquiline
eagle.
</P>
<P>
   But after exhaustive debate, his proposal was rejected last year
by the 35-member committee overseeing the reconstruction. The heirs
to Ludwig Gies, the artist who designed the Bonn eagle, had
objected.
</P>
<P>
   So now a 26-by-21-foot eagle that is 60 percent bigger than the
Bonn bird, but of the same form, hangs in the 669-member chamber of
the Reichstag. With the low public galleries protruding above the
mauve seats seemingly lifted from the nearest office equipment
store, the docile Rhineland eagle adds to a feeling of informal
intimacy, the very opposite of Prussian militarism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the bird brouhaha came the Reich rumpus. ``Reich'' means
empire. But there is no more German empire. Three existed in
history: Charlemagne's, Bismarck's and Hitler's. The last of them,
of course, tainted the word.
</P>
<P>
   So should the Reichstag change its name to Bundestag, as Thierse
has suggested? Or should it become the Plenarbereich (Plenary
Area), as several other members of Parliament have argued? Or
perhaps the Reichstagsgebaude (Reichstag building), a name favored
by Dietmar Kansy, a Christian Democratic politician?
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Finance Ministry's imminent move from Bonn to a
Berlin building that was once the Nazi-era Air Ministry of Herman
Goering, Werner Schulz of the environmentalist Green Party said:
``Of course the Reichstag's name should be changed. Who would call
the new Finance Ministry the Reichluftfaehrtministerium?''
</P>
<P>
   Who indeed? But ``Reichstag'' appears likely to stick, as it has
through an extraordinary history. This has included being a center
of war propaganda during World War I, the Parliament of the Weimar
Republic and the site of a Nazi exhibition in 1938 on ``The Eternal
Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the border between the British- and
Soviet-occupied sectors of Berlin ran through the damaged masonry,
and when the Berlin wall was built in 1961, the Reichstag found
itself in the West, but pushed up against the wall in a kind of
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   When the building was redone in the 1960s, the aim seemed to be
to play down its significance. The west entrance _ now revived as
the main entrance under the ringing words ``Dem Deutschen Volke''
(``To the German People'') engraved in 1916 _ was closed. Walls
went up to mask any notion of pomp or space.
</P>
<P>
   It is these walls that have now been stripped away to reveal
graffiti and grandeur. Glass and aluminum contrast with old stone
ornaments to create a disarming impression of modernity
superimposed on a many-layered past.
</P>
<P>
   Above the chamber in the new glass dome, which replaced a stone
dome dismantled in 1954, 360 mirrors reflect light downward. Far
below the chamber is a system for storing heat produced by an
ecologically advanced technology based on the burning of rapeseed
oil.
</P>
<P>
   It is very Berlin somehow, this bold, sometimes jarring,
juxtaposition of past and future, of violence and ecology, of
history and hope. And it inevitably raises the question: Will all
this be reconciled at last?
</P>
<P>
   From the top of the dome, reached by climbing a circular ramp, a
360-degree view of this restless city stretches away into the
distance: the column symbolizing Prussia's triumph against France
in 1871, the Soviet memorial, a last fragment of the Berlin wall,
crane after crane hoisting the new Berlin into being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin has an incredible charge,'' Foster said, ``and I wanted
the Reichstag to be forward-looking.'' But as the churning view
from its dome suggests, the Parliament of a thousand mutations
still lies in the midst of a torrent of change whose ultimate
direction seems uncertain.

GOLF EQUIPMENT COUNTERFEITERS REAP BIG PROFITS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Ga., China, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan)   By DENNIS BLANK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Within hours after the Taylor Made Golf Co.
introduced its new $300 FireSole driver at the recent Professional
Golfers' Merchandise Show here, counterfeiters were hustling their
own versions for less than half that price at the same trade show.
</P>
<P>
   That was one example of a brazen and widespread underground in
counterfeit golf equipment, a market that has been estimated at up
to $4 billion a year, more than the entire $2.5 billion legitimate
golf-equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Also flooding the market are knockoffs, or imitations that do
not try to pass for the real thing but might violate patent
protections. The line between counterfeits and knockoffs can be
blurry, but both are definitely having an economic impact on sales
for an industry already in a slump. Despite an increase in the
number of people golfing, sales this year are expected to be flat
at best and possibly down as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is definitely getting worse,'' said George Abbott,
managing director of the International Anti-Counterfeiting
Coalition in Washington. Thomas Cove, vice president for
governmental relations at the Sports Goods Manufacturers
Association, said: ``Counterfeiting chases the money. It is a
criminal syndicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Golfers' Association declined to comment, but
one lawyer said that knockoffs and counterfeits were being sold
openly at the association's most recent trade show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a huge effect on the industry,'' said the lawyer,
Timothy L. Epp, who represents the Carlsbad, Calif.-based Taylor
Made. ``But we really don't know the size of this underground. I
don't think we can ever stop the knockoff business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Customs Service puts it at $4 billion annually,
Cove says that estimate is far too high. He estimates the total
U.S. sales of all counterfeit sports equipment, including apparel,
at just $2 billion annually, compared to $60 billion in wholesale
revenues from legitimate sales.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Made has won judgments against Taiwanese manufacturers.
But, Epp said, the copyright infringements are costing the company
sales and damaging its good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These knockoffs and counterfeit goods are often misrepresented
to unsuspecting consumers to be exactly the same as genuine Taylor
Made products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement is cracking down. At the end of the recent
Professional Golfers' Association show, Customs agents arrested 12
people, including four Taiwanese nationals, in Houston, Los
Angeles, Atlanta and Savannah, Ga. The arrests concluded a two-year
investigation that resulted in more than 300 seizures of phony golf
clubs with an estimated total value of $6 million. By comparison,
seizures by Customs in 1997 at ports like Los Angeles and San
Francisco netted an estimated total of $1.1 million in counterfeit
golf-club parts coming in from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 men have all been arraigned in federal courts on charges
of trafficking in counterfeit goods, which carry sentences of up to
10 years in prison and $2 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Customs said its agents had infiltrated the underground network
and discovered that most of the counterfeit components were made in
Vietnam, China, Taiwan and Thailand. Once in this country, the
clubs are sold to distributors, who do business in hotel rooms and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site that industry lawyers say is a particular cause for
concern is Chip Shot Golf, which sells what it calls ``Callaway
wood look-alikes'' for $139.99, far below the Callaway Golf Co.'s
Biggest Big Bertha, which can retail for more than $500. Chip Shot
Golf declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Golf, the leading manufacturer of golf equipment, has
more than two dozen civil actions pending in the courts and has
pressured authorities in Taiwan to arrest offenders. More than
110,000 counterfeit clubs have been seized there in raids on
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a brazen and reckless move to copy the technological
innovations of others and blatantly infringe on patents granted _ a
move that we cannot and will not allow to go unchallenged,'' said
Steve McCracken, a lawyer for Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Taiwanese authorities arrested Lin Ping-Chun, the
owner of Lin Kou Golf near Taipei, who had served a six-month
sentence for counterfeiting violations. Tung Uei Industries in
Taichung City was also raided, with the police arresting some
company officials and confiscating an estimated $65,000 worth of
counterfeit Callaway clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to wage the war against counterfeiters of our
products because such activities hurt consumers, our retail
accounts, as well as employees and shareholders,'' said Ely
Callaway, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway's lawyers say Jason Tse Lung Lin, through a company
called Impression Golf, capitalized on the popularity of Callaway
clubs by using names like ``Big Brothers'' and ``Big Bursar'' and a
logo virtually identical to Big Bertha's. Callaway was granted an
injunction by a federal court to put Impression Golf out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   One Customs agent, Joseph Henderson, said undercover agents
infiltrated the network of Asian golf equipment makers and set
themselves up as importers for two of them after making purchases.
He said that he does not think organized crime is involved, but
that these Asian companies ``are organized like any other business
in terms of marketing, distributing and shipping.''

   A Fund Group, Alone at Last &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the mutual fund group nobody seemed to want. Now senior
managers of Robertson Stephens Investment Management _ which
manages $3.5 billion in assets, including a stable of 10
high-profile mutual funds _ have completed their purchase of the
firm from BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   The management firm was originally acquired by the old
BankAmerica in October 1997, when it was still part of Robertson
Stephens &AMP; Co., the investment bank. Then came BankAmerica's sale
last September to Nationsbank, which took BankAmerica's name but
had no use for Robertson Stephens or its money management unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, BankBoston stepped in to buy Robertson Stephens,
the investment bank, but not the money management arm.
</P>
<P>
   The management group, led by G. Randy Hecht, president and chief
executive, and Paul Stephens, a Robertson Stephens co-founder,
rechristened the firm as the RS Investment Management Co.,
effective last Monday. Terms were not disclosed. As of Wednesday,
the funds also changed their names, each replacing the Robertson
Stephens moniker with ``RS.'' &QL;

   Since 1994, United States growth funds have trounced their
value-oriented brethren in performance. But it seems that foreign
funds, which aren't usually divided by their growth or value
orientation, have experienced a similar phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in
Chicago, foreign funds with a consistent and pronounced growth
orientation in their portfolios have beaten their value
counterparts in each of the last four years _ 11.33 percent to
10.82 percent in 1995, 14.88 percent to 14.79 percent in 1996, 6.54
percent to 5.4 percent in 1997 and 17.15 to 9.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Why the similarity between domestic and foreign funds?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had similar conditions, particularly when you look at
Europe versus the United States,'' said Kevin McDevitt, a
Morningstar analyst. Among them, he said, were falling interest
rates, low inflation and strong earnings growth. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON WISHES LEWINSKY 'GOOD LIFE'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton said Friday he hopes Monica
Lewinsky has ''a good life,'' adding that he regrets the pain she's
endured in the eye of the sex-and-deception storm that nearly
swamped his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her
life, and I hope it will be a good life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish anyone ill who was caught up in this, and she
paid quite a high price for a long time, and I feel badly for
that,'' said Clinton. ``This was a pretty tough thing for everybody
involved, and I wish her well. I hope it works out all right for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks, his most personal to date on the
former White House intern, at a joint news conference with Italian
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked about Lewinsky in the wake of a
publicity blitz that included her two-hour interview on ABC
Wednesday night and the release Thursday of a book by British
celebrity biographer Andrew Morton.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Monica's Story,'' purports to give Lewinsky's
version of an intimate Oval Office relationship that Clinton first
denied, and later admitted, leading to his impeachment by the House
in December and his Senate acquittal just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who told the nation in September he had ''sinned,'' had
sought forgiveness and was working with clergy to try to mend the
damage the relationship had caused in his personal life, said
Friday he remains on repentance road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the efforts that I have made, and that I continue
to make every day, at home and at work, will bear fruit,'' said
Clinton. ``And I
</P>
<P>
   hope that all the people who have been hurt by this, including
totally innocent people who have massive legal bills, will get the
help they need, and I'm determined to do what I can to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about the propriety of Lewinsky profiting,
through book deals and commercial interviews, from her role in a
scandal that shook the nation and drove its political institutions
to distraction for 13 painful months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that's not a decision for me to make,'' he said.
``One of the things I've learned, that I've had to relearn all over
again in this last four-year episode, is that all I can control in
life is what I do and what I say,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if I do and say the right things, then that's the thing
that's best for me and my family and for the American
</P>
<P>
   people.''

DESPITE JOB GROWTH IN FEBRUARY, WAGE PRESSURE REMAINS SUBDUED AND
MARKETS SOAR
</HEADLINE>

(fe) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the U.S.
economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained
remarkably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   For bond and stock investors on Friday, the combination eased
fear of inflation, setting off a wild celebration. Traders drove
long-term interest rates down, and the Dow Jones industrial average
soared, rising 2.8 percent, or 268.68 points, to close at a record
9,736.08.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by a boom in construction and consumer spending, American
employers added 275,000 new jobs to their payrolls, the Labor
Department reported on Friday. Since last Thanksgiving, the economy
has been adding jobs at the staggering pace of 3.2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy isn't losing any steam,'' said Kenneth Goldstein,
an economist at the Conference Board, a private research
organization. ``It's going to be a very strong first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the jobs report, which also showed that the
unemployment rate edged up an insignificant 0.1 percentage points,
to 4.4 percent, and that hourly wages barely budged, appeared to
ease fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve might feel
compelled to raise interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the movie `As Good As It Gets'?'' asked Daniel Eagan,
senior portfolio manager at Black Rock, a Philadelphia investment
firm. ``We are about as close to that as we can be.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economists said the euphoria on Wall Street was
overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities,
warned that the latest evidence did not settle the question of
whether the Federal Reserve might need to act later this year to
try to cool off an overheated economy. ``The labor market may not
have gotten tighter last month,'' he said, ``but we're still
creating jobs at an unsustainable pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The bump in the unemployment rate, for example, does not
necessarily mean that workers are getting easier to find. The Labor
Department says that any change of less than 0.2 percentage points
carries little if any significance. In February, the change
reflected a sharp drop in employment as measured by the so-called
household survey. But it is not unusual for the household survey _
on which the jobless rate is based _ to give a weaker reading than
the more reliable employer survey of actual payroll changes,
according to Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, employment growth in the household survey has lagged
behind for several years. It is also an extremely volatile survey,
having shown a gain of more than 700,000 jobs in January, three
times the increase in the payroll survey, but then registering a
drop of 200,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Wage pressures appeared to ease last month. Hourly wages of
rank-and-file workers, after jumping by a nickel in January, moved
up only 1 cent in February to $13.04.
</P>
<P>
   Yet outside of manufacturing _ which has eliminated 50,000
workers as industrial companies remained under relentless pressure
to cut costs _ virtually every indicator of current and future job
activity was flashing green.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly jobless claims, for instance, have been dropping
steadily, and the measure is now at a 10-year low. The Conference
Board's help-wanted index, which measures demand for workers,
jumped sharply in January. And the latest quarterly survey from
Manpower Inc., a temporary help company based in Milwaukee that
regularly polls 16,000 employers, showed that 29 percent expected
to expand their payrolls this spring while just 6 percent foresaw
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no deterioration of hiring strength,'' said Mitchell
Fromstein, Manpower's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While job growth this fast is a boon for workers, especially the
youngest, least educated and lowest paid, it also carries some
risks for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the recent hot pace slows soon, unemployment is expected
to fall below 4 percent within months, and the economy would be
back in territory not seen since the late 1960s, when demands for
wage increases started to burst out into inflation after a long
period of quiesence.
</P>
<P>
   True, inflation _ instead of rising as many economists had
predicted _ has declined even as unemployment has remained below 5
percent for well over a year. The question is whether it makes
sense to extrapolate that pattern into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers think the labor market is getting more
efficient. ``It looks like something might have changed,'' said
Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University, who is
stydying whether the expanding role of temporary help may be
enabling companies to attract scarce workers without pushing up the
entire wage scale.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, argue
that the United States has had some lucky breaks _ rock bottom
prices for oil and other commodities, a stronger dollar, cheaper
imports _ that are bound to disappear when the world's woes ease.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the future, the juxtaposition of strength in the
mammoth service economy, which employs most Americans, and weakness
in manufacturing has persisted since the Asian financial crisis
erupted in the summer of 1997. The size of the industrial job cuts
in February, however, was something of a surprise because there
have been a flurry of other indicators suggesting the pain was
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   Some cuts were in industries that have long been ailing: the
garment industry lost another 15,000 jobs. Others were in seemingly
healthy sectors, although the Labor Department warned that the
8,000 drop in auto employment was probably a statistical fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Factory workers were not the only ones being dismissed. With
gasoline as low as 80 cents a gallon in many parts of the country,
another 10,000 or so oil workers were cut from rigs, probably to
sign on to construction crews.
</P>
<P>
   Building continued to boom despite a few signs that higher
interest rates may be damping mortgage applications. With mild
weather and strong demand for everything from housing to new shops,
72,000 workers joined construction payrolls in February, bringing
the total added since Labor Day to more than a quarter million.
</P>
<P>
   The lines at cash registers help explain why retailers are
struggling to hang on to workers they might have laid off by now in
most years. They added 123,000 workers, adjusted, like all the
figures, to take account of past seasonal variations. And business
services have been mopping up workers, adding 40,000 new jobs in
areas like computer processing and management consulting. Health
care employment, which has been stagnating for a while, jumped too,
as home care agencies added more nurses and aides.
</P>
<P>
   Even though hourly earnings barely rose, the measure can be
unreliable because its coverage is limited to rank-and-file
workers, and month to month changes are often dominated by
fluctuations in the type of people who happened to get hired that
month. Still, the rise from a year ago was just 3.6 percent, a
slowdown from the rate of last summer.

INCOME TAX ISSUE NOW SQUARELY ON GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ With the House of Representatives' narrow
passage of the first personal income tax in New Hampshire history
Thursday, Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen finds herself at the
epicenter of an upheaval in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the April 1 deadline for finding a new way to fund
public schools, legislators and taxpayers alike are wondering
whether the popular governor will make good on her threat to veto
any income tax not sanctioned by voters in a referendum. The
state's high court, which has been asked for its advisory opinion,
has not yet said whether holding such a binding referendum would be
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation is not resolved by the end of the month, the
portion of local property taxes that funds public schools will
become uncollectable and economic chaos could result.
</P>
<P>
   With a 400-member House and 25-member Senate, which is expected
to also pass the tax bill, New Hampshire has more representatives
per-capita than any other democracy. David Larrabee, a real estate
broker from the central New Hampshire town of Loudon, is one of
them. He is also a Republican who broke with his party over the tax
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always considered myself a conservative Republican and I
still am,'' Larrabee said. ``I was always a diehard about the
pledge,'' he said of the litmus test requiring political candidates
to vow to veto any broad-based tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is that I woke up and realized who was suffering
and who was not. The affluent were having a heyday,'' Larrabee
said. ``I'm still against an income tax, don't get me wrong, but I
don't see anything better and fairer out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, a former state attorney general and longtime
Republican activist still doesn't believe that a general income tax
will come to pass. ``It was sobering this morning to wake up and
look at the headlines,'' Rath said. He does believe the Senate will
pass a tax bill only to have Shaheen veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen is set to announce an alternative tax plan this week.
Her proposal is expected to rely on an expansion of gambling at the
state's four racetracks and a $200 million increase in business
taxes. Rath is betting it will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is in great shape politically. She'll veto (the
income tax bill) without a referendum and say to people that the
only way you'll get me to break the pledge is if you break it
yourself,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   Should voters be given a choice between Shaheen's plan and one
that would fund schools through a 4 percent income tax and a $6 per
$1,000 valutation statewide property tax, Rath thinks voters will
opt to tax businesses instead of themselves. Larrabee isn't so
sure.
</P>
<P>
   The property tax burden has become so onerous that the elderly
are being forced out of their homes, Larrabee said. ``They may get
a surprise. People will only put up with something for so long. The
affluent will go against it because they want to keep paying their
low property tax rates and let the poor communities pay at a higher
rate. If that is made clear to people, they will go with an income
tax as painful as it is,'' Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee's friend and fellow legislator, Robert Clegg,
disagrees. His constituents, the Hudson contractor said, are
telling him they want no income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the plan carry? My personal opinion is that a lot of
the legislators who voted for it told me they honestly believed
that as retired citizens, since Social Security payments are exempt
from the income tax, they wouldn't have to pay.'' Clegg said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides expect the lobbying to be furious in coming weeks.
``Don't let the fact that New Hampshire has a citizen Legislature
fool you. The non-professional nature of it can make it more
(susceptible) to manipulation by special interests,'' said Clarke
Hubbard, an assistant professor of political science at the
University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard doesn't believe there is broad public support for an
income tax. As awareness of the inequities of the current tax
system increase, however, voters may be willing to accept a new tax
to get out from under the heavy property tax burden, he said.

 &HT;    Nonmanagement directors of Coca-Cola get pay boost
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co.'s 11 outside directors are each getting
a $75,000 pay boost _ a 150 percent increase _ for serving on the
company's board.
</P>
<P>
   The new $125,000 annual fee, which went into effect at the
beginning of the year, will come in the form of $50,000 cash and
$75,000 in company stock, according to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's
proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is accumulated for the directors, who have access to
it only after they leave the board.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the annual pay for non-management directors was
$50,000 cash. But more companies are paying directors with at least
some stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing trend to pay part in cash and part in stock,''
said Roger Raber, president of the National Association of
Corporate Directors. ``It ties directors to the performance of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's outside directors also will receive $1,000 for each
meeting they attend, a cut from $1,500 last year. In 1998, there
were six board meetings and several additional committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Jan. 1, Coca-Cola eliminated the outside directors'
retirement plan. Recently, some companies have terminated such
plans, partly because many outside directors already have pensions
with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock closed up $1 Friday at $63.93 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

ALBRIGHT, VISITING INDONESIA, MEETS IMPRISONED SEPARATIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Friday with the East Timorese separatist leader, Xanana Gusmao, who
was brought from house arrest in a downtown bungalow here to the
Indonesian foreign ministry for the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, 53, who was jailed by the Indonesians in 1992 and
released from prison to a lighter form of detention last month, is
seen by many as holding the key to a peaceful transition to
independence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Indonesia, the first by a senior U.S.
official since President Clinton's in 1994, was dominated by talks
over how to prevent a repeat of the civil war in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 invaded and
then annexed.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country and the fourth
most populous nation in the world, has been hit hardest by the
Asian economic crisis, with a steep drop in living standards and a
continuing economic slump expected this year. Ethnic violence has
risen sharply in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie startled the United States and regional
powers in Southeast Asia last month when he announced that he was
prepared to grant East Timor autonomy or, if that was
unsatisfactory to the population there, independence.
</P>
<P>
   Albright listened to proposals from both Habibie and Gusmao
about how the transition on East Timor, a desperately poor region
of 800,000 people on the eastern edge of Indonesia, should be
managed.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech after her meetings, Albright said the United States
favored an ``international presence'' in East Timor but was not
specific about what kind. A senior official traveling with her said
that such a presence could be from the region, the United Nations
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing to the administration is the recent arming,
apparently by the Indonesian military, of people on East Timor who
are in favor staying part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Between 7,000 and 10,000 ``pro-integration'' people have been
armed in recent weeks, according to some estimates, and
administration officials have expressed strong concern that the
violence on East Timor will rise. More than 100,000 people are
reported to have died in the fighting after Indonesia's occupation
of the territory in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary told the Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas,
that the administration believed the arms were being provided by
``elements'' in the Indonesian military, a senior administration
official said. ``We don't know if it's an authorized policy, but we
know it's going on,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference with Albright, Alatas hotly denied that
the Indonesian military was arming people on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the government had reactivated the ``people's
guard'' and was ``selectively arming them, mostly with wooden
sticks.'' He said that in some parts of the country the guard was
being issued rifles but that these rifles were being kept in
military command posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government said last month that it wanted to be
free of East Timor by next January, leaving a very short time for a
transition. One important issue that has to be dealt with is how to
assess what the people of East Timor want: autonomy or
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ruled out a U.N. referendum, and the United
States is not insisting on such a vote. Albright said ``we are open
to suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   During her talks here, Albright also expressed concern that
Indonesia's elections planned for June 7 _ the first multiparty
voting in more than 40 years _ are organized in a free and fair
manner.

AIRPORT WON`T MAKE FEDERAL DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Even though Sea-Tac International Airport won't meet a
federal deadline, the Year 2000 millennium bug won't eat your
luggage at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Jan. 1, Port of
Seattle officials promise.
</P>
<P>
   All 157 computer systems at the port-operated airport will be
clear of potential problems that could bring them to a halt when
the year 2000 arrives, said Bill Swedish, the port's chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the airport won't meet a Federal Aviation
Administration-recommended June 30 target date for Year 2000
computer fixes, Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have all systems fixed by the end of October, which
was our initial target date when we started out to identify
problems in 1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA-recommended date was set after we started, when we
were already involved in our program. We are now on our project
plan and 86 percent complete, but 14 systems will not be done by
June 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 problems stem from the trouble some computer programs
and chips have in recognizing the Year 2000 date, which could lead
them to read the year 2000 as 1900 or prompt a system shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, Sea-Tac will have a backup plan and a contingency
plan for every airport computer system under the port's control,
Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Sea-Tac's baggage-handling conveyers, airfield
runway lights, programmable temperature control systems throughout
Sea-Tac terminals, fire alarm systems, emergency generators,
automated voice recordings, fire trucks, radios and other systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did discover Y2K problems in computer chips aboard the
airport's fire trucks,'' Swedish said. ``They have been fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish and other Sea-Tac officials say that by the end of
October, they will have hunted down and tested every imbedded
computer chip at Sea-Tac and will have replaced all those that
could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we will have all the new ones tested and rehearsed and
have backup and contingency plans in place in case there still are
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Swedish and two other Sea-Tac officials, Burr Stewart,
administrative projects director, and Charles Blood, general
manager of the airfield line of business, received authorization
from Port of Seattle commissioners to spend $36 million to get rid
of Sea-Tac's computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most current projection is that we will not be anywhere
near that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it will be completed at about $13 million to $15
million. We allow some leeway, because you never know if you will
find some non-compliant computer chips that need replacing.''
</P>
<P>
   His assurances do not cover air traffic control at Sea-Tac,
which is handled by the FAA, Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   But they came as the federal Government Accounting Office
reported that about a third of the U.S. airports responding to a
GAO questionaire said they won't meet the June 30 target date for
completing Year 2000 computer fixes and have no procedures to
remain open if computers fail.
</P>
<P>
   Another third said they wouldn't meet the target date but that
they were developing backup plans. The remaining third expect to
miss the deadline and have no backup plans.
</P>
<P>
   While the group without backup plans in place is comprised of
mostly small airports, nine of the 50 largest U.S. airports also
aren't prepared, according to the GAO, which didn't identify
airports participating in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   While most airport officials don't expect aviation safety and
security to be compromised by Year 2000 computer problems, the GAO
said failures at even a single airport could cause delays
throughout the U.S. aviation system.

 &HT;    CLINTON APOLOGIZES FOR U.S. ROLE IN GONDOLA DEATHS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton vowed Friday the United States
would not ''duck'' its responsibility for a military accident that
killed 20 people on an Italian ski slope last year. He said he
intends further compensation for the victims' families and wants
changes to reduce to ''zero'' the odds of another such tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the
responsibility for what happened,'' Clinton said at a press
conference. ``Our presence in Italy, our air operations, our
training operations were the context, the environment in which this
horrible thing occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, appearing with Clinton,
said he was ''shocked,'' by the acquittal Thursday of Marine Capt.
Richard Ashby, the pilot whose low-flying jet severed two steel
cables, sending a gondola full of tourists to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for a scapegoat,'' he said. ``But we expect
that at the end of this process, it is clear and it is determined
who is responsible, and those who are found responsible are
punished through a fair trial. We are confident that this will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touched on another issue Friday. In his most personal
remarks to date about Monica Lewinsky, the president said he hopes
she has ``a good life,'' and that he regrets the pain she's endured
in the eye of the sex-and-deception storm that nearly swamped his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her
life, and I hope it will be a good life,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish anyone ill who was caught up in this, and she
paid quite a high price for a long time, and I feel badly for
that,'' said Clinton, later adding, ``this was a pretty tough thing
for everybody involved, and I wish her well. I hope it works out
all right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference was dominated, however, by questions about
last year's gondola accident, which has caused serious strains
between the United States and Italy, a NATO member and an important
U.S. ally in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots fly training missions from Aviano, Italy, the base
for Air Force flights in support of the NATO peacekeeping mission
in Bosnia, just across the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Aviano would be a likely staging ground for similar support
should a NATO operation be launched in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While both Clinton and D'Alema insisted U.S.-Italy relations
remain sound, the prime minister made no effort to submerge the
outrage felt by many Italians over Ashby's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally shocked, and so is Italian public opinion,''
said D'Alema. ``It is not normal for a military aircraft to fly in
a valley 300 feet from the ground. It is neither normal nor
acceptable that this leads to the consequences it did lead to.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosectors in Ashby's court-martial said his jet which hit the
cables about 370 feet above ground was flying lower and faster than
training rules permit. He was acquitted of charges of involuntary
homicide and manslaughter, however, by a jury of Marines at Camp
Lejeune, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to comment on the verdict. He stressed to
D'Alema, and, by extension, to the Italian public, that he took
vindication from the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not trying to duck its responsibility,''
Clinton said. ``We are heartbroken and horrified by what happened,
and we're going to do our best to make sure that nothing like that
ever happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has instructed Defense Secretary William Cohen to work
with his Italian counterpart to change training tactics and flight
regulations that would, in the president's words, ``reduce the
prospect to zero that something like this will occur again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also offered his assurance that the United States would
work with the Italian government to ensure that victims' families
are compensated in accordance with policies agreed upon by both
governments.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement governing U.S. military operations in Italy,
the families of the victims may apply to the Italian government for
compensation. At least 10 families have done so already, and more
are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government must determine equitable compensation.
The United States must to pay 75 percent of the compensation
awarded by the Italian government, which would be responsible for
paying the remaining 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already the United States has provided two separate payments to
each victim's estate: a $5,000 to cover transportation and burial
expenses and a $60,000 lump sum payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that my words could ever ease the pain of someone
who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a spouse in that
terrible accident,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are profoundly regretful and apologetic for what has
occurred, to the families and to all the people of Italy.''

 &HT;    First Union announces job cuts in Georgia
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some First Union employees in Georgia received word
Friday that their jobs were eliminated as part of the bank's
ongoing reduction of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman declined to say how many of the Charlotte,
N.C.-based bank's 26,000 Georgia employees lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of notifying the people who are
involved,'' said spokeswoman Donna Smart. ``Until we have completed
that process we cannot release any numbers.'' The nation's
sixth-largest bank said last month it would reduce its 71,500
member work force by 5 percent to 10 percent, as part of efforts to
trim expenses amid an expected slowdown in profit growth. Smart
said the bank expects to complete the job cuts next week.

<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The trademark black cowboy hat is gone, replaced
by a baseball cap with ``SD'' stitched in black and white on the
front.
</P>
<P>
   All the players in the spring training camp of the San Diego
Padres wear the cap, but one truly stands out _ country music
dynamo Garth Brooks, who has put three months of bookings on hold
to pursue his passion for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's tryout at age 37 is mostly for show, and his chances of
actually making the Padres roster are nonexistent. But given a
chance to help increase donations for his favorite charity and do a
world of good for the egos of San Diego players and their fans, he
jumped at the opportunity. Brooks's presence is a big boost even if
you've never heard one of his songs. The Padres, of course,
appreciate anybody who can help their fans forget the sweep by the
New York Yankees in the World Series last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy for being here,'' Brooks would tell anyone who came
along in the first days of what is meant to be at least a six-week
experiment. ``But it's not as crazy as it looks. Sure, I've
embarrassed myself a hundred times out there. But for every one,
there has been a time when I can hear somebody cheer and say `Ya!'
and that means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's workdays go eight to nine hours, proof he has much to
learn about being a baseball player. Brooks's day starts and ends
with signing autographs. He knows what people like to see and hear.
He never disappoints. Fans bring shirts, hats, and baseballs for
him to sign. Also CDs and record albums. In their eyes, Brooks has
replaced the late Gene Autry as the ``Singing Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is not just another entertainer taking advantage of the
relaxed atmosphere of spring training. He is serious, giving up
months of bookings for this adventure. Through his relationship
with the Padres, which started in 1997, he has been able to secure
major support for the Touch 'Em All Foundation: Teammates for kids,
which includes baseball stars, entertainers, and business people.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Roger Clemens and Seattle's Ken Griffey are on his
charity team. Brooks said he'd like to see a box in the standard
player contract which players can check off to give a donation.
</P>
<P>
   The players will set goals in five categories. Each home run by
Griffey, for example, will be worth $1,000 to the foundation. He
hit 56 last year. Other categories include hits, stolen bases,
strikeouts, and saves. Amounts vary per event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to get everybody in major league baseball,''
said Brooks. ``We have a small number to start and hopefully that
number will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has been away from baseball for more than a decade, but
he did have a batting cage erected in his backyard and became a
pretty good hitter. Brooks played baseball in high school and had
the ability to play collegiately, but he blew out his arm throwing
the javelin in his sophomore year at Oklahoma State, and he
abandoned his baseball career. But he remained a lifelong fan, and
got lucky in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks came to training camp for two days and made a favorable
impression with the Padres, especially manager Bruce Bochy. He
trusts Brooks when he says he will do nothing to embarrass the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth has a lot of fans in the Padres family,'' said general
manager Kevin Towers. ``He earned our respect by the way he handled
himself in Peoria last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That respect grew through the foundation, headquartered in
Denver. It was founded by Brooks and president Bo Mitchell. The
foundation's CEO is former Padres vice president of marketing Don
Johnson. The spring training invitation was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still up to Brooks, who realized he was stepping on
the toes of some legitimate farmhand seeking to reach the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Brooks, ``I'm here because I'm Garth
Brooks. If I was a guy just going out with the team, I would not be
treated the way I have so far. I look at the kids in the next
(minor league) locker room and I know they have a long way to go.
But I know everyone in the other locker room (major league) has
paid some dues.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is a candidate to play left field or third base. He takes
part in Padres drills until aound 1:30 p.m. Then, without a break,
he begins an hour of signing autographs. This is the scene every
day. Brooks's patience with his legion of fans is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   After signing autographs, Brooks does a series of TV interviews.
On this day, Brooks did six or seven TV interviews. One was Major
League Baseball. Another crew came all the way from Sydney, where
his music and appeal to young fans make his baseball tryout a
compelling story.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic blitz is followed by a stampede of print
reporters, all fearful that Brooks will be worn down. Instead, they
find an indefatigable entertainer eager to spread the word. The day
ends an hour later with Brooks signing more autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are the defending National League champions, but
there is no jealousy here, only respect for a man who shows up
early every day for workouts as if he's been doing it all his life.
They know Brooks gets no money; in lieu of paying Brooks, the
Padres have donated $200,000 to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a pittance when you consider that in his music career,
Brooks has produced $90 million in gross revenues, second only to
the Beatles ($107 million). His work ethic should come as no
surprise. In the last three years he has played in 350 shows in 100
cities, selling an estimated 5.3 million tickets. In 1997, his
concert at New York's Central Park set a Park attendance record
with an estimated crowd of 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres' contribution in the bank, Brooks could leave
camp at any time. But he's having too much fun, and Bochy assured
him that he is getting a legitimate tryout. Every day somebody asks
him if he would be able to forsake his great career for a baseball
assignment that could be a low as Single A?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' said Brooks. ``The Padres have made their
contribution to the foundation. I can leave at any time. Would I
stick around?. It depends on if I'm offered that. The game is hard.
If you fail seven of 10 times, you're a success. I learned here
that no matter what happens, you're going to have to let things
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's driven,'' said Towers. ``He's working very
hard. People in the music business told me he was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's teammates are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knows what will happen,'' said slugger
Tony Gwynn, who is a year older than Brooks. ``But the thing that
you have to admire about Garth is that he's working very hard. If
he makes a mistake, he's learning from it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first intrasquad game on Tuesday, it was obvious Brooks
was nervous. As he went to the plate for his first at-bat, Bochy
gave him a tip. ``You might want to get a helmet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks struck out against nonroster righthander Salvador
Rodriguez. Brooks, who played left field, fouled off four of five
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool,'' he said. ``I'm proud of four of the five
pitches I saw. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember.
</P>
<P>
   `` I was offered a chance to read for a role in Kevin Costner's
``The Love of the Game.'' The role of Gus, the catcher. Truth is I
don't want to play a baseball player. I want to play baseball.
Maybe there will come a time in my life when I will let that go and
do some celebrity things. Right now, I get to play baseball, and
it's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks wants everybody to know that he values this experience as
much as he does spreading the word through his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not out here to face the best, what are you going to
tell your kids when you go home?'' said Brooks, who lives in
Arizona with his wife, Amy, and three daughters. ``I came here to
play baseball. One day I will face the Big Unit (Randy Johnson) in
front of a crowd. That's what I came here to do. I might be
embarrassed and walk away. But that's not what I'm going to tell my
kids . . . I'll be talking about how I hit him for a grand slam.''

ELS SURGES TOWARD LEAD IN DORAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Only one of the top seven players in the world rankings
is in the field for the Doral-Ryder Open, and Ernie Els made his
presence felt Friday when he surged into contention with a 66 to
pull within two shots of leader and native Floridian Greg Kraft
(67_135), who said he hopes his star is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot made of the fact that Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Davis Love 3d, and Mark O'Meara are among the absentees at a
$3 million tournament that followed last week's $5 million Match
Play Championship in San Diego. Since Els bowed out in the first
round, he decided to show up for this storied tournament over the
Blue Monster course.
</P>
<P>
   There were certain names who generated some interest and some
news. Jack Nicklaus showed up after visiting New England Baptist
Hospital and was told he could discard the crutches and use a cane
after hip replacement surgery Jan. 27. Nick Faldo, who has won six
major championships but has been struggling, missed the cut on
75_148. Greg Norman, who underwent shoulder surgery after the
Masters, barely made the cut on 73_144.
</P>
<P>
   So it remained for Els, who is tied for second with Greg
Chalmers (who matched his 66 as low round of the tournament)
entering Saturday's third round, to step up. There were no plans to
play Doral until he was beaten, 1-up, by Paul Azinger in the first
round Feb. 24. ``I just felt I had a week off,'' said Els, ``so I
decided to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, whose tour of 9-under 135 set him up for a possible run
to his first official win in eight years on the PGA Tour, birdied
the second (8-iron, 5 feet), seventh (7-iron, 4 feet), and ninth
(6-iron, 5 feet) before a bogey on the 10th when he pulled a 3-iron
into the water. He regrouped and birdied the 12th (sand wedge, 30
feet), 15th (6-iron, 3 feet), and the demanding par-4 18th when he
punched a 5-iron 18 feet behind the hole and made it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a victory at Hattiesburg, Miss., in 1993 when it was
an unofficial event. ``Even though it wasn't an official win, I
have no complaints and I don't worry about it,'' said Kraft.
``Everybody wants to win. If you win five times, you want to win
six. If you win zero, you want to win one. This is my eighth year
on tour. I can still remember that day like it was Friday, and the
way I felt coming down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, who won his only tournament on the PGA Tour this year at
Riviera, lit up the scoreboard with birdies on the par-5 first out
of a bunker from 5 feet, the second (wedge, 6 feet), the fifth
(7-iron, 12 feet), 12th (wedge, 4 feet), 13th (5-iron, 14 feet),
and 16th (sand wedge, 15 feet). He just left a putt from the back
fringe to the right of the hole on the 18th, and is looking forward
to the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had last week off, and if I take this week off, I
might lose that bit of magic,'' said Els, who has won the US Open
twice (1994, 1997) in his global career. He tried to discount the
lack of name quality atop the leaderboard. ``These are guys who
have come through the real world,'' he said. ``They'be come through
Asia, Europe, the Nike and Hogan tours. They know what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers, a resident of Perth in Western Australia who won the
Australian Open last December after earning his PGA Tour card, has
played in six events and made just two cuts. After starting on the
10th hole, he had birdies on his second, third, and fourth holes to
announce his presence. He then birdied his 10th, 11th, and 13th
holes in a rare bogey-free round.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem was adjusting to the US Tour. ``It's taken
time,'' he said. ``It's taken me awhile to get used to playing with
these guys. I've been watching this on television for so many
years, it's just taken a while to get relaxed in this atmosphere.
When I came over here, it was sort of wiping the slate clean and
starting all over again because I had never been through anything
over here except the Q School.''
</P>
<P>
   After the leaders, Tommy Armour 3d (71) and Esteban Toledo (70)
were joint fifth on 138. The group of nine at 139 included Pat
Horgan (70) of Newport, R.I., who set up his round when he hit a
6-iron to 15 feet on his 10th hole and ran in the putt for an
eagle. He finished up with a wedge from 40 feet on his final hole
and made a 3-foot putt to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Sisk of Marshfield, Mass. (72_140), was in a group of five
an additional stroke back as he made his second cut of his rookie
season.

   FOR SALE: Five buildings on 1,600 acres of woodland. Cape Cod
Bay vu. 26 years old. Original owner. Good condition.
</P>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ The property that was put on the market last
summer was a nuclear plant _ the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station here
_ and that alone might have made it a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear energy has been very unpopular since the 1979
accident at Three Mile Island. And the opening of electricity
markets in states like Massachusetts adds to the financial risks of
running a nuclear plant: the costs of plant shutdowns, for
instance, can no longer be passed along, with the blessing of
regulators, to customers. And the operator no longer has a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, Pilgrim's owner, Boston Edison Co., had said
that if a buyer could not be found, the plant would be shut down
and decommissioned sooner rather than later. For Plymouth, a town
of nearly 50,000 and home of Plymouth Rock, the loss of its biggest
employer would have been a huge blow.
</P>
<P>
   So the 670 managers and employees of the Pilgrim plant were
understandably nervous when teams of executives from other utility
companies toured the plant to see if they wanted to make a bid. The
floors and walls of the plant glistened; the telephones were even
polished by hand. Some of the maintenance and operating workers
wore ties and dress shirts for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until a buyer was found, you did not know what the future
held,'' recalled Frank Clifford, a service reactor operator at
Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   While the offers did not exactly pour in, two bids were
eventually made for the plant. Entergy &UR;  &LR; Corp., a huge utility based
in New Orleans, was the winner with a $80 million bid. It was just
the second sale of a nuclear plant in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's a buyers' market, but the fact that there is a market at
all in nuclear plants is a sign of how deregulation is reshaping
the power industry. Entergy and companies like the Peco Energy &UR;  &LR; Co.
and Dominion Resources &UR;  &LR; are in the forefront of a group of
bargain-basement shoppers who see remaining value in nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more to
build a new power plant capable of generating the same amount of
electricity, they are able to buy older nuclear plants for tens of
millions _ a mere fraction of their book value. (The last reactor
to be built in the United States was ordered in 1973.)
</P>
<P>
   These companies, which own more than one nuclear plant, say they
have developed the skill and size to run nuclear plants more
efficiently. The possibility of costly operating shutdowns does not
frighten them, they say, because they will have the needed
expertise, manpower and equipment available should a problem arise.
</P>
<P>
   And the price is so cheap that it pays to deal with the
generally higher costs of operating nuclear power plants compared
with that of running other electricity sources.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plants in newly open markets like Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and New Jersey are particularly attractive. Under
deregulation, a number of the utilities in those states are
shrinking to become transmission companies.
</P>
<P>
   They will concentrate on the delivery of electricity and on
servicing business and residential customers. Utilities like
Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, for example, will buy power at
the lowest price from pools where companies like Entergy, Dominion
and Peco will sell power.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers of nuclear plants contend they can thrive in such
open markets. When the plants are run well, they can compete on
price with low-cost plants that run on hydropower, coal and natural
gas. And local nuclear plants are particularly attractive compared
with power plants outside the region, which face more expensive
transmission costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are buying the nuclear plants are very smart,''
said Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns. Despite
the image of nuclear power as an industry with no future, he said,
it still has many years of life yet.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, which will have five nuclear plants once the Pilgrim
acquisition closes, has identified nuclear generation as having
tremendous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Many utilities, however, especially those with only one nuclear
plant, see only potential liabilities. At the same time, regulators
in Massachusetts and elsewhere have been pushing utilities to
dispose of their generation plants to help open the market to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   For those utilities that are transforming themselves into
transmission companies, state regulators often make allowances for
their nuclear plants because of the uncertainty over whether there
would be buyers. But most utilities have not needed much prodding
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin estimates that 25 to 30 plants will soon be put on the
market and will either change hands or be shut down. In a decade,
he predicted, most of the nation's 103 operating reactors will be
owned by just a handful of companies.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the next such deal, the two units of the Nine
Mile Point nuclear plant, which employs 1,350 workers, are up for
sale. Niagara Mohawk Power &UR;  &LR; Corp. of Syracuse owns one unit. A
consortium of utilities, which includes Niagara Mohawk, owns the
other. They are in negotiations with Amergen, a joint venture
formed by Peco Energy, a utility based in Philadelphia, and British
Energy &UR;  &LR; of Edinburgh, one of Britain's largest generator of
electricity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the plant, on the shores of Lake Ontario, is causing
apprehension in Scriba, N.Y., a town of about 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the new owner going to be a good citizen in our
community?'' asked Norman Seiter, a lawyer for the town board of
Scriba. The two units pay about 85 percent of the property taxes of
the town and 39 percent of Oswego County's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If the units are sold, as expected, for less than their book
values, the town would be under pressure to reduce the plant's
valuation sharply, causing property tax revenues from the
operations to fall.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Amergen was the buyer in the first nuclear plant sale
in the United States, agreeing to acquire the functioning unit of
Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the nation's worst
nuclear accident. The seller was GPU &UR;  &LR; Inc., a utility that serves
parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Amergen has also received the
exclusive right to negotiate an agreement to buy the Vermont Yankee
Nuclear plant in Vernon, Vt., owned by a group of 13 New England
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But not every nuclear plant put on the market will end up with a
buyer. Some plants have been so ridden with problems or have such
complex ownership and regulatory hurdles that they are likely to be
decommissioned early because they cannot be counted on to offer
reliable power at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GPU, for example, tried to sell its Oyster Creek
plant, situated about 35 miles north of Atlantic City, N.J., but
talks broke down, and it was going to be shut. Now, the sales of
the Three Mile Island unit and the Pilgrim plant have encouraged
GPU to make another effort to find a buyer for Oyster Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Peco had looked at the Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, Maine,
but backed off. That plant will be shut down for good.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a permanent shutdown worries people in Scriba
the most. ``We want these plants to stay here and keep operating,''
Seiter &UR;  &LR; said. If buyers are not found, he noted, ``we will still
have a nuclear site in our backyard with the waste being stored for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   As more nuclear plants come on the market or are decommissioned,
similar concerns are likely to be felt by dozens of communities the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston Edison, a subsidiary of BEC Energy, the decision that
its one nuclear plant would not be a part of its future was made
after a review two years ago. The utility decided that Pilgrim
should be run by a company that had a number of such plants and
could take advantage of economies of scale, said Carl Gustin, the
senior vice president for corporate communications at Boston
Edison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best way for Pilgrim to keep operating in the
future to have an owner committed to nuclear power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy got a bargain, industry analysts say. Of its total bid
of $80 million, $67 million was for nuclear fuel. This meant that
in effect Entergy paid only $13 million for a plant whose book
value is about $700 million. A trust fund of $466 million to offset
the cost of decommissioning, whenever that should be needed, is
also being passed along to Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought the Pilgrim plant at a time it was running at
97 percent of its capacity and producing 670 megawatts of power _
enough to serve a small city.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant has been troubled in the past. For a time, it had
one of the worst operating records in the nation. In 1986, the
plant was already under criticism from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission when it suffered two shutdowns because of equipment
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim remained shut for two years while it underwent an
extensive overhaul. Adm. Ralph G. Bird, an outside expert with a
background in nuclear submarines, took charge and put in new
management and tightened operations and safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy has succeeded in turning around other troubled plants.
Two of its plants, &UR;  &LR; Arkansas Nuclear One and River Bend in
Louisiana had particularly poor operating records in the late
1980s. The plants, which had been operating at as low as 60 percent
of capacity, have been operating at an 88 percent level recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are taking a risk when you assume these assets,'' Mike
Bellamy, the vice president of operations at Pilgrim for Entergy
Nuclear said in an interview. ``If they are run well and you buy
them at a good price, the opportunity is there to make a nice
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Plymouth, the sale of Pilgrim Nuclear ``has brought real
mixed feelings,'' said Robert Bradley, the office manager at the
Pilgrim Sands Motel, whose house overlooks the plant. ``There have
been times when people were real nervous and wanted it shut down.
It has also been a real financial boon to the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Entergy is not expected to make major changes at the plant,
Bellamy of Pilgrim said, adding that earlier job cuts had left the
plant with a lean and efficient work force.
</P>
<P>
   Still, workers and managers may have to change their way of
thinking in a newly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   Employees had the attitude that ``Mother Boston Edison will take
care of me,'' said Cristine Maimaron, a manager and an important
member of the marketing team that sold the plant. ``It was hard to
make the break.''

   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The trademark black cowboy hat is gone, replaced
by a baseball cap with ``SD'' stitched in black and white on the
front.
</P>
<P>
   All the players in the spring training camp of the San Diego
Padres wear the cap, but one truly stands out _ country music
dynamo Garth Brooks, who has put three months of bookings on hold
to pursue his passion for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's tryout at age 37 is mostly for show, and his chances of
actually making the Padres roster are nonexistent. But given a
chance to help increase donations for his favorite charity and do a
world of good for the egos of San Diego players and their fans, he
jumped at the opportunity. Brooks's presence is a big boost even if
you've never heard one of his songs. The Padres, of course,
appreciate anybody who can help their fans forget the sweep by the
New York Yankees in the World Series last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy for being here,'' Brooks would tell anyone who came
along in the first days of what is meant to be at least a six-week
experiment. ``But it's not as crazy as it looks. Sure, I've
embarrassed myself a hundred times out there. But for every one,
there has been a time when I can hear somebody cheer and say `Ya!'
and that means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's workdays go eight to nine hours, proof he has much to
learn about being a baseball player. Brooks's day starts and ends
with signing autographs. He knows what people like to see and hear.
He never disappoints. Fans bring shirts, hats, and baseballs for
him to sign. Also CDs and record albums. In their eyes, Brooks has
replaced the late Gene Autry as the ``Singing Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is not just another entertainer taking advantage of the
relaxed atmosphere of spring training. He is serious, giving up
months of bookings for this adventure. Through his relationship
with the Padres, which started in 1997, he has been able to secure
major support for the Touch 'Em All Foundation: Teammates for kids,
which includes baseball stars, entertainers, and business people.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Roger Clemens and Seattle's Ken Griffey are on his
charity team. Brooks said he'd like to see a box in the standard
player contract which players can check off to give a donation.
</P>
<P>
   The players will set goals in five categories. Each home run by
Griffey, for example, will be worth $1,000 to the foundation. He
hit 56 last year. Other categories include hits, stolen bases,
strikeouts, and saves. Amounts vary per event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to get everybody in major league baseball,''
said Brooks. ``We have a small number to start and hopefully that
number will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has been away from baseball for more than a decade, but
he did have a batting cage erected in his backyard and became a
pretty good hitter. Brooks played baseball in high school and had
the ability to play collegiately, but he blew out his arm throwing
the javelin in his sophomore year at Oklahoma State, and he
abandoned his baseball career. But he remained a lifelong fan, and
got lucky in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks came to training camp for two days and made a favorable
impression with the Padres, especially manager Bruce Bochy. He
trusts Brooks when he says he will do nothing to embarrass the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth has a lot of fans in the Padres family,'' said general
manager Kevin Towers. ``He earned our respect by the way he handled
himself in Peoria last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That respect grew through the foundation, headquartered in
Denver. It was founded by Brooks and president Bo Mitchell. The
foundation's CEO is former Padres vice president of marketing Don
Johnson. The spring training invitation was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still up to Brooks, who realized he was stepping on
the toes of some legitimate farmhand seeking to reach the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Brooks, ``I'm here because I'm Garth
Brooks. If I was a guy just going out with the team, I would not be
treated the way I have so far. I look at the kids in the next
(minor league) locker room and I know they have a long way to go.
But I know everyone in the other locker room (major league) has
paid some dues.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is a candidate to play left field or third base. He takes
part in Padres drills until aound 1:30 p.m. Then, without a break,
he begins an hour of signing autographs. This is the scene every
day. Brooks's patience with his legion of fans is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   After signing autographs, Brooks does a series of TV interviews.
On this day, Brooks did six or seven TV interviews. One was Major
League Baseball. Another crew came all the way from Sydney, where
his music and appeal to young fans make his baseball tryout a
compelling story.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic blitz is followed by a stampede of print
reporters, all fearful that Brooks will be worn down. Instead, they
find an indefatigable entertainer eager to spread the word. The day
ends an hour later with Brooks signing more autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are the defending National League champions, but
there is no jealousy here, only respect for a man who shows up
early every day for workouts as if he's been doing it all his life.
They know Brooks gets no money; in lieu of paying Brooks, the
Padres have donated $200,000 to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a pittance when you consider that in his music career,
Brooks has produced $90 million in gross revenues, second only to
the Beatles ($107 million). His work ethic should come as no
surprise. In the last three years he has played in 350 shows in 100
cities, selling an estimated 5.3 million tickets. In 1997, his
concert at New York's Central Park set a Park attendance record
with an estimated crowd of 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres' contribution in the bank, Brooks could leave
camp at any time. But he's having too much fun, and Bochy assured
him that he is getting a legitimate tryout. Every day somebody asks
him if he would be able to forsake his great career for a baseball
assignment that could be a low as Single A?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' said Brooks. ``The Padres have made their
contribution to the foundation. I can leave at any time. Would I
stick around?. It depends on if I'm offered that. The game is hard.
If you fail seven of 10 times, you're a success. I learned here
that no matter what happens, you're going to have to let things
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's driven,'' said Towers. ``He's working very
hard. People in the music business told me he was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's teammates are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knows what will happen,'' said slugger
Tony Gwynn, who is a year older than Brooks. ``But the thing that
you have to admire about Garth is that he's working very hard. If
he makes a mistake, he's learning from it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first intrasquad game on Tuesday, it was obvious Brooks
was nervous. As he went to the plate for his first at-bat, Bochy
gave him a tip. ``You might want to get a helmet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks struck out against nonroster righthander Salvador
Rodriguez. Brooks, who played left field, fouled off four of five
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool,'' he said. ``I'm proud of four of the five
pitches I saw. The last one I wasn't. That's the one I'll remember.
</P>
<P>
   `` I was offered a chance to read for a role in Kevin Costner's
``The Love of the Game.'' The role of Gus, the catcher. Truth is I
don't want to play a baseball player. I want to play baseball.
Maybe there will come a time in my life when I will let that go and
do some celebrity things. Right now, I get to play baseball, and
it's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks wants everybody to know that he values this experience as
much as he does spreading the word through his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not out here to face the best, what are you going to
tell your kids when you go home?'' said Brooks, who lives in
Arizona with his wife, Amy, and three daughters. ``I came here to
play baseball. One day I will face the Big Unit (Randy Johnson) in
front of a crowd. That's what I came here to do. I might be
embarrassed and walk away. But that's not what I'm going to tell my
kids . . . I'll be talking about how I hit him for a grand slam.''

CLINTON SEEKS TO SMOOTH OVER EUROPEAN OUTRAGE OVER U.S. PILOT'S
ACQUITTAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Italy agreed Friday to review
flight safety measures as President Clinton moved to calm European
outrage over the acquittal of a Marine pilot involved in a cable
car accident that killed 20 skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema only a
day after a military court found Capt. Richard Ashby innocent of
manslaughter charges, sparking accusations of a whitewash from many
parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was the pilot of a jet that clipped a gondola cable and
sent skiers plunging to their deaths. Ashby's craft was flying
lower and faster than allowed through the Italian Alps resort of
Cavalese, but he maintained his map failed to show a ski lift and
his plane's altimeter was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is responsible for this terrible tragedy,''
Clinton said in opening remarks as he and D'Alema held a joint news
conference. ``Again, I want to say to the people of Italy, on
behalf of the American people, we are profoundly regretful and
apologetic for what has occurred, to the families and to all the
people of Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's White House visit with Clinton had been set for weeks,
but the verdict dominated their conversation. The two also
discussed the situation in Kosovo where Italy maintains interest.
It was the third brief new conference Clinton has hosted with a
world leader in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced he and D'Alema agreed that their defense
chiefs will jointly review the operational and safety changes
proposed in the wake of the accident. The United States maintains
Air Force and Marine jets at the Aviano Air Base in northern Italy
as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said the United States and Italy would exam all measures
concerning the functions of the air bases used by U.S. forces and
examine the safety measures around all military exercises at those
air bases.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema said he was ``personally shocked'' by Ashby's
verdict, which he said gave the impression there will be no
punishment for those responsible for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish to stress one point. That event certainly cannot
be considered an ordinary occurrence. It is not normal for a
military aircraft to fly in a valley 300 feet from the ground. We
expect that at the end of the process, it is made clear who was
responsible for this accident and that these people are punished
for it,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not give his reaction to the verdict
because charges are pending against a crewman. Ashby also faces
charges for the disappearance of the plane's videotape of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States was willing to work with the Italians
to ``reduce the prospect to zero'' that something similar could
happen again. He noted the United States made a modest cash
settlement to the victims' families but stood ready to pay claims
filed by the families under the Italian court system.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States also was committed to ``a just
disposition'' of the pending criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the people of Italy and for those families
to know that the United States is not trying to duck its
responsibility and that we are heartbroken and horrified by what
happened, and we're going to do our best to make sure that nothing
like that ever happens again,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema repeatedly stressed that Italy wanted someone held
responsible and punished for the accident. ``We are not asking for
a scapegoat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the prospects of anyone being held responsible for the
deaths dimmed. Charges have been dropped against two crew members.
Manslaughter charges are pending against Capt. Joseph Schweitzer,
Ashby's navigator, who also will face trial in a military court.
</P>
<P>
   Following Ashby's acquittal, Schweitzer's attorney said he would
seek dismissal of the charges against his client.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's Prowler was flying at 360 feet, far below the 1,000 foot
allowed by flight rules. It was also flying at more than 500 mph,
far faster than allowed through the valley. During the flight on
Feb. 3, 1998, Ashby was at the single set of controls and
Schweitzer sat to his right as mission planner.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims, many of them German tourists in Italy,
gathered at Camp Lejeune, N.C., were the trial was held and
expressed disbelief at the verdict. Ashby called it a tragedy for
all involved.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Clinton said NATO was not bluffing as it
threatens Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic with airstrikes and
maintained those threats already had averted a potential disaster
last year. The threats stopped temporarily a conflict between Serb
police and Kosovar Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said Italy also wanted the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians
to sign a peace pact. The two sides have suspended ratification of
the treaty temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has warned the Kosovar Albanians it will not
take part in airstrikes unless they sign the treaty, and the United
States has warned the Serbs it will participate in bombing if it
doesn't sign.

JAPAN LOWERS RATES AGAIN, AND FOR BANKS IT'S A BIG ZERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's central bank pushed overnight interest rates to
the unprecedented level of effectively zero this week in one of its
boldest experiments yet to invigorate the economy _ basically
allowing Japanese banks to borrow for free.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan's move, which partly contributed Friday to a 5
percent surge in the Japanese stock market, represents a gamble
that banks will use this borrowed money to increase their own
lending to businesses and individuals. The hope is that such a move
will stimulate spending and generate a recovery in the world's
second-largest economy, which is stuck in the worst recession since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Lending rates in the overnight money market, a critical part of
the banking system, have been well below 1 percent for a while _ a
sign of how fragile both the weakly capitalized banks and the
economy have become over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Bank of Japan announced it would bring the rate
down to 0.15 percent. This week the central bank poured between the
equivalent of $10 billion and $15 billion into the market each day,
and the rates fell to 0.04 percent, then to 0.03 percent, then to
0.02 percent, then to 0.01 percent on Thursday. On Friday, the rate
settled at 0.02 percent, or just one-fiftieth of one percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   That means the rate is less than one-two hundredth the
comparable level in the United States. At such a rate, a bank could
borrow $1 million overnight and pay just 27 cents in interest the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, including officials at the Bank of Japan, is sure
whether the astonishingly low rates will work. There are also
significant hazards _ a mass flight of capital as investors seek
higher returns in investments overseas, for example, or a plunge in
the value of the yen. Indeed, the yen fell to a three-month low of
123.72 to the dollar in Tokyo Friday, and some forecasters now say
it could weaken to 130 fairly soon and far further later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk is that even with such low borrowing costs, the
Bank of Japan may still not be able to coax banks to borrow and use
that cheaper to money to expand lending to companies throughout the
country. A critical problem now is that banks have been so absorbed
in treating their mountains of bad debt they have been simply
unwilling to make new loans and have even been cutting their
lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a trial period,'' said Kazuo Momma, an official
at the Bank of Japan. ``It takes time to evaluate what is happening
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at least, the market liked it. Encouraged by the
central bank's moves this week, as well as a formal application for
public money by the nation's biggest banks, investors sent stocks
rallying in the biggest one-day surge this year. That pushed the
benchmark Nikkei 225 share average up 710.55 points, to 14,894, its
highest level since December.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan's moves also brought down long-term bond
rates, which last month were triple the level of October. The
government is trying to expand the economy with more spending, and
this has spooked investors who had dumped bonds and sent their
yields soaring. Higher yields can choke an economic recovery by
raising long-term borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond, a benchmark
for long-term rates, fell to 1.57 percent Friday, a three-month
low.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan was able to reduce overnight lending rates by
flooding the overnight money market with funds. The $230 billion
market is the lifeblood of the banking system and is a commonly
used tool for banks and other financial institutions to borrow and
lend short-term cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Akihiko Yokoyama, a fixed income analyst
at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo. ``Can you imagine who would lend out money
at zero percent?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be: fewer and fewer lenders. And that could
emerge as a problem. Insurance companies and investment trust funds
no longer want to park their money there, and are putting it into
regular bank deposit accounts or into longer-term money markets,
such as one-month or three-month maturities.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Japan officials are suggesting that they may next try to
lower interest rates in the money markets for one-month or
three-month borrowings. But that could ultimately lead to capital
flight, as investors move money abroad for higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a problem at the moment,'' said Clifford J.
Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd. ``Having
rates at zero has all sorts of implications.''

A CAPITAL IDEA: ART IS COMING OF AGE ON THE BANKS OF THE COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Berkeley-on-the-Colorado. ``Austin City Limits''
and 177 music venues. The infamous Texas Lege. A flourishing
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   And a nationally renowned collection of Renaissance and baroque
art?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that Austin always would be the Texas city
that visual art forgot, it's being propelled to the top tier of the
state's art centers and to new national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The opening this weekend of the Suida-Manning Collection of
Renaissance and baroque works, newly acquired by the Blanton Museum
at the University of Texas, caps a number of announcements and
debuts of high-profile arts projects in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gluckman's design for the new Austin Museum of Art is
coming closer to reality. Another major UT exhibition _ of images
by legendary photojournalist David Douglas Duncan _ has just
opened. With several other projects moving forward, Austin may soon
claim the sort of critical mass that will lure visitors in the same
way that Fort Worth attracts Hill Country art pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   For newcomers, navigating Austin's art scene means moving mostly
along a north-south axis.
</P>
<P>
   Northernmost are the Laguna Gloria estate (for decades home to
the Austin Museum of Art and the Texas Fine Arts Association) and
the Elisabet Ney Museum, the 19th-century studio and home of a
German-born pioneer of sculpture in Texas. The south pole is staked
out by the Umlauf Sculpture Garden &AMP; Museum. And in between are the
UT campus, downtown Austin with two or three distinct art
districts, and the city's east side, on the other side of
Interstate 35, which appears to be to Austin what Brooklyn is to
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For now, UT's art venues are what bring the city international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Suida-Manning Collection, which bows to
the public this weekend at the Blanton Museum of Art. A selection
of some 50 works from the 700 paintings, drawings and sculptures
will be shown, including masterworks by Simon Vouet, Claude Lorrain
and Guercino.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled by two generations of art historians, the
Suida-Manning Collection was the last great privately held
assemblage of Old Master artworks in the United States. Ironically,
UT's coup just as keenly may be felt in New York, where the
Metropolitan Museum of Art for years showed key works on long-term
loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Suida-Manning went to Austin in its entirety as part gift,
part purchase _ and it was just what the Blanton needed to compete
with the nation's top-ranking academic museums, says UT President
Larry Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1963 as the Huntington Art Gallery, the Blanton has
distinguished collections of graphic works and 20th-century Latin
American art. It has a decent collection of American paintings,
bequeathed by James and Mari Michener.
</P>
<P>
   But it needed a core collection of major historic works,
Faulkner says. With its rich holdings in northern Italian baroque
paintings and drawings, in addition to works from the Renaissance
and rococo, the Suida-Manning Collection gives UT instant stature.
</P>
<P>
   UT's other premier art institution is the Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center. The Ransom also has an exhibition
opening this weekend, of iconic photographs by David Douglas
Duncan, who donated his archive to the Ransom a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, because the Ransom's main galleries are being used by the
Blanton for its Suida-Manning installation, the Ransom is sharing
its Duncan show with the LBJ Library and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In late 2002, though, the Blanton will move into a new building
designed by Herzog &AMP; de Meuron of Basel, one of the world's
pre-eminent architecture teams. Last fall's announcement of the
commission enhanced widespread excitement about UT's historically
poky art museum and must have come as a relief to Ransom
supporters, who can't wait to reclaim and renovate those galleries
for display of the Ransom's rich holdings.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Moving from campus to downtown, the first stop is a lively
little district anchored by Women &AMP; Their Work, Galleria Sin
Fronteras and Lyons Matrix Gallery, which two years ago were joined
by the Artplex building of galleries and studios.

CLINTON SETS UP CLASH IN NOMINATING LEE TO CIVIL RIGHTS POST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up another confrontation with Senate
Republicans, President Clinton nominated Bill Lann Lee on Friday to
head the Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has run the division since December 1997, when Clinton
appointed him acting assistant attorney general to get around
conservative Republicans who a month earlier blocked the former
NAACP lawyer's confirmation as the nation's top civil rights
enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Although conservatives remain opposed to Lee, the White House
expressed hope that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee
would give him a fair hearing and consider the record he compiled
over the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Lee has ``done an
excellent job on a wide variety of issues over the last year'' and
should be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Before formally resubmitting the nomination, Clinton met
privately with Lee on Friday at the White House and reaffirmed
plans to secure his confirmation. Clinton's decision to resubmit
Lee's name for assistant attorney general drew immediate praise
from civil rights groups and supporters, many of whom attended the
meeting in the Roosevelt Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Lann Lee's life has been in the pursuit of excellence and
in knocking down the walls of discrimination,'' said Massachusetts
Sen. Edward Kennedy, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
</P>

   ``All we're asking for is fairness and the willingness to listen
carefully to Bill Lann Lee,'' Kennedy said. ``What is really
indecent is the (Republican leadership's) failure to give him the
kind of fair hearing under the advice and consent (role) of the
Senate'' in presidential appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy I. Height, chairwoman of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, urged Republican leaders in the Senate to show that
``enforcement of civil rights is not a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives immediately signaled that Clinton and his
Democratic allies in the Senate face an uphill fight to win
confirmation of Lee, a Chinese-American whom congressional
Republicans say is too zealous in enforcing affirmative-action
laws.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who last month urged Clinton
to give up on Lee, dismissed the prospects of his winning
confirmation. ``While Mr. Lee is a very fine man, the Senate has
already considered his nomination for this position,'' said Hatch,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the Clinton administration has chosen
to renominate Bill Lann Lee and play politics with the (Justice
Department's) civil rights division rather than put forward a
consensus, confirmable candidate,'' said Hatch, whose committee
will consider whether to send the nomination to the full Senate for
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Justice, a libertarian public interest group,
accused Lee of overstepping his bounds in acting as the country's
top civil rights enforcer. ``Lee's record confirms all of the worst
fears raised by critics of his nomination,'' said Clinton Bolick,
the institute's litigation director. ``Lee has relentlessly pursued
racial preferences, blatantly disregarding Supreme Court
precedents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy dismissed the criticism. ``Those that are aligned
against Bill Lann Lee, their problem is not with Bill Lann Lee, but
it is with the Supreme Court of the United States or with the laws
of the United States,'' the senator said.

BRUTAL MURDER BROUGHT VICTIM OUT OF CLOSET IN SMALL-TOWN ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLACAUGA, Ala. _ The closets that gay people build in small,
severe towns like this one are thick and difficult to penetrate,
and Billy Jack Gaither's was locked tighter than most.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day two weeks ago when he was beaten to death and
burned, Gaither, 39, lived with his disabled parents in their white
clapboard house, tending to their needs, cooking dinner and
cleaning up, singing in the choir of his Baptist church. His
parents swear they had no idea he was gay, and his father, Marion
Gaither, is still half in denial, desperately pointing out that his
son once had a girlfriend in Birmingham whom he almost married.
</P>
<P>
   But the small group of gays in this central Alabama town of
13,000 knew Billy Jack Gaither as one of their own, sharing their
fears of public knowledge. A friend who grew up with him and used
to accompany him on the nearly 40-mile trip to the gay bars of
Birmingham said Gaither would probably have escaped Sylacauga, like
most gay people who grow up here, but was too devoted to his
parents to contemplate leaving. The friend, who asked not to be
identified for fear of losing business, said Gaither never wanted
to hurt his deeply religious, Baptist parents by revealing the
nature of his sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his parents and the rest of Sylacauga have found out about
Gaither, and in the worst possible way. On Thursday, officials
charged two local men with Gaither's murder, saying the men said
they had become angered after Gaither made a sexual advance toward
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The murder is already being called another signpost of hate,
alongside the deaths of Matthew Shepard, killed in Wyoming last
year because he was gay, and James Byrd, the black man dragged to
his death behind a truck last year in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Coosa County sheriff's report said the arrested men, Steven
E. Mullins and Charles M. Butler Jr., had known Gaither and met him
on the night of Feb. 19 at a local nightclub. They then locked him
in the trunk of his car and drove to a deserted boat dock where
they bludgeoned him to death with an ax handle, then heaved his
body onto a pyre of burning tires. His charred remains were found
the next day on the banks of Peckerwood Creek, which local churches
use for baptizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither's parents had barely absorbed the horror of his gruesome
death before they learned the motive for his murder, and the secret
life that he had led for so long. They knew him as the kindest of
their four boys, the one who read his big illustrated Bible every
night before going to bed, who never came home late on those rare
occasions when he did go with friends to one of the local bars (all
of them straight).
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was gay, he sure never showed it,'' his mother, Lois
Gaither, said Friday morning. ``He never flaunted himself as being
gay or talked about it. And whether he was or not, it don't make me
love him any less. He was my young'un.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, in a kind of rueful acknowledgment of the truth,
``Whatever he did, he never brought it home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marion Gaither, debilitated by multiple heart attacks and a
stroke, sat on the couch near his wife, holding his forehead in his
hands, shaking his head at all references to his son's sexuality.
When a television news report came on saying his son was killed
because he was gay, Gaither shouted out, ``If he was gay. If he was
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the house, however, gave a glimpse of a separate world
that Billy Jack Gaither lived in. He had decorated his room with a
large collection of Scarlett O'Hara dolls and other figurines from
``Gone with the Wind,'' for which he hunted at flea markets on
weekends. A large picture of Clark Gable kissing Vivian Leigh hung
over his bedroom fireplace; pink chiffon curtains fluttered around
antique etchings of antebellum women in hoop skirts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the house, which his parents also allowed him to
decorate, was more conventional. In the living room he hung a
painting of the Last Supper, next to another of Jesus praying in
the garden; between them was a golden plaque of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The two rooms, one for the outside world, the other for himself,
seemed to illustrate the traditional dichotomy of small-town
Southern gay life. Gaither's friend said there are about 100 gay
people in town, but none were open about their sexual orientation.
Though there had never been a violent incident like this one
against a gay person, the friend said, there was plenty of evidence
that homosexuality was not appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he said, citing one example, a group of downtown
merchants hung up a series of flags on lightpoles to spruce up the
image of the central business district. The merchants were not
aware that a rainbow symbol on one flag was sometimes used by gay
groups, but a local church recognized the symbol and began a
strident campaign to remove it, saying that its presence promoted a
gay lifestyle in Sylacauga. The flag quickly came down.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Those gay people who have not moved out of town occasionally
travel together to gay bars in Birmingham or Montgomery, the friend
said. He said Gaither occasionally went on such trips and was known
to have had at least two short-term relationships with other men,
whom he would meet out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Sylacauga, with more than 70 churches in its boundaries, is not
unlike most rural southern towns in its conservatism and religious
beliefs. It is industrial rather than agricultural, with many
people working in the factories that ring the town. Gaither
operated a computer terminal at Russell Corp., an athletic wear
manufacturer, in nearby Alexander City. He dropped out of Sylacauga
High School in the 11th grade, but later got his equivalency
diploma and joined the Marines for a year before getting an
honorable discharge because of high blood pressure, his parents
said.
</P>
<P>
   David W. White, the Birmingham coordinator for the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance of Alabama, said Gaither frequented a Birmingham
bar called the Tool Box, one of five gay bars in the city. Many gay
people from surrounding small towns drive to Birmingham for
companionship, he said, because the slightest indication of
homosexuality in a town like Sylacauga would invite harassment, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider it difficult to live anywhere in Alabama
other than Birmingham,'' White said. ``Even in Birmingham, I would
never in a public place grab my partner's hand and walk down the
street. It would literally be a death wish in the state of Alabama.
You would almost be inciting violence to do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Gaither's friend said, gay people in town have been
more concerned about harassment and the loss of jobs or business
than about violence. That all changed with Gaither's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking over our shoulders now,'' said the friend,
who carefully closed the doors of his office before even discussing
the subject. ``You know, Mullins lived just two miles from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, who shaved his head, was known around town for wearing
Ku Klux Klan T-shirts and making racist comments, but Gaither's
friend said the gay community had not been aware of either him or
Butler as someone to fear. Mullins and Butler are being held in the
Coosa County jail on $500,000 bond each; their case will be handed
to a grand jury on March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men could face execution if they are convicted
of capital murder, they cannot be charged with a hate crime,
because Alabama's hate-crime statute covers crimes committed due to
race, religion, ethnicity and disability, but not sexual
orientation. White and other gay leaders said the murder would
increase the pressure on the Alabama Legislature to broaden the
statute. Shephard's death led to similar calls for hate-crime
legislation that would apply to gays.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was explicit in comparing the two cases in
offering his prayers to Gaither's friends and family. ``In times
like this, the American people pull together and speak with one
voice, because the acts of hatred that led to the deaths of such
innocent men are also acts of defiance against the values our
society holds most dear,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gaither put it somewhat differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was gay or not, that still didn't give them no right to
kill him,'' she said.

COMBAT DEATHS IN LEBANON SPARK PLEDGES FROM ISRAELI CANDIDATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, March 7) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With four new combat deaths in southern Lebanon
prodding them into action, Israel's politicians have topped their
election campaigns with a promise that many Israelis were desperate
to hear _ a pledge to ``bring our boys home.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak,
vowed to withdraw from southern Lebanon ``within a year,`` if he is
elected prime minister when Israelis go to the polls May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered
with a pledge to withdraw, but without the time limit, and raised
the possibility of a unilateral pullout from the 9-milewide strip
of Lebanese territory that Israel has occupied since 1985. He had
previously opposed such a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But with few options before them and a trail of failed Lebanon
policies behind them, the politicians' promises seemed more geared
to appease a war-weary Israeli public ahead of elections than a
real pledge of action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, seven Israelis have been killed
in southern Lebanon in a war of attrition pitting Israel and its
proxy militia, called the South Lebanon Army, against
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas. Since 1985, more than 900
soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when Israelis buried a general (the highest ranking
officer slain in southern Lebanon since 1982), two soldiers and a
reporter who were killed by guerrilla bombs, the Lebanon conflict
exploded into a hot campaign issue. Israelis who had grown weary of
the tit-for-tat struggle demanded an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's leaders are faced with a narrowing range of
military options, as last week's response to the killings
suggested. And the political options are even more limited. Most
analysts agree that the fighting in Lebanon will not stop until
Israel agrees to return the Golan Heights, captured in 1967, to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a few Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon last
Sunday and then threatening a massive retaliatory strike ``on the
ground, in the air and from the sea,'' the government called off
the operation the next day, citing as the reason Hezbollah's
restraint from launching Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli warplanes tried in 1996 to contain Hezbollah with
massive airstrikes that ended in a debacle after a stray bomb hit a
United Nations shelter, killing more than 100 Lebanese civilians.
Analysts said there would have been little to gain this time around
from such a large-scale attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against whom would they use massive force, against a handful
of guerrilla fighters who are not really a visible target?'' said
Shaul Zadka, a political analyst at Bar Ilan University in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wanted to intimidate the Lebanese,'' said Zadka, who
recently set up an organization called Red Line, which advocates
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. ``It was for Israeli internal
consumption. It was part of the election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of appealing Lebanon options may explain why neither
Barak or Netanyahu, the front-runners in the race for prime
minister, spelled out exactly how he proposed to pull the troops
out. Barak said simply that if elected he would ``bring the boys
home'' within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu replied that he would ``find a way to get the army out
in the coming year,'' and then lambasted Barak's commitment to a
specific date as ``irresponsible and even dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said, ``All the Hezbollah and the Lebanese and the
Syrians have to do is to sit tight and do nothing, not to give us
any security arrangements, no negotiations. They already know that
somebody has undertaken to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister didn't go beyond his previous position.
He repeated his stance accepting U.N. Resolution 425, which calls
on Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, and attaching conditions.
Lebanon, he said, would have to guarantee that the border with
Israel remain quiet after Israeli troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is a likely non-starter, analysts say, because
Lebanon has repeatedly rejected it. Instead, the Lebanese have
maintained that Israel should withdraw its troops unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Israeli military leaders hesitate to quit the area without
security guarantees. Most say they fear that after a pullout,
Hezbollah's fighters would move to the Lebanese-Israeli border and
continue to attack Israeli towns, particularly if Israel does not
reach a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock has plenty of Israelis looking for alternative
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Feb. 28 roadside bombing that killed Brig. Gen.
Erez Gerstein and three others, suggestions ranged from bombing
Beirut to reducing the size of the border ``security zone'' that
Israel says it needs to occupy to protect its northern villages.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, hundreds of Israelis demonstrated for a
unilateral withdrawal, an option that has gained popular momentum
in the past two years, as the hope for peace with Syria dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Even Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, a security hawk who as
defense minister engineered Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion, has
advocated a unilateral pullback _ in phases.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Israel's military leaders reject the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``They question the consequences,'' said Moshe Maoz, a political
analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``On one hand, it might
reduce the motivation of Hezbollah to fight and strip Syria of its
ability to exert pressure on Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the negative side, Hezbollah would be able to advance
to the border and exercise pressure from there,'' he said. ``Then
what? Israel will have the legitimacy to hit back, but this doesn't
solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Defense Minister Moshe Arens, a security hawk, hinted
that Israel may decide to abrogate a 1996 U.S.-brokered agreement
that obligates both Israel and Hezbollah to avoid striking areas
populated with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says that restraint is preventing its troops from
striking back at the the guerrillas, who often launch attacks from
within populated villages.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's political options don't appear much better. Peace
negotiations with Syria have been frozen since Netanyahu was
elected in 1996. Last week, the Israeli prime minister said he
would not pay an ``exaggerated price'' for a deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   While most Israelis are tired of the quagmire in Lebanon, a
majority has indicated an unwillingness to pay the only price
likely to bring the conflict to an end.

A CAPITAL IDEA: ART IS COMING OF AGE ON THE BANKS OF THE COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Berkeley-on-the-Colorado. ``Austin City Limits''
and 177 music venues. The infamous Texas Lege. A flourishing
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   And a nationally renowned collection of Renaissance and baroque
art?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that Austin always would be the Texas city
that visual art forgot, it's being propelled to the top tier of the
state's art centers and to new national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The opening this weekend of the Suida-Manning Collection of
Renaissance and baroque works, newly acquired by the Blanton Museum
at the University of Texas, caps a number of announcements and
debuts of high-profile arts projects in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gluckman's design for the new Austin Museum of Art is
coming closer to reality. Another major UT exhibition _ of images
by legendary photojournalist David Douglas Duncan _ has just
opened. With several other projects moving forward, Austin may soon
claim the sort of critical mass that will lure visitors in the same
way that Fort Worth attracts Hill Country art pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   For newcomers, navigating Austin's art scene means moving mostly
along a north-south axis.
</P>
<P>
   Northernmost are the Laguna Gloria estate (for decades home to
the Austin Museum of Art and the Texas Fine Arts Association) and
the Elisabet Ney Museum, the 19th-century studio and home of a
German-born pioneer of sculpture in Texas. The south pole is staked
out by the Umlauf Sculpture Garden &AMP; Museum. And in between are the
UT campus, downtown Austin with two or three distinct art
districts, and the city's east side, on the other side of
Interstate 35, which appears to be to Austin what Brooklyn is to
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For now, UT's art venues are what bring the city international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Suida-Manning Collection, which bows to
the public this weekend at the Blanton Museum of Art. A selection
of some 50 works from the 700 paintings, drawings and sculptures
will be shown, including masterworks by Simon Vouet, Claude Lorrain
and Guercino.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled by two generations of art historians, the
Suida-Manning Collection was the last great privately held
assemblage of Old Master artworks in the United States. Ironically,
UT's coup just as keenly may be felt in New York, where the
Metropolitan Museum of Art for years showed key works on long-term
loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Suida-Manning went to Austin in its entirety as part gift,
part purchase _ and it was just what the Blanton needed to compete
with the nation's top-ranking academic museums, says UT President
Larry Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1963 as the Huntington Art Gallery, the Blanton has
distinguished collections of graphic works and 20th-century Latin
American art. It has a decent collection of American paintings,
bequeathed by James and Mari Michener.
</P>
<P>
   But it needed a core collection of major historic works,
Faulkner says. With its rich holdings in northern Italian baroque
paintings and drawings, in addition to works from the Renaissance
and rococo, the Suida-Manning Collection gives UT instant stature.
</P>
<P>
   UT's other premier art institution is the Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center. The Ransom also has an exhibition
opening this weekend, of iconic photographs by David Douglas
Duncan, who donated his archive to the Ransom a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, because the Ransom's main galleries are being used by the
Blanton for its Suida-Manning installation, the Ransom is sharing
its Duncan show with the LBJ Library and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In late 2002, though, the Blanton will move into a new building
designed by Herzog &AMP; de Meuron of Basel, one of the world's
pre-eminent architecture teams. Last fall's announcement of the
commission enhanced widespread excitement about UT's historically
poky art museum and must have come as a relief to Ransom
supporters, who can't wait to reclaim and renovate those galleries
for display of the Ransom's rich holdings.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Moving from campus to downtown, the first stop is a lively
little district anchored by Women &AMP; Their Work, Galleria Sin
Fronteras and Lyons Matrix Gallery, which two years ago were joined
by the Artplex building of galleries and studios.
</P>
<P>
   The past five years have seen substantial growth in the gallery
scene and in visual arts in general, says Kathryn Davidson,
associate director of Women &AMP; Their Work, which was the first Texas
art organization to be funded by the National Endowment for the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the greater degree of change will come in the next
five years,'' she adds. Inauguration of the new Blanton, as well as
the new Austin Museum of Art will, with any luck, stimulate
corporate support of local venues. (Dell Corp., for instance, last
week announced a major grant to the Austin Museum of Art.)
</P>
<P>
   South downtown is where Richard Gluckman's new Austin Museum of
Art will be built (and where the AMoA already has an urban
outpost). It's where the Texas Fine Arts Association recently
inaugurated its new home in a vintage building, brilliantly adapted
by Dallas architect Gary Cunningham. Sixth Street downtown is home
to a number of small commercial galleries. And it's where
grassroots projects like La Pena cultural center and Mexic-Arte
Museum have taken over an entire city block on Congress Avenue and
turned it into a hotbed of cultural activity.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime observer says that the recent dramatic changes
reflect years of organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all has been a long time in coming,'' says Ric Hernandez,
assistant director of the Texas Commission on the Arts and a
multitalented artist. ``The real leaders were the theater community
who established themselves downtown very quickly. Then, in the
visual arts, La Pena and Mexic-Arte led the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Austin boasted several commercial art
galleries, and plans for a downtown museum of art were supported by
a public bond issue, Hernandez recalls. The economic bust of the
mid-'80s, however, saw the galleries close and private support for
the museum evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has come back, however, as a new organization with a
dynamic new director in Elizabeth Ferrer. Sue Graze, former
director of the CRCA Gallery at the University of Texas at
Arlington, is the TFAA's new director.
</P>
<P>
   The icing on the cake, though, comes with happenings eastward,
on either side of the I-35 corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent bond election voted funds to build a Mexican-American
cultural center on the far eastern side of downtown. Bond money
also will support the George Washington Carver Library's plans to
develop an exhibition program dedicated to African-American art and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, artists have begun moving their studios to the far
side of I-35. Flatbed Press, a major regional fine arts press, has
relocated to the east side of Austin _ and so has the Austin Visual
Arts Association.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Mayor Kirk Watson links the flurry of activity to
Austin's geographic, ethnic and historical diversity _ and a knack
for creative solutions to community development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visual art does such a good job of recording culture and
reflecting where people are at certain points in time,'' Watson
says. ``And the visual arts here are starting to show the same kind
of nimbleness and diversity that have made Austin the live music
capital of the world and a center for high-tech industry.''

`60 MINUTES' TO AIR NEW THEORY OF BABY EAPPEN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Reopening the investigation and controversy over the
death of Newton baby Matthew Eappan, CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' plans to
air allegations Sunday by two California doctors that the child
could have died from strangulation and may not have been shaken to
death by British au pair Louise Woodward, as a jury found.
</P>
<P>
   The network said Friday that Sunday's segment by newsman Mike
Wallace concludes that Matthew Eappan was strangled about 48 hours
before his death on Feb. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are news to attorneys who both prosecuted and
defended Woodward in an explosive trial two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said Friday Dr. Floyd Gilles, chief of Neuropathology at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, chief of
radiology at the same hospital, will tell viewers their opinion is
based their examination of medical evidence that show injuries to
Eappen's neck. Both the prosecution and defense teams had suggested
those wounds were likely caused by efforts to intubate and
rescussitate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Eappen was rushed to the hospital February 5, 1997, after
Woodward reported to a 911 dispatcher that the baby had stopped
breathing. Initially, police said, Woodward told them she might
have been too rough with the baby during his morning bath. She
later denied those allegations. The baby boy died four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles says in a CBS news release that the conclusion of the
prosecution that the baby's head swelling occurred immediately
after his injury left only Woodward as a suspect. But in some cases
of infant strangulation, Gilles said, swelling can take as much as
48 hours to become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors would not comment Friday, saying through a
spokesman that they had agreed not to talk publicly until after
Sunday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Martha Coakley, who was interviewed for the
``60 Minutes'' piece, said the news program unfairly casts
suspicion on the baby's parents, Deborah and Sunnil Eappen, by
suggesting they should have noticed the signs of repeated abuse, or
could have even been responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Coakley called the ``60 Minutes'' effort ``irresponsible
journalism'' that surprised her, considering the good reputation
the show has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying it's a 48-hour strangulation, that's like saying Nicole
Simpson died of a heart attack,'' referring to the stabbing victim
and former wife of O.J., who was charged and eventually acquitted
in criminal court in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's trial featured reams of medical evidence and doctors
who gave drastically different accounts of how and why the baby's
head injuries occurred. But none suggested strangulation as a cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution contended the baby was shaken or tossed roughly
on a hard surface, resulting in bleeding in the brain. The defense
team doctors argued that the infant had a spontaneous eruption in
his brain that day, a result of an old injury.
</P>
<P>
   Boston defense attorney Andrew Good said Friday he had no
explanation for how the defense medical experts might have missed
the possibility that baby Eappen was strangled.
</P>
<P>
   But because the defense has always contended that Eappen's brain
injuries were suffered prior to the day he was rushed to the
hospital, Good said he welcomes the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could in the limited time we had to
investigate the case,'' Good said. ``What we have always said is
that this case bears further scientific investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Coakley, defense attorney Barry Scheck is scheduled
to appear on the CBS program, the network said. Woodward will also
appear and repeat her denials that she mishandled the infant that
day, according to the CBS release.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex County jury convicted Woodward of second-degree
murder on Halloween Day, 1997. Later, some jurors said they
believed Woodward had lied about her actions that day, but they
also said they would have preferred to convict her of manslaughter,
and punish her less severely.
</P>
<P>
   That option had been taken away from the jury in a bold gamble
by her defense attorneys who said they wanted the jury to state
clearly their client was not guilty of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel later reduced the jury's
verdict to manslaughter.

NEW EDUCATION CHIEF CALLS FOR FIRINGS IF TEACHERS NOT UP TO PAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ School systems should ``not hesitate'' to fire
uninspired teachers, hire new management or shut failing schools,
the new head of the state Board of Education said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unconciliatory in the face of criticism from the Massachusetts
Teachers Association that his views will undermine mainstream
public schools, James A. Peyser said teachers and their schools
must stop considering teaching jobs ``entitlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that he does not intend to change his long-held views
on teacher accountability and greater school choice as board
chairman, he urged union officials to see students as their main
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that means some teachers lose their jobs, so be it. I am
less interested in protecting the institutions than the parents and
children,'' said the 42-year-old former board member, speaking in
his trademark low-key, professorial manner. ``It is not acceptable
to allow kids to fail, so when students are put at risk we should
not hesitate to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   While Peyser's education views are similar to those of outgoing
chairman John Silber, his temperament and reputation are very
different. Silber was largely seen as combative, while even critics
of Peyser's politics have said they find Peyser calm, collegial,
and a respectful listener.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser said he's not sure exactly what steps he and his
nine-member board can or will take to increase accountability. In
many areas of education, he said, including teacher testing, the
Legislature needs to clarify and perhaps consider expanding the
board's authority.
</P>
<P>
   But his firm stance on teacher performance, coupled with his
professional work supporting privatization in public education,
have placed him squarely at odds with mainstream education
advocates, including the 86,000-member teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Peyser has been the executive director of the
Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research in Boston, founded in
1988 by a former Cabot Corp. executive to advocate private market
solutions to social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser said Friday he believes that no matter how challenging
the problems of a school's students, or how uninvolved their
parents, a school must successfully educate those students, or
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, there are no excuses that are acceptable,'' he
said. ``In the end, someone has to overcome them. It is not enough
to say the demographics are bad, or the facilities are not as good
as they should be. That is the nature of the business. The test is
our ability to overcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyser's Pioneer Institute has pushed for reduced special
education and bilingual education services, and supports students
being able to choose their school from among different districts.
One Pioneer division exists exclusively to help charter schools,
which operate free of union and school committee rules, and
publishes a widely distributed charter school newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser said his three year track record as a board member,
before he resigned in December to run for education commissioner,
proves that he is not ``about destroying public education,'' as his
critics have charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of my time on the history/social studies
(curriculum) and trying to improve the MCAS test,'' he said,
refering to the tough, new Massachusetst Comprehensive Assessment
System test students took for the first time last May. ``These are
at the core of maintream education and have nothing to do with
Pioneer'' Institute interests.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser attended public school in Irvington, NY. He has lived in
the Lower Mills section of Dorchester for the past 11 years and
sends his six-year-old daughter to a private school, Milton
Academy. He said this was the best choice for his daughter and fits
his philosophy that parents should have a wide range of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the issue of teacher firings, Massachusetts
Teachers Association general counsel Ann Clarke said Friday that
the 1993 Education Reform Act has already speeded up the firing
process, by eliminating a teacher's right to a school committee
hearing and a court hearing. Teachers now meet with the
superintendent, then go straight to a neutral arbitrator under the
state Department of Education who can uphold, reverse, or alter the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   State data show that 15 of the 33 teachers fired whose cases
went to arbitration in the last five years were upheld. The other
18 arbitrated firings were overturned, or reduced to a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The number of fired teachers who accepted termination without
arbitration was not available from the MTA.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ David Protess believes his career was shaped at age 7,
growing up near Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. In 1953, when he was 7,
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the headline, `Rosenbergs Fried,''' Protess said,
recalling that he was the same age as one of the Rosenbergs' sons.
``It seemed so unjust, and I'm not taking a position about whether
they were guilty or not. What was unjust was that the state
orphaned two young boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 52, Protess, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, examines death row cases, assigning them to his
journalism students and teaching them to pore over documents,
re-enact crimes and interview witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It has brought him and a handful of students remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Protess and three students helped prove the innocence
of four men who spent 18 years in jail for a double murder in
suburban Ford Heights. On Friday, the four men agreed to a $36
million settlement in a civil suit they filed against Cook County.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an investigation by Protess and six students led to
the release of Anthony Porter, 43, who spent 16 years on death row
in the murder of a couple in a Chicago park.
</P>
<P>
   The state's key witness recanted statements incriminating
Porter. A woman implicated her estranged husband, Alstory Simon, a
Milwaukee laborer. And Simon, interviewed by a private investigator
working with Protess, confessed to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, although not officially exonerated, is free while the
authorities investigate the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   Protess' pursuit of cases, his enthusiastic style, and the
skills he teaches have earned him admirers among students,
journalists and professors. Still, he gets questions about his
passion in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I bring a passion to my work?'' he asked. ``Yeah, I do.
Sometimes that is controversial. I just believe that the higher
calling of journalism is that after you find the truth, you can in
fact right the wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In some cases, the truth was the guy was guilty, and
those students got an A.''
</P>
<P>
   Protess has tempered his approach somewhat since 1995, when he
and 10 students tried to overturn the murder conviction of Gervies
Davis. They testified at Davis' clemency hearing. On the day of the
execution, Protess gathered students at his home with a grief
counselor on stand-by for what he said ``was really a wake.'' Davis
called from prison and ``I put him on the speaker phone so we could
all hear him,'' Protess said.
</P>
<P>
   After that execution, some people accused Protess of being more
advocate than journalist.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he should have done things differently. For example,
instead of testifying, he should have required defense lawyers to
subpoena his research so he would not appear to be working for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we became too personally involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Protess, who has a doctorate in public policy, investigated
cases for the Better Government Association, a private watchdog
group, in the 1970s. Afterward, while teaching at Northwestern, he
investigated wrongful convictions for Chicago Lawyer magazine,
asking his students to help with the legwork. He now gets three to
four requests a day from inmates and lawyers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for cases with no incriminating physical evidence like
blood or semen, no credible eyewitness, no reliable confession, and
other ``viable suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Porter case there was no physical evidence and a shaky
witness. One victim was in Porter's gang, which cast doubt on
motive. The other victim's mother believed Porter was innocent
because she last saw her daughter with Simon and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Protess emphasizes that his investigations are collaborative
efforts involving people with various skills.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in Protess' course, a private investigator, Paul
Ciolino, teaches about dicey neighborhoods. (Among his tips:
``Always wear tennis shoes so you can run, or, if you get a door
slammed on your foot, it won't hurt that much.'') Protess makes
students act out all interviews in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehearse everything, so that if there's a person in prison
who hasn't talked about his crime for years, we practice how to get
him to talk,'' said Shawn Armbrust, a student on the Porter case.
</P>
<P>
   Protess wants his students to learn investigative skills, but he
also wants to solve cases. Sometimes he speaks to witnesses before
students do. Sometimes he suggests a certain interview team,
knowing students appear less threatening than a professional
reporter or an investigator. On crucial interviews, he or Ciolino
go along, because ``the credibility of college students would be in
question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says that two women should go to do this interview, I'd
get angry,'' said a student, Tom McCann. ``But then I thought about
it, and I realized it did make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Protess sat in a car while Ms. Armbrust and Cara Rubinsky,
another student, went into Simon's home in Milwaukee. The students
were to play ``good cops'' while Protess would come in later as the
``bad cop.''
</P>
<P>
   When students found Simon's estranged wife, Inez Jackson, in
Milwaukee, they told her there was a message from a relative in
prison that their professor wanted to deliver personally. They did
not reveal the relative's name because Protess feared that would
prompt a detailed conversation in which he should take part.
</P>
<P>
   Protess knows private investigators like Ciolino may use
techniques journalists would not. Ciolino tried to elicit Simon's
confession by showing a videotape of a man who said he saw Simon
commit the murders. The man, who worked for Ciolino, was only
pretending to be an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have delayed exonerating Porter, saying they need to
investigate the impact of the fake tape. Simon's lawyer is not
saying his client did not kill the couple, only that it was
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Protess said he considered a tactic like Ciolino's tape
inappropriate for journalists unless it was the only way to get
information ``in a story with life and death stakes.'' He said
other methods were available in the Porter case.
</P>
<P>
   Protess also involves members of the news media in order to get
the story out. He allowed a CBS producer to follow the Porter
investigation. And he often consults with a columnist at the
Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Protess' approach spawns the criticism that he is
controlling or didactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some issues that we did not agree with him on, how
to handle the case, and we would have to do it his way,'' said
Laura Sullivan, a student on the Ford Heights case. Ms. Sullivan,
now a reporter with the Sun in Baltimore, added, ``It's like your
greatest defects are also your best assets. It's all those negative
attributes that make him so good at what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Ford Heights case, Protess had a well-publicized spat
with his students over a movie deal. Ms. Sullivan said the students
felt he pressured them to sign a contract. Protess said he was
angry that the students pocketed their movie fees. He gave his to
the wrongly convicted men. In retrospect, Protess, who is rejecting
movie deals on the Porter case, said he could have been ``more
understanding'' in conveying his views.
</P>
<P>
   Protess has also learned to alter his dealings with prosecutors
and defense lawyers, requiring both to subpoena information. When
prosecutors interviewed him about Inez Jackson, Protess refused to
disclose her address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have a bunch of cops running up there and
interrogating her,'' he said. ``They said, `We're going to find her
anyway.' We said, `We don't think so.'''

MENSA FOUND NOT LIABLE FOR MEMBER'S BRAIN DRAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Md.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mensa higher intelligence organization is not
responsible for turning one of its members into a ``space cadet''
after a light fixture landed on his head, a Houston judge ruled
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   William Bundy, 52, a homebuilder from Crownsville, Md., claims a
light fixture fell on his head July 5, 1996, while he was attending
a Mensa conference at the downtown Houston Hyatt Regency.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy filed a state district lawsuit in July 1998 seeking more
more than $10 million from Mensa, the Hyatt Regency and a Dallas
company that he says designed the light fixture, Daiker Howard Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to have earned no money the last two years because he
no longer has the mental capacity to perform his job and suffers
from ``increasing headaches the more time I spend thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This leads to a `space cadet' feeling with everything
happening in slow motion,'' his court papers say. ``I find I am no
longer capable of multi-tasking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundy's alleged mental deficiencies have not prevented him from
representing himself in his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Tracy Christopher dismissed Mensa from the
lawsuit, saying the organization had no responsibility for the
hotel's light fixture. Hyatt Regency and Daiker Howard remain
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Mensa attorney William Pilat told Christopher there is no
evidence that any of the events described in the lawsuit occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy claims a Mensa official asked him to move ``a popcorn
machine'' to make room for a display, and when he agreed to move
the machine it could have caused the 15-pound light fixture to fall
on him. He said he was temporarily knocked out and did not realize
what had happened when he came to.
</P>
<P>
   He said a Mensa member ``put the light fixture back on the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundy argued that although Mensa members saw him ``staggering''
and falling because of the accident, they never offered him medical
assistance and did not tell him what happened until a day after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nature of the injury, the plaintiff was still
unable to comprehend the extent of his injuries and the necessity
of treatment,'' the lawsuit said. ``The plaintiff staggered around
the gathering from Friday morning until he left Sunday without
anyone summoning medical assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundy said he sought medical help after returning to Maryland
and has been diagnosed with ``a concussion followed by
post-concussion syndrome a.k.a. traumatic brain injury a.k.a.
closed head injury.''
</P>
<P>
   He owns his own home-building company (which has the motto
``Better Built by Bundy Built'') but claims he has been mentally
unable to work since the accident, has generated no income and has
been living off savings.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims the alleged accident has caused him to suffer
from sleep disorders, a ``loss of ability to function on a personal
level and maintain a relationship'' and a rotator cuff tear because
of his long layoff from homebuilding.

 &HT;    The dangerous dance of eating disorders
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; EMBARGOED for Sunday, March 7
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The churning of her stomach was a good kind of
pain, like the fire in her calf muscles after a vigorous workout.
She was stronger than hunger, it told her, stronger than everyone
else who needed food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, you are on top of the world at that point in
time,'' Caroline Winkler says.
</P>
<P>
   The only time she felt better was when she was dancing. She
loved everything about ballet _ the crowds, the applause, the
flowers on stage, but most of all the pride of performing. Winkler
the dancer was not an insecure teen-ager but a successful
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   They went together like tights and a tutu, the dancing and
fasting. It was obvious to her that the dancing helped keep her
thin and her carrot-stick figure helped her dancing. ``You're told
the costumes aren't made to fit you,'' she says. ``You're made to
fit them.''
</P>
<P>
   How was she supposed to know that her dedication to sleekness
would jeopardize her dance career? She's only 19. How could she be
on the brink of osteoporosis, with less bone density than her
grandmother?
</P>
<P>
   That's what they told her earlier this year when she left her
Centerville home for 17 days in a clinic for eating disorders.
Doctors said the intense exercise of dancing is out, for at least a
year. They also told her it wasn't such a great accomplishment
after all when she weighed as little as 90 pounds at 5 feet 6
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is my life,'' Winkler said before leaving the Renfrew
Center, a Philadelphia women's mental health center specializing in
eating disorders. ``It's what I love. It's my passion. Knowing what
I've done to myself, that I took my dream away and I'm my own worst
enemy, is very scary. I basically shattered my dreams right before
my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on medical leave from Dayton Ballet's second company,
Winkler sees a new dream dawning even beyond the formidable task of
beating bulimia and anorexia nervosa after six years. She wants to
help others recover from eating disorders, preferably without the
panic attacks, bald spots, sleepless nights and shriveled bowel
that she has endured. ``I want to go around to high schools and
talk,'' she says, and she's establishing a foundation to help
people pay for the expensive treatment that health plans rarely
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake people make in trying to reach those who have eating
disorders is in assuming they think and reason the same way as the
rest of us. For one thing, says Winkler, people think the problem
is food when food is only a means for coping with the real
problems. Her story is a rare insight into the thought processes
behind anorexia and bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler believed she had to be perfect. Her older sister's a med
student, her mother owns a dancewear store, her father owns an
accounting firm and she's what? A dancer? ``I always felt that I
was a failure. I love my family to death, but I just felt I
couldn't compare to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about her eating disorder was it insulated her
from those feelings. She didn't realize it at the time, of course,
but anorexia subconsciously relieved her from feeling anything.
``You don't have time for feelings. You're consumed with thinking
about food.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone insulted or slighted her, she didn't have to respond.
She could just deny herself another meal, or maybe think about the
dry salad she would eat for lunch, focus all her attention on the
smell and the taste and the texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mask,'' she calls her eating disorder. It hid all her
problems, not just from herself but from everyone else. Nobody was
going to say, ``Caroline, you really shouldn't be so hard on
yourself'' or, ``Caroline, why can't you be more assertive?'' To
her friends and family, her dwindling body was so obvious that they
couldn't possibly notice any other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders affect about 8 million Americans, including 1
million boys and men, according to the National Association of
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, which include compulsive
and binge eating as well as bulimia. Between 3 percent and 9
percent of them will die, depending on the estimate, making the
disorders more deadly than drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not something just dancers get,'' says Kara
Fowler, a registered dietitian in Cincinnati who is Winkler's
nutritional therapist. Sure, it's more common among dancers,
models, gymnasts, wrestlers _ fields driven by appearance _ and
also among chefs and dietitians. But eating disorders ``happen
across all age groups, in all types of fields,'' Fowler says.
</P>
<P>
   For Winkler, dancing was another shield from those depressing
human flaws. Whatever she did in school or elsewhere, she was a
great anorexic and a great dancer. ``Dancers don't need to know
anything,'' she told herself. ``Except how to stand on their
toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancing added the benefit of letting her be somebody else. Even
if she didn't deserve much attention and applause the rest of the
time, she always got it when she took the stage. She knew she
deserved it there, too. She liked Caroline the dancer, and so did
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so pretty,'' people would tell her. ``You have a great
body. I can tell you're a dancer.'' That became her identity, thin
and a dancer, ``and that's what I loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she necessarily agreed about being pretty. Even when
Winkler weighed 105 pounds, wearing size 1 or children's clothing,
she couldn't bear the sight of that blob in the mirror. ``I don't
see bones. I see fat all over my body,'' she says even now at 114
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach was flat, but never flat enough. My hip bones stuck
out. It still wasn't flat enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Her stomach, her thighs, her rear end, ``even my face is too
fat.'' She can accept the muscular calves and biceps from dancing,
but her ankles? ``Way too big for me.'' So are her fingers. Her
wrists, as her weight creeps up, ``are getting a little big, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all is her lower back. She can't see her ribs there
anymore. ``It's so scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler went on her first diet at 13, the age her caretakers
mark as the beginning of her eating disorder. She threw up her
first meal on purpose at 16. She'll never forget what her dance
instructor told the class that day. The guest choreographer had
told them to take a break, but when the teacher came back to the
studio, she hollered, ``Get up off your fat, lazy,
Centerville-snobby asses.''
</P>
<P>
   The instructor was right, Winkler told herself. ``I am fat and
lazy. I probably need to start losing weight.'' She threw up her
dinner that night, and soon she was taking diet pills and
laxatives.
</P>
<P>
   She still ate McDonald's and pizza with the rest of the kids.
``I would just get rid of it.'' Eventually all she had to do was go
to the restroom and bend over, without even sticking her finger
down her throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually kept about one meal a day and maybe a snack down,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she couldn't sneak off by herself, but that's why she
carried laxatives in her purse. ``I popped three or four of those
puppies in and the same thing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This bulimic routine was not painless, Winkler says. Her
esophagus hurt almost constantly, and the retching tortured her
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every time I threw up, I threw up blood,'' she says.
``But it didn't matter what I did to my body.'' Anything she did to
stay thin was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's fear of gaining weight rarely loosened its choke hold
from that first bulimic night at 16. ``That would have been, as I
saw it, killing myself,'' she says. Not literally. She never was
suicidal. But if anything ever kept her from dancing, that would be
``killing my identity.''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen, she was sure. She had seen other dancers put on
probation for gaining weight, and she never lacked for weight-loss
techniques. Among dancers, she says, calories, carbohydrates and
resisted cravings are standard shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's fear was scarred into her mind like gasoline spilled
on the lawn by the time she earned a spot with Dayton Ballet II,
the amateur apprentice troupe. Freshly graduated from Centerville
High School in 1997, she made her career choice expecting to hear
even more emphasis on weight. She was surprised to hear the
instructors there talk about better conditioning instead of less
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issue is fitness, not thinness,'' says Dermot Burke,
Dayton Ballet's executive director. These are high-performance
athletes, he says, and they can't function any better on an empty
stomach than pro football players.
</P>
<P>
   From Burke's perspective, that's the attitude at most elite
dance companies. He thinks dance directors are probably more
sensitive to eating disorders than other athletic instructors
because anorexia and bulimia have been so closely associated with
dance. They're learning to say, ``You're out of shape,'' for
example, instead of ``You're fat.''
</P>
<P>
   But that enlightenment hasn't necessarily trickled down to youth
instructors, he acknowledges, and they're at the level where
dancers ``start to equate goodness with thinness.'' Then when a
young dancer starts wasting away, even the most loving friends and
family members don't quite know how to bring up the skeleton in the
living room. Most of the time, Burke says they don't allow
themselves to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's mother, Susan, missed the signs for the longest time
even though she had experienced mild anorexia in her dancing days.
Looking back, she can't believe the conversation she once had with
a friend of hers as they watched their daughters practice. They
were talking about other girls on weight probation, and they
decided their daughters had ``just figured out how to lose
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before she graduated, Winkler told her sister, Valerie,
about the bulimia. She must have wanted to quit throwing up, she
says now. She even kept the appointments with her school counselor
and the Undereaters Anonymous group that Valerie made for her, even
though she knew her bulimia problems were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I just wouldn't eat,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, a trip to the dentist clinched her decision. She
had 25 cavities in 11 teeth from all the stomach acid she had
thrown up.
</P>
<P>
   But anorexia was harder to hide from her friends and family. She
couldn't go out to dinner and order coffee with a parsley sprig.
``I didn't want people to know,'' she says. They just would have
nagged her about eating.
</P>
<P>
   So when she moved into an apartment two summers ago, she went
back to bulimia. Not until March 1998, when she returned to her
parents' house after foot surgery, did she settle on anorexia
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The high was what hooked her on anorexia, a light-headed feeling
like an exercise high. She'd feel intensely hungry about four times
a day, but the pangs would leave after 10 minutes and the high
would last for two or three hours. ``But after a while, I had no
hunger, and I still had the highs.''
</P>
<P>
   She ate enough, she figured. She had lots of light yogurt and
fruit, especially apples and cantaloupe. She knew anorexics died of
potassium depletion, so she ate a banana every day. She had the
impression it burned 100 calories to digest an 80-calorie egg, so
that was her protein source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to protect my muscles,'' she says. But carbohydrates,
starches, dairy products besides light yogurt? Not a chance. After
a few months, she always knew how many calories were in her body.
She could figure it out in her head.
</P>
<P>
   She suppressed her hunger every day with six gallons of water.
She supplemented that with the diuretics in caffeinated Diet Coke
and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home and her parents offered a meal, she would say
she had eaten out. ``I lied a lot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She also shopped a lot, oddly. She'd come home with bags of
groceries, but she gave them all away. Or she baked. Cookies, pies,
cakes, and she always told people she had sampled them while she
was cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I satisfied myself was watching them eat, and asking,
`What does that taste like? Is it good? Describe it to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   She volunteered to make the lunch runs for her co-workers, and
she usually brought everyone back something extra. That was
satisfying, too. ``I was stronger than they were,'' she says.
``They were weak. They ate that cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't that Winkler didn't care about food. ``It's all I
thought about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She dreamed about the half a cantaloupe she would gorge on for
breakfast. Where others express their emotions by singing or
painting or writing poetry, she obsessed about the food she would
not eat.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's parents were alarmed about her weight even before she
went to Puerto Rico on a dance tour last June and July. They had
argued about her lack of eating. She was down to 105 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Susan says the biggest mistake she made was trying
to deal with it herself. She had been through anorexia, both her
own and her brother's. She knew what to do. She'd cook Caroline's
favorite meals, she'd sit with her at the table, as long as it
took, giving her moral support through the meal.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. All Caroline ate was fruit, dry English muffins,
unbuttered corn, salmon and crab legs, and not a lot of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost real precious time before we got professional help,''
Susan says.
</P>
<P>
   At least Caroline was traveling with her private dance
instructor, another recovering anorexic. The coach assured Susan
she'd help Caroline gain weight in Puerto Rico. But when she came
off the plane in Dayton, Susan knew right away Caroline had lost
more weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her upper arms were so small I could pretty much put my
fingers around them,'' Susan says. ``Her legs were tiny and
fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline started spending seven hours a day at the gym and dance
studio. She had a chance to get her body fat measured and it was 8
percent. Normal for a healthy female is 18 percent to 24 percent,
says Fowler, the dietician at Nutrition Access. Anything below 14
percent is considered dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so cool,'' Caroline says.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents felt helpless. ``We didn't know where to turn,''
Susan says, and they couldn't stop wondering what they had done to
cause this horror for their daughter, ``what you've said in the
past. Did you make comments that she needed to lose weight? What
was going to happen to her? It was awful.''

 &HT;    The dangerous dance of eating disorders
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; EMBARGOED for Sunday, March 7
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The churning of her stomach was a good kind of
pain, like the fire in her calf muscles after a vigorous workout.
She was stronger than hunger, it told her, stronger than everyone
else who needed food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, you are on top of the world at that point in
time,'' Caroline Winkler says.
</P>
<P>
   The only time she felt better was when she was dancing. She
loved everything about ballet _ the crowds, the applause, the
flowers on stage, but most of all the pride of performing. Winkler
the dancer was not an insecure teen-ager but a successful
entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   They went together like tights and a tutu, the dancing and
fasting. It was obvious to her that the dancing helped keep her
thin and her carrot-stick figure helped her dancing. ``You're told
the costumes aren't made to fit you,'' she says. ``You're made to
fit them.''
</P>
<P>
   How was she supposed to know that her dedication to sleekness
would jeopardize her dance career? She's only 19. How could she be
on the brink of osteoporosis, with less bone density than her
grandmother?
</P>
<P>
   That's what they told her earlier this year when she left her
Centerville home for 17 days in a clinic for eating disorders.
Doctors said the intense exercise of dancing is out, for at least a
year. They also told her it wasn't such a great accomplishment
after all when she weighed as little as 90 pounds at 5 feet 6
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is my life,'' Winkler said before leaving the Renfrew
Center, a Philadelphia women's mental health center specializing in
eating disorders. ``It's what I love. It's my passion. Knowing what
I've done to myself, that I took my dream away and I'm my own worst
enemy, is very scary. I basically shattered my dreams right before
my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on medical leave from Dayton Ballet's second company,
Winkler sees a new dream dawning even beyond the formidable task of
beating bulimia and anorexia nervosa after six years. She wants to
help others recover from eating disorders, preferably without the
panic attacks, bald spots, sleepless nights and shriveled bowel
that she has endured. ``I want to go around to high schools and
talk,'' she says, and she's establishing a foundation to help
people pay for the expensive treatment that health plans rarely
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake people make in trying to reach those who have eating
disorders is in assuming they think and reason the same way as the
rest of us. For one thing, says Winkler, people think the problem
is food when food is only a means for coping with the real
problems. Her story is a rare insight into the thought processes
behind anorexia and bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler believed she had to be perfect. Her older sister's a med
student, her mother owns a dancewear store, her father owns an
accounting firm and she's what? A dancer? ``I always felt that I
was a failure. I love my family to death, but I just felt I
couldn't compare to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about her eating disorder was it insulated her
from those feelings. She didn't realize it at the time, of course,
but anorexia subconsciously relieved her from feeling anything.
``You don't have time for feelings. You're consumed with thinking
about food.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone insulted or slighted her, she didn't have to respond.
She could just deny herself another meal, or maybe think about the
dry salad she would eat for lunch, focus all her attention on the
smell and the taste and the texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mask,'' she calls her eating disorder. It hid all her
problems, not just from herself but from everyone else. Nobody was
going to say, ``Caroline, you really shouldn't be so hard on
yourself'' or, ``Caroline, why can't you be more assertive?'' To
her friends and family, her dwindling body was so obvious that they
couldn't possibly notice any other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders affect about 8 million Americans, including 1
million boys and men, according to the National Association of
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, which include compulsive
and binge eating as well as bulimia. Between 3 percent and 9
percent of them will die, depending on the estimate, making the
disorders more deadly than drug addiction.

past. Did you make comments that she needed to lose weight? What
was going to happen to her? It was awful.''

   On-Line Stock Advice From the Junior Set &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it written that a stock guru has to be old enough to
vote. But in the age of the Internet, where anyone with a modem can
dispense financial wisdom and shift market tides, there are other
questions raised about people like Daniel Miller, 15, who maintains
a stock-advice Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by a CNBC appearance last month, as well as a couple
of stellar picks, his following has been growing so quickly that he
is soliciting advertising for his site and considering charging
admission.
</P>
<P>
   Miller ducks into the computer room or the library at the Frisch
Yeshiva School in Paramus, N.J., where he is in the ninth grade, to
post his observations on line. One day last month, he dashed off
this note, typo and all: &QL; 
``2/23/99 _ FSOL is my pick . . . I havbe class will explain
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before, shares in Filtered Souls Entertainment Inc., a
small hip-hop record label in Canada, had risen 92 percent. And
that, perhaps, was evidence of Miller's influence: He had discussed
the company on the Silicon Investor site before he actually
recommended it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He later told a reporter that he had heard about Filtered Souls
through an anonymous e-mail tip and then read more about it on the
Business Financial Network site, which was paid a fee for its
positive report.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Lambert, president of Filtered Souls, said he had never
heard of Miller before, but was ``just happy with the publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity pleases Miller less. His father, Leon, has
temporarily curbed interviews _ but not before his son could ask a
reporter, ``Is this story going to be positive or negative?''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone charging for investment advice needs to register as an
investment adviser, said Duncan King, a spokesman for the
Securities and Exchange Commission. But the First Amendment, he
said, protects the average citizen or stock tipster, who, for no
payment, simply wants to get up on his Web-based soapbox. &QL;

   As Marvin S. Traub, chief executive of Bloomingdale's until
1991, is discovering, retailing in the heart of Texas has
challenges never encountered in the heart of Manhattan's East Side.
For one thing, floods. When the San Marcos River soaked the city of
San Marcos last October, Traub had to delay his plans for opening
the first store in his new Home Company-Fine Furniture Direct chain
from May to July.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are meant to add discounted fine furniture to the
Prime Retail outlet malls that now concentrate on clothing. Traub,
a Prime Retail director, is chairman of the new chain; he expects
it to have 10 stores in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   As president of a consulting firm that bears his name, Traub,
73, also works with Coin, an Italian retailer, and Lanvin of Paris,
and has created a Johnny Walker line of clothing. ``I'm just back
from London and the South of France, and I'm on my way to Paris and
Milan on Sunday,'' he said on Friday, somewhat breathlessly. ``Then
I'm back for a week, then I go skiing for five days.''

   Bridging Goldman's Gender Gap &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is an iconoclastic time at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. The
130-year old investment bank recently broke one long tradition when
it decided to end its partnership and go public. Now it's breaking
another: the male-dominated executive suite. The firm announced on
Friday that two women, Robin Neustein and Leslie Tortora, would
join the management committee, the top executive group.
</P>
<P>
   Both are central to strategy talks at Goldman. Ms. Neustein, 45,
began her career as an investment banker but since 1991 has served
as the firm's informal chief of staff. The role has taken on
heightened importance as Goldman aims to remake itself into a
public company, with more openness and stable management.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tortora, 42, heads Goldman's information technology
division, a new entity. She also leads an Internet committee, a
task made all the more pressing by the need to present a clear
Internet vision when Goldman markets itself to investors beginning
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, technology seems to rise in prominence in terms of
business strategy; we are trying to figure out how to leverage it,
not just be reactive,'' Ms. Tortora said, reflecting on the reasons
that she was given a management committee seat.
</P>
<P>
   She and Ms. Neustein say their promotions also send a message to
Goldman women. ``The secret of success here is finding a mentor,''
Ms. Neustein said. ``So we're pretty proud to have some women at
the top.''

CARDINAL O'CONNOR MEDIATES BETWEEN BLACK BUSINESS LEADERS AND
POLICE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Worried about the bitter aftermath of the shooting of
Amadou Diallo, Cardinal John O'Connor has helped bring together
black business leaders and officials of the police union to discuss
just how severely the incident has frayed the relationship between
black New Yorkers and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal mediated an emotional meeting between the two
groups on Thursday in his midtown Manhattan office, one of several
sessions planned by representatives of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association and 100 Black Men, a civic group of black
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the meeting, the participants agreed to sponsor a
joint prayer service for racial peace with the cardinal, possibly
at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and to continue discussing sensitive
issues, such as whether street searches by officers in minority
neighborhoods have grown too expansive.
</P>
<P>
   Four plainclothes officers were searching for a rapist last
month when they confronted Diallo, an unarmed West African
immigrant, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. He
died in a barrage of 41 police bullets fired when the officers,
according to their lawyers, mistakenly believed he was reaching for
a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on Thursday underscored how seriously a broad
spectrum of leaders is viewing the strained relationship between
blacks and the police force.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he was particularly struck by the remarks of
Brother Tyrone Davis, director of the Archdiocese of New York's
Office of Black Ministry, who related at the meeting how he is
often stopped by officers, even while wearing clerical garb, for no
other apparent reason than that he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a great number of black people and other people of
color in the New York area who sincerely believe that they are far
more vulnerable to the police than white people are,'' the cardinal
said in an interview Friday. ``I have tremendous respect for our
police force, but clearly we have problems, and we have to get at
those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed to ask the cardinal to preside over their
meeting. Several black participants said the cardinal's role was
essential, in part because they believe he holds a position of
special respect within the Police Department, where more than half
the officers are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Gatling, president of 100 Black Men of New York, said he
hoped the cardinal's involvement would help officers understand the
anger and fear that the Diallo shooting has provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cardinal reaches out, and police families realize that
Cardinal O'Connor is involved in this, we thought this would reach
to their better side, their conscience and their religious base to
say, `This is bad and we must do something about it,''' Gatling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the police union, James Savage, said the
meeting opened a dialogue in which he conveyed that officers employ
aggressive patrol tactics to protect black citizens, not to show
disrespect for them. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has repeatedly said
since the shooting that, whatever the perceptions may be,
statistics show that officers have shown greater restraint in the
use of force in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the meetings is to try to work this out jointly
instead of screaming at one another over barricades,'' Savage said.
``We sort of needed a mediator like the cardinal, somebody who was
trusted by both sides.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The careful balance in the cardinal's position on the shooting
was evident in a sermon on Feb. 14 when he expressed his sympathy
for the Diallo family, his concern about continued racism and his
belief that, whatever the conduct of individual police officers,
``the follies, the sins, the treacheries, the violence, even the
killings perpetrated by some, cannot, must not, blind us to the
nobility of the vast majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal opened Thursday's 90-minute meeting by distributing
copies of that sermon and then spent much of the rest of the time
listening to his eight visitors, four from the union and four from
the black civic group.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the meeting had come up at a preliminary talk the
two groups had late last month at the offices of Howard Rubenstein,
the public relations executive who represents both organizations.
Both sides said they felt the issues would be more easily discussed
in the presence of someone with the moral force of the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not paper over their differences,'' said Rubenstein,
who attended the meeting. ``They were blunt, but civil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling related how he was stopped two years ago, just blocks
from Police Headquarters, by a police officer who used a racial
slur in addressing him. He had just left a meeting, he said, with
police officials about how to improve the department's relationship
with minorities. ``I was scared out of my wits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Savage said he told the group it was unfair to view police
officers as racist because of their diligence in attempting to
combat crime in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply told them that police officers assigned to black and
Latino communities feel that they are doing a service to the
community, and when they stop people, they think they are
benefiting the community,'' Savage said. ``They don't think they
are harassing the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said he and his staff would try to come up with
concrete suggestions to improve relations between the Police
Department and minority communities. ``But I tried to warn them,''
he said. ``I don't have any smoke and mirrors. I happen to be in a
very visible position, but that doesn't make me a genius.''

 By EDWIN MCDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Atop the observation deck of the 605-foot-high Space
Needle, Douglas Brown pointed out Mount Rainier, the towering
snow-capped peak in the distance, to his wide-eyed wife. Next he
explained where the distinctive white ferryboats were probably
heading as they chugged across Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he remarked that in this coffee-loving city, it was
not unusual to find espresso machines in gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not your usual travelogue, and these were not your
everyday tourists. Douglas and Gladys Brown, who live in Queens,
were eager volunteers in the small but growing army of long-weekend
warriors _ travelers who journey the country, and often the world,
on fares available only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any Internet fares, but the rock-bottom,
last-minute ones known as E-fares, generally offered at midweek for
the following weekend's travel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the E-fares offered in recent weeks have been round trips
between Chicago and Philadelphia for $129, Houston and Boston for
$229, and Newark and Rio de Janeiro for $399 _ each roughly half
the lowest coach fare. But that is only a sprinkling of the
hundreds of heavily discounted E-fare flights available each week
from the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are among the tens of thousands of travelers who use
E-fares to good advantage. Eager for his wife, who was born in
Argentina, to see her newly adopted country, Brown has traveled
with her in recent months to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston,
San Antonio, Orlando, Fla., and Chicago. Before long, the couple
hope to use E-fares to visit Argentina, where Mrs. Brown will
assume the role of tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, their 4,800-mile round trip between New York
and Seattle, where Brown lived for six months in 1995, cost them a
bargain-basement $239 each _ roughly 5 cents a mile. That compares
with an industry average of 13.1 cents a mile for trips in 1997,
the latest year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-fares are almost always the cheapest fares available on the
Internet, averaging 5 to 15 percent lower than 14-day advance
fares,'' said Michael Stellwag, a former pricing analyst with
Southwest Airlines and now an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in New
York. ``The 14-day tickets let you stay away longer, but the
disadvantage is that you can't just pick up and go.''
</P>
<P>
   These fares are not for creatures of habit or those who prefer a
relaxing weekend at home to a whirlwind visit to another city. They
are also not for workaholics or people who have trouble making up
their minds: When an airline sends out a mass e-mailing announcing
a flight and fare that suits you, you've got to jump _ or risk
losing out. Hamlet would probably be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   So who is darting to E-fares? It is risky to generalize, but
many buyers fall into three rough categories: separated lovers,
people who make repeat visits to relatives or friends, and people
hungry for adventure. What they have in common are flexible work
schedules, spontaneity and, usually, no small children.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``leisure travelers shop for price, and tend to be
males between 18 and 30,'' said Jason N. Ader, a managing director
at Bear Stearns, who a few months ago produced a report on Internet
bookings by leisure travelers. ``And about 90 percent of all
leisure travelers who make bookings use the Internet for other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   E-fare travel is growing rapidly, the airlines say, though they
divulge no numbers. Millions of people sign up with one or more
airlines to receive free e-mails that list the fare offers for the
weekend. To stand the best chance of getting a ticket, they must
respond quickly _ usually within a day, though less popular routes
may still be available on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   They can book by e-mail or, for an extra $20 a ticket, by phone.
For domestic travel, many E-fares require a Saturday departure and
a Monday or Tuesday return, though there are variations.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, which originated the weekend getaways in 1996
to fill seats that would otherwise have stayed empty, now has 2.1
million subscribers. And with Delta joining in a month ago, all the
major United States airlines now take part.
</P>
<P>
   While airlines decline to say how much they derive from E-fares,
American said its monthly revenues ``are into seven figures.'' That
means at least $12 million a year, and while that is minuscule
compared with American's estimated 1998 passenger revenue of $16
billion to $17 billion, it can pay for a lot of in-flight snacks,
overtime or jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, airlines derive revenue from the discount rates
they arrange for E-fare passengers with certain hotels and rental
car companies.
</P>
<P>
   E-fares also nurture familiarity that could translate into
patronage when the e-mail customers buy higher-priced tickets.
</P>
<P>
   These fares were spawned, basically, by computer analysis. The
airlines are getting better all the time at using computers to
analyze past trends and future bookings, and then to predict, often
far in advance, roughly how many empty seats there will be on a
given flight.
</P>
<P>
   The information also enables them to determine how many seats
they can fill at Fare A, Fare B and so on. That explains the wide
range of fares for the same flights, with passengers often paying
two or three times as much as their seatmates, or even more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the Browns' nonstop flight to Seattle _ Continental Airlines
Flight 121 _ fares ranged from their $239 to $307 for a 14-day
advance purchase to $1,828 for a same-day coach ticket. (One oddity
of the complex new world of air travel is that last-minute
travelers can pay both the highest and lowest fares.)
</P>
<P>
   Airlines try to calculate all the angles. While few Saturday
flights carry business travelers, whose higher fares pay most bills
at most airlines, leisure travelers abound on Saturday mornings,
said Stellwag of Warburg Dillon Read. But because there are still
some Saturday morning seats to fill, airlines allow E-fare
passengers to depart on Saturday morning and also return on Monday,
another busy travel time, as well as on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the airlines insisted on E-fare travel only at off-peak
times, the getaways would either be too compressed or would cut
further into the workweek, and ``not enough people would buy
E-fares to make them worthwhile,'' Stellwag said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find them worthwhile include Stellwag himself, who,
with his background in airlines, love of travel and reasonably
flexible hours, is adept at working the E-fare system to his
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he flew from Newark to Indianapolis on Continental,
then rented a car and drove 90 minutes to central Illinois to see
his grandmother. While he was there, he helped her buy a car (a
Buick Park Avenue), and she looked over his tax return, using the
skills from her years in a tax business with her husband. ``I have
an M.B.A. in finance,'' Stellwag explained, ``but I still need help
with my taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before his Indianapolis trip, Stellwag resorted to
another bit of E-fare creativity. Unable to find an inexpensive
flight to New Orleans, where he gets together each year during
Mardi Gras with seven buddies from Southwest Airlines, he found a
Continental E-fare to Birmingham, Ala., for $129 and then flew to
New Orleans on Southwest. His deft two-step saved more than $500
off the regular Newark-New Orleans round-trip fare.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ford, a manager for Global Crossing, a telecommunications
company in Morristown, N.J., used similar ingenuity two years ago,
while he was working for AT&AMP;T in Chicago. He was given two tickets
to a Chicago Bulls-New York Knicks game that he knew his brother in
New Jersey would love to see.
</P>
<P>
   There were no E-fare tickets from Newark to Chicago that
weekend, but there were some from Newark to Toronto and from
Toronto to Chicago. ``So I routed my brother through Toronto,''
Ford said. Not only did they get to see Michael Jordan, he added,
but ``the Knicks won the game by a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Smith of Arlington, Va., and his wife, Sue Wadel, are
typical of those who thrive on spontaneity. Last fall, they
traveled to Madrid on impulse, spending time in the Prado, and last
month, on a lark, they spent four days in Frankfurt. They have the
flexibility to travel at the last minute, said Smith, who does
radio and television voice-overs, and the E-fares make it all
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Todd J. St. John, a finance manager for United Parcel Service in
Mahwah, N.J., often flies on impulse to Louisville, where he has
friends, and returns on the first flight Monday morning to be in
the office by 10. Other times he takes a vacation day to fly to Los
Angeles, where he is met by his brother, and they drive four hours
to Las Vegas, a popular destination for leisure travelers and
therefore not often available on E-fares.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of partying, they drive back to Los Angeles in
time for St. John to catch the Monday-night red-eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one seems to have kept score, airline officials say
E-fares may have kindled or sustained almost as many romances as
Cupid.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Dan Robbins, president of a computer consulting
company in Linden, N.J., met his intended, a Seattle beautician
named Tiffany Loboduk, through the Internet. Now he often uses
Continental E-fares to be with her on weekends. ``It's probably no
more expensive to fly to Seattle than my phone bill would be if I
stayed home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Donohue, newly engaged to Kristen Kenny of New
Providence, N.J., was transferred to Milwaukee two years ago by his
employer, Bacardi-Martini. At first, he flew home to see her as
often as time and finances allowed, usually about every two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was soon fed up with that, so I might have lost her,'' he
said. But after discovering E-fares, he flew home every couple of
weeks. Now Donohue has been reassigned to Bacardi-Martini's office
in Paramus, N.J., and he and Ms. Kenny plan to marry on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, perhaps most, use E-fares mainly to visit family
and friends. Geneva Tucker of Summit, N.J., flies Continental
between Newark and Greensboro, N.C., about once a month to see her
16-month-old grandson and her daughter, Kerry Pearson, who attends
the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She gets back in
time to attend a late-afternoon Monday class at the New Jersey
Institute of Technology in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weekend schedule works out nicely,'' Mrs. Tucker said.
``My daughter gets a little break, and my grandson doesn't forget
who his `G.G.,' Grandma Geneva, is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their popularity, E-fares do not lack for critics. Some
complain about the paucity of seats to Boston, Miami, Orlando and
other desirable cities in high seasons, while others say the short
span between the posting of the week's destinations and the
departures leaves little time to arrange for a day off or for the
care and feeding of children or pets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But without those limits, E-fares probably would not exist.
``It's true that some markets like Boston and Florida show up
rarely,'' said Ken Bott, manager of Internet marketing for
Continental. E-fares, he pointed out, are for flights on which
airlines have empty seats, ``and we only have seats available when
the rest of the universe isn't trying to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Posting available flights sooner, airline officials say, could
disrupt their systemwide price structure, which must accommodate a
range of discounts, including 7-day, 14-day and 21-day advance
purchases. Besides, Bott added, E-fares are focused on a very
narrow subset of travelers _ those who have the time, money and
desire to travel on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics also say E-fares can be higher than promotional
fares sometimes available through the Internet or through travel
agents, and airline officials do not deny that this can happen
occasionally, especially on flights to cities where demand for
tickets is low. But such promotions are only short-term, while many
E-fare destinations are offered repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Stellwag, the analyst, said E-fares were also cheaper than those
available from Priceline.com, where customers offer a price they
are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is an obvious fan of E-fares, Stellwag said some
airlines understate their benefit to the bottom line. It costs
about 9.3 cents a mile to fly one passenger, he said, and since the
average flight is about 750 miles, the average cost per seat is
roughly $70. ``But airlines' E-fares average more than that,'' he
added, ``and they've increased about 20 percent since their
inception, because demand has been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, the cost of E-trips can still be substantial.
Including air fare, hotel, transportation to and from the airport,
rental car and meals, the Browns' 50-hour visit to Seattle cost
them about $1,000. That is not inconsiderable, even in a household
where both spouses work. Brown, 35, an accountant and financial
planner, works for Buck Consultants of New York, conducting two-day
seminars on retirement benefits for corporate employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown, 30, who had taught elementary school in Argentina,
sells cosmetics at the J.C. Penney store in the Queens Center Mall,
not far from their one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But they have no children and do not own a car. Their biggest
indulgences, other than travel, are books and movies. And they
agreed that the trip was worth the money, despite its brevity,
because they had enough time in Seattle to visit its art museum and
aquarium, dine at an upscale Asian restaurant, shop and take a
90-minute tour beneath the streets of a restored version of Pioneer
Square. (The original was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1889.)
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to the Seattle-Tacoma airport on Monday, they
even squeezed in a visit to the Museum of Flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great,'' Brown said of the trip. ``Every place we've
been is as if I'm seeing it for the first time through Gladys'
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And the United States has exceeded Mrs. Brown's expectations.
``What I like most about it,'' she said, trying to dodge raindrops
during a stroll to the Pike Place farmers' market, ``is finding
that most people here are so friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is doubly true of her husband, she suggested, as the couple
took turns recounting how they met three years ago at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago. Because neither could speak the
other's language, their friendship almost ended before it began _
until Brown dashed into a nearby bookstore, emerged with a Spanish
phrase book and pointed to a sentence asking if she would join him
for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneity, indeed.

 &HT;    Longtime schoolteacher's farm will inspire children in
perpetuity
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON COUNTY, S.C. _ It was her family farm for 65 years, and
it will be her 800-acre legacy for future generations of
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Thomason Bowie was a new bride in 1934, when she first
came to live in the red-brick manor house on a cotton plantation.
Her life there was virtually a line out of Gershwin's
``Summertime'': comfort, beauty, sweet soil, and her daddy-in-law
was already rich.
</P>
<P>
   She hardly needed to work, but she did, teaching school for 35
years. By the time her husband, Parker Bowie, inherited the farm,
he could have sold out and lived anywhere; but he didn't. He stayed
at the homeplace and became a gentleman farmer, a philanthropist, a
woodworker and a clockmaker for the blind. He died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Now 86, Bowie doesn't want to live anywhere else. The cotton
fields are gone, mostly replanted in hay or fescue for cattle. A
few goats are kept as pets. The peacocks that strut among the fruit
trees of her back yard are by no means pets, but their iridescent
feathers more than earn their keep.
</P>
<P>
   She may never touch another tractor, but Bowie is still very
much a country girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always lived on the farm,'' she said. ``I could
never get along in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, it came time to decide what to do with her
800-acre legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't bear to see the place broken apart or torn up,''
she said. Nearby farms had been quickly turned into mobile home
parks by their new owners. If her land went to a timber company,
the magnificent loblolly pines and poplars and cedars in her
woodlands would most likely be clear-cut. And even if a developer
turned it into a lovely golf course ringed by fine homes, no matter
what they called it or how much the property value appreciated, it
would never be a farm again.
</P>
<P>
   But since she had no children to leave it to, Bowie finally
reasoned, why not give it to everyone? So the lifelong teacher and
farm wife ensured that her farm will become a classroom for
generations into the future. She has formed the Thomason-Bowie
Foundation _ named in honor of her husband and her late brother,
Dr. Houston Thomason _ to operate her land as an agricultural and
environmental laboratory for the region's schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even in rural Anderson County, kids don't necessarily know a lot
about farming anymore, she noted. Developmental pressures and the
information age have reached into even these rural stretches of the
Savannah River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children don't have any idea where milk comes from,'' she
said. ``There are so few farms left.''
</P>
<P>
   But hers will remain. Though the details of the administration
of the foundation are still not settled, Bowie has already started
the work of making it into an open-air school.
</P>
<P>
   She has constructed two pavilions as outdoor lecture halls. A
pond that her husband built has been drained, cleared and refilled.
Miles of new trails have been cut through the nearly 200 acres of
the farm that remain in woodlands. Younger children can grow plants
to attract wildlife; older students can grow demonstration row
crops.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to build a Scout camp on the tract. Later,
the plantation house may be used as a regional tourism welcome
center.
</P>
<P>
   Local school officials are already giddy at the prospect of
having a place where their students can learn from the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we even comprehend yet the potential of what
future students can gain from this farm,'' said Craig Drennon,
principal of nearby Crescent High School. ``It explodes with
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always difficult to find a proper place for field trips to
illustrate what students are learning in class, Drennon said. ``And
it's even harder to find individuals like Mrs. Bowie, who are
willing to share what they have with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dillard, superintendent of the Anderson County school
district, which includes the Bowie farm, said not enough students
are interested in environmental and agricultural sciences. That's
largely because those subjects seldom come alive in the classroom,
he said. ``When students get to high school, they don't want to
take sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators are trying to combat this trend by advocating
``hands-on, inquiry-based programs,'' Dillard explained. The
problem is providing places where that kind of learning can occur.
``Having this farm, where the students can literally get their feet
wet, and having it right here in our midst is just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, that sort of hands-on education was demonstrated on
the Bowie farm when environmental specialists from Clemson
University conducted a lesson in the woods for about 80 elementary
and middle-school students.
</P>
<P>
   William ``Rockie'' English, a water quality specialist for the
Clemson Extension Service, put on his hip waders, slogged into the
stream and showed the children how bugs can tell them whether the
water is polluted or clean. He scooped up salamanders, crawfish and
mayflies and explained what their presence says about water
quality, then put the animal trophies and some creek water into
Ziploc bags and tossed them up for the children to examine.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Kyle McGee gave the creekside classroom high
marks. ``It was neat,'' he said. Seldom in a school setting does he
get a chance, as he did in Bowie's woods, to let a baby crawdad
creep up his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that I got to hold it and it didn't bite me, or
nothin','' Kyle added.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nearly hourlong demonstration, his fellow
students seemed equally rapt. They dangled over the railing of the
wooden bridge and hung on the scientist's words. They gazed in
wide-eyed awe at the baggies of bugs they passed around. Their
teachers barely had to say a corrective word to the kids crammed at
the edge of the creekbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reverting to my childhood,'' said English. He was teaching
by mucking in the creek; 30 or 40 years ago, he would've called it
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Watt, the county agent for the Clemson Extension Service,
said that's exactly what they expect to happen routinely at the
Bowie farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science taught in a classroom is just a subject,'' Watt said.
``Out here it comes to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie trekked into the woods with the students on that
particular day _ something her foundation provides a way for her to
do, in a sense, in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's thinking of the young people,'' said Alice Campbell,
chairwoman of Reviva, an economic and tourism development agency in
the nearby town of Iva.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bowies were active in the civic affairs of Iva. And their
donations to Erskine College, in Due West, have enabled the college
to build a new seminary building and, more recently, a fine arts
center named for Marie Bowie. Many of the antiques the couple
collected in their travels are among the center's exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick a while back and didn't think I was going to last
much longer,'' Bowie said. ``So I gave them a lot of my things.''
She smiled. ``Must've been crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the former teacher has no plans to vacate her
farmhouse: There is still the garden to tend and the greenhouses to
putter in. And the work of developing the farm as a learning lab
has actually helped her appreciate it more. The new trails have
enabled her to explore parts of the place that she'd never seen
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living here all these years,'' she whispered, ``and
I really didn't know it was so beautiful.''

 &HT;    The new Ebenezer
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 9 this morning, the members of Ebenezer Baptist
Church will rise from their wooden pews, bow their heads in prayer
and walk away from 113 years of history.
</P>
<P>
   The walk will be short, but it will unleash a lifetime of
memories for 85-year-old Jethro English.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Ebenezer that English saw the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. grow from a prankish kid who loved pillow fights to a civil
rights legend. He saw King preach his first and last sermons at the
church; saw King's mother, Alberta, die after being shot by a
deranged gunman during a Sunday morning service.
</P>
<P>
   And English will be there this morning when Ebenezer holds one
last brief service at its brick building on Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1922, when they built this church, my daddy was a deacon,''
English said. ``His name is on the cornerstone. I just look at all
of those names over the years and I look at the church across the
street and you know what I think? My daddy built this up. And his
son is now around to see the other church. Ain't that something?''
</P>
<P>
   People can't help but talk about history when Ebenezer's name is
mentioned. The church was ground zero for the civil rights movement
during much of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   And today it has become hallowed ground, a tourist site that
draws 400,000 visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer is trying to carve out a new identity as it moves into
the New Horizon Sanctuary, an $8 million, 1,800 seat building
directly across Auburn Avenue from the old church.
</P>
<P>
   But church officials have discovered that many people now see
Ebenezer more as a museum than an active church.
</P>
<P>
   ``When some youths in the neighborhood found out that I go to
Ebenezer, they asked me, 'Don't you have to pay to get into the
church?' said Brenda Davenport, 40, director of Ebenezer's
children's chapel. ``They thought it was a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to battle such a notion, church officials have decided
not to sing ``We Shall Overcome'' at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to see the place where Dr. King preached, but they
don't stay if we just talk about `We Shall Overcome,' '' said the
Rev. Joe Roberts, Ebenezer's senior pastor. ``They got to know what
are you doing for me now and the problems I face.''
</P>
<P>
   So Roberts focuses on the present. He rattles off a series of
church-sponsored programs, little known to the public. They include
feeding the homeless every Sunday, operating a day care center and
planning to build a $3 million community center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these outreach efforts, Ebenezer's future may be stifled
by the very community it serves.
</P>
<P>
   When it was built in 1922, the church was located in an area of
Atlanta known as ``Sweet Auburn,'' a jumping collection of
restaurants, shops and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of black Atlantans find the suburbs
sweeter. They attend mega-churches, many offering sermons on the
``prosperity gospel'' _ a belief that wealth is a sign of God's
favor _ instead of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the success of such churches, Roberts said he won't
change his message or the location of Ebenezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus didn't say, `Pick up your BMW and follow me,' '' Roberts
said. ``I see no obligation to take care of bourgeois Negroes. . .
. The people who need help are those who are sick, not those who
are well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer's location is now a strength, Roberts said. He points
to the explosive growth in downtown business development and loft
apartments going up near Auburn Avenue in Cabbagetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to come back into the city,'' he said.
``There's going to be opportunity for a very diverse mix of
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such opportunities for diversity when Ebenezer was
founded in 1886. Atlanta was segregated, but church leaders fought
against racism.
</P>
<P>
   Its second pastor, the Rev. A.D. Williams, was president of the
Atlanta branch of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. took over Ebenezer in 1931,
he took the church's activism to another level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, ``Daddy King'' led a march on City Hall to protest the
lack of black voters, an unheard of tactic at the time, said the
Rev. Herman ``Skip'' Mason, an Atlanta-based historian and author.
</P>
<P>
   Being pastor at Ebenezer was one of the most powerful positions
in the black community. ``Before you had black elected officials,
the minister was the congressman, the state senator and the
unofficial mayor,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy King married the Rev. Williams' daughter, Alberta. They
had three children, A.D., Christine and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy King has often been portrayed as an affectionate
patriarch, but Ebenezer members said he was a fiery man who fought
constantly against the petty humiliations of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fireball,'' said Auretha English, 81, Jethro's wife
and a longtime member of Ebenezer. ``He did not play.'' ``Mama
King'' was her husband's exact opposite. ``She was calm and
sweet,'' English said. ``She believed in everybody knowing
everybody. If somebody joined the church, Mama King would introduce
the new member to somebody and the next thing you know, that person
would be in some kind of organization.''
</P>
<P>
   King's son, Martin, returned home in 1960 to become co-pastor at
Ebenezer. Although already internationally known, Martin's
philosophy of nonviolence was alien to Daddy King.
</P>
<P>
   Jethro English recalls Daddy King telling his son what he would
do to the next racist who sent them a threatening note. But Martin
chided his father. He launched into an impassioned explanation of
why ministers should preach love to those who hated them, English
recalled. Daddy King looked at him in silence for a moment after
Martin walked away. A tear rolled down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff,'' Daddy King said, ``that man got more Christianity than
I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer members said they deeply respected Martin Luther King
Jr., but were not awed by his celebrity. He wouldn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1968, King visited Brenda Davenport's home after her
father died. ``You just felt so calm around him,'' she said. ``He
wasn't standoffish at all. We didn't know him as this famous
person. We knew him as a nice man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, King was assassinated in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy played out over the next week at Ebenezer, when
thousands of mourners filled the church to remember the slain civil
rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy revisited the church years later, in 1974, when a man
shot Alberta King while she played ``The Lord's Prayer'' during
Sunday morning worship. A church deacon also was slain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking over this morning!'' the killer yelled, recalls
Auretha English, who was in the choir loft at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Daddy King was mystified by the series of family
tragedies, Jethro English said. In the span of six years, he had
lost his wife and two sons _ Martin had been assassinated and A.D.
had drowned. But Daddy King never lost his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would have been the one,'' he told English. ``The
Lord didn't see it that way. You don't question God.''
</P>
<P>
   And English has never lost his faith in Ebenezer. For him the
church isn't a musuem, but a divine mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord wants us to stay right here,'' English said. ``And
the Lord's going to bless us, too. Sure we had some tragedies. And
we're going to have some more, too. But we're going to stay right
here.''

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: New drugs `godsend' for arthritis sufferers
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two days after trying Enbrel injections for her
rheumatoid arthritis, Melody Ray felt so good she wanted to tell
all her friends. But she didn't, fearing the newfound relief might
just be a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   It's not. At six weeks and counting, she's still feeling great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it worked so fast,'' said Ray, a 51-year-old
Fayetteville homemaker who has tried several remedies the past 17
years. ``The swelling in my joints is much less, and I can actually
make a fist and feel my fingers. I know I still have the disease,
but it's so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray is among the thousands of arthritis patients nationwide
being prescribed Enbrel and two other new medicines for their
condition that control pain and swelling with fewer side effects,
such as stomach and kidney distress.
</P>
<P>
   The development of these drugs, Enbrel, Arava and Celebrex, is
considered as significant as the discovery of cortisone in the late
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients say it's a godsend,'' said Dr. W. Hayes Wilson,
Piedmont Hospital chief of rheumatology. ``It's the first medicines
that they could take in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel and Arava are aimed specifically at rheumatoid arthritis,
which differs from the more common osteoarthritis, the result of
wear and tear on joints that occurs as people age. Rheumatoid
arthritis can strike early in adolescence, turning into a
debilitating condition of fatigue, painful swollen joints and
difficulty with the simplest of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis remains elusive,
experts theorize it occurs when the body's immune system attacks
its own joints and other structures. The result is severe
inflammation, usually of the hands, knees, elbows and ankles. About
2 million Americans suffer RA; 60 percent of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   But some arthritis sufferers are finding they cannot afford some
of the drugs they've waited so long to try. For example, one shot
of Enbrel costs $125. At twice weekly doses, that's $13,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ray says her health insurance company agreed to pay for the
prescription, which arrives by mail. But Ben Starr of Columbia,
Mo., says the ``exorbitant'' Enbrel is out of reach to thousands of
retired middle-class people who are not covered by private
insurance, and whose Medicare benefits don't pay for prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two weeks I enjoyed great relief, but cut back to
one shot per week with less satisfactory results because of the
cost,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex, the third drug, relieves pain without causing
gastrointestinal turmoil. People needing daily nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis or other chronic pain can
suffer stomach ulcers and internal bleeding from these drugs. It
has been a major flaw of such drugs, estimated to cause 107,000
hospitalizations yearly, and resulting in 16,500 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Using advanced molecular technology, scientists figured out how
to make a drug that manipulates two major enzymes, called Cox-1 and
Cox-2. Celebrex inhibits only Cox-2, which causes pain and
inflammation, but it does not affect Cox-1, which regulates normal
cell functions in the stomach and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by the Crucible Group, an Atlanta-based drug research
company, Celebrex was tested in clinical trials giving two groups
of patients a week's worth of Celebrex or naproxen, a commonly
prescribed anti-inflammatory drug. Neither patients nor scientists
in the study knew who was getting which drug. Their GI tracts were
checked before and after taking the drugs for changes in their
stomach linings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients on naproxen had the erosions in their stomach, an
early sign of trouble,'' said Dr. Steve Gordon, director of the
Crucible Group, which is involved in numerous studies for
pharmaceutical companies. ``Those who had taken Celebrex, they had
none of these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug also showed similar results when compared to
prescription-strength ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrex is revolutionary for anyone you treat with
anti-inflammatories,'' Gordon said. ``The biggest bugaboo with the
past drugs is putting these people at risk for ulcers.''

 &HT;    My nandina an invader? Say it ain't so!
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lately, a bit of disconcerting bamboo news has been
riding down the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   First, I heard from Julia Gaskin, who was moved to e-mail me
after reading about my plantings in McCaysville. Declaring her love
for the highlands, the ``transplanted mountain girl'' (born in
Asheville, N.C., lives in Madison County, Ga.) gently urged me to
undo my bamboo, noting, ``We have enough Oriental invaders _ kudzu,
Chinese privet, Japanese honeysuckle'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskin's message said that bamboo ``may look beautiful while you
are around to keep it in bounds, but what happens when you're
not?''
</P>
<P>
   That got my attention, especially the part about not being
around.
</P>
<P>
   I read on as she suggested an alternative to my beloved reeds.
At least I still refuse to even consider so-called dwarf bamboo.
But my canes include black bamboo, golden, gray. Her suggestion:
giant switch cane, a native woody grass, also called Southern cane
and botanically known as Arundinaria gigantea. She made it sound
like the right replacement for the reeds I love to hear and see
rustling in the breeze, noting that ``it makes a wonderful songbird
habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that Gaskin makes a good case for this native, I
promised to look into switch cane, its prospect of survival (and
invasion) on the ridge. I just hope I get around to doing that
before the bamboo rampages.
</P>
<P>
   Still dealing with Gaskin's eloquent assault, I opened another
e-mail alerting me to reports that nandina (also called heavenly
bamboo), another staple of my garden, has been put on a list of
``alien invaders'' along with the usual suspects: kudzu, water
hyacinth, privet.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Wildlife Federation asserted on its Web site that
such species ``disrupt natural ecosystems by out-competing native
species, drying up wetlands and strangling native trees.'' These
``invasive exotics should not be used at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any selfish gardener, I read this and thought it was OK for
some plants to be on that list. English ivy, sure. But nandina? My
nandina? It always comes down to whose plant is being trashed,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   E-correspondence tells me that in Florida, nandina is an
officially declared pest. Hillary Cherry, a botanist at the
University of Florida in Gainesville, e-mailed me saying that
nandina is ``shading out our natives,'' including rare ones such as
red columbine.

<P>
   She says that in some Florida counties nandina ``has escaped
into the wild and is actively invading and reproducing by sexual
and vegetative means (rhizomes). I am just at the beginning stages
of a study designed to determine nandina's invasive potential. . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such science, I have only emotion. I love
nandina, just as I love those tall, rustling bamboo canes. Nandina
is one of the perfect shrubs, along with pieris. It's evergreen. It
flowers. It berries. Its mesmerizing fall colors _ wines and roses
and golds _ make fashion designers watery-mouthed with envy at
nature's creative powers.
</P>
<P>
   Nandina's latest troubles echo longstanding disparagement; even
some of my so-called friends call my many plants ``trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the threat, I promise to keep my nandina in check. As
long as I'm around. Same for the bamboo. And, with all the bad news
I'm seeing online, I'll have to cut back my Internet trips, too.

 &HT;    Duluth author offers blunt advice for wedded bliss
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wellington Boone's advice to men who struggle with
marriage is simple: Your wife is not your momma.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the title of Boone's latest book, ``Your Wife Is
Not Your Momma'' (Doubleday, $19.95, 228 pages). It's a book that
offers blunt advice about relationships and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt is Boone's style. The 50-year-old Duluth (Ga.) resident
has appeared on ``The 700 Club'' and spoken at Promise Keepers
rallies. And there are passages in this book that sound like he's
trying to fire up and inspire a stadium full of Christian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You old lazy thing, get up off your behind and do some things
around the house!'' he writes, explaining the importance of men
serving their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Boone also demonstrates an earthiness and wit in this book
that's missing from many how-to Christian tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katheryn loved me from the very first,'' he writes of his
first meeting, on a basketball court, with the woman he would later
marry. ``She especially liked my big legs. It had to be God.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the book's plain-spoken style, it's full of thoughtful
advice. Boone tells men how to make the transition from being
single to married, how to deal with in-laws, and how a good
marriage can make a man successful in other areas of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title comes from Boone's belief that most men marry
to find ``replacement'' mothers. But he writes such marriages
invariably run into problems, that Christian marriages have to do
with men serving their wives, like Jesus served the church.
</P>
<P>
   Boone reveals it took him 10 years to understand this ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought buying a new ring and buying a gold bracelet would
make her happy,'' he said. ``It was much simpler than that. It's
hanging up her clothes and turning the bed back at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who's been married for 25 years and has three children,
said following his own advice has kept his relationship strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wives see you loving them unconditionally,'' he said,
``they want to do anything to make you happy.''
</P>

 &HT;    Century-old materials and classic design put new home in sync
with Atlanta neighborhood
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLNATA _ Jeff Jones and Michael Boykin could only smile each
time a passer-by stopped to tell them what a great job they were
doing restoring their Atlanta house.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would come by during construction and say they
couldn't remember how it looked before we renovated it,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the house wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Boykin built the Ninth Street bungalow two years ago
from scratch, designing it as it might have looked in the early
1900s, when many homes the neighborhood south of Piedmont Park were
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Their success story is all in the details that Jones, an
interior designer, incorporated, from 200-year-old wide-plank
floors and old-frame windows to rustic kitchen cabinet hardware and
even a heating return vent from the period. A former Atlanta
antiques dealer, Jones might have missed his calling as a Hollywood
set designer: His attention to authenticity extended even to sound.
Instead of using screws to install floorboards, he used nails so
that they actually creak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really fun to trick people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that along the way, Jones, a champion of intown
neighborhood revitalization, decided to launch a career restoring
homes and designing new ones to look old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we can do a lot to save these old structures, or
at least create the appearance of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His own house offers all the conveniences of a new home. ``The
nice thing about it is it contains walls packed with insulation,
modern heating and air systems, good lighting _ everything new
construction offers,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   It just looks old.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an architect by training who for years designed interiors
mostly for large commercial projects, and Boykin, who works in
medical equipment sales, had been living in an industrial loft near
the Carter Center when they decided to buy an old house. ``But we
didn't want to pay for someone else's renovations,'' Jones said, so
they decided to build.
</P>
<P>
   They first studied the architecture of old in-town neighborhoods
before settling on a design that borrows from several styles
popular throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta duplex sparked a concept for achieving both old and
new. ``I took that design and blew it up and out by several feet,
then removed the center wall to create a shotgun-style house,''
Jones said, explaining the design concept.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the ceilings to 10 feet and expanding the width by 4
feet provided the extra space they sought while capturing a look of
a home common throughout in-town neighborhoods at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge in building was finding affordable land in town.
After an extensive search, they chose a lot, where a burned house
had been torn down, and quickly secured the necessary building
permits in between city moratoriums on new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The rear slope of the narrow hillside lot allowed them to build
a basement level large enough for someday increasing the number of
bedrooms from two to four, an option that increases their home's
resale value.
</P>
<P>
   Jones set the house back from the street to allow room for an
entry garden. From the sidewalk, a fieldstone and brick pathway
meanders behind a group of crape myrtles and past a circular
fountain to a wide front porch. There, three pairs of French doors,
when opened, create a flow ideal for parties, blending the indoors
and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the severe slope in the back yard, we had to use the
front, much like the they do in Europe or New Orleans when
entertaining,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Boykin, a gardener, planted large mature wax myrtle and
ligustrum shrubs to give the yard the look of an established
in-town garden. Weathered wooden lounge chairs, peeling with red
paint, lend a whimsical touch to the casual spot.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,680-square-foot house is as much a study in scale as it is
old and new, something Jones has long emphasized as a designer.
``People today are buying these large new houses and putting little
pieces of furniture in them,'' he said. ``The scale just gets
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' use of oversized materials and decorative objects began
with the siding _ a mixup that paid off. A third of the way into
installing the hand-split, rust-colored cedar shakes, Jones noticed
they were actually roofing shingles the supplier had delivered by
mistake. But because he liked the look of the thicker, longer
shingles, he decided to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   The house features large windows with two-over-two panes, common
in old houses, as well as wide moldings, overdoor panels and even
transoms, once popular for increasing air circulation when
air-conditioning for most was just a dream. Floors were built from
wide heart pine boards salvaged from a 200-year-old factory in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, Jones designed a pair of fireplaces flanking
the central hallway that are two-way _ one opens to the dining room
and the other, the kitchen _ with old, thick bricks.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, instead of using new cabinets, he built ones to
fit behind massive doors found in an old house in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   And in the master bedroom, a rear entrance opens onto a wide
back porch with a tin roof and partial view of Piedmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the house are antique furnishings and architectural
relics, many of which the designer ``recycled'' to create new,
large-scale pieces. An old camera tripod forms the base of a tall
floor lamp. An antiquated railroad baggage cart serves as a low
living room coffee table. And a collection of Greek olive jars with
rough, craggy finishes provide massive accent pieces. ``I'm a nut
for old pots,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pieces were collected in his travels for Jeff Jones
Antiques, the Bennett Street store he closed late last year in
order to concentrate on the design and construction of new homes
built to look old.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has completed several in Atlanta, estimates the costs
for designing and building such houses run about 30 percent more
than for standard new construction. That's because of the expense
in salvaging and reusing old materials, such as windows, doors and
moldings. Yet the resale value of an ``old'' new house is about the
same as for a restored property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who appreciate the old neighborhoods, as we do,
appreciate the look of the old houses,'' Boykin said.
</P>
<P>
   And real estate agents expect that sentiment to grow as more
people wanting to escape long suburban commutes seek in-town homes
_ but without sacrificing the amenities of new construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, people are attracted to the rough textures, the
fine woods, of old craggy things,'' Jones said, regardless of
whether the home or object is old or new.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who pass his house will vouch for that.

QUALITY FIELD FOR SANTA ANITA HANDICAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Don't be fooled by the size of the field for today's
$1 million Santa Anita Handicap. What it lacks in quantity, it more
than makes up for in quality.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for the Grade I event is a virtual Who's Who of older
California-based equine stars. All six horses are multiple graded
stakes winners, and three of the runners are coming off impressive
victories.
</P>
<P>
   There's 8-5 morning-line favorite Silver Charm, the 1997
Kentucky Derby champion who has never finished worse than second in
eight career starts at Santa Anita; 2-1 second choice Puerto
Madero, who won for fun in the Grade I Donn Handicap at Gulfstream
Park in Florida on Jan. 31 and just might be the best handicap
horse in America; and Free House, the California-bred son of
Smokester who made a mockery of last summer's Pacific Classic at
Del Mar when he won by four lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in impressive Strub Stakes winner Event of the Year; the
Ron McAnally-trained Sidon, who won three Grade I events in his
native Chile; and Dr. Fong, who ran a strong second in the Strub,
and you've got one of the most competitive Big 'Cap fields ever
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   First post today is noon, and the 1 1/4-mile Santa Anita
Handicap will go off at approximately 2:40 p.m. as the fifth race
on the card.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the best Big 'Cap I've seen in the last 15
years,'' jockey Gary Stevens said. ``You can make a case for any
one of the bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who will be aboard Silver Charm, is not alone in his
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any starter in this field, if they were running any place else
in the country, they'd be odds-on,'' said jockey Chris McCarron,
who has the mount on 7-2 third choice Free House. ``Even though
it's not a big field, it's packed with talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Puerto Madero, who finished second to 1998 Horse of the Year
Skip Away twice last year, has suddenly matured. After a
disappointing sixth-place showing in the Pacific Classic, trainer
Richard Mandella gave the 5-year-old son of Gallantsky a four-month
respite. He returned to win the Grade III Native Diver Handicap at
Hollywood Park by 2 1/2 lengths on Dec. 20, followed by a 2
3/4-legnth romp in the Donn.
</P>
<P>
   While Mandella does not want to give Puerto Madero any Eclipse
Awards based on two races, he thinks he might have something
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, we did beat Silver Charm and we're
2 for 2 in our comeback,'' he said. ``He just might be the best
(handicap) horse.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Silver Charm is back home and working well. The third-leading
career moneywinner behind Cigar and Skip Away and winner of 5 of 8
lifetime races at Santa Anita, the 5-year-old by Silver Buck
finished a disappointing third in the Donn. But Stevens prefers to
give Puerto Madero credit for a strong effort, rather than
denigrate his horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the three-eighths pole, I didn't even think we'd hit the
board,'' he said. ``I had to take him back, and he made up a lot of
ground. We just got outrun.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Free House is coming off a neck victory in last month's Grade
II San Antonio Handicap, when he was hooked virtually the entire
way by 1998 Big 'Cap champion Malek, whose connections decided to
skip this year's running in favor of the $5 million Dubai World Cup
on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of 4 of 7 lifetime starts at Santa Anita, Free House has
also been working smartly and could prove tough to collar if
allowed to canter on the lead like in the San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's really on his game, he's very, very impressive,''
McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Event of the Year, a leading contender for last year's
Kentucky Derby before an injury sidelined him for the year, flashed
his 3-year-old form while winning the Strub by 2 3/4 lengths. The
son of Seattle Slew appears to be rounding into top form and could
be the horse to give Mandella an unprecedented third consecutive
Big 'Cap victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a dream come true,'' Mandella said. ``I have a
hard time believing I've won two.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella won in 1997 with Siphon and then became only the fourth
trainer to saddle back-to-back Big 'Cap winners when Malek
prevailed in a short four-horse field last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella faces a tougher chore today, a fact that's not lost on
Silver Charm's trainer, Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the toughest horse race I've ever been
involved in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that can win this race is going to be the top handicap
horse in America,'' said Paco Gonzalez, trainer of Free House.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely he'll get an argument.

 &HT;    Rialto, Outfit make downtown Atlanta `Our Town'
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, March 7.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been 36 years since O.K. Sheffield, a retired
banker, last attended the Rialto Theatre, to see the movie ``Bye
Bye Birdie'' with Ann-Margret and Dick Van Dyke. He admired the
1961 tan brick structure built on the downtown site of the original
1916 theater, with its seemingly unsupported stairways and expanse
of glass around the lobby, ``which looked very contemporary for the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s and '80s, Sheffield said, ``The Rialto's
decline was a sad thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is pleasantly surprised, therefore, to be planning a
visit to the reborn Rialto Center for the Performing Arts. This
week, his favorite theater troupe, the Theatrical Outfit, begins
its full-season residency there with ``Our Town,'' starring Outfit
producing artistic director Tom Key as the Stage Manager. Sheffield
will be there _ along with the restored stairways and glassed-in
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so excited to see downtown come alive again,
especially at night,'' says the 70-year-old Atlanta resident.
</P>
<P>
   Key agrees. He chose Thornton Wilder's 1938 Pulitzer
Prize-winning play to begin the Outfit's downtown residency _ the
first by a fully professional theater troupe in Atlanta history _
because of its message about community. Though the play is beloved
for celebrating the values of small-town America before the world
wars, Key sees it as a rallying point for urban heritage as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that, for Atlantans in 1999, downtown is `Our
Town,' '' says Key, 47. ``It's the crossroads we all share.''
</P>
<P>
   Since reopening in 1996, the Rialto has been a major player
downtown, exceeding box-office projections for diverse offerings in
classical music, jazz, dance and film, mostly single nights or
short runs by touring artists, local troupes or students from
Georgia State University (which owns and operates the facility).
</P>
<P>
   Theater attractions have included one-man shows by Key, done
independently of the Outfit. During his ``C.S. Lewis Onstage''
three years ago, he was astonished to find that he needed no
microphone _ so sensitive were the acoustics _ in a house that's
larger (833 fixed seats) than the Alliance Theatre but feels more
intimate. Key began to covet the space for his 20-year-old Outfit,
then based at the smaller 14th Street Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   When he approached NationsBank with the idea of a move, vice
president Sally Daniel was skeptical. Would enough patrons go
downtown? After all, Outfit's three-week runs are far longer than
other Rialto engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Then Key revealed another surprise: More than half the patrons
who saw the sold-out ``Lewis'' run lived in the suburban 770 area
code. NationsBank, a major corporate sponsor, signed on for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Outfit and the Rialto are making a statement about
downtown,'' Daniel says. ``We're going to need Gwinnett (Ga.) and
Cobb (Ga.) folks, not just the intown audience, if downtown is
going to be an entertainment destination, and Tom is a key _ no pun
intended _ to that success.''
</P>
<P>
   Key is still a more dependable performer than producer. His two
seasons at the Outfit have been artistically mixed, with
disappointments (``The Displaced Person'') and an unqualified
triumph (``The Blood Knot''). But he has bolstered the box office
so dramatically that he is confident that he can keep pace with the
Rialto's doubled capacity for each production's run _ 40,000 seats,
as opposed to 20,000 at 14th Street _ and thus balance his recently
doubled budget of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rialto director William L. Baites says his contract with the
Outfit begins with a cut-rate base rent, followed by a share of box
office when a show becomes a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a resident theater company brings a new dimension to
the Rialto,'' Baites says. ``It focuses attention on us for a
longer time and feeds the whole surrounding community, including
bars and restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   As for loyal fans, Key is banking on those mature theatergoers
with fond memories of the Rialto.
</P>
<P>
   He said, laughing, ``I had one gentleman about 65 tell me he
always thought that after the Fox Theatre, the Rialto was the
second-best place in Atlanta for necking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Town''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Wednesday. 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 2:30 p.m.
Sundays. Through March 28. $10-$30. Theatrical Outfit at the Rialto
Center for the Performing Arts, 80 Forsyth St. N.W., 404-651-4727.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual display of frustration between close
allies, the Italian prime minister told President Clinton on Friday
that he was shocked at the acquittal of a U.S. pilot in the deaths
of 20 tourists in Italy and said he would not be satisfied until
someone was punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' the prime minister,
Massimo D'Alema, told Clinton at a news conference here as the two
stood just a few feet apart. ``With so many casualties and so many
deaths, you can hardly ever say you are satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   It was remarkable for a visiting head of state to put the
president on the defensive on his own turf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he was ``profoundly regretful'' for the deaths
and that the United States was taking steps to try to prevent such
accidents in the future, but he said he could not comment further
because of pending legal proceedings related to other charges in
the matter. D'Alema, making no attempt to conceal his frustration,
repeatedly hammered the idea that the Italians, indeed much of
Europe, were demanding accountability and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not normal for a military aircraft to fly in a valley
300 feet from the ground,'' D'Alema said. ``It is neither normal
nor acceptable that this leads to the consequences it did lead to.
We expect that at the end of the process, it is made clear who was
responsible for this accident and that these people are punished
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finally blurted out that the United States was ``not
trying to duck its responsibility,'' but the lingering impression
was that D'Alema found the president's response inadequate to the
deaths of the 20 tourists last year in the Italian Alps. They were
riding a ski lift when a Marine Corps pilot, flying lower and
faster than rules permitted, flew his jet into the ski lift's
cables, shearing them and sending the tourists plunging to their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It was a coincidence that D'Alema found himself at Clinton's
side just one day after a military tribunal in North Carolina
acquitted the pilot. The prime minister's trip had been previously
scheduled, mainly so that the two leaders, who had never met, could
get to know each other. D'Alema became prime minister in October;
the tourists were killed the previous February.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also took the opportunity to discuss the peace
talks in Kosovo and coming 50th anniversary celebration of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, scheduled for April 23 in
Washington. Clinton renewed his warning to Serbia that the alliance
was ``prepared to act'' if the Serbs refused a peace deal and
attacked Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The not-guilty verdict for the pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby,
unleashed outcries of anger and incredulity from the victims'
relatives, who live across Europe. The gondola incident overtook
the private talks between D'Alema and Clinton Friday morning,
pushing them into overtime, and it then dominated their 50-minute
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   As they posed for photographers, the two leaders did not shake
hands, and at the news conference, the two appeared grave. D'Alema
said he appreciated Clinton's apology and said the U.S. president
had shown ``great human sincerity'' and had not been arrogant, but
D'Alema still demanded punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States was ``heartbroken and horrified''
and would ``unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what
happened.'' But he said he could not risk any further comment
because it could influence other legal proceedings against Ashby on
charges of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The aircraft's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, also faces
charges. The squadron commander was relieved of command, and the
squadron's director of safety standardization was reprimanded in a
move that effectively ends his military career.
</P>
<P>
   In private, the deaths were the first order of business and were
brought up by D'Alema as he and Clinton sat together with a handful
of aides in the Oval Office. D'Alema said then and repeated at the
news conference that the Italians found the verdict
incomprehensible, but that he was not looking for a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reviewed steps that the United States has taken to try
to prevent such incidents from happening again. They include
enforcing a flight floor in Italy of 2,000 feet above ground; the
gondola cables were about 360 feet above ground. An official said
the measures also include requiring safety briefings when crews
arrive in Italy, although such briefings were already required
before the ski-lift accident. He said they were also developing a
digital data base of the terrain, although in this case the maps
showed terrain accurately but the plane hit a man-made object.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States has paid the families of the victims
$65,000 each, reimbursing Italy for $60,000 it paid to each family
and then providing $5,000 each for transportation and burial costs.
Ten of the 20 estates have brought wrongful death suits, ranging in
damages from $800,000 to several million dollars. Those suits have
been filed in Italian courts and the United States has said it
would reimburse up to 75 percent of the costs. None of the claims
has been paid, but the Italians have made settlement offers in five
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the families say the Defense Department has offered
them settlements of about $50,000 and have advised them that if
this is not sufficient, they should bring suits in the Italian
courts, as specified in the agreement that covers NATO forces. But
the lawyers also say that such suits could take up to 10 years to
resolve and that some of the victims were breadwinners, leaving
their families with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has appropriated $20 million to rebuild the ski lift.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby said Friday that the crew of the plane had written a
letter of sympathy to the victims' relatives the day after the
accident, but that a Marine Corps public affairs officer had
refused to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the crew gave the letter to the officer, Ashby
told The Associated Press, the public affairs officer returned it
to the crew saying, ``We represent the Marine Corps, not you.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot told the Associated Press that he would like to hug
the relatives ``if they would accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they would,'' he said. ``I don't know how to
put it into words.''

ALBRIGHT, VISITING INDONESIA, MEETS IMPRISONED SEPARATIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Repeating to correct slug; no other changes.)  
(DW) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met
Friday with the East Timorese separatist leader, Xanana Gusmao, who
was brought from house arrest in a downtown bungalow here to the
Indonesian foreign ministry for the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, 53, who was jailed by the Indonesians in 1992 and
released from prison to a lighter form of detention last month, is
seen by many as holding the key to a peaceful transition to
independence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit to Indonesia, the first by a senior U.S.
official since President Clinton's in 1994, was dominated by talks
over how to prevent a repeat of the civil war in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 invaded and
then annexed.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country and the fourth
most populous nation in the world, has been hit hardest by the
Asian economic crisis, with a steep drop in living standards and a
continuing economic slump expected this year. Ethnic violence has
risen sharply in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie startled the United States and regional
powers in Southeast Asia last month when he announced that he was
prepared to grant East Timor autonomy or, if that was
unsatisfactory to the population there, independence.
</P>
<P>
   Albright listened to proposals from both Habibie and Gusmao
about how the transition on East Timor, a desperately poor region
of 800,000 people on the eastern edge of Indonesia, should be
managed.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech after her meetings, Albright said the United States
favored an ``international presence'' in East Timor but was not
specific about what kind. A senior official traveling with her said
that such a presence could be from the region, the United Nations
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing to the administration is the recent arming,
apparently by the Indonesian military, of people on East Timor who
are in favor staying part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Between 7,000 and 10,000 ``pro-integration'' people have been
armed in recent weeks, according to some estimates, and
administration officials have expressed strong concern that the
violence on East Timor will rise. More than 100,000 people are
reported to have died in the fighting after Indonesia's occupation
of the territory in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary told the Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas,
that the administration believed the arms were being provided by
``elements'' in the Indonesian military, a senior administration
official said. ``We don't know if it's an authorized policy, but we
know it's going on,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference with Albright, Alatas hotly denied that
the Indonesian military was arming people on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the government had reactivated the ``people's
guard'' and was ``selectively arming them, mostly with wooden
sticks.'' He said that in some parts of the country the guard was
being issued rifles but that these rifles were being kept in
military command posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government said last month that it wanted to be
free of East Timor by next January, leaving a very short time for a
transition. One important issue that has to be dealt with is how to
assess what the people of East Timor want: autonomy or
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ruled out a U.N. referendum, and the United
States is not insisting on such a vote. Albright said ``we are open
to suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   During her talks here, Albright also expressed concern that
Indonesia's elections planned for June 7 _ the first multiparty
voting in more than 40 years _ are organized in a free and fair
manner.

FALLING FARM PRICES COULD MAKE IT EASIER TO GET MILK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --Basic milk prices have dropped by their largest
margin in history, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture
report released Friday. And that should mean lower prices in
grocery stores within the month.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government said that basic milk prices, or the price
paid to farmers, dropped by $6, or 37 percent, to $10.27 per
hundred pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes on the heels of an announcement by the California
Department of Food and Agriculture that the average farm price for
milk will soon be $1.21 per gallon, or 50 cents less than the
current price.
</P>
<P>
   The retail price  &UR; -- &LR;  what consumers pay  &UR; -- &LR;  is greatly
influenced by the farm price for milk. Shoppers are expected to see
lower prices as early as April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest month-to-month decrease we've ever had,''
said USDA manager John Rourke.
</P>
<P>
   But while the federal government's survey is especially good
news for most of the nation, it has little impact on milk prices in
California. The federal government's announcement affects only
regions that belong to its milk marketing orders system. Regions
whose milk products are a matter of interstate commerce are part of
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Since California is self-sufficient in milk production, it has
its own marketing system, Rourke said. The state's Department of
Food and Agriculture sets milk prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, milk prices for all are affected by cheese and butter
prices as traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Since fall,
butter prices have been cut in half. Cheese prices have dropped by
a third this year. In addition, there was a 3.7 percent increase in
milk production in January from a year ago  &UR; -- &LR;  higher supply at a
time when demand is seasonally low, after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Taking all of those factors into account, prices have come
tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in a time-machine, going back 20 years,'' said
Robert Wellington, the economist for Agri-Mark Dairy Cooperative in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The lower prices are expected to filter down to consumers in two
months. But it's still up to the retailer to pass on the savings to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers try to keep prices as steady as they can'' whether
farm prices rise or fall, Wellington said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the average retail price for a gallon of milk was
$3.18 in Los Angeles, $3.23 in San Diego and $3.13 in San
Francisco. In Arizona, it was $2.46 a gallon, $2.58 in Portland,
Ore., and $2.72 in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Californians pay higher prices for milk has become
a sore point for consumer groups. State agricultural officials and
dairy farmers say the price is higher because state law requires
milk to be fortified with vitamins that drive up costs. Another
state law mandates that milk can't be sold for less than it cost to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, state Sen. Jackie Speier of San Francisco, recently
introduced a bill that would allow retailers to sell milk at less
than what it costs to make. In other states, retailers sell milk as
a ``loss leader,'' hoping the discounted milk will draw in shoppers
who end up buying other groceries.

 Gymboree's Hip Kin  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Gymboree has a cool new cousin at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Zutopia, a kid's clothing store that opened this week in San
Mateo's Hillsdale Shopping Center, is the first in a new national
chain that's being rolled out by Gymboree Corp. of Burlingame.
</P>
<P>
   Zutopia targets kids ages 6 to 12 who have outgrown Gymboree,
the purveyor of brightly colored, perhaps overly adorable clothing
that grandparents favor.
</P>
<P>
   Zutopia's fashions, by contrast, come in understated colors and
comfortable styles like cargo pants and slouchy sweatshirts.
Zutopia differs from rivals like GapKids by emphasizing a fun decor
(disco balls on the ceiling and Nintendo stations in the back) and
do-dads kids can buy for their rooms, like inflatable space alien
dolls ($6) and purple lava lamps ($49).
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Craviotto, 9, of San Mateo visited the store Wednesday
wearing a Velcro bracelet that Zutopia had mailed to her home.
(Zutopia is using Gymboree's customer database to mail notices to
potential shoppers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this store best because it has more things than Gap and
it's, like, designed different, too,'' said Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come back and get that thing,'' said her 8-year-old
sister, Meggan Craviotto, pointing to a lava lamp. Meggan was
wearing a temporary tattoo of the Zutopia logo, a four-pointed
star, that she had received in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree hired a completely separate staff to develop Zutopia so
there would be no influence from the little kids' side. And there
is no mention of Gymboree in the Zutopia store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that will kill a kids' brand faster than being
associated'' with babies and toddlers, said Keith Harband, vice
president of marketing for Zutopia.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers seem to agree. ``My kids used to beg me not to make
them wear Gymboree clothes because of the colors,'' said one mom.
But she said her kids would like Zutopia.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to roll out 15 to 20 Zutopia stores this year,
including a second in the Bay Area at Valley Fair Shopping Center
in Santa Clara. Eventually, the chain could be as big as Gymboree,
which has 525 stores in the United States, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Bensinger, an analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group, questioned
the wisdom of launching a new chain when the Gymboree stores are in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The company's net income plunged 82 percent last year while
sales at stores open at least a year inched up just 1 percent.
Gymboree stock has taken a beating, with shares at $8.94 at the
close of trading yesterday, down from a 52-week high of $26.88.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt (expenses) are going to go up because of this
new concept, and there is no doubt it will hurt operating
margins,'' Bensinger said. ``This is a period when they need to
focus on the core business, so it's poorly timed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo stations and other elements of the store sound like
good ideas, but Zutopia is ``going against a formidable opponent,
GapKids, that already has captured a lot of the market,'' Bensinger
said. ``So I think it will be really difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bensinger said he's glad Zutopia is being managed separately
from the Gymboree chain, which has suffered from inventory problems
and bad fashion decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree's problems aside, Zutopia garnered praise from shoppers
interviewed there this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice selection and presentation, with comparable prices
to GapKids,'' said Karin Wolfsohn, a San Mateo resident and former
buyer for Macy's. ``The customer service was good and the quality
is great, just like Gymboree, and this gets them away from the
cutesy, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a nicer Limited II, with about the same prices,''
said Martha Bacon of Menlo Park. She said the 1970s elements like
the lava lamps will appeal to kids now, but ``who knows how long
the 1970s thing will last.''
</P>
<P>
   Zutopia executives, who come from companies including Esprit,
Banana Republic, Gap, Mossimo and Wet Seal, conducted extensive
market research while developing the new chain, Harband said.
Researchers held focus groups and visited kids at home to find out
how they spend their time and what their clothes and rooms are
like.
</P>
<P>
   The research showed that kids 6 to 12 ``want to be treated with
respect and they want their opinions to be valued,'' Harband said.
``They're looking for a level of independence from their parents,
particularly as it applies to their rooms and what they wear,''
said Harband.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ZUTOPIA0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Consequently, kids respond strongly to products that seem to be
made just for them. They also love getting personalized letters,
which is why most of Zutopia's marketing efforts center on direct
mail, Harband said.
</P>
<P>
   To differentiate itself from competitors, Zutopia is paying
close attention to small details that appeal to kids' sense of
discovery, said Harband.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a fabric tag is sewn under the zipper of each pair
of girl's shorts that reads ``Zu Girl.'' Some of the buttons are
rubber instead of plastic. Rubber hang tags on pants can be used as
key chains, which kids like to attach to their backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sheree Waterson, Zutopia's vice president of merchandising, said
Zutopia fashions are meant to be ``edgier'' than those of rivals
like GapKids. There are no polo shirts in Zutopia, for example.
``Preppy isn't part of the strategy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another in-store attraction will be an Internet kiosk and two
Nintendo stations to be installed later this month, said Harband.
Just to round out the mix, Zutopia even sells candy _ 1970s-era
varieties such as Pop Rocks and Boston Baked Beans that seem to be
as popular with parents as with kids.

FULL IOC PANEL EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO CHOOSE HOST CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee will allow all of its
members to continue choosing host cities, but from a reduced list,
its top officials predict.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the roughly 100 rank-and-file members opposed to
losing their most cherished privilege, the IOC's executive board is
expected to back down on its original proposal that would have a
15-member selection committee, only ten of them from the IOC, pick
the site of the 2006 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the selection committee would recommend two finalists
from the six candidate cities, with the full membership choosing
the victor. ``It would happen on the same day,'' said Jacques
Rogge, an IOC board member from Belgium. ``The members will find
out the finalists immediately before they vote.''
</P>
<P>
   By switching to a selection committee the IOC hoped to eliminate
the lavish lobbying culture, with its expensive trips, gifts and
improper payoffs, that led to the Salt Lake City scandal and has
shaken the Olympic movement to its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the members have objected, saying that losing
the right to vote would be an insult to their integrity. ``If the
full membership is not voting,'' said Philipp von Schoeller of
Austria, a member since 1977, ``it would mean you cannot trust any
of the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the members have been banned from visiting the six
European cities vying for the 2006 Games, the IOC's site evaluation
commission has already produced a detailed report on each one. The
cities are: Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Helsinki, Finland;
Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee would make a second examination of the
cities and the IOC members would have an opportunity to question
the finalists before voting at their June meeting in Seoul. ``I
think that will be accepted,'' said Rogge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC's special inquiry panel probably will not
finish its report recommending further expulsion of members
involved in the Salt Lake scandal until next week, chairman Richard
Pound of Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it done by the weekend it'll be a miracle,'' said
Pound, who had hoped that the six-man panel would finish its work
by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel has been struggling with a mass of evidence
involving at least 19 members beyond the nine who have already
resigned or been forced out and has been debating which offenses
are serious enough to warrant expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said that the panel will finalize its report early next
week and that the IOC board will convene, possibly by phone, before
it meets formally prior to the special full session at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland on March 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pound would not say how many more members are in jeopardy of
being expelled, but hinted that they already have been been advised
of the possibility. ``The ones who may have to think about a
defense,'' Pound said, ``are already thinking about it.''

TEXAS TECH HAS UNSUNG HEROINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ To the untrained eye, her statistical
contributions to the success of the Texas Tech women's basketball
team might seem insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   She is, after all, a distant fifth on the list of preferred
scoring options among the starters. She has fewer rebounds per
minutes played (one every 11.7 minutes) than anyone on the Red
Raiders' roster.
</P>
<P>
   But coaches and teammates are emphatic no player will be more
instrumental to the Red Raiders' success in tonight's Big 12 title
game than point guard Melinda Schmucker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her duties as floor general for the offense,
Schmucker will be assigned the task of limiting the damage done by
Stacy Frese, Iowa State's leading scorer, when the teams meet at 7
p.m. at Municipal Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas Tech (27-3), the No. 9 team in The Associated
Press poll, and No. 21 Iowa State (22-6) are considered locks to
land spots in the NCAA Tournament when bids are announced tomorrow,
Tech views a repeat title in the Big 12 tournament as pivotal to
their postseason success. By knocking off the Cyclones, Tech would
enhance its chances of earning a No. 2 seed in one of the
regionals, and two home games to begin the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they will ask Schmucker to tighten the defensive
clamps to the extent she did in the teams' regular-season meeting
on Jan. 20 in Lubbock. Then, Schmucker _ with help from backup
Katrisa O'Neal _ limited Frese to 3-of-10 shooting and forced her
into a season-high eight turnovers in a 71-47 romp by the Red
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Frese, who averages 16.8 points, managed 12 and one 3-pointer in
Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really embarrassed us, and she deserves a lot of the
credit for that,'' Frese said of Schmucker. ``She's really physical
and she does a good job of keeping her person in front of her and
limiting her path to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   To those in the Tech camp, such a tale is vintage Schmucker:
underappreciated by outsiders until it is too late. When coaches
were asked to select the All-Big 12 team, Frese and her
double-digit scoring average found a spot on the first team.
Schmucker, who averages 5.8 points and leads the league in
assist-to-turnover ratio (5.5 assists, 1.7 turnovers per game), did
not even make honorable mention.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not stop coach Marsha Sharp from calling her ``the
glue of our team.'' It does not prevent guard Rene Hanebutt from
singling out Schmucker's improvement over last season as the
biggest reason why she expects the Raiders to avoid stumbling in
the early rounds of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't ever get the recognition she deserves,'' Hanebutt
said. ``But every night, she shuts down the other team's best
perimeter player and runs our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   A preseason talk with Sharp, said Schmucker, convinced her she
needed to become a more vocal leader and defensive presence this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I needed to take charge, so I did,'' Schmucker
said. ``Last year, I was just a sophomore. I didn't know if I was
the one who was supposed to do that. This year, I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, that includes putting the defensive freeze to Stacy
Frese. How well Schmucker does her job could determine whether Tech
plays its first games of the NCAA Tournament in Lubbock or
somewhere else.

 Sega Says It's Time To Play  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hit with a barrage of publicity this week over rival Sony Corp.'s
planned new PlayStation II, Sega of America President Bernard
Stolar yesterday tried to pull the spotlight back toward his
company's upcoming Dreamcast game console.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief teleconference with analysts and reporters,
Stolar announced that computer retailers Babbages and Electronic
Boutique have already taken 11,000 preorders for the high-powered
game console even though it won't be available in the United States
until sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And Sega of America, which relocated its headquarters from
Redwood City to San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch earlier this year,
plans to launch a $100 million marketing campaign in mid-April
touting the 128-bit Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 100 percent on track for what I believe is the biggest
launch the game industry has ever seen,'' Stolar said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Stolar's announcements were new or earth-shattering,
but they show how Sega will have to scratch and claw to gain any
significant slice of the $6.3 billion U.S. videogame market against
powerhouse Sony. Dreamcast carries Sega's hopes to reclaim some of
the U.S. market after the company was forced to pull its
slow-selling Saturn game console off the shelves last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. generated the big buzz in the
video game industry this week by announcing plans for its
next-generation PlayStation. The company, which bases its U.S.
subsidiary in Foster City, plans to sell PlayStation II in Japan
later this year, and in the United States in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also announced it will form a joint venture with Toshiba
Corp. to make the microprocessor for the new console.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sony announcement got received with great fanfare, and
people were really talking it up,'' said George Jones,
editor-in-chief of Computer Gaming World magazine in San Francisco.
``The big problem Sega is going to have is Sony has so much
marketing know-how and capital.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SEGA06 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  With the original PlayStation, launched in 1994, Sony has
captured about 60 percent of the $15 billion worldwide game console
market, far ahead of number the number two Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dreamcast and the PlayStation II run on 128-bit central
processors, providing more powerful 3-D graphics and video than
available today.
</P>
<P>
   Sega released the Dreamcast in Japan on November 20. The company
said it had sold more than 700,000 by last month and is on target
to sell 1 million units March 31. The targeted release date in the
United States and the retail price will be announced late this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Stolar said yesterday that he wanted to remind game developers
and the public that the Dreamcast will be on U.S. retail shelves in
about 15,000 to 20,000 stores a full year before the PlayStation
II.
</P>
<P>
   He said the platform, which will also allow game players to go
against each other online, should have about eight to 12 game
titles available when it is launched and a total of about 30 by the
December holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Sega plans to announce the retail price and targeted release
date during a five-day game developers conference, which starts
March 15 in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The PlayStation ``on paper sounds impressive, but the fact is,
it is still on paper,'' Stolar said. ``Sega will already be in the
marketplace building our installed base and building an impressive
library of games.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst wasn't impressed with Stolar's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't tell us anything we didn't already know,'' said
Seema Williams of Forrester Research Inc. ``The 11,000 preorders is
nice, but you have to break some bigger numbers than that to be
impressing anybody anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega's one-year lead into the market also gives Sony time to
learn from any mistakes Sega may make, she said. However, Sega
needs the time to build its public identity, which now ``is next to
zero,'' she said.

TERADYNE COFOUNDER, WIFE DONATE $10 MILLION TO MIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teradyne Inc. cofounder Alexander d'Arbeloff and his wife have
donated $10 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
fund new methods of using technology in education.
</P>
<P>
   The Alex and Brit d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT
Education was announced to the university's trustees by president
Charles M. Vest at a meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment of the d'Arbeloff fund comes at just the
right moment,'' Vest said in a statement. ``Educational change is
in the wind at MIT and throughout academia . . . New technologies
and new connections to the world beyond the classroom create new
teaching opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift was the fifth largest from living individuals received
by MIT in the last decade. Ray Stata, chairman and founder of
Analog Devices Inc., donated $25 million to an MIT building program
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff has been chairman of MIT's governing corporation
since July 1997. He and his wife are alumni of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The d'Arbeloffs' gift is unusual in that most very large
donations to MIT have been dedicated to building projects or
research. The new fund will support change in basic teaching
practices at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be there is a tremendous opportunity to rethink
some of education, how people learn, in light of a lot of the new
information technology that has been developed,'' d'Arbeloff said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new technology affecting education has to do with
the Internet and related fields, though the gift does not specificy
exactly what kinds of projects will be funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an era where everyone is talking about the Internet
and how it will effect everything, e-commerce and e-education,''
d'Arbeloff said. ``There's an opportunity to add value to what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund will support proposals from faculty members, focusing
initially on undergraduate engineering and science education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the educators, I'm a businessman,'' said d'Arbeloff.
``In a university, things don't change unless they are supported by
faculty. It's just like in business, you don't get new products
unless they're supported by engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff, who graduated from MIT 50 years ago, founded
Boston-based Teradyne with a partner in 1960 to make test equipment
for semiconductors, the most basic parts of computers and other
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Teradyne became a huge success, riding economic ups and downs
over the next 39 years. The company, which earned $102 million last
year, has a stock market value of $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff retired as the long-time chief executive of Teradyne
in 1997 but remains the company's chairman. He has taught at MIT
and endowed a chair in the institute's mechanical engineering
department. He was elected to a life membership in MIT's
corporation in 1994.

CORRUPTION LAW DOESN'T APPLY IN IOC CASE, US OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent ethics commission erred when it suggested that
bribery of International Olympic Committee members could be made
punishable under a US law against corruption involving foreign
officials, Justice Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report also implied erroneously that IOC
members who take or solicit bribes might themselves be held
accountable under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal on the use of US anti-bribery laws was a
cornerstone of a report released Monday by the ethics commission,
headed by George S. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader
from Maine. The recommendation was seen as a key step toward making
the IOC, which often operates as though it were a sovereign nation
of sport, subject to rules other than its own.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee embraced the Mitchell commission's
proposal and on Wednesday asked President Clinton to take the
necessary steps to put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Justice Department's doubts about the
initiative represent a potential setback to efforts to restore
faith in Olympic organizers, who have spent the past three months
pelted by venal disclosures of up to two dozen IOC members
accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from
organizers in cities vying to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the five-member Mitchell commission asked the IOC
and the US Olympic Committee to work together to have the IOC
designated a ``public international organization'' for the purposes
of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that receive that designation are effectively the
equivalent of foreign governments under the law, which bans
attempts by US businesses and individuals to use bribes or other
illegal inducements to win favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Department officials said Friday that the IOC
could not qualify as an international public organization. The IOC
is essentially a private club that lacks official ties to the US
government and consists of members who do not formally represent
their countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The designation more properly applies to groups like the World
Bank, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the international
police agency Interpol, said the Justice Department officials, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the IOC, those organizations have formal, official
relationships with the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Mitchell commission's report incorrectly suggested
that by designating the IOC a public international organization,
IOC members who are offered or solicit bribes would be subject to
prosecution under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecution is limited to US businesses or individuals
who attempt to bribe foreign officials; those who accept or solicit
bribes _ whether IOC members or any other foreign official _ are
not subject to the law. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was
specifically written that way for diplomatic reasons, so it would
not seem the United States was trying to impose its standards on
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Mitchell commission Friday disputed the Justice
Department officials' contention that the IOC could not be named a
public international organization. He said the IOC was comparable
to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a private entity
under Swiss law that is covered under the act.
</P>
<P>
   However, the commission lawyer, Michael K. Atkinson of the
Washington law firm Winston &AMP; Strawn, acknowledged that the Justice
Department's interpretation could pose an insurmountable hurdle to
US action on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson also acknowledged that IOC members could not be
prosecuted for taking bribes under the law, even if the IOC were
designated a public international organization. He said the
commission never expressly made such a claim, but he conceded that
language in the report seemed to suggest that could happen. ``Maybe
we should have made that clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Mitchell Friday were unsuccessful. His
Washington law office said he was in New York on personal business.
</P>
<P>
   USOC President Bill Hybl said Friday that his organization's
request to Clinton was based solely on the Mitchell commission's
recommendation. ``There was not an independent investigation to
determine the viability of that option,'' Hybl said, adding that he
had confidence in the commission's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the USOC asks Clinton to issue an executive order
designating the IOC a public international organization. A White
House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the request.
</P>
<P>
   A top IOC official, meanwhile, rejected the commission's
proposal, saying the IOC would strongly object to being made
subject to US laws.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, called the
Mitchell commission's recommendation an unreasonable threat to the
IOC. ``I don't think we're going to place ourselves under the
jurisdiction of the USA,'' Pound told the Globe and Mail newspaper
of Toronto. ``We wouldn't consider that (USOC) suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe Friday, Pound was more
circumspect, saying: ``I don't know enough about the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act to have what lawyers call a fully concluded
opinion about whether IOC should come under it. But my initial
instincts lead me to be against the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act were unavailable to
prosecutors, there are other laws that could apply to Justice
Department and state of Utah investigations of alleged bribery by
Salt Lake City Olympic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors could apply federal fraud and interstate
racketeering statutes, and state investigators could use Utah's
anti-bribery statute.

FULL IOC PANEL EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO CHOOSE HOST CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee will allow all of its
members to continue choosing host cities, but from a reduced list,
its top officials predict.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the roughly 100 rank-and-file members opposed to
losing their most cherished privilege, the IOC's executive board is
expected to back down on its original proposal that would have a
15-member selection committee, only ten of them from the IOC, pick
the site of the 2006 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the selection committee would recommend two finalists
from the six candidate cities, with the full membership choosing
the victor. ``It would happen on the same day,'' said Jacques
Rogge, an IOC board member from Belgium. ``The members will find
out the finalists immediately before they vote.''
</P>
<P>
   By switching to a selection committee the IOC hoped to eliminate
the lavish lobbying culture, with its expensive trips, gifts and
improper payoffs, that led to the Salt Lake City scandal and has
shaken the Olympic movement to its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the members have objected, saying that losing
the right to vote would be an insult to their integrity. ``If the
full membership is not voting,'' said Philipp von Schoeller of
Austria, a member since 1977, ``it would mean you cannot trust any
of the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the members have been banned from visiting the six
European cities vying for the 2006 Games, the IOC's site evaluation
commission has already produced a detailed report on each one. The
cities are: Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Helsinki, Finland;
Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee would make a second examination of the
cities and the IOC members would have an opportunity to question
the finalists before voting at their June meeting in Seoul. ``I
think that will be accepted,'' said Rogge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC's special inquiry panel probably will not
finish its report recommending further expulsion of members
involved in the Salt Lake scandal until next week, chairman Richard
Pound of Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it done by the weekend it'll be a miracle,'' said
Pound, who had hoped that the six-man panel would finish its work
by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel has been struggling with a mass of evidence
involving at least 19 members beyond the nine who have already
resigned or been forced out and has been debating which offenses
are serious enough to warrant expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said that the panel will finalize its report early next
week and that the IOC board will convene, possibly by phone, before
it meets formally prior to the special full session at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland on March 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pound would not say how many more members are in jeopardy of
being expelled, but hinted that they already have been been advised
of the possibility. ``The ones who may have to think about a
defense,'' Pound said, ``are already thinking about it.''

U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION TO HOLD HEARING ON NEW YORK CITY
POLICE
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government stepped into the heated
issue of the police treatment of black and Hispanic people in New
York City on Friday when the Civil Rights Commission voted to
conduct a hearing into the city's police practices.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from leaders of minority groups in New
York in the wake of the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
street peddler, the commission voted 3-2 to investigate police
practices and police-community relations in New York and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, the commission's chairwoman, said that the
agency had not yet determined which other cities would be included
in the inquiry. Ms. Berry said she expected city officials,
including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, to be asked to testify at the May hearings, which will be
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have subpoena power, and if we need to subpoena
documents and persons, we will,'' Ms. Berry said in a telephone
interview. ``But my experience is that mayors and government
officials are usually very cooperative. I would expect that they
would be as eager as we are in exploring these issues in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, emphasized that New
York is not the only city the commission will examine and indicated
that city officials would cooperate with the commission's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has worked very cooperatively with the
U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the past, and we look forward to
continuing that relationship,'' Ms. Roche said. ``New York City has
an excellent story to tell about the New York City Police
Department. and we look forward to telling it.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was established by the Civil Rights Act of
1957, is an independent fact-finding agency of the federal
government with eight members, half appointed by the president and
half by Congress. There are currently three vacancies, and two
members are Democrats, two are independents and one is a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The commission does not file civil complaints or prosecute
individuals for crimes. Rather, it produces reports for the
president, Congress or other federal agencies on how federal, state
or local government agencies treat the civil rights of individuals
or groups. The commission's critics say it moves too slowly in
releasing its findings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the commission has investigated police
practices in Los Angeles, in the wake of the Rodney King beating in
1991, and in Chicago, where police practices were examined as part
of a broader look at racial tensions in a number of cities. Its
report on Los Angeles is due out in April, and the report on
Chicago was issued last year.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Diallo has angered and alienated many blacks and
Latinos as well as some whites in New York. Diallo, an immigrant
from the West African nation of Guinea, died in a hail of 41
bullets fired by four plainclothes officers on Feb. 5 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A number of civil rights organizations have charged that racism
on the part of the officers, who are white, led them to be too
quick to shoot a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry emphasized that her agency's examination of the New
York City Police Department would range beyond the Diallo shooting
and that the public should not expect it to result in criminal
charges being lodged against anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a fact-finding agency, not a prosecuting agency,'' she
said. ``We're not prosecuting anybody or looking at any particular
incident. We're looking at how the Police Department functions,
whether they are operating according to standard operating
procedures, what problems and complaints have been made about the
agency and whether they have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche added that the mayor has not yet been contacted by the
commission about appearing at its hearing. She noted that Giuliani
had appeared before the commission three years ago to discuss
immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said her agency had been coming under some pressure to
examine the practice of New York City's police since Abner Louima,
a Haitian immigrant, reported being physically abused by officers
in the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, Brooklyn, in August
1997.
</P>

   Federal officials _ from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation _ have been working closely
with the New York City Police Department in the investigation of
the Diallo case. And the four police officers accused in the Louima
case are facing federal civil rights charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of civil rights leaders have asserted that Diallo's
killing fit into a pattern of police abuse against minorities
across the country. Among other incidents the killing of Tyisha
Miller, 19, who was shot 12 times in the back by the police in
December as she sat in her car in Riverside, Calif., and the death
of Deron S. Grimmitt Sr., 32, who was shot by a police officer in
Pittsburgh after a police chase.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, leaders of the major civil
rights organizations, including Hugh Price of the National Urban
League, Kweisi Mfume of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Jesse Jackson of the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition and Raul Yzaguirre of the National Council of La Raza,
called on President Clinton to ``stem this national epidemic of
brutality and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., in whose district Diallo was
killed, has been pressing for the Civil Rights Commission to take
action. And on Friday he praised the agency's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a major breakthrough,'' he said. ``This sets
this issue where it should be set. This is a civil rights issue. If
it isn't, then it should be.''

CORRUPTION LAW DOESN'T APPLY IN IOC CASE, US OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent ethics commission erred when it suggested that
bribery of International Olympic Committee members could be made
punishable under a US law against corruption involving foreign
officials, Justice Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report also implied erroneously that IOC
members who take or solicit bribes might themselves be held
accountable under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal on the use of US anti-bribery laws was a
cornerstone of a report released Monday by the ethics commission,
headed by George S. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader
from Maine. The recommendation was seen as a key step toward making
the IOC, which often operates as though it were a sovereign nation
of sport, subject to rules other than its own.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee embraced the Mitchell commission's
proposal and on Wednesday asked President Clinton to take the
necessary steps to put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Justice Department's doubts about the
initiative represent a potential setback to efforts to restore
faith in Olympic organizers, who have spent the past three months
pelted by venal disclosures of up to two dozen IOC members
accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from
organizers in cities vying to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the five-member Mitchell commission asked the IOC
and the US Olympic Committee to work together to have the IOC
designated a ``public international organization'' for the purposes
of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that receive that designation are effectively the
equivalent of foreign governments under the law, which bans
attempts by US businesses and individuals to use bribes or other
illegal inducements to win favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Department officials said Friday that the IOC
could not qualify as an international public organization. The IOC
is essentially a private club that lacks official ties to the US
government and consists of members who do not formally represent
their countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The designation more properly applies to groups like the World
Bank, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the international
police agency Interpol, said the Justice Department officials, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the IOC, those organizations have formal, official
relationships with the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Mitchell commission's report incorrectly suggested
that by designating the IOC a public international organization,
IOC members who are offered or solicit bribes would be subject to
prosecution under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecution is limited to US businesses or individuals
who attempt to bribe foreign officials; those who accept or solicit
bribes _ whether IOC members or any other foreign official _ are
not subject to the law. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was
specifically written that way for diplomatic reasons, so it would
not seem the United States was trying to impose its standards on
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Mitchell commission Friday disputed the Justice
Department officials' contention that the IOC could not be named a
public international organization. He said the IOC was comparable
to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a private entity
under Swiss law that is covered under the act.
</P>
<P>
   However, the commission lawyer, Michael K. Atkinson of the
Washington law firm Winston &AMP; Strawn, acknowledged that the Justice
Department's interpretation could pose an insurmountable hurdle to
US action on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson also acknowledged that IOC members could not be
prosecuted for taking bribes under the law, even if the IOC were
designated a public international organization. He said the
commission never expressly made such a claim, but he conceded that
language in the report seemed to suggest that could happen. ``Maybe
we should have made that clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Mitchell Friday were unsuccessful. His
Washington law office said he was in New York on personal business.
</P>
<P>
   USOC President Bill Hybl said Friday that his organization's
request to Clinton was based solely on the Mitchell commission's
recommendation. ``There was not an independent investigation to
determine the viability of that option,'' Hybl said, adding that he
had confidence in the commission's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the USOC asks Clinton to issue an executive order
designating the IOC a public international organization. A White
House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the request.
</P>
<P>
   A top IOC official, meanwhile, rejected the commission's
proposal, saying the IOC would strongly object to being made
subject to US laws.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, called the
Mitchell commission's recommendation an unreasonable threat to the
IOC. ``I don't think we're going to place ourselves under the
jurisdiction of the USA,'' Pound told the Globe and Mail newspaper
of Toronto. ``We wouldn't consider that (USOC) suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe Friday, Pound was more
circumspect, saying: ``I don't know enough about the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act to have what lawyers call a fully concluded
opinion about whether IOC should come under it. But my initial
instincts lead me to be against the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act were unavailable to
prosecutors, there are other laws that could apply to Justice
Department and state of Utah investigations of alleged bribery by
Salt Lake City Olympic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors could apply federal fraud and interstate
racketeering statutes, and state investigators could use Utah's
anti-bribery statute.

NOW ABOUT THAT LIPSTICK, MONICA ...  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems Barbara Walters skipped right over one intimate, yet
salient, detail in her interview of Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday
night, a facet that thousands of viewers were wondering about.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, though, somebody who logged on to ABC's Monica chat
room Thursday morning had the presence of mind to pitch the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What,'' the Web peruser wrote, ``was that lipstick Monica was
wearing?''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, hosts of others in the chat room broached their own
pressing queries: ``What is that color called?'' ``Where can I buy
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly, ABC uncovered the truth and posted it on its Web
site. Ms. Lewinsky was wearing a lip liner pencil and an overcoat
of lipstick, said Denise Markey, a makeup artist whom Ms. Lewinsky
chose to do her face Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lipstick is called Glaze. It is ``berry-colored.''
</P>
<P>
   The lip liner is called Bare. It is ``brownish, almost yellow.''
The manufacturer is Club Monaco Cosmetics, a Toronto-based
corporation recently bought by Ralph Lauren. Glaze costs $13. Bare
is $10.
</P>
<P>
   The products are usually available at any of the four Club
Monaco stores in New York. But not now. They sold out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's new understated lip look _ as opposed to the
bright-red lips of her White House intern days _ seems to have
touched something deep and elemental in many Americans. Thousands
of people from around the country seem determined to track down
their own Glaze lipsticks and Bare lip pencils. Hundreds of callers
tied up the phone lines of anybody even slightly connected to Ms.
Lewinsky's lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the public what the color was,'' said Sonya McNair, an
ABC News spokeswoman, referring to the network's Web site posting.
``We were flooded with even more calls _ `Where can we get it?'''
Many sounded amused, she said. ``But they were very serious about
the lipstick. They want to be sure they can find it at some
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The look was created by outlining the lips with the Bare pencil,
and then filling them in. The Glaze was applied to the entire lip
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the effect of soft pink with a yellow undertone,''
Ms. Markey said. ``Very interesting.''

CALLS FOR TIGHTER TREASURY CONTROLS WENT UNHEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts treasury under Joseph D. Malone
failed to implement repeated recommendations for tighter management
controls that might have prevented the alleged looting of millions
of dollars from its Unpaid Check Fund, according to the state
comptroller and a former Malone official.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for adopting the recommendations was one of
the former treasurer's top deputies, Robert E. Foley, who was
charged Wednesday with stealing $2.4 million from the fund. Malone
left office in January after eight years as treasurer .
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Martin Benison said Friday the treasury
remains one of only a ``handful'' of the state's 152 departments
and agencies that has failed to put in place an improved system for
controlling the issuance of checks and other cash management
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   According to last year's audit, the treasurer's office had yet
to complete the ``internal control plan'' required by a 1989
statute that would have put more checks and balances in place for
issuing payments, including those from the eight accounts overseen
by Foley's cash management division. The Unpaid Check Fund, which
holds unclaimed state checks, is one of those accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's office had submitted a draft of its plan to comply with
the law, according to last year's audit, but had failed to
incorporate changes set out by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the private firm
hired by the state to audit the various agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, as deputy treasurer in charge of the office's cash
management division, was identified in the 1998 audit as the
``person responsible'' in Malone's office for getting the new plan
approved. The changes, which include making more people responsible
for approving the issuance of state checks, within the system, have
yet to be approved, state officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such changes could have prevented the Foley's scam and
the alleged theft of $6.5 million from the fund by John Trischitta,
Foley's subordinate, Benison said, ``Of course, if there is
collusion involved, it is going to that much harder to detect. But
if these controls had been put in place, there would have been that
many more people overseeing things, and generally, yes, it would
have been that much more difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci and Deloitte &AMP; Touche are
conducting a regularly scheduled audit of both the treasurer's
office and the Lottery that was begun in November, before the Foley
and Trischitta scheme were uncovered. The report, due to be
completed next week, is expected to recommend that new procedures
and internal controls be put in place by the treasurer, Shannon
O'Brien, as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A former reasury official, who asked not to be identified, said
Friday Malone had been committed to improving controls within the
treasurer's office. Failure to adopt recommendations made annually
in state audits for improving cash management was Foley's, the
official said. Foley could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of past years' records of the operation of the Unpaid
Check Fund have been seized by the state attorney general's for its
criminal investigation, Benison said he doubted the audit being
done by Deloitte &AMP; Touche and DeNucci's office would criticize
Malone for failing to implement past recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   While past audits completed by Deloitte &AMP; Touche have identified
general problems in how the cash management system worked inside
Malone's office, none has ever singled out the management of the
Unpaid Check Fund for criticism. However, an accountant who worked
for Malone in 1994 said Friday she made specific recommendations to
improve the process under which claims for payment were approved
and checks were cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certain areas that needed change to place more
controls in the system,'' said Mary Zarilli Connarton whom Malone
hired as director of internal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Connarton said she made her recommendations directly to Foley in
September 1994. While she does not know if the changes were put in
place, Foley, unlike managers in other areas of the treasurer's
office she dealt with, had not institued the reforms by the time
she resigned in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   From the recent disclosures, it appears to few, if any, of the
changes recommended by Connarton were adopted in the Unpaid Check
Fund. Trischitta remained the only person responsible for approving
applications made by ``heir finders'' on behalf of individuals or
firms seeking state checks they believed were for them.
</P>
<P>
   And the only people who could approve the issuance of the checks
were Foley or, in his absence, his assistant --- and now fiancee _
Amelia Viscomi Tamburrini.

BACK FROM JAPAN, OUT OF YOU-KNOW-WHO'S DOGHOUSE, DUNCAN STARTS FOR
THE METS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Canada)   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Just because Mariano Duncan was playing in Japan
last season, it wasn't as if he had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of Nike guys said they thought I was retired,''
Duncan said. ``Maybe a lot of teams didn't know I was coming back
from Japan or that I still wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Duncan jumped at the chance to come to the Mets'
camp this spring as a nonroster player. The Mets need a
right-handed-hitting utility infielder to supplement their bench.
Duncan, who will turn 36 on March 13, thinks he fits right in. But
even if he doesn't, he is grateful that the Mets invited him to
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave me a chance to come to spring training so I can show
someone I can still play,'' Duncan said before he started at
shortstop Friday night against the Montreal Expos in the Mets'
first exhibition game of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year major league veteran who has played in three World
Series, Duncan has been in a similar situation before. When he went
to the Yankees before the 1996 season, they already had Pat Kelly
and Tony Fernandez at second base. But Kelly and Fernandez went
down with injuries. Duncan ended up leading the team in hitting
with a .340 average, by far the highest of his career, as the
Yankees went on to win the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a year later, everything started to go wrong,'' Duncan
said. ``Not because of me, but because of you know who.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-too-veiled reference was to George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, who selected Duncan for his doghouse
early in 1997. It was a place Duncan never escaped. He hit .244 in
50 games with the Yanks and was to be traded to San Diego in a
package for Greg Vaughn, but Vaughn failed his physical and the
deal was voided. Duncan was traded to Toronto, where he batted just
.228 the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he played for the Japanese version of the Yankees _
the Yomiuri Giants. Unlike many North American players, Duncan
loved the food _ and hated the businesslike brand of baseball. So
much so that he quit with a month left in the season after hitting
an anemic .232.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, when you go to Japan, people forget about
you,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   He is here hoping his two World Series rings will help refresh
someone's memory.

TERADYNE COFOUNDER, WIFE DONATE $10 MILLION TO MIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teradyne Inc. cofounder Alexander d'Arbeloff and his wife have
donated $10 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
fund new methods of using technology in education.
</P>
<P>
   The Alex and Brit d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT
Education was announced to the university's trustees by president
Charles M. Vest at a meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment of the d'Arbeloff fund comes at just the
right moment,'' Vest said in a statement. ``Educational change is
in the wind at MIT and throughout academia . . . New technologies
and new connections to the world beyond the classroom create new
teaching opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift was the fifth largest from living individuals received
by MIT in the last decade. Ray Stata, chairman and founder of
Analog Devices Inc., donated $25 million to an MIT building program
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff has been chairman of MIT's governing corporation
since July 1997. He and his wife are alumni of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The d'Arbeloffs' gift is unusual in that most very large
donations to MIT have been dedicated to building projects or
research. The new fund will support change in basic teaching
practices at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be there is a tremendous opportunity to rethink
some of education, how people learn, in light of a lot of the new
information technology that has been developed,'' d'Arbeloff said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new technology affecting education has to do with
the Internet and related fields, though the gift does not specificy
exactly what kinds of projects will be funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an era where everyone is talking about the Internet
and how it will effect everything, e-commerce and e-education,''
d'Arbeloff said. ``There's an opportunity to add value to what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund will support proposals from faculty members, focusing
initially on undergraduate engineering and science education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the educators, I'm a businessman,'' said d'Arbeloff.
``In a university, things don't change unless they are supported by
faculty. It's just like in business, you don't get new products
unless they're supported by engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff, who graduated from MIT 50 years ago, founded
Boston-based Teradyne with a partner in 1960 to make test equipment
for semiconductors, the most basic parts of computers and other
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Teradyne became a huge success, riding economic ups and downs
over the next 39 years. The company, which earned $102 million last
year, has a stock market value of $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arbeloff retired as the long-time chief executive of Teradyne
in 1997 but remains the company's chairman. He has taught at MIT
and endowed a chair in the institute's mechanical engineering
department. He was elected to a life membership in MIT's
corporation in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Kiley, who won a Tony Award for his compelling
performance as Don Quixote in the Broadway musical ``Man of La
Mancha'' and was for 40 years one of theater's most distinguished
and versatile actors, died Friday at Horton Hospital in Middletown,
N.Y. He was 76 and lived in Warwick, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a blood disorder, his wife, Patricia Ferrier
Kiley, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley was a versatile actor, the kind of performer who could be
called on to play kings and commoners and a diversity of characters
in between. As someone who worked with equal ease in both musicals
and dramas, he regarded himself as an actor who sang, not as a
singer who also acted.
</P>
<P>
   Before he did ``Man of La Mancha'' in 1965, he already had been
on Broadway singing ``Stranger in Paradise'' as the Caliph in
``Kismet.'' He had been in the drama ``Time Limit,'' had won a Tony
award for the musical ``Redhead'' (where he met his wife, who was a
dancer in the show) and also had starred in Richard Rodgers' ``No
Strings,'' among many other musicals and plays. ``Man of La
Mancha'' proved to be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said he was a character man in a leading man's
body,'' his wife said Friday. She remembered that when ``Man of La
Mancha'' came along, he said: ``Aha! Here's my chance not only to
play a doddering old knight, but I also get to play an author.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was best known for his roles in musicals, he also
acted in plays by Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur
Miller. He played the autocratic Dr. Sloper in two productions of
``The Heiress,'' on Broadway with Jane Alexander in 1976 and at the
Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn., with Jayne Atkinson in
1989. His last Broadway performance was in Miller's ``All My Sons''
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Tony Awards, he won three Emmys and two
Golden Globes for his performances in ``The Thorn Birds,'' ``A Year
in the Life'' and ``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Chicago, and after a year at Loyola University,
he left to study acting at the Barnum Dramatic School in Chicago.
He began his career as an announcer and actor on radio. After
serving in the Navy, he worked briefly in Chicago and then moved to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he was in ``The Trojan Women'' at Equity Library
Theater. The next year he was the understudy for Anthony Quinn as
Stanley Kowalski in the national tour of ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' and made his Broadway debut in 1953 in ``Misalliance.''
While continuing his Broadway career, he also often worked on
television, appearing on many major dramatic shows, including
``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, he felt a certain discouragement with his
career until ``Man of La Mancha.'' As he said, ``I had fallen into
the position of good old Kiley, the faithful leading man for the
lady stars.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Man of La Mancha'' tried out at the Goodspeed Opera
House in East Haddam, Conn., it moved to the ANTA Washington Square
Theater, where it became a surprise hit. It put Kiley firmly in the
spotlight as the idealistic Don Quixote and the knowing Cervantes,
a demanding double role that was operatic in size and depth. His
reviews were glowing, his performance triumphant, as he sang the
inspirational ``Impossible Dream'' and the other songs that became
so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   He played Don Quixote for the entire run of the show, 2,328
performances over six years. Then he toured with it and took it
back to Broadway in 1972 and again in 1977. Don Quixote became his
signature role and also his annuity. Although there were moments
when he regarded it as ``a millstone around my neck,'' he also
seemed to approach it as a continuing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the musical, Kiley extended his interest to the
author, and in 1973 played the title role in Norman Corwin's
``Cervantes,'' portraying the author with dignity and considerable
humor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 he was back on Broadway in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Absurd
Person Singular,'' and in 1981 he played Moliere in Mikhail
Bulgakov's ``Moliere in Spite of Himself'' at the Hartman Theater
Company in Stamford, Conn. His films include ``Blackboard Jungle,''
``The Phenix City Story,'' ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' ``The
Little Prince,'' ``Endless Love'' and ``Patch Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   When he became ill about five years ago, he stopped acting
onstage but continued to do narrations for documentary and
biographical television. His deep, resonant voice was always
identifiable, whether he was speaking, for example as the voice of
the tour guide in ``Jurassic Park,'' or singing ``The Impossible
Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In January he was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame but was
unable to attend the ceremony. Broadway theaters decided to dim
their lights in his honor at 8 p.m. Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by six children from his
first marriage, Kathleen and Erin, of Bridgeport, Conn., Dierdre,
of Fairfield, David, of Grosse Point, Mich., Michael Kiley and
Dorothy Caruso of Blacksburg, Va., and by 12 grandchildren and 1
great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the role of Don Quixote in 1977, he admitted
in an interview that he felt possessive about it: ``I nearly die
whenever I see anybody play the role, as though somebody is abusing
my child. A lot of very good actors have played this role, and many
of them are much smarter than I; but I think my naivete suits it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, he said that he sided with Don Quixote in
thinking that it was madness to see life as it is and not as it
ought be. He quoted the nuclear physicist Fritjof Capra as saying
that ``our everyday perceptions of reality aren't true,'' and
concluded, ``Perhaps Holy Fools like Quixote are right after all.''

`60 MINUTES' TO AIR NEW THEORY OF BABY EAPPEN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reopening the investigation and controversy over the
death of Newton baby Matthew Eappan, CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' plans to
air allegations Sunday by two California doctors that the child
could have died from strangulation and may not have been shaken to
death by British au pair Louise Woodward, as a jury found.
</P>
<P>
   The network said Friday that Sunday's segment by newsman Mike
Wallace concludes that Matthew Eappan was strangled about 48 hours
before his death on Feb. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are news to attorneys who both prosecuted and
defended Woodward in an explosive trial two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said Friday Dr. Floyd Gilles, chief of Neuropathology at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, chief of
radiology at the same hospital, will tell viewers their opinion is
based their examination of medical evidence that show injuries to
Eappen's neck. Both the prosecution and defense teams had suggested
those wounds were likely caused by efforts to intubate and
rescussitate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Eappen was rushed to the hospital February 5, 1997, after
Woodward reported to a 911 dispatcher that the baby had stopped
breathing. Initially, police said, Woodward told them she might
have been too rough with the baby during his morning bath. She
later denied those allegations. The baby boy died four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles says in a CBS news release that the conclusion of the
prosecution that the baby's head swelling occurred immediately
after his injury left only Woodward as a suspect. But in some cases
of infant strangulation, Gilles said, swelling can take as much as
48 hours to become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors would not comment Friday, saying through a
spokesman that they had agreed not to talk publicly until after
Sunday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Martha Coakley, who was interviewed for the
``60 Minutes'' piece, said the news program unfairly casts
suspicion on the baby's parents, Deborah and Sunnil Eappen, by
suggesting they should have noticed the signs of repeated abuse, or
could have even been responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Coakley called the ``60 Minutes'' effort ``irresponsible
journalism'' that surprised her, considering the good reputation
the show has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying it's a 48-hour strangulation, that's like saying Nicole
Simpson died of a heart attack,'' referring to the stabbing victim
and former wife of O.J., who was charged and eventually acquitted
in criminal court in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's trial featured reams of medical evidence and doctors
who gave drastically different accounts of how and why the baby's
head injuries occurred. But none suggested strangulation as a cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution contended the baby was shaken or tossed roughly
on a hard surface, resulting in bleeding in the brain. The defense
team doctors argued that the infant had a spontaneous eruption in
his brain that day, a result of an old injury.
</P>
<P>
   Boston defense attorney Andrew Good said Friday he had no
explanation for how the defense medical experts might have missed
the possibility that baby Eappen was strangled.
</P>
<P>
   But because the defense has always contended that Eappen's brain
injuries were suffered prior to the day he was rushed to the
hospital, Good said he welcomes the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could in the limited time we had to
investigate the case,'' Good said. ``What we have always said is
that this case bears further scientific investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Coakley, defense attorney Barry Scheck is scheduled
to appear on the CBS program, the network said. Woodward will also
appear and repeat her denials that she mishandled the infant that
day, according to the CBS release.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex County jury convicted Woodward of second-degree
murder on Halloween Day, 1997. Later, some jurors said they
believed Woodward had lied about her actions that day, but they
also said they would have preferred to convict her of manslaughter,
and punish her less severely.
</P>
<P>
   That option had been taken away from the jury in a bold gamble
by her defense attorneys who said they wanted the jury to state
clearly their client was not guilty of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel later reduced the jury's
verdict to manslaughter.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore has only one declared
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. His party
is delighting in its newfound popularity after impeachment, while
President Clinton is basking in impressive job approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, is Gore, who has never provoked as much hostility
from his foes as Clinton and who is widely regarded as the most
involved vice president in modern times, performing so feebly in
the polls?
</P>
<P>
   With only a few exceptions, survey after survey shows that in a
head-to-head matchup, Gore has less support than two Republicans
who are planning to run, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In a Time/CNN poll released Friday, Bush leads Gore among adults
nationwide by 52 percent to 41 percent. The survey also found that
60 percent thought Bush was strong and decisive, while only 39
percent said that of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Another new poll, by the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press, found that Clinton's popularity did not fully transfer.
Among voters who approve of the job Clinton is doing, just 32
percent said there was a good chance they would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to describe those numbers as positive for Gore.
Even so, he might take solace in that his potential support may not
be as fragile as the numbers suggest. For one thing, no matter how
active he has been, Gore is still the vice president, and it has
always been difficult for anyone in a president's shadow to develop
a distinct persona before people begin to focus on the presidential
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers repeatedly invoke Vice President George Bush,
who at this point in the 1988 campaign lagged far behind two
Democrats, Gary Hart and Michael Dukakis, only to roar from behind
to win the White House. A Gallup Poll conducted in January 1987
found that Bush was trailing Hart, 38 percent to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the current situation, Mark Penn, who conducts polls
for Gore, as well as for Clinton, said: ``He's not really seen
right now as a presidential candidate but as a vice president.
Historically, vice presidents start out in horse races somewhat
lower. Bush was significantly behind Hart and Dukakis.''
</P>
<P>
   William McInturff, a Republican pollster, concedes that he made
the identical argument on behalf of Bush in 1987. ``If I were a
Gore loyalist,'' McInturff said, ``I could substitute all of my
quotes _ scratch Bush and put in Gore _ because some of it is
endemic to being the vice president. People have no real sense of
who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   McInturff said he was still taken aback by the figures. ``It's
really stunning how bad off he is,'' he said. ``Anybody who's been
a well-known Republican is clocking the guy. My uncharitable view
is that Gore is a stiff and that in comparison to Clinton he has
nowhere near the skills.'' (McInturff's candidate this time, Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., still registers far behind Gore.)
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring for Bush and Ms. Dole may be misleading because
of their peculiar circumstances. On the one hand, they have very
high name recognition. On the other, people may have
extraordinarily idealized notions of their views because no one
really knows how Bush or Ms. Dole stand on most national or
international issues. Penn calls it ``a glow factor that's
untested.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was in San Francisco this week on his 53rd trip to
California as vice president, dismissed the polls as
``unreliable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An analysis this week by the Pew Research Center asserts that
Bush's weaknesses in 1987 ``may have reflected mixed views of the
administration,'' while Gore's ``position in the polls today may
have more to do with his own image problems.'' The analysis noted
that one explanation for Bush's weakness at the time was that
President Reagan, still reeling from the Iran-contra scandal, had a
much lower approval rating at this point in 1987 than Clinton does
now.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are so worried about Gore's vulnerability that at
a recent closed-door retreat with House Democrats, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the delegate to the District of Columbia, expressed her
alarm at the polls, and asked him to explain how he expected to
recover. (His explanation, that it was too early to take polls
seriously, did not reassure Ms. Norton or others in the room.)
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gore are concerned that in courting Democrats, he
risks appearing as if he is trying to be all things to all voters,
and that may hamper his ability to articulate why he should be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore needs not only to reach out and unify the party but he
also has to draw bright lines of distinction about what kind of
Democrat he is,'' said Andrei Cherny, a former Gore senior speech
writer who is editor of Blueprint, a magazine promoting centrist
Democratic policies. ``Not everyone will agree with him, but
they'll respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focus on the polls that name Gore, his advisers
point to broader predictors, like polls showing that people are
more optimistic about the country, in their forecasts of Gore's
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Penn argued that it was unrealistic to expect that Clinton's job
approval ratings would boost the vice president's electoral
prospects. ``There are a lot of Republican-leaning independents who
like the job President Clinton is doing and aren't yet ready to
vote for a Democrat for president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, defended him from the
constant comparisons with Clinton. ``To compare the president and
vice president directly is like comparing Michael Jordan to Scottie
Pippen,'' Lehane said. ``Jordan's obviously a great player. But
they're teammates on the same team. Once people have an opportunity
to see Gore addressing the challenges of the future, they'll
realize how much a part of this team he's really been.''

CORRUPTION LAW DOESN'T APPLY IN IOC CASE, US OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent ethics commission erred when it suggested that
bribery of International Olympic Committee members could be made
punishable under a US law against corruption involving foreign
officials, Justice Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report also implied erroneously that IOC
members who take or solicit bribes might themselves be held
accountable under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal on the use of US anti-bribery laws was a
cornerstone of a report released Monday by the ethics commission,
headed by George S. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader
from Maine. The recommendation was seen as a key step toward making
the IOC, which often operates as though it were a sovereign nation
of sport, subject to rules other than its own.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee embraced the Mitchell commission's
proposal and on Wednesday asked President Clinton to take the
necessary steps to put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Justice Department's doubts about the
initiative represent a potential setback to efforts to restore
faith in Olympic organizers, who have spent the past three months
pelted by venal disclosures of up to two dozen IOC members
accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from
organizers in cities vying to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the five-member Mitchell commission asked the IOC
and the US Olympic Committee to work together to have the IOC
designated a ``public international organization'' for the purposes
of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that receive that designation are effectively the
equivalent of foreign governments under the law, which bans
attempts by US businesses and individuals to use bribes or other
illegal inducements to win favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Department officials said Friday that the IOC
could not qualify as an international public organization. The IOC
is essentially a private club that lacks official ties to the US
government and consists of members who do not formally represent
their countries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The designation more properly applies to groups like the World
Bank, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the international
police agency Interpol, said the Justice Department officials, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the IOC, those organizations have formal, official
relationships with the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Mitchell commission's report incorrectly suggested
that by designating the IOC a public international organization,
IOC members who are offered or solicit bribes would be subject to
prosecution under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecution is limited to US businesses or individuals
who attempt to bribe foreign officials; those who accept or solicit
bribes _ whether IOC members or any other foreign official _ are
not subject to the law. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was
specifically written that way for diplomatic reasons, so it would
not seem the United States was trying to impose its standards on
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Mitchell commission Friday disputed the Justice
Department officials' contention that the IOC could not be named a
public international organization. He said the IOC was comparable
to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a private entity
under Swiss law that is covered under the act.
</P>
<P>
   However, the commission lawyer, Michael K. Atkinson of the
Washington law firm Winston &AMP; Strawn, acknowledged that the Justice
Department's interpretation could pose an insurmountable hurdle to
US action on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson also acknowledged that IOC members could not be
prosecuted for taking bribes under the law, even if the IOC were
designated a public international organization. He said the
commission never expressly made such a claim, but he conceded that
language in the report seemed to suggest that could happen. ``Maybe
we should have made that clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Mitchell Friday were unsuccessful. His
Washington law office said he was in New York on personal business.
</P>
<P>
   USOC President Bill Hybl said Friday that his organization's
request to Clinton was based solely on the Mitchell commission's
recommendation. ``There was not an independent investigation to
determine the viability of that option,'' Hybl said, adding that he
had confidence in the commission's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the USOC asks Clinton to issue an executive order
designating the IOC a public international organization. A White
House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the request.
</P>
<P>
   A top IOC official, meanwhile, rejected the commission's
proposal, saying the IOC would strongly object to being made
subject to US laws.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, called the
Mitchell commission's recommendation an unreasonable threat to the
IOC. ``I don't think we're going to place ourselves under the
jurisdiction of the USA,'' Pound told the Globe and Mail newspaper
of Toronto. ``We wouldn't consider that (USOC) suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe Friday, Pound was more
circumspect, saying: ``I don't know enough about the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act to have what lawyers call a fully concluded
opinion about whether IOC should come under it. But my initial
instincts lead me to be against the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act were unavailable to
prosecutors, there are other laws that could apply to Justice
Department and state of Utah investigations of alleged bribery by
Salt Lake City Olympic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors could apply federal fraud and interstate
racketeering statutes, and state investigators could use Utah's
anti-bribery statute.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Battle for control of the future of computing
is looming between the personal computer industry and consumer
electronics manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots can be found in meetings like one held here in July
1995, shortly after Nobuyuki Idei became chief executive of the
Sony Corp. Briefing Idei on the importance of the Internet, Peter
Sealey, a Sony consultant, noted that the year before, the dollar
volume of PC sales had surpassed that of television sales in the
United States for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped the meeting and challenged my data,'' Sealey
recalled. ``I think it was a shock to him that this had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Idei's education about the rapidly expanding world of
personal computing was abrupt, Sony's conversion to a digital
products strategy has been complete.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the world's pre-eminent consumer electronics maker,
Sony has now realized that its core business is being profoundly
transformed by digital electronics, in ways that pose both
opportunities and threats.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge strategic shift for a company that long relied on the
elegance of its industrial design and the prestige of its brand
name, Sony has come to recognize, its executives say, that a new
era is arriving in which clever software, above all else, will
determine whether products from televisions to telephones will
succeed or fail in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That sets the stage for a grand confrontation. On one side are
Sony and its peers in the consumer electronics business. On the
other is the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. and the Intel Corp., the twin engines of the
PC world, are eagerly looking for new markets in which to expand.
Beginning with the cable set-top box in the living room _ a box
they believe will bring the power of the Internet to tens of
millions of TV viewers who do not now use computers _they have a
vast range of Windows-based products on the drawing board,
including toys, phones, even computers for the car that will do
everything from read aloud your to help you with navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy is to re-create the powerful business model
of the personal computer industry in consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   At the center would be Windows CE, a scaled-down version of the
Windows desktop software that is now familiar mostly in palm-size
computers, where it has been slow to win converts. It would be the
foundation for tens of thousands of vibrant software applications
and an intensely competitive market of hardware makers all vying to
compete on price and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the PC itself would control an ever-expanding world of
``smart'' peripherals _ TVs, audio systems, telephones, kitchen
appliances and other electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the post-PC era; it's the PC-plus era,'' said Craig
Mundie, Microsoft's senior vice president for consumer strategy.
``The PC may be simpler to use in the future, but it will still
broker lots of home services and control other smart appliances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That vision presents a potentially grim future for Sony's $38
billion consumer electronics business. As a global standard setter,
Sony has enjoyed high margins and big market shares. But the
``PC-ization'' of consumer electronics would most likely mean a
world of increasing uniformity and low margins, like those that
computer makers have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's view of the digital future is far more decentralized. Its
product designers sniff that the PC is the obsolete ``mainframe''
of the home. Instead, they envision homes in which dozens, even
hundreds, of smart appliances are seamlessly interconnected,
perhaps without a PC involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is going to have to change their business model to
be effective in the world of consumer electronics,'' said Mario
Tokoro, the computer scientist who is president of Sony's
Information Technology Laboratories and a top adviser to Idei on
computing and networking issues.
</P>
<P>
   The system envisioned by Sony would let the consumer control a
digital videocassette recorder from the television set, or vice
versa _ or control them both from a cellular phone. In recent
demonstrations, the company has shown an integrated audio and video
system tied together by I-Link, a high-speed digital connection to
the cable box.
</P>
<P>
   It will allow people to watch movies on demand, pause a live
basketball game in mid-jump shot to go to the kitchen for a
sandwich _ then watch the rest of the game on delay _ or transmit a
home video to a friend on the other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new Playstation II, introduced last week and
scheduled to arrive in the United States next year, would connect
to the network, serving as a digital versatile disk, or DVD,
player, and perhaps even as a cable set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   The collision of these competing visions has resulted in what
one Sony executive calls a ``strategic dance.'' Publicly, Sony has
announced ambitious strategic alliances with Microsoft in the last
two years to design consumer electronics products; quietly, it has
been reshaping itself into what is likely to soon become
Microsoft's most dangerous competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is fearful and respectful and wary,'' said
Sealey, the consultant to Sony.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Sony's commitment to a digital future is that by
the end of next year, it plans to employ an equal number of
software and hardware engineers, according to Akikazu Takeuchi,
president of Sony's Platform Software Development Center, which has
recently built software laboratories in Japan, Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of Sony's new software-centric strategy are already
clear at the company's vast development and marketing center here
in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A fast-growing group of software programmers are putting the
finishing touches on a new operating system called Aperios, which
is intended to control digital TVs, cellular phones, even robot
``pets'' that Sony plans to introduce later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Aperios and Windows CE will face off for the first time later
this year, too, as cable companies decide which operating system
they will use in a new generation of set-top boxes that will bring
interactive television to millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the introduction of the new cable boxes will be the
first round in the struggle for dominance over the next generation
of computing. And for Sony, its role as a leader in consumer
electronics, an industry it virtually invented, is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley has long been that for all
its excellence in hardware design, Japan, for cultural reasons, has
habitually lagged behind in software development, which benefits
from free-spirited individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sony's computer researchers defy the stereotypes. Regular
visitors say the company's computer laboratory in Tokyo could
easily be mistaken for one in San Jose or Santa Clara, right down
to the comfortable beanbag chairs. And Tokoro, who heads the labs,
is not only a well-respected researcher but also the acknowledged
architect of the company's ambitious software strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the first Japanese labs that was an
American-style lab, with open doors and no hierarchy,'' said David
J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``The young researchers there are happy to argue with
Mario, which is unheard of in that culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrival of Aperios will put Sony's commitment to
computer software to the test. And some Sony insiders worry that
the company's bureaucracy _ its many divisions' conflicting agendas
and its stodgy ``salaryman'' pay practices _ will thwart the
software revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company has occasionally chased down technological
blind alleys, most famously in the case of the Betamax. And until
last year, when it re-entered the PC market with innovative,
ultrathin laptops, it had failed consistently in personal computers
and work stations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives say Sony has made the important leap of
recognizing that the very nature of its business has changed. ``To
Sony's credit, we now realize that our competitor is no longer
Toshiba or Panasonic, but it's Microsoft and Dell,'' said one
executive in the company's United States personal computer
business, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Sony has hard-won experience with the business model it is
counting on for success in the software world.
</P>
<P>
   The template is the company's conquest of the video-game
business. In a bruising battle with Tokyo, Olaf Olafsson, then
president of Sony's Interactive Entertainment division, persuaded
the company to look for profits in software and licensing, and to
sell the game hardware at cost.
</P>
<P>
   The fight ultimately led Olafsson to resign in 1996. But the
Sony Playstation became _ and remains _ a runaway hit in both the
United States and Japan. Sony Computer, which is largely the
Playstation business, provided 26.5 percent of Sony's operating
profits in the first half of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Olafsson, now president of the Advanta Corp., a financial
services company, said Sony had no alternative but to pursue a
similar course as it confronts the PC world head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony will never succeed as a just another clone
manufacturer,'' he said. ``It's not a manufacturing company per se,
and it won't make the cheapest PC. I would say they have to find
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   That something else could help change the way Wall Street views
the company, whose stock declined in 1998 as a result of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Japanese market has been struggling,'' noted Peter
G. Wolff of the investment bank ING Barings in New York. But, he
added, Sony has recently begun to show promise. Among Japanese
companies, ``Sony has been regarded as the most international, and
with the best brand name,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Sony executives _ like others in the consumer
electronics industry _ have come to realize that Microsoft covets
markets that are not part of the traditional personal computer
business. It already sells toys and games, and it is developing a
growing array of smart consumer electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also recognizes the risk of relying on Microsoft to set
software standards for the dawning age of digital consumer
electronics. The broad agreements between Idei and William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, to cooperate on a new
generation of information appliances have so far gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a love-and-hate relationship,'' Tokoro said. ``Each of
us has our own territory. But the computer people need consumer
electronics markets to grow, and by cooperating with us they want
to expand into our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives, of course, have a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony has been recognizing, begrudgingly, that the
microprocessor is going to find its way into the traditional lines
of business,'' said Mundie of Microsoft. ``But the PC will remain
an important launching pad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence _ a rivalry fraught with mutual needs and
fundamental differences _ is nothing new. Immediately after
arriving to head Sony's United States business in April 1997,
Howard Stringer, long a top executive at CBS, called an internal
meeting to develop a strategy for Sony's relationship with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer said last week that the company was still monitoring
the relationship closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we waltz and sometimes we stand on the opposite side
of the dance floor,'' he said. ``And just like dancing, it's best
not to talk about the bedroom while you're on the dance floor,
because who knows where you might end up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the real engagement is still ahead, each side has already
begun to marshal its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Intel have been signing up consumer electronics
makers, including Mitsubishi and Honeywell, to support a new
standard known as the Home Application Programming Interface
alliance, or Home API. These standards are intended to make the
personal computer the control center for all kinds of home
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, Philips Electronics and six other consumer electronics
makers have countered with their own standard, known as Home Audio
Visual Interoperatibility, or HAVI (pronounced HAH-vee).
</P>
<P>
   HAVI operates in tandem with the I-Link digital cable developed
by Apple Computer, a technology designed to move digital video and
audio efficiently between home entertainment components. But it
does not require a PC; instead, the microprocessing power is within
the components and appliances themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sony recently began giving demonstrations of HAVI-equipped
entertainment centers that include not only TV, cable and audio
gear but also a new kind of device that works much like a digital
VCR and performs many of the storage and retrieval functions of a
personal computer's hard disk. The first HAVI-compatible systems
may be introduced as early as this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Through the cable set-top box, with the Aperios operating
system, all this equipment can be connected to the Internet at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Sony to complete the picture by announcing its
own multimedia ``portal,'' a Web site from which music, movies and
software can be downloaded, with Sony charging a fee for each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sony and its allies announced last month that HAVI
would interconnect with Sun Microsystems' Jini software, which is
also intended to allow all sorts of computers and appliances to
work together seamlessly, independent of a Windows-driven computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first big test of Sony's vision will come later this year
when the cable TV industry rolls out a new set-top cable box built
by the General Instrument Co., with the almost comically
old-fashioned name DCT-5000. Cable system operators will be able to
decide whether to use Sony's or Microsoft's software, or that of
other companies, in the boxes they deliver to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   These operators have been promising powerful interactive cable
systems since the beginning of the 1990s; the DCT-5000 helps make
it possible, technologically. And AT&AMP;T's entry into the cable
business, through its pending acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc., provides the financial muscle and competitive impetus that
the industry may have lacked.
</P>
<P>
   As powerful as today's most advanced personal computers, the new
set-top box will serve as the brain for dozens of activities,
including Internet browsing, local and long-distance telephone
service, video games, movies on demand and many new home
applications, like easy-to-use electronic phone books or
call-screening based on Caller ID technology.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are as limitless as software designers'
imaginations. For example, the TV might replace today's ubiquitous
home audio baby monitor. With a camera in the nursery, parents
could keep tabs on a sleeping tot, using the picture-in-a-picture
feature of the family-room TV. And if the baby does something cute,
it will be possible to save a video clip and then send it over the
cable network to be viewed on the grandparents' television on the
other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry and its partners are betting that when
families want to enter cyberspace, they would rather settle down on
a sofa in front of the TV than sit at a desk staring into a
computer display.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consumer, you will care less that this is not a personal
computer,'' said David E. Robinson, senior vice president of
General Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid re-creating the PC business model, the cable
industry, led by John C. Malone, the electrical engineer turned
chairman of Tele-Communications, structured a deal in which
Microsoft, Sony, Sun and other companies all are providing software
for the set-top box. No company has a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were eager to be part of the deal, in the hope
that beyond supplying their operating systems they would be able to
sell highly profitable services _ like pay-per-play video games _
directly to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers will pick different services from cable operators,
rather than worrying about hardware and software, Robinson said.
But the kinds of applications that the new set-top boxes will make
possible are the sort at which Sony has long excelled.
</P>
<P>
   General Instrument, partly owned by both TCI and Sony, will make
some boxes with special Sony I-Link connectors. And soon, perhaps
even later this year, the cable industry plans to allow consumer
electronics companies to produce set-top boxes under their own
names.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be possible to go to a store and buy a Sony-made
set-top box, or a cable-ready Sony digital TV with the Aperios
operating system. Indeed, they may compete directly with systems
from other consumer electronics companies with built-in Microsoft
software.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it will be the consumer who decides whether the
future will be a post-PC or a PC-centric world.

`60 MINUTES' TO AIR NEW THEORY OF BABY EAPPEN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reopening the investigation and controversy over the
death of Newton baby Matthew Eappan, CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' plans to
air allegations Sunday by two California doctors that the child
could have died from strangulation and may not have been shaken to
death by British au pair Louise Woodward, as a jury found.
</P>
<P>
   The network said Friday that Sunday's segment by newsman Mike
Wallace concludes that Matthew Eappan was strangled about 48 hours
before his death on Feb. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are news to attorneys who both prosecuted and
defended Woodward in an explosive trial two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said Friday Dr. Floyd Gilles, chief of Neuropathology at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, chief of
radiology at the same hospital, will tell viewers their opinion is
based their examination of medical evidence that show injuries to
Eappen's neck. Both the prosecution and defense teams had suggested
those wounds were likely caused by efforts to intubate and
rescussitate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Eappen was rushed to the hospital February 5, 1997, after
Woodward reported to a 911 dispatcher that the baby had stopped
breathing. Initially, police said, Woodward told them she might
have been too rough with the baby during his morning bath. She
later denied those allegations. The baby boy died four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles says in a CBS news release that the conclusion of the
prosecution that the baby's head swelling occurred immediately
after his injury left only Woodward as a suspect. But in some cases
of infant strangulation, Gilles said, swelling can take as much as
48 hours to become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors would not comment Friday, saying through a
spokesman that they had agreed not to talk publicly until after
Sunday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Martha Coakley, who was interviewed for the
``60 Minutes'' piece, said the news program unfairly casts
suspicion on the baby's parents, Deborah and Sunnil Eappen, by
suggesting they should have noticed the signs of repeated abuse, or
could have even been responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Coakley called the ``60 Minutes'' effort ``irresponsible
journalism'' that surprised her, considering the good reputation
the show has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying it's a 48-hour strangulation, that's like saying Nicole
Simpson died of a heart attack,'' referring to the stabbing victim
and former wife of O.J., who was charged and eventually acquitted
in criminal court in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's trial featured reams of medical evidence and doctors
who gave drastically different accounts of how and why the baby's
head injuries occurred. But none suggested strangulation as a cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution contended the baby was shaken or tossed roughly
on a hard surface, resulting in bleeding in the brain. The defense
team doctors argued that the infant had a spontaneous eruption in
his brain that day, a result of an old injury.
</P>
<P>
   Boston defense attorney Andrew Good said Friday he had no
explanation for how the defense medical experts might have missed
the possibility that baby Eappen was strangled.
</P>
<P>
   But because the defense has always contended that Eappen's brain
injuries were suffered prior to the day he was rushed to the
hospital, Good said he welcomes the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best we could in the limited time we had to
investigate the case,'' Good said. ``What we have always said is
that this case bears further scientific investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Coakley, defense attorney Barry Scheck is scheduled
to appear on the CBS program, the network said. Woodward will also
appear and repeat her denials that she mishandled the infant that
day, according to the CBS release.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex County jury convicted Woodward of second-degree
murder on Halloween Day, 1997. Later, some jurors said they
believed Woodward had lied about her actions that day, but they
also said they would have preferred to convict her of manslaughter,
and punish her less severely.
</P>
<P>
   That option had been taken away from the jury in a bold gamble
by her defense attorneys who said they wanted the jury to state
clearly their client was not guilty of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel later reduced the jury's
verdict to manslaughter.

PATHETIC READING FROM A REGGIE LEWIS TEAMMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is from the deposition of Derrick Lewis, a former
basketball player at Northeastern University, and a teammate/friend
of the late Reggie Lewis. His deposition was taken as part of the
lawsuit brought by Reggie's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, against four
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Lewis played four years at Northeastern, never
graduated, and testifies on Page 216 that he wanted to come back to
school for a final year, but was shunned by the university. Here is
his answer when he is asked if he complained to anyone about not
being taken back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I complained to the president. I told him, you know,
after I come and bust my ass there for four years and now I wanted
to continue my education here, or there, it didn't really, it
didn't matter. They had a bill they made for me, what I had a
thousand dollar loan, student loan to cover, for on Jim Calhoun
where he made me take out a student loan. They cost me to go back
to school and get some aid. So I'm out here with a kid, a family,
and no skills, anything like, just a little bit of college. I
cannot get no _ I can't go back to school, because I owe this loan
and have no money to pay for it. And I can't get no decent job
because I don't have no kind of skills. So they left me between a
rock and a hard place. So I was pissed. I was like, you know, damn,
you can at least pay for the bill and I can get some more kind of
funding. Until you pay for the student loan, you are not going to
get no more grants through school.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the same subject: ``After, you know, somebody played
for four years and I didn't only had a year to finish, I was like
you know, I was just asking for the year which I still have now a
year, you know, could you provide a year and I can go finish and
get my degree. I could pursue to take care of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   So Derrick Lewis, who says over 100 times in his deposition that
he lied to then-Globe sportswriter Jackie MacMullan in the spring
of 1995, and writer Ron Suskind of the Wall St. Journal as well,
about using cocaine with Reggie Lewis, played four years at
Northeastern. Couple that fact with this admission on Page 194,
``Me personally, I very rarely went to class there.''
</P>
<P>
   This might give you a clue as to why Northeastern is fighting so
hard in court not to have the content of the investigation it
conducted several years ago of its basketball program of 1980-90
made the public.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has left the school and made a fortune as the basketball
coach at the University of Connecticut, one of the favorites
heading into next week's NCAA Tournament. Richard Lapchick, who
heads up the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at
Northeastern, which allegedly helps athletes get their degrees, has
relocated to Disney World in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Lewis is down and out in Baltimore, by his own
testimony. It is just pathetic to read over and over that he lied
about Reggie Lewis taking drugs. The reason he lied, he says, is
that he was drunk. He testifies he got drunk drinking ``10 rum and
Cokes and a six-pack of beer'' in MacMullan's room, while she was
tape-recording his testimony. She had her best friend from college
in the room with her at the time. Derrick Lewis said all of the
liquor and a meal came from room service at the Baltimore Marriott,
and was paid for by MacMullan.
</P>
<P>
   The actual copy of the bill shows only a room service charge of
$15.93 during MacMullan's two-day stay. There is no way anyone
could have 10 rum and Cokes, a six-pack of beer, and something to
eat, for $15.93 in a Marriott hotel. A local Marriott official told
this writer Friday that 10 rum and Cokes, a six-pack of domestic
beer, and one cheeseburger would cost $98.50. With imported instead
of domestic beer, $102.19.
</P>
<P>
   Draw your own conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The depositions in the case also shed a little more light on
former Celtic first-round draft pick Len Bias, who died of a
cocaine overdose shortly after the draft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Derrick Lewis told both MacMullan and Suskind that
years before, when he was at Northeastern and Bias was at Maryland,
they attended a Celtics training camp at Camp Millbrook in
Marshfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Derrick Lewis said then, but recants now, he, Bias,
Reggie Lewis, and a friend from Duquesne (not further identified)
went to a local McDonald's and used cocaine in the men's room.
Derrick Lewis now says it never happened. However, former
Northeastern teammate Andre LaFleur had a different story. LaFleur,
who roomed with Reggie at NU, and tested positive with Reggie in a
drug test in college, said in his deposition that Reggie told him
he was surprised to see Bias doing cocaine in the men's room at
McDonald's, but that Reggie didn't partake himself.
</P>
<P>
   So this is twice now that Bias has been fingered as a cocaine
user a year before he died.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad to think about the impact cocaine has had on Celtic
history. Indiana coach Bobby Knight said once that Bias was the
second-best college player he had ever seen, second only to Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie is going for the gold at Boston College Saturday,
when he raises more money for the charity named after his son. He
will reenact his famous ``Hail Mary'' pass to Gerald Phelan.
Flutie's fund has swelled to over $820,000 and has a goal of $1
million by June 1, when Flutie will make the first grants . . . We
lost two more great guys this week. Steve Sinko, the former head
coach at Boston University in the 1960s when the Terriers played a
big-time schedule, died Monday on Cape Cod at 89. Sinko finished
his coaching career on a strange note. His final game was supposed
to be against BC at Fenway Park in 1963, but President Kennedy was
assassinated the day before, and the game was canceled. In
Foxborough, Gerry Rodman, who was as responsible as anyone for
bringing the Patriots to that community, died after a long bout
with cancer. Gerry was probably the all-time Babe Ruth fan, which
is why the family had a cluster of red, white, and blue flowers,
sculpted in the No. 3, beside his casket. Rodman met the Babe at
age 14, and was so enamored of him that he became one of the
biggest collectors of Babe Ruth memorabilia before memorabilia was
popular . . . Yes, the Mike Buoniconti being honored by the
Gridiron Club of Boston Sunday at Lantana's in Randolph, Mass. is
the nephew of Nick, who also attended Springfield Cathedral, before
going on to fame with Notre Dame, the Patriots, the Dolphins, and
TV. Mike is one of 26 high school players being honored at the
annual ``Super 26'' football banquet.

   Whatever happened to Adam Vinatieri's offer sheet from the
Cleveland Browns. Did he talk too soon, and say too much? . . . We
hear that the Browns might shock the world and take running back
Ricky Williams of Texas as the first player in the draft instead of
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch . . . As great as he is, someone
please stop Ty Law from running back kicks. He wants to do it, like
Deion Sanders, but the concern is he doesn't become more like Jason
Sehorn. Sehorn was one of the best cornerbacks in football in 1997,
and talked the Giants into letting him run back kicks the following
season. On his first return of the exhibition season, he blew out
his knee and was sidelined for the year. Incidentally, Giants head
coach Jim Fassel will be at Lantana's to speak March 27 . . . It's
hard to believe that Billy Blanks, now the talk of the nation with
his Tae-Bo workout technique, was hardly getting by in life,
teaching karate in a small studio less than a decade ago in
Rockland, Mass. Someone has packaged the former New England karate
champion into a multimillion-dollar business. Billy's infomercials
run constantly on the weekend all across the country, and
reportedly he has sold more than $50 million worth of workout
videos.

   We are seeing the beginning of the age of the black quarterback
in pro football. Six of the highest-rated quarterbacks in this
year's NFL draft are black, and three black quarterbacks are
expected to be taken on the first round _ Donovan McNabb, Syracuse;
Daunte Culpepper, Central Florida, and Akili Smith from Oregon.
That's never happened . . . Harvard athletic director Billy Cleary,
one of the greatest hockey players ever from this area, on the
Harvard's women's hockey team, ranked No. 1 in the nation. ``Right
now I like the women's game better than the men's. Women are
playing with great skill; making great plays. I don't know what the
men (around the country) are playing. They just seem to want to hit
each other. Years ago, we couldn't get 50 people to watch a women's
game. This year we had over 2,000 here for our game against Brown,
and over 1,000 for a couple of others. The atmosphere is great. The
band comes and everyone has a great time.'' . . . Good blood lines.
Steve and Mike Zeija, who will be playing for Hopkins Academy
(Hadley) in the Western Massachusetts state high school basketball
tourney at the University of Massachusetts Saturday, are cousins of
the Billy Curley/Mickey Curley clan from Duxbury, Mass. that
dominated school basketball for years.

SONY'S BET FOR A NEW GENERATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)

<P>
   Sony's Aperios operating system, intended to control a host of
consumer devices in a post-PC era, has been under development for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Early work on the system was based in part on ideas drawn from
Smalltalk, an innovative computing system pioneered at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Windows CE, which Microsoft designed to be compatible
with older programs _ including the desktop Windows operating
system _ Aperios was designed from scratch and so has none of the
``legacy'' issues that scientists say can clutter up software.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the basic operating system can be shrunk down to a tiny
``kernel'' that runs in as little as 100 kilobytes of memory, a
tiny amount compared with the tens of millions of bytes of memory
required by a program like Windows and less than one-third the
memory requirements of a minimal Windows CE system.
</P>
<P>
   Sony figures that the smaller memory requirement will make
Aperios attractive to makers of hand-held consumer devices, like
so-called smart cellular phones and portable Web-surfing
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Aperios is a real-time operating system, meaning that it _
unlike Windows or Apple's Macintosh operating system _ can handle
high-speed streams of video from a TV cable or a home video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature that may give Aperios an edge in computing's
next generation is called a ``reflective architecture.'' That means
the software can monitor its own functions and reconfigure itself
on the fly as demands on it change _ for instance, as a user fires
up a digital VCR to record a movie being downloaded from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such flexibility is a key to Sony's notion of a world of digital
consumer electronics devices that work together without benefit of
a personal computer as the system's central brain.

PHYSICIAN MANAGEMENT COMPANY ORDERED TO KEEP MONEY IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- &UR;  &LR; The California Department of Corporations
ordered the nation's largest manager of physician practices to stop
funneling money out of the state because the agency is worried the
company may soon go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials late Friday told Birmingham, Ala.,-based
MedPartners Provider Network Inc. that any revenues it generates in
California must stay within the state after a routine government
audit determined the company was not fiscally sound.
</P>
<P>
   According to DOC spokeswoman Julie Stewart, MedPartners'
California operation, based in Long Beach, had been sending money
to the company's corporate headquarters. The cease-and-desist order
should stop that, she said, permitting MedPartners only to pay its
local physicians and other health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel they aren't demonstrating financial viability at this
point ... so whatever (money) comes into California stays in
California,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   MedPartners officials could not be reached for comment early
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the order, the DOC has sent letters to all health
plans in the state demanding evidence of contingency plans to care
for enrollees in case MedPartners goes out of business. MedPartners
physicians currently care for 1.3 &UR;  &LR; million Californians. Many plans
have already shifted patients to physicians working for other
companies, or have contracted with the same doctors through
different physician networks.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, an $8 &UR;  &LR; billion merger with PhyCor Inc. collapsed,
sending the MedPartner's shares down 45 &UR;  &LR; percent. In May, the
company laid off 10 &UR;  &LR; percent of its California work force following
months of losses. MedPartners has since said it plans to exit the
physician management business to concentrate on pharmaceutical
benefits management. &UR;

JOBS REPORT SPURS DOW TO NEW HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors, who were braced for bad news from the
February jobs report, got a pleasant surprise Friday that helped
push bond yields down sharply and stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average set a new high, rising 268.68
points, to 9,736.08 _ just 264 points from 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a jobs report reflecting surprisingly strong growth
and threatening higher interest rates, investors got a more benign
result.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for stocks, the jobs data showed that the
economy was still growing at a strong pace, which is good for those
hoping for a rebound in corporate earnings. On the plus side for
bonds, the data did not show that the economy was too strong, which
would have heighten fears of an increase in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this was the fact that bond investors had probably
become overly pessimistic about the possibility of an interest rate
increase recently. So the pop in the bond market after the 8:30
a.m. release of the employment report was big, with the price of
the 30-year bond jumping more than two points. The yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.54 percent in early
trading from 5.69 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks followed when they opened, with the Dow up 202 points, or
2 percent, in the first half hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The rally shows that investors are still willing to bet on
stocks, even if it means choosing to ignore traditional signs of
danger. These include a stock market that is markedly overvalued
for the earnings it is offering and rising interest rates that can
undermine earnings and attract money from stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you needed to do was to halt this sharp rise in interest
rates,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities. He said that the stronger-than-expected
economy this year helped a ``return of confidence in earnings that
enabled the market to be resilient in the face of rising yields.''
Since February, long-term interest rates have jumped half a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But the news is not good for all investors. The gains in the
market, as they have been for some time, have been concentrated in
the big-name, big-company stocks, from General Electric, which rose
3 3/16, to 103 11/16 Friday, to Microsoft, &UR;  &LR; which jumped 2 11/16,
to 154 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The underperformance of the rest of the market can be seen in
the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks. It is down 5.7
percent this year, while the Dow is up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 50 percent of the stocks trading on the New York
Stock Exchange are 30 percent or more below their 52-week highs,
according to Jeffrey M. Warantz, senior equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Warantz has another barometer, called the laggards indicator; it
shows that in the last 12 months 73 percent of more than 5,500
common stocks rose 1.2 percent while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks climbed 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many investors didn't come near that,'' he said,
referring to the 19 percent, ``because the market was incredibly
narrow and only a few stocks produced those gains. And if investors
are diversified, as they should be, their portfolios, chances are,
underperformed the market in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all investors, the tension in the market between rising
interest rates and the Federal Reserve, on one side, and the
outlook for corporate earnings and the stock market, on the other,
still remains. And if the economy continues to look too strong,
fears of a rate increase by the Fed will intensify, despite
Friday's bond market rally.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Tucker Anthony, said that
February's increase of 275,000 jobs certainly ``was not weak.'' She
is telling her clients that given the signs of a rebound in
manufacturing, which was signaled in recent data from purchasing
managers and January factory orders, she is thinking of raising her
economic forecast for the year one percentage point, to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe that kind of growth, which matches the
pace of the last two years, will force the Fed to raise rates to
slow the economy and ward off a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Camilli believes that interest rates will not go much
higher. She contends that the threat of another global financial
crisis and fears of disruptions because of year 2000 computer
glitches will keep the Fed from raising its interest-rate target.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she expects the first three months of this year to
be the strongest quarter of 1999, followed by a pretty sharp
slowdown in the second quarter. She said this sign of slowing ought
to keep interest rates from going much higher and predicted the
peak for long-term rates would come this month or in April.
</P>
<P>
   In late bond trading Friday, the 30-year Treasury bond had given
up some of its morning gains, with the price closing up 1 11/32, to
95, while the yield was down to 5.60 percent, from 5.69 percent on
Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that another spark for the rally was a report in
Business Week magazine that said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, was not inclined to raise interest rates
because of concern about another global financial crisis. In
addition, the jobs data showed that there was only a tiny increase
in wage pressures last month, another sign that inflation remains
in check.
</P>
<P>
   The price of futures contracts based on the Federal Funds rate,
which is the Federal Reserve's target interest rate, also rallied,
showing that investors were less worried, at least Friday, about a
rate increase later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor, computer, phone, drug and financial stocks led
the stock market higher. Intel rose 1\, to 114|; IBM jumped 7], to
178]; SBC Communications &UR;  &LR; climbed 2 7/16, to 51 13/16; Merck rose 2
5/16, to 82 3/4, and American Express &UR;  &LR; jumped 5|, to 118|.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which rallied at the end of the day, to close up 2.84
percent for its first close over 9,700. For the week, the Dow rose
4.6 percent. The S&AMP;P 500 climbed 28.83, or 2.31 percent, to
1,275.47 and is just four points from its highest level, which was
reached at the end of January. It rose 3 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which has many technology stocks,
also rallied sharply at the end of the day to finish at 2,337.11,
up 44.22, or 1.93 percent. Because of of its recent selloff, it is
still 173 points, or 7.4 percent, from its record high. For the
week, Nasdaq was up 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 3.99, or 1 percent, to 398.01, and
was up 1.5 percent for the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the U.S.
economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained
remarkably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   For bond and stock investors on Friday, the combination eased
fear of inflation, setting off a wild celebration. Traders drove
long-term interest rates down, and the Dow Jones industrial average
soared, rising 2.8 percent, or 268.68 points, to close at a record
9,736.08.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by a boom in construction and consumer spending, American
employers added 275,000 new jobs to their payrolls, the Labor
Department reported on Friday. Since last Thanksgiving, the economy
has been adding jobs at the staggering pace of 3.2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy isn't losing any steam,'' said Kenneth Goldstein,
an economist at the Conference Board, a private research
organization. ``It's going to be a very strong first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the jobs report _ which also showed that the
unemployment rate edged up an insignificant 0.1 percentage points,
to 4.4 percent, and that hourly wages barely budged, rising a cent
_ appeared to ease fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve
might feel compelled to raise interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the movie `As Good As It Gets'?'' asked Daniel Eagan,
senior portfolio manager at Black Rock, a Philadelphia investment
firm. ``We are about as close to that as we can be.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economists said the euphoria on Wall Street was
overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities,
warned that the latest evidence did not settle the question of
whether the Federal Reserve might need to act later this year to
try to cool off an overheated economy. ``The labor market may not
have gotten tighter last month,'' he said, ``but we're still
creating jobs at an unsustainable pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The bump in the unemployment rate, for example, does not
necessarily mean that workers are getting easier to find. The Labor
Department says that any change of less than 0.2 percentage points
carries little if any significance. In February, the change
reflected a sharp drop in employment as measured by the so-called
household survey. But it is not unusual for the household survey _
on which the jobless rate is based _ to give a weaker reading than
the more reliable employer survey of actual payroll changes,
according to Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, employment growth in the household survey has lagged
behind for several years. The survey asks individuals about
employment among members of their household and uses a much smaller
sample than the employer survey. It is also an extremely volatile
survey, having shown a gain of more than 700,000 jobs in January,
three times the increase in the payroll survey, but then
registering a drop of 200,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Wage pressures appeared to ease last month. Hourly wages of
rank-and-file workers, after jumping by a nickel in January, moved
up only 1 cent in February to $13.04.
</P>
<P>
   Yet outside of manufacturing _ which has cut 50,000 jobs as
industrial companies remained under relentless cost pressure _
virtually every indicator of current and future job activity was
flashing green.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly jobless claims, for instance, have been dropping
steadily, and the measure is now at a 10-year low. The Conference
Board's help-wanted index, which measures demand for workers,
jumped sharply in January. And the latest quarterly survey from
Manpower Inc., a temporary help company based in Milwaukee that
regularly polls 16,000 employers, showed that 29 percent expected
to expand their payrolls this spring while just 6 percent foresaw
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no deterioration of hiring strength,'' said Mitchell
Fromstein, Manpower's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While job growth this fast is a boon for workers, especially the
youngest, least educated and lowest paid, it also poses risks for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the recent hot pace slows soon, unemployment is expected
to fall below 4 percent within months, and the economy would be
back in territory not seen since the late 1960s, when demands for
wage increases started to burst out into inflation after a long
period of quiesence.
</P>
<P>
   True, inflation _ instead of rising as many economists had
predicted _ has declined even as unemployment has remained below 5
percent for well over a year. The question is whether it makes
sense to extrapolate that pattern into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers think the labor market is getting more
efficient. ``It looks like something might have changed,'' said
Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University, who is
stydying whether the expanding role of temporary help may be
enabling companies to attract scarce workers without pushing up the
entire wage scale.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, argue
that the United States has had some lucky breaks _ rock bottom
prices for oil and other commodities, a stronger dollar, cheaper
imports _ that are bound to disappear when the world's woes ease.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the future, the juxtaposition of strength in the
mammoth service economy, which employs most Americans, and weakness
in manufacturing has persisted since the Asian financial crisis
erupted in the summer of 1997. The size of the industrial job cuts
in February, however, was something of a surprise because there
have been a flurry of other indicators suggesting the pain was
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   Some cuts were in industries that have long been ailing: the
garment industry lost another 15,000 jobs. Others were in seemingly
healthy sectors, although the Labor Department warned that the
8,000 drop in auto employment was probably a statistical fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Factory workers were not the only ones being dismissed. With
gasoline as low as 80 cents a gallon in parts of the country,
another 10,000 or so oil workers were cut from rigs, probably to
sign on to construction crews.
</P>
<P>
   Building continued to boom despite a few signs that higher
interest rates may be damping mortgage applications. With mild
weather and strong demand for everything from housing to new shops,
72,000 workers joined construction payrolls in February, bringing
the total added since Labor Day to more than a quarter million.
</P>
<P>
   The lines at cash registers help explain why retailers are
struggling to hang on to workers they might have laid off by now in
most years. They added 123,000 workers, adjusted, like all the
figures, to take account of past seasonal variations. And business
services have been mopping up workers, adding 40,000 new jobs in
areas like computer processing and management consulting. Health
care employment, which has been stagnating for a while, jumped too,
as home care agencies added more nurses and aides.
</P>
<P>
   Even though hourly earnings barely rose, the measure can be
unreliable because its coverage is limited to rank-and-file
workers, and month to month changes are often dominated by
fluctuations in the type of people who happened to get hired that
month. Still, the rise from a year ago was just 3.6 percent, a
slowdown from the rate of last summer.

 &HT;    New team a happy dream for Martin
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mark Martin is pleased by the distance his team has
come since the beginning of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started last year with a brand new team, with the exception
of my crew chief, Jimmy Fennig, and my truck driver,'' Martin said.
``The tire changers, jack man, engine tuner and everyone else was
new and learning how to work as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin remained with Roush Racing, for whom he has driven since
1988, but moved with his reorganized team into a shop near
Charlotte, sharing space with teammate Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really worried when we finished 39th in the (1998)
Daytona 500 because I thought that would really get the team down,
but they came back strong and we finished third at Rockingham one
week later.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Martin won the inaugural Las Vegas 400 and went on
to win six more races while finishing second in the Winston Cup
points race.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was afraid to tell people I had moved my shop and
left behind a championship caliber team,'' Martin said. ``But,
after we won right away, I was proud to say this was all done by a
new team.''
</P>
<P>
   FORD RULES
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Las Vegas, Ford Tauruses took the first seven spots
and 13 of the top 14 on the 1 1/2-mile, mildly-banked oval.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, NASCAR has made several aerodynamic rule changes,
hoping to even things up. The latest rule was instituted for the
season-finale last year at Atlanta Motor Speedway, raising the rear
spoilers and lowering the front air dams for Fords, Chevrolets and
Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was pretty bad,'' said Pontiac driver Derrike Cope.
``It was kind of like auto racing's version of Custer's Last Stand.
Ford had everybody outclassed because the rules were so lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   NO TIRE CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, the exclusive tire supplier for the Winston Cup
series, says the racing radial being used in Las Vegas this week is
the same model used two weeks ago in Rockingham, N.C., and to be
used next month in Bristol, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the desert conditions in Nevada, we found that the
racetrack has aged at a slightly faster pace than some other
tracks,'' explained Tony Freund, Goodyear's lead engineer for stock
cars. ``Dealing with that, this is a slightly different tread
compound than on the Eagle we raced here last year.''

 &HT;    Labonte leads unlikely pack
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It isn't the group of drivers NASCAR officials
probably hoped would start near the front of Sunday's Las Vegas
400, but the first few rows would be even more obscure if it wasn't
for Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who finished 19th in last year's inaugural Winston Cup
race here, set a track record by covering the 1.5-mile oval of Las
Vegas Motor Speedway in 31.645 seconds, an average speed of 170.643
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, the 49th of 51 drivers to test the unfamiliar pavement
Friday, unseated veteran Michael Waltrip, who was seeking his first
pole since June 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who has only two poles and no victories in 396 Cup
races in 14 years, will start outside Labonte on Sunday after
posting a qualifying speed of 170.159 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte and Waltrip were among 22 drivers who surpassed Dale
Jarrett's qualifying record of 168.224 mph set a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's first-round qualifying determined the first 25 starting
positions for the third race on the Winston Cup circuit. Today's
second-round qualifying will set positions 26-36, with the final
seven spots going to drivers with provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it was better,'' Labonte said. ``The car
has handled so smoothly so far. That helps out. The car stuck
really good and I was able to pick up the throttle really quick. It
didn't push up or slide and I thought, `This could be good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was good enough to beat Waltrip, whose time of 31.735 seconds
withstood challenges from the next 40 drivers. But with Labonte
still left to qualify, Waltrip says he knew his 233-race drought
without a pole wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Bobby had a real good shot,'' Waltrip said. ``But
we've still got a good bunch of morale. We're still getting a good
starting position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to feel for someone that hasn't won (a pole in a
while),'' said Labonte, who won his second pole in the last six
races. ``It's been quite a while for him. But at the same time, if
he can qualify second, you know they've got that team turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip isn't the only driver starting near the front who isn't
accustomed to being there. Joe Nemecheck will start in the third
position in the No. 42 Chevrolet, his best position in 28 races.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was part-time driver Tom Hubert, who
has been the rear tire changer on Derrike Cope's pit crew. Hubert,
a 34-year-old native of Cottonwood, Calif., will start in the No. 4
spot in his fourth Winston Cup race. His other three starts have
come on road courses at Sears Point, Calif., and Watkins Glen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what to expect from (the other Cup drivers),''
Hubert said. ``They always seem to pull out a lot for qualifying.
It's pretty scary going in there. We knew we had a good chance to
get in the show, but we wanted to be better than we were.''
Two-time defending Cup champion Jeff Gordon will start 11th, while
defending Las Vegas champion Mark Martin earned the 13th spot.

 &HT;    Monica not 'used,' but the nation has been
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's get this straight: The day
President Clinton apologized to the nation but not to Monica
Lewinsky, the poor thing felt dirty and used.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, who considered herself the president's ``sexual
soulmate,'' is sorry for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, she didn't intend to cause the president
public embarrassment. She was fully prepared to lie in the Paula
Jones investigation. That would be ``like putting on a team
jersey.'' Really? To play offense, defense or both?
</P>
<P>
   I gleaned these meager details from the pre- and post-hype of
Barbara Walters' Wednesday night tour through the sewers of
Monica's mind. What I know of this excursion is secondhand. I
refused to watch. Instead, I spent the evening at the Kravis Center
listening to the liquid gold soprano of Kathleen Battle and five
accompanists who rendered every note a musical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But even had I stayed home, I would not have watched. I see no
redeeming value in further examination of this woman, who doesn't
seem to have a clue as to how action yields consequences or that
one can talk too much. I also am convinced that she's already had
far more public exposure of her private parts than is good for her
or the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at a precipitous point in public propriety and
lingered there so long that we can no longer distinguish between
analyzing the news and stirring in filth. Proof of our desperation
is evident when such a respected journalist as Ms. Walters _ under
pretense of enlightening viewers about important matters _ fawns
over an egotistical, spoiled child-woman, encouraging her to
service us with titillating details of past sexual exploits.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks prior to the broadcast, Ms. Walters was widely
acclaimed for having ``won'' ``the interview of the century,'' more
appropriately the booby prize of trash journalism. With her usual
aplomb, Ms. Walters prepared the public for the unveiling of the
full Monica by stating unequivocally that she found her to be a
``very smart, very articulate girl in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   How smart do you have to be to lift your skirt and flash your
thong? How articulate do you have to be to master the art of phone
sex? Apparently, Ms. Lewinsky developed the poise and
self-confidence that so impressed Ms. Walters over the duration of
at least three affairs, two with married men.
</P>
<P>
   Consider also the elaborate preparations made to spotlight
Monica's interview. A local group of viewers was wired to an
electronic machine to scientifically record their reactions on a
graph. Would stations pay for such an analysis on the issue of
public schools? Even ``Nightline,'' a program of the highest
journalistic integrity, was scheduled to devote its first
post-interview segment to a follow-up of the perils of Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The morning shows followed suit by inviting varied experts to
analyze Monica's performance. At no point did any network official
or respected news anchor say what desperately needed to be said,
``This craziness has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. About 70 million people watched. According to The
Washington Post, a 30-second ad spot during the Monica interview
went for $800,000 _ four times the usual rate. Given that kind of
profit incentive, we can expect more dirt-as-analysis journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And we will get it. Diane Sawyer has interviewed Charles
Manson's women so we can share their memories of the slaughter of
pregnant movie star Sharon Tate and her house guests in 1969. Thank
God Ted Bundy is dead, or he would be the subject of an interview
during the next TV sweeps period. Increasingly, only the
sensational and bizarre seems to command mass public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't need censorship. Our greatest need is to
demonstrate the sense and self-discipline required to stop buying
salacious trash as important news. Our appetite for such garbage
convinces those who show contempt for morality that they have
legitimacy in society.

REMEMBER THE NAMES! QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER HISTORIAN'S ALAMO
RESEARCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: today in lede is cq for Saturday) 
 
By BOB TUTT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 163 years ago today, on March 6, 1836, that the Alamo
fell to Mexican forces.
</P>
<P>
   And we're still arguing about who was there.
</P>
<P>
   The research in the 1920s and '30s of a
schoolteacher-turned-historian has come into question. Amelia W.
Williams, a Texas history scholar and graduate student at the
University of Texas, performed what once was regarded as the
definitive research on who fought at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Her research led to her being empowered to decide what names
should be listed on a monolith honoring those killed defending the
Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   However, controversy over her research soon flared and continues
to simmer. Numerous Texans have contended they had forebears at the
Alamo whose names Williams omitted, and some others have charged
she mistakenly listed some who weren't there.
</P>
<P>
   The number of defenders listed on the monument is 189.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Thomas Ricks Lindley, a Texas history scholar who
lives in Austin, has placed the number at about 250. That also is
the figure reported by Col. Juan N. Almonte, a much-respected
Mexican officer later captured at the Battle of San Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley makes his case in the manuscript for a book he has
titled ``Alamo Traces, the Historiography of the Siege and Storming
of the Texian Alamo.'' It's under review by the University of Texas
Press.
</P>
<P>
   In this work, he joins others in pillorying the Alamo research
of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   According to his research, about 70 Texan reinforcements
succeeded in getting through the Mexican forces besieging the Alamo
on March 4, two days before it was overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   They were members of a party of 150 men, including about 70 to
80 from James W. Fannin's forces at Goliad, a company of rangers
from Bastrop, additional men from Gonzales and 24 Tejanos (Mexican
Texans) under the Texas patriot Juan Seguin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing,'' he said, ``is that Davy Crockett went
out and met these reinforcements and brought back at least
50-something. We'll never identify all these men.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindley and others say Williams' miscount stemmed from her
mistaken belief that the list of Alamo defenders should be based
solely on the number of land grants issued to their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   That was a mistake because there was no assurance that the
survivors of all defenders applied for land grants.
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate way to compile the list of defenders, he said,
was to go to the Alamo muster rolls created before the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he said, Williams not only eliminated genuine
Alamo veterans ``for no good reason'' but also mistakenly
identified others as veterans of the historic battle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lindley said, she identified Manuel Martinez y
Marquis as dying at the Alamo. Actually he had participated in the
capture of the Alamo from Mexican forces in 1835 and received a
pension for that service in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own reservations about Williams' research,
Lindley cites other criticisms such as those of Walter Lord, author
of ``A Time to Stand,'' an account of the battle for the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer bulk of her research,'' Lord wrote, ``has
discouraged later students from checking on her and led them all
too often to take her statements at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Lord pointed to her use of an alleged letter
William B. Travis, the Alamo's commander, wrote to James Butler
Bonham, one of the Alamo's most glorified defenders, urging him to
come to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said the quotation Williams used on this actually was ``a
paraphrase of a reminiscence by Bonham's nephew, recounting the
family tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Lord said, ``Miss Williams relies on pure
trash.'' He said she used a fictional passage in a novel as the
source for falsely stating that another defender, Hiram J.
Williamson, had attended West Point. The academy has no record of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley writes that although the exact circumstances of Travis'
death have never been established, Williams capriciously decided
the story that Travis committed suicide by shooting himself in the
head was true.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley also notes criticisms levelled by Paul Hutton, a
University of New Mexico historian. He described Williams' doctoral
dissertation on the Alamo's fall as ``of stunningly poor quality.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Hutton said, the story of the Alamo has fallen to
``popularizers and propagandists'' who have ``simply repeated false
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindley joins the late Texas history scholar Harbert Davenport
in arguing that Williams' research is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her errors, Williams is not the only Texan who has been
confused about the Alamo. A recent Texas history poll sponsored by
The Dallas Morning News seems to indicate the invocation ``Remember
the Alamo'' no longer resonates with the same force.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name three of the Texan heroes at the Alamo, only
13 percent of the 403 polled could do so, even with such notables
as Davy Crockett, William B. Travis and Jim Bowie as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine percent couldn't remember any names.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, native Texans did no better than Texas transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Winders, the Alamo's staff historian, said that while he
agrees with Lindley that names should be added to the roster of
defenders, he also thinks that ``Amelia Williams, for the time in
which she was working, was doing the best she could do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``a fallacy,'' he said, that the defenders can all be
identified with the precision of a mathematical formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should burn Amelia Williams in effigy because
we found out later that she was sloppy'' in her research, Winders
observed. ``We'd all be burned at some point.'' &QL;

READY OR NOT, REID TAKES A SHOT AT TITLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the day he turned professional, David Reid has been saying
that he is ready for a world championship fight. Al Mitchell, his
trainer and manager, has been preaching patience. Finally, the time
has come for the precocious junior middleweight and his cautious
caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   After just 11 pro fights, Reid, 25, will challenge for a world
title Saturday night at the Atlantic City Boardwalk Convention
Center in New Jersey when he takes on Laurent Boudouani (38-2-1),
the World Boxing Association super welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Lou Savarese (38-2) will take on Mount
Whitaker (18-0) in a 10-round heavyweight bout. The bouts will be
broadcast on HBO as part of its ``World Championship Boxing''
series, beginning at 10:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reid (11-0), the only gold medalist for the U.S. boxing team at
the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, becomes the third member of that
squad to fight for a world title. Floyd Mayweather Jr., the World
Boxing Council junior lightweight champion, was the first and
Fernando Vargas, the International Boxing Federation junior
middleweight champion, was the second.
</P>
<P>
   The path Reid has taken is closely aligned with that of Oscar De
La Hoya in terms of fighting for a first world championship. Both
Reid and De La Hoya were the only gold medalists from their teams
(De La Hoya in the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain), and each
fighter will have fought for a world title in his 12th pro bout.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reid's road to the title shot has been tougher than De
La Hoya's. Reid's 11 opponents have a combined record of 310-45-5,
with 222 knockouts, while De La Hoya's first 11 opponents had
combined records of 198-54-18, with 93 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's fight could be tougher than any of the previous
1996 Olympians had in winning their championships, because in
fighting the 32-year-old Boudouani, Reid is taking on a champion in
his prime. So, just as it arose with Mayweather and Vargas, the
question comes up as to whether Reid is in over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did the fight six months from now, I'd feel stronger
about his chances of winning,'' said Kery Davis, HBO's director of
programming, who signed Reid to a multifight contract. ``I still
believe he has the talent to win the championship now, but the wait
would have made it easier to take. He and Al Mitchell have taken
the fight where it's 50-50 that he wins. Normally, with a young
fighter you want to have it 65-35. But we'll definitely find out
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Reid believes he is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been ready for a long time,'' Reid said. ``I've been
waiting on this chance for a long time. I think it's going to come
down to who wants the title the most. Who knows what he's thinking?
The only thing I know is I'm coming to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid is coming off an uneven performance last October against a
tough southpaw named Cowboy James Coker. Coker put Reid on the
canvas twice, opened a cut over one of Reid's eyes and proved
difficult to hit. But Reid said he learned a lot in the fight,
which he won by unanimous decision, and Mitchell learned even more
about his fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me how he would react when he got put on the
canvas,'' Mitchell said, ``how he would react when he got cut, and
he showed me he could go the distance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he was offered the championship fight against Boudouani,
Mitchell studied film of the champion, who won a silver medal for
France in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the perfect style for Dave,'' Mitchell said. ``He's not
a one-dimensional fighter. He's a comer, and he's strong. He won't
lay down. We know he's not a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Boudouani, of Sallanches, France, won his title by knocking out
Julio Vasquez in the fifth round on Aug. 21, 1996. He has
successfully defended it five times, most recently stopping Terry
Norris, the former WBC junior middleweight champion, in the ninth
round last Nov. 30. He also has two victories over Francisco
Castillejo, who recently won the WBC junior middleweight title from
Keith Mullings.
</P>
<P>
   When Boudouani looks at Reid, he does not see someone who is too
young to be contending for a world championship. He sees someone
who is trying to take his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at the number of fights he has,'' Boudouani
said. ``It's not how many fights you've had, it's what you've done
in the gym.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Life's a stage for UT Interactive ringleaders
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ The setting was
<TEXT>
Greenplace, a summer stock theater in New York's Catskill
Mountains, and director Chan Chandler found himself without a crew
to stage the musical ``All Bets Off.''
<P>
   Chandler, a University of Texas graduate, knew what to do _
recruit friends from his college days, including friend Rod
Caspers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the `Texas mafia' and 15 people sprang into action,''
he said of the summer of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way it was going to get done was with this team of
Texans.'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   So when Caspers, one of those University of Texas mafioso,
signed on to direct perhaps the biggest production of his career 13
years later _ UT Interactive _ it was no surprise he looked to
Chandler for help.
</P>
<P>
   Caspers, who is now UT's program coordinator, and Chandler, a
fellow veteran stage hand, have choreographed today's mammoth open
house at UT that will spotlight the nation's largest public
university.
</P>
<P>
   UT Interactive features more than 470 events _ including tango
lessons, a Shakespeare performance and health care seminars _
designed to showcase UT's research, campus life and course
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler and Caspers have spent a year poring over event themes,
scheduling when and where they would be held on campus and
overseeing almost a thousand student, faculty and staff volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Schindler, who works with Chandler and Caspers at UT, says
they are ideal ringleaders who embody the influence UT has not only
on them but on Texas and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell students this all the time: The friends and contacts
you make at UT are for a lifetime,'' Chandler said. ``That's the
point of UT Interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chandler, those friendships were crucial in the fiercely
competitive world of New York theater, where the network coached
one another through auditions and late-night writing sessions.
</P>
<P>
   They created a retreat, Austin-on-the-Hudson, really, just an
apartment in Weekhauken, N.J., with backyard views of the Hudson
River churning beneath the Manhattan skyline. Perfect for
expatriate Texans needing a bigger piece of sky.
</P>
<P>
   On their own, they have done some impressive work. Caspers
organized the memorial services for Barbara Jordan and James
Michener, and teaches theater at UT and liberal arts colleges in
the Midwest. Chandler, who owns an animation studio in Austin,
orchestrated the ticker-tape parade for returning Desert Storm
heroes and produces a show of Japanese music and dance at Carnegie
Hall each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whenever I need help, I always go back to UT,'' Caspers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the partnership between Chandler and Caspers began in
a dramatic fashion. Twenty years ago, theater graduate student
Caspers cast aspiring actor Chandler as a stock boy in a production
of the musical ``Working'' at UT's Winship Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really ever since then, we've worked together,'' Caspers said.
</P>
<P>
   Together they have transformed UT's main commencement ceremony
on the South Mall from a tired, thinly attended ritual in 1994 to a
show with fireworks and music that drew almost 20,000 people last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In November and December, Caspers took a leave of absence from
UT to help Chandler stage-manage Radio City Music Hall's Christmas
show in Chicago. The pair may put on a similar production in Mexico
City this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always flip-flop,'' Caspers said. ``If he's going to work
on it, I'll just be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said Caspers has directed everything he's written.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we finish each others sentences,'' Chandler
said. ``We work in a shorthand that only comes after working
together so many years.''

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 6:
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Europe are quarreling over bananas,
airplanes and beef, working together to secure peace in Kosovo and
tangling over the future of NATO. This improbable confluence of
events reflects important changes taking place in trans-Atlantic
relations. Perhaps more clearly than at any time since the end of
the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, America and its
European allies are confronting the economic frictions of
globalization and adjusting to a world no longer shaped by the
clash of ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are new stresses in America's relations with
Europe, there are also encouraging signs that Europe may emerge
from this period prepared to take a greater role in maintaining
security on the Continent. That would be healthy for both Europe
and America.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising evidence of this shift is the negotiations
over Kosovo. European countries have shown themselves willing to
take on more political and military responsibility than they did in
Bosnia four years ago. France and Britain have been especially
assertive. But the latest American effort to lock up a deal before
the formal peace talks resume later this month in France suggests
that Washington's leadership and leverage will not be easy to
replace.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is another arena of change. While the alliance is preparing
to mark its 50th anniversary next month with the admission of three
new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all is not
harmonious. There is vigorous and potentially divisive debate
within NATO about the alliance's reliance on nuclear weapons and
how it should react to threats from beyond Europe. These
discussions are drawing new energy from a younger generation of
European leaders, especially Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, and Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia no longer a military threat and three of its former
allies about to join NATO, the question of whether the alliance
still needs to threaten nuclear retaliation against conventional
attack deserves discussion, as Germany has suggested. Also, most
European NATO members rightly bristle at some of Washington's more
ambitious notions for enlisting NATO forces to defend common
Western interests on distant battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   Trade relations are in flux as well, primarily because of
increased global competition. The rapid integration of world
markets over the past decade, symbolized by new decision-making
bodies like the World Trade Organization, is challenging the cozy
protectionist policies Europe used during the Cold War years to
shelter its companies and workers from risk.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is now trying to tilt its market in favor of local banana
importers, aircraft manufacturers and beef farmers and ward off
cheaper American competition. Since open protectionism is no longer
respectable, Europe cloaks its efforts with arguments about air
pollution, dangerous beef hormones and the devastation that free
trade in bananas would produce in former Caribbean colonies. While
not entirely without merit, these arguments disguise the real
motives of European governments and impede reasonable solutions. A
trans-Atlantic trade war is in nobody's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and America may also be headed for troubles in other
economic areas. The introduction of Europe's new currency, the
euro, could force European governments into restrictive monetary
policies that could retard needed economic growth, slowing
America's own economy and worsening trade tensions. The European
Union's slowness to admit members from Central and Eastern Europe
is distorting the political and economic development of the entire
Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Further frictions are likely as America and Europe adjust their
relationship to new circumstances. That is fine, as long as the
problems are resolved constructively and not allowed to undermine
the vital trans-Atlantic partnership.

EDITORIAL: A FEDERAL LOOK AT POLICE CONDUCT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 6: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to hold
hearings in New York City on Police Department practices may
provide an opportunity to heal the anger and alienation that have
surfaced among many New Yorkers after the shooting of Amadou
Diallo. For a long time, many minority communities in the city have
felt that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the police do not care enough
about building relations of trust or hearing their concerns about
incidents of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission hearing, scheduled for late May, is not
directly linked to the Diallo shooting, it may offer aggrieved
citizens a forum at which the mayor and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir can address concerns about over-aggressive police practices
that have victimized innocent people. When Diallo, an immigrant
from Guinea, was killed while unarmed in a hail of 41 bullets by
officers from the Street Crimes Unit, many charged that the unit
routinely targeted black residents as potential lawbreakers and
exercised undue force against them.
</P>
<P>
   The commission does not have power to prosecute crimes. But as
an independent agency of the federal government, it has the power
to investigate complaints that citizens have been denied protection
of the laws because of racial discrimination. It may issue
subpoenas, collect evidence and refer credible complaints to the
appropriate agency of government for action.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has indicated that he will cooperate fully with the
commission's fact-finding mission. The mayor's aides say they are
eager for an opportunity to describe the Police Department's
community relations program and its successes. That the mayor seems
to welcome the chance to talk before a neutral body should assist
him in improving communications between City Hall and black and
Latino communities where the police are increasingly feared and
resented.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's hearing will provide a forum for dialogue, but
the commission has no power to dictate improvements in police
tactics or programs. The mayor has presided over dramatic
reductions in New York City's crime rates. In the wake of the
Diallo killing, he and his police commissioner have been reaching
out to leaders in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a parallel movement, Cardinal John O'Connor mediated a
meeting this week between representatives of the police union and a
group of black business leaders and professionals concerned about
policing in minority neighborhoods. The planned federal hearing
only can help to ease the tensions that continue to roil
police-community relations in the city.

UT win separates Mihm from boys
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ricardo Patton, the affable Colorado coach,
wasn't going to let Chris Mihm leave the building without shaking
the large Longhorn's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great game, young man,'' Patton told the Texas center, briefly
excusing himself from a postgame huddle with several writers.
``Listen, you don't have a younger brother about your size that we
can recruit, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm had dwarfed the Buffaloes on Friday. The 7-footer from
Austin Westlake shook off foul trouble that cost him by his own
estimation five or six minutes on the court and delivered perhaps
the best all-around game yet of his two seasons as a much-hyped
collegian. If he hadn't, Colorado would have almost surely upset
the top-seeded Longhorns in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals and
perhaps threatened Texas' NCAA Tournament aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you never know. It would have been the Longhorns' 12th
defeat, after all. And the Big 12 isn't held in the highest regard
this season, given Kansas' sunken stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we needed one win at least here,'' Mihm said. ``I
wanted to made sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, his impact ran deeper than the obvious
box-score data will reveal. You'll see there how he scored 24
points _ a season high _ hogged 14 rebounds and blocked three
shots. But you won't see how many of the Buffaloes' missed shots
were the result of his having altered their trajectories. And that
zero in the assists column next to his name is a baldfaced lie.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Mihm had a huge assist, perhaps the biggest of the
day, albeit not an officially recognized one. UT's lead was only
four, 77-73, when Gabe Muoneke missed a short jumper. The ball
appeared about to careen out of bounds before Mihm, fighting loose
from a double-team tangle, stuck out his left hand and tapped it to
Kris Clack. A fortuitous accident perhaps, but he definitely saved
the moment for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Clack, who was given credit for the rebound, then sank a short
bank shot. With only 19 seconds left, the Buffs found themselves
too far behind to complete their rehab from what had been a
14-point deficit. The Longhorns would escape peril by an 82-76
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Kris who answers to Clack definitely deserves his
recognition for heroism, especially considering he had returned to
the fray despite an ouchy bump on his rump. But if not for the
well-placed extra effort by the Chris who answers to Mihm, the
outcome could have been a serious pain in the you know what for the
reborn Horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most improved player in our league,'' Patton said of Mihm
after he walked away from their brief interlude outside the locker
room. ``No question about it. If he keeps improving like he has, he
will play at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sooner than his coach, Rick Barnes, would prefer to
contemplate. There's conjecture Mihm will pursue an NBA career
after his junior year, and he did nothing to dispel the feasibility
of the notion by coming up big, a full 84 inches' worth, against
the smaller, quicker Buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Barnes raved about Mihm's defensive showing, and
Patton scoffed at a reporter who questioned Mihm's second-half
assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put two guys on him and had a third guy sagging in to
help,'' Patton said. ``We didn't want to get buried in the paint
like that, but he left us no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensed one-on-one early, Mihm had surpassed his season scoring
average _ 12.9 _ in less than 16 minutes. By the half, he was
8-for-11, and the Colorado coaches were searching for a lesser
evil. The defense-by-committee scheme for which they opted after
the break limited Mihm to just six additional shots, but he made
three of them and, with his over-covered presence, created numerous
opportunities for his mates.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him, it was hard to imagine how much of a wimp he had
been at the outset of the season, when his personal ineffectiveness
was much to blame for the Longhorns' dreadful 3-8 start.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in late December, Barnes corralled him for a
lengthy film critique. Mihm was hardly the star of these movies,
though. Rather, the coach picked clips of three games _ all bad
defeats, of course _ in which Mihm had been outscored 54-29 and
outrebounded 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris,'' Barnes said, ``are these guys that much better than
you? What is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 30, when the Longhorns whipped Hawaii following a
team meeting to air things out, Mihm's productivity has improved
dramatically, as has his assertiveness. He was agile and mobile,
but Barnes wanted him to be hostile, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's coming. A 20-point, 17-rebound effort against Massachusetts
on Super Sunday was a milestone performance for him. But Friday's
might have surpassed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely in the same league,'' Mihm said. ``I felt really
good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Which made Patton feel really envious.

O'MALLEY WANTS A COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley said
baseball should establish an independent committee to study ways to
solve the sport's economic problems and avoid another work
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, speaking to reporters at Dodgertown on Friday, said he
would be interested in working on such a committee _ as long as it
wielded power and its findings were taken serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a whole fresh look, a whole fresh view by all
concerned, by all parties,'' O'Malley said. ``I would have to be
convinced that it was truly a meaningful assignment (to be on the
committee).''
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley, who sold the Dodgers to the Fox Group last spring,
said getting all three sides _ management, players and agents _
together should be baseball's immediate concern. Then, steps need
to be taken to eliminate the tension that developed from the work
stoppage of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we have to remove all the animosity that existed
in the last negotiation. That has to be eliminated on all sides,''
O'Malley said. ``Secondly, you have to build up some trust, and
that doesn't happen overnight. There has to be trust on both sides.
Then you identify the issues, the problems, educate each side on
those issues, and then you try to find the common ground to avoid
another work stoppage.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said only then can discussions begin about the
ever-escalating salaries, revenue sharing, and determining a way to
balance baseball's economy. The collective bargaining agreement
expires after the 2001 season, and already there's talk of what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have half the teams in spring training today whose
fans realize you don't really have a shot at playing in October,''
O'Malley said. ``It's not good for the game. It's not good for
sponsors. It's not good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Opener sold out: The April 5 opener against the Arizona
Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium sold out Friday morning, less than
two days after tickets went on sale. It's the quickest a home
opener has sold out in Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   Resting the back: Second baseman Eric Young continues to be
slowed by stiffness in his lower back, but the Dodgers don't appear
to be overly concerned. For the first time in a few days, Young
took grounders Friday, physical therapist Pat Screnar said, though
he's been kept away from the batting cages.
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Dodgers right-hander Dave Mlicki, who could be
traded by the team, threw two innings of two-hit, no-run ball in
his spring training debut. ``I'm sure it's an audition,'' Mlicki
said. ``I'm going to pitch somewhere, and hopefully, it's here.'' .
. . Shortstop Ryan Jaroncyk, a former first-round pick of the Mets
who later quit baseball, told the Dodgers he will report for
workouts in May when classes he's taking at Palomar Junior College
end. Jaroncyk was taken by the Dodgers in December's Rule V draft
but hasn't played since 1997, when he hit .174 in 29 games at the
Single-A level.

COMMENTARY: MONICA'S REAL STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``I saw things this past year,'' Monica Lewinsky told
Barbara Walters, ``that I didn't know happened in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that an out-of-control prosecutor and his
thuggish deputies threatened and grossly abused Ms. Lewinsky, her
family and her friends. And the purpose was not to fight crime of
any serious kind but to destroy the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the ABC television interview we heard a young woman describe
a tawdry sexual entanglement. Viewers might think her sympathetic
or silly. But one thing was overwhelmingly clear. It was simply
preposterous that those sexual antics should have produced a year
of prosecutorial inquisition and the impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's methods are the real story in Andrew Morton's ``Monica's
Story.'' Literary critics may mock the book's mawkishness. But it
tells us important things about prosecutorial abuse _ abuse of a
kind that most of us, not only Ms. Lewinsky, did not know happened
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   When Linda Tripp set the trap at the Ritz-Carlton in Pentagon
City on Jan. 16, 1998, Starr's agents took Ms. Lewinsky to Room
1012. A deputy prosecutor said they were ready to charge her with
perjury, obstruction of justice, subornation of perjury, witness
tampering and conspiracy _ and she could go to prison for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   All those dread crimes were because she had signed an affidavit
denying ``sexual relations'' with President Clinton. No honorable
prosecutor would bring even a misdemeanor charge on that basis. And
in fact, the affidavit had not yet been filed in court _ and would
not have been if the Starr deputies had allowed Ms. Lewinsky to
call her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has steadfastly denied that she was kept from telephoning
her lawyer. But the Morton book produces much evidence to the
contrary. When Ms. Lewinsky asked to use the bathroom, a telephone
was removed from it first. When she was finally allowed to call her
mother, an agent had his hand ready to cut her call off if she said
anything about where and with whom she was.
</P>
<P>
   In Room 1012, Starr has said, Ms. Lewinsky was ``in a
non-custodial setting.'' The Morton book is utterly convincing in
its picture of a young woman overborne, terrorized over many hours,
cut off from the world. The experience left her with nightmares
``of being trapped and drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling detail in the book is Starr's treatment of Catherine
Allday Davis, a friend in whom Ms. Lewinsky had confided. Ms. Davis
was flown from Tokyo to appear before the grand jury. ``It was
awful,'' she said. ``I'm no prude, but they wanted very, very
specific details about their sexual relationship. I thought it was
wrong and quite disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office subpoenaed Ms. Davis' computer. And over
objections from her and her lawyer, her e-mail, including private
correspondence about members of her family, was published in
Starr's referral to the House.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky met with Starr deputies to be
questioned at length about what she would tell the grand jury if
granted immunity. All had agreed that it would be a totally secret
meeting. But when she got home, she turned on the television set
and heard a reporter say that Monica Lewinsky had met the deputies
and admitted a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after she appeared before the grand jury, Starr wanted
a videotaped deposition from her, the book says, about ``how, when,
where and why she had performed oral sex on the president and ...
other intimate details.'' Why videotape? For someone's private
delectation, or so that the world could see it? Ms. Lewinsky was
devastated at the demand. When her lawyers objected, the
questioning took place without cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview Ms. Lewinsky did not discuss Starr's
methods _ because he had forbidden her to do so. Under her immunity
agreement she cannot talk to the press without his permission. He
is using that clause for the outrageous purpose of protecting
himself from criticism. That is consistent with his assertion last
year that criticism of his office could amount to obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of Ken Starr?'' Barbara Walters asked. Ms.
Lewinsky replied: ``I'm too afraid to answer.''

U.S. BISHOPS FACE NOVEMBER DEADLINE FOR APPLYING PAPAL DIRECTIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By   PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the phone, Bishop John Leibrecht sounded upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a process in place, and I'm trusting it,'' he said in
an interview earlier this month. ``I think we'll work out
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibrecht's optimism is impressive, given that he has an
assignment that appears to be almost as impossible as it is
important: The Roman Catholic bishop, whose diocese is
Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo., heads the committee of bishops
charged with drafting the document that will apply ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' (``From the Heart of the Church''), Pope John Paul II's
broad 1990 directive on the religious mission and identity of
Catholic colleges and universities, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has more than 230 Catholic colleges and
universities, some of national stature, many others of local or
regional importance. Besides educating some 600,000 students, they
are centers of scholarship and critical intelligence for a church
that insists faith must not be detached from understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For Pope Paul, writing in ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' the objective
of these institutions is ``to assure in an institutional manner a
Christian presence in the university world confronting the great
problems of society and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That task, the pope said, demands a free and fearless search for
the truth, academic freedom, institutional autonomy and also an
``institutional fidelity of the university to the Christian
message'' as taught authoritatively by the church.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are tensions in the papal prescription, but
``Ex Corde Ecclesiae'' prudently left the practical details of
maintaining Catholic identity to be worked out by each nation's
bishops, who presumably knew the local situation best.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's words were welcomed by American Catholic educators
belatedly facing up to what, nine years later, has become clear:
Catholic colleges and universities are under immense pressures to
follow the path toward secularization trod by the many other
institutions that once boasted a distinct religious connection and
mission.
</P>
<P>
   These pressures, cultural, ideological, financial, are often a
lot more complex than those outside the academy realize. Still, the
upshot is that on most major Catholic campuses there is a
significant lobby of tenured faculty members and midlevel
administrators who are quite content to be part of Catholic higher
education as long as the ``Catholic'' dimension remains more or
less window dressing in the eyes of their secular counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Behind their view is the conviction, by no means unrealistic,
that, talk of multiculturalism notwithstanding, anything trying to
be ``a Christian presence'' in higher education is likely to
encounter a serious stigma and be at a disadvantage in the fierce
competition for grants, students, scholars and status.
</P>
<P>
   Many other faculty members and administrators on these campuses
hold a more benign view of maintaining some distinctly Catholic
ethos and mission, but they are uncertain about how to do this
without returning to the dogmatism and intellectual isolation that
characterized many of their institutions a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly this cause needs all the help it can get. That is what
Leibrecht hopes his committee can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent Catholic educators appear skeptical. They do not
doubt the bishop's good will. They do wonder whether he and his
fellow bishops are really working under constraints that will make
their work more of a hindrance than a help. In 1996, after all,
Leibrecht's committee proposed a text applying ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' to the United States, and it was approved, 224 to 6, by
the American bishops.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican tossed that document back with the complaint
that it relied too much on trust between bishops and Catholic
educators and did not tie American colleges and universities
``juridically'' into the hierarchical chain of command.
(Historically, most Catholic colleges and universities have not
operated directly under the bishops but under the auspices of
religious orders of priests and sisters and, in recent decades,
under independent boards of trustees with lay majorities.)
</P>
<P>
   A revised proposal that Leibrecht's committee ran past the
bishops' conference in November revealed that concerns about
applying the church's internal canon law to theology departments
and other aspects of Catholic academic life had now almost
completely overshadowed the pope's central thrust in ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae.'' Will episcopal oversight of Catholic theology
professors or obligatory oaths of fidelity for Catholic university
presidents really contribute to assuring ``a Christian presence in
the university world'' _ or just the opposite?
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican also is demanding that the America bishops produce a
satisfactory document by their meeting next November, a daunting
task, as Leibrecht acknowledges
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that, independent of the debate over ``Ex
Corde Ecclesiae,'' a recent clash between the Vatican and St. Louis
University over the sale of that Jesuit-founded university's
hospital has reopened the question of whether Rome claims a veto
over property decisions even by boards of trustees on which the
laity make up a majority.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be a lot of new ground to break by November. The air
is full of dire predictions if the bishops put their heads down and
rubber-stamp whatever the Vatican signals it wants: lay boards
voting to break off their institutions' Catholic ties,
non-Catholics resigning from boards, a sharp decline in the ability
of Catholic institutions to recruit first-rate faculty members.
Much of that seems overblown. It might be more pertinent to ask
whether the major casualty of such a rush would be ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' itself.

   STRONG JOB CREATION SHOWS THE ECONOMY IS STILL ROBUST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another big burst of job growth in February showed that the
nation's economy was still on a roll while wage pressures remained
subdued. Driven by booms in construction and consumer spending,
employers added 275,000 new jobs to their payrolls. Since
Thanksgiving, the economy has been adding jobs at the staggering
pace of 3.2 million a year. Even so, the unemployment rate edged up
0.1 percentage point, to 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strong jobs creation figures touched off a rally in the
stock market and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a new
high of 9,736.08. Traders also drove long-term interest rates down.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond declined to 5.60 percent,
from 5.69 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing by consumers rose by $14.7 billion, to $1.316
trillion, in January. Consumer credit jumped at a 13.5 percent
annual rate in January, up from 2.9 percent in December.

   TOUGH TIMES FOR INDONESIAN BANKS

<P>
   It is clear that nursing Indonesia's ruined economy back to

banking system have discouraged even the most hardened realists,
who say the postponement of a crucial step toward bank reform last
week was a telling example of why the country will take so long to
heal.

   When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William

Coast Guard the supertanker was leaking oil. ``We're going to be
here for quite a while,'' the skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, reported
by radio. Nearly 10 years after one of the nation's worst
environmental disasters, the Exxon Valdez is in many ways still

<P>
   Winsloew Furniture, which makes aluminum furniture for patios

   The market for counterfeit golf equipment has grown to $4

PRINCETON STUDENTS SAY BAN ON NUDE OLYMPICS WON'T STOP EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Princeton University officials may be planning to ban
the Nude Olympics, but judging from the reaction of students
Thursday night during their first public forum on the issue, the
tradition will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Nude Olympics is an annual event dating back to the
streaking days of the 1970s in which sophomores _ and often other
students _ run naked around a campus quadrangle at midnight after
the first snow. The event lost its official sanction in January
after a calamitous night in which 10 students were admitted to the
hospital and campus infirmary with severe alcohol poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with reports of bottle throwing and public sex and
urination by some of the 350 revelers, the university president,
Harold T. Shapiro, appointed a committee of faculty members and
students to ``prevent a tragedy before it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 50 or so students who attended a forum held by
the committee made it clear that the rite of passage would not die
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to run next year, and you better tell public safety
to lay off the doughnuts because they are going to have to catch
me,'' said one student, a veteran Nude Olympian who did not give
his name and left quickly after his speech.
</P>
<P>
   A few students even hinted at the possibility of a large-scale
revolt next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to end the Nude Olympics smacks of
totalitarianism, paternalism and yes, many things,'' said Andrew
Rearick, a senior. ``Imagine 200 or 300 students running in
defiance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the committee is ready. In a report to the university
administration next month, the panel plans to recommend severe
penalties, including a one-year suspension for students who break
the ban, said the chairwoman, Janina Montero, the dean of student
life.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that the ban would be difficult to enforce.
``But when one of your classmates dies next year, we're going to
say what?'' she asked. Several students complained that the
committee should try harder to come up with a compromise, like
banning drunken students from the event, sponsoring nude games or
even holding the Nude Olympics in the gymnasium. But committee
members said they simply could not risk another year of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Luciani, a committee member and the president of the
freshman class, said he was particularly upset by reports that an
86-year-old woman with a fractured hip was among several people
forced to wait for hours in the emergency room of the Princeton
Medical Center while students were treated for alcohol poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students were so ill that doctors feared they would
stop breathing, he said. Others had to be restrained because they
were so rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani said that he had received hundreds of e-mail messages
from classmates who want the nude run to continue, and that he felt
particularly guilty because his class would be the first to be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here I had thought, `When I'm a sophomore, I'm
going to get to run in the Nude Olympics, and it's going to be
something that I'm going to remember for the rest of my life,''' he
said. ``It hurts somewhat because I know that I won't be able to
carry on a tradition that generations have before me.''

COLUMN: CONFRONTATION SOWS DOUBTS ABOUT POLICE 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say hello to Sean Hawkins of Brooklyn. Do not,
however, say yo.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins is a 32-year-old black man who lives in Crown Heights
with his wife, Kena, and their daughter, Kaia. After three years of
college, he now works in collections for Brooklyn Union Gas Co. He
wants to buy a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where he was
raised, so he regularly goes to the old neighborhood to attend
community board meetings, to volunteer with neighborhood groups and
to help spruce up a local playground.
</P>
<P>
   He was walking home after a haircut on the evening of Jan. 30,
he said, when a car carrying three white people passed him on New
York Avenue near Sterling Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Yo, can we speak to you?''' Hawkins recalled. ``I
didn't pay them any mind, because I knew they couldn't be talking
to me. Basically, I don't respond when people say `yo.' People
don't usually try to get my attention in that fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio caught his eye when they stopped their car, got out and
said they were police officers. Hawkins stopped and took his hands
out of his pockets. ``One of them asked me, `You walk around at
night with your hands in your pockets?''' Hawkins said. ``I replied
that it was 20 degrees outside. Once I replied that way, they
started to pat my pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said he protested and told them that if he was suspected
of breaking the law, they should take him to the station house. He
tried to push their hands away. He said one of the officers punched
him in the chest, while another suggested that Hawkins get an
education. (Where did that come from? he asked himself.) They left,
he said, to respond to another call. Hawkins went home and filed a
complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which is
investigating it.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts anything will come of his complaint since he has no
witnesses, although he spotted the three officers at a local
precinct house a few days later when he was amending his complaint.
But he filed it because he refuses to act as if nothing has
happened. Something did: He did not go to work for almost three
weeks because of a painful swelling in his chest. He also began to
ask if this was the price he must pay for aggressive police patrols
that have helped reduce crime in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have their mind made up that this person is
committing a crime _either now, before or about to _ so let's stop
and catch him now and see if he has anything on him,'' Hawkins
said. ``There are other things in life that are challenging besides
having to worry about public servants that we are paying doing harm
to us. The mayor says crime is down, crime is down. But is it
better for us, or just for him, number-wise?''
</P>
<P>
   A police spokeswoman did not return a call on Thursday seeking
comment. Hawkins, who returned to work last week, said he was not
against all police officers. He said he attends meetings of the
community council at the 81st Precinct station in Bed-Stuy. But
David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
encounters like the one described by Hawkins ultimately erode
respect for the law and its legitimacy when more minority civilians
than whites are stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``No Equal Justice: Race and Class in the
American Criminal Justice System,'' Cole said that most people
stopped by police do not know they can decline to consent to a
search. The courts, he said, have further encouraged such consent
by ruling that police officers do not have to inform people that
they have the right to say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people believe they have no choice,'' Cole said. ``This
allows the police to use coercive tactics based on no individual
basis for suspicion and allows the police to rely on racial
stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said he tried to exercise his right to decline a search,
but to no avail. A few days after his encounter, four plainclothes
officers shot and killed an unarmed African immigrant in the Bronx.
Hawkins now wonders if police will ever be familiar enough with
minority neighborhoods to fight crime while respecting the rights
of law-abiding residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line?'' Hawkins said. ``When is it going
to stop? A lot would be resolved if they brought back the residency
law for the police. They want to take money out of our communities,
then they should live here. Maybe they would respect the
neighborhood better. Not only that, the mayor wants to bring money
to the city. That would bring a ton back to the city because they
would shop here. They would live here.''

AIRPORT WON`T MAKE FEDERAL DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Even though Sea-Tac International Airport won't meet a
federal deadline, the Year 2000 millennium bug won't eat your
luggage at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Jan. 1, Port of
Seattle officials promise.
</P>
<P>
   All 157 computer systems at the port-operated airport will be
clear of potential problems that could bring them to a halt when
the year 2000 arrives, said Bill Swedish, the port's chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the airport won't meet a Federal Aviation
Administration-recommended June 30 target date for Year 2000
computer fixes, Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have all systems fixed by the end of October, which
was our initial target date when we started out to identify
problems in 1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA-recommended date was set after we started, when we
were already involved in our program. We are now on our project
plan and 86 percent complete, but 14 systems will not be done by
June 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 problems stem from the trouble some computer programs
and chips have in recognizing the Year 2000 date, which could lead
them to read the year 2000 as 1900 or prompt a system shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, Sea-Tac will have a backup plan and a contingency
plan for every airport computer system under the port's control,
Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Sea-Tac's baggage-handling conveyers, airfield
runway lights, programmable temperature control systems throughout
Sea-Tac terminals, fire alarm systems, emergency generators,
automated voice recordings, fire trucks, radios and other systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did discover Y2K problems in computer chips aboard the
airport's fire trucks,'' Swedish said. ``They have been fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish and other Sea-Tac officials say that by the end of
October, they will have hunted down and tested every imbedded
computer chip at Sea-Tac and will have replaced all those that
could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we will have all the new ones tested and rehearsed and
have backup and contingency plans in place in case there still are
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Swedish and two other Sea-Tac officials, Burr Stewart,
administrative projects director, and Charles Blood, general
manager of the airfield line of business, received authorization
from Port of Seattle commissioners to spend $36 million to get rid
of Sea-Tac's computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most current projection is that we will not be anywhere
near that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it will be completed at about $13 million to $15
million. We allow some leeway, because you never know if you will
find some non-compliant computer chips that need replacing.''
</P>
<P>
   His assurances do not cover air traffic control at Sea-Tac,
which is handled by the FAA, Swedish said.
</P>
<P>
   But they came as the federal Government Accounting Office
reported that about a third of the U.S. airports responding to a
GAO questionaire said they won't meet the June 30 target date for
completing Year 2000 computer fixes and have no procedures to
remain open if computers fail.
</P>
<P>
   Another third said they wouldn't meet the target date but that
they were developing backup plans. The remaining third expect to
miss the deadline and have no backup plans.
</P>
<P>
   While the group without backup plans in place is comprised of
mostly small airports, nine of the 50 largest U.S. airports also
aren't prepared, according to the GAO, which didn't identify
airports participating in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   While most airport officials don't expect aviation safety and
security to be compromised by Year 2000 computer problems, the GAO
said failures at even a single airport could cause delays
throughout the U.S. aviation system.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Working with nuclear secrets stolen from a U.S.
government laboratory, China has made a leap in the development of
nuclear weapons: the miniaturization of its bombs, according to
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing was unable to produce small warheads that could be launched
from a single missile at multiple targets and form the backbone of
a modern nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough that officials say was accelerated by the
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the mid-1980s,
officials said. But it was not detected until 1995, when American
experts analyzing Chinese nuclear test results found similarities
to America's most advanced miniature warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, government investigators had identified a
suspect, an American scientist at Los Alamos laboratory, where the
atomic bomb was first developed. The investigators also concluded
that Beijing was continuing to steal secrets from the government's
major nuclear weapons laboratories, which had been increasingly
opened to foreign visitors since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was told of the full extent of China's spying in
the summer of 1997, on the eve of the first U.S.-Chinese summit
meeting in eight years _ a meeting intended to dramatize the
success of President Clinton's efforts to improve relations with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say they took the allegations seriously;
as proof of this they cite Clinton's ordering the labs within six
months to improve security.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. officials assert that the White House sought to
minimize the espionage issue for policy reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conflicted with their China policy,'' said a U.S.
official, who like many others in this article spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``It undercut the administration's efforts to have a
strategic partnership with the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies the assertions. ``The idea that we tried
to cover up or downplay these allegations to limit the damage to
United States-Chinese relations is absolutely wrong,'' said Gary
Samore, the senior National Security Council official who handled
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a reconstruction by The New York Times reveals that
throughout the government, the response to the nuclear theft was
marked by delays, inaction and skepticism _ even though senior
intelligence officials regarded it as one of the most damaging spy
cases in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the FBI did not aggressively pursue the criminal
investigation of lab theft, U.S. officials said. Now, nearly three
years later, no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the secretary of energy, have government officials administered lie
detector tests to the main suspect, a Los Alamos computer scientist
who is Chinese-American. The suspect failed a test in February,
according to senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the Energy Department, officials waited more than a year to
act on the FBI's 1997 recommendations to improve security at the
weapons laboratories and restrict the suspect's access to
classified information, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's chief of intelligence, who raised the first
alarm about the case, was ordered last year by senior officials not
to tell Congress about his findings because critics might use them
to attack the administration's China policies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the White House, senior aides to Clinton fostered a
skeptical view of the evidence of Chinese espionage and its
significance.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, for example, said they determined on
learning of it that the Chinese spying would have no bearing on the
administration's dealings with China, which included the increased
exports of satellites and other militarily useful items. They
continued to advocate looser controls over sales of supercomputers
and other equipment, even as intelligence analysts documented the
scope of China's espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Samore, the Security Council official, did not accept the Energy
Department's conclusion that China's nuclear advances stemmed
largely from the theft of U.S. secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as Clinton prepared to meet with President Jiang Zemin
of China, he asked the CIA for a quick alternative analysis of the
issue. The agency found that China had stolen secrets from Los
Alamos but differed with the Energy Department over the
significance of the spying.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In personal terms, the handling of this case is very much the
story of the Energy Department intelligence official who first
raised questions about the Los Alamos case, Notra Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock became a secret star witness before a select
congressional committee last fall. In a unanimous report that
remains secret, the bipartisan panel embraced his conclusions about
Chinese espionage, officials said. Taking issue with the White
House's view, the panel saw clear implications in the espionage
case for U.S.-China policy, and has now made dozens of
policy-related recommendations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A debate still rages within the government over whether Trulock
was right about the significance of the Los Alamos nuclear theft.
But even senior administration officials who do not think so credit
Trulock with forcing them to confront the realities of Chinese
atomic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   China's technical advance allows it to make mobile missiles,
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and small warheads for
submarines _ the main elements of a modern nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   While White House officials question whether China will actually
deploy a more advanced nuclear force soon, they acknowledge that
Beijing has made plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996 Trulock traveled to CIA headquarters to tell
officials there of the evidence his team had gathered on the
apparent Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear designs.
</P>
<P>
   As Trulock gathered his charts and drawings and wrapped up his
top-secret briefing, the agency's chief spy hunter, Paul Redmond,
sat stunned.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the Atomic Age, a Soviet spy ring that included
Julius Rosenberg had stolen the first nuclear secrets out of Los
Alamos. Now, at the end of the Cold War, the Chinese seemed to have
succeeded in penetrating the same weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be just as bad as the Rosenbergs,'' Redmond
recalled saying.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that so alarmed him had surfaced a year earlier.
Senior nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos, poring over data from
the most recent Chinese underground nuclear tests, had detected
eerie similarities between the latest Chinese and U.S. bomb
designs.
</P>
<P>
   From what they could tell, Beijing was testing a smaller and
more lethal nuclear device configured remarkably like the W-88, the
most modern, miniaturized warhead in the U.S. arsenal. In April
1995, they brought their findings to Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to detail the evidence uncovered by the Los
Alamos scientists, who have access to a wide range of classified
intelligence data and seismic and other measurements.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the scientists were piecing it together, they were
handed an intelligence windfall from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, they were told, a Chinese official gave CIA
analysts what appeared to be a 1988 Chinese government document
describing the country's nuclear weapons program. The document, a
senior official said, specifically mentioned the W-88 and described
some of the warhead's key design features.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos laboratory, where the W-88 had been designed,
quickly emerged as the most likely source of the leak.
</P>
<P>
   One of three national weapons labs owned by the Department of
Energy, Los Alamos, 35 miles outside Sante Fe, N.M., was
established in 1943 during the Manhattan Project. Trulock and his
team knew just how vulnerable Los Alamos was to modern espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The three labs had long resisted FBI and congressional pressure
to tighten their security policies. Energy officials acknowledge
that there have long been security problems at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, also in New Mexico,
had in 1994 been granted waivers from an Energy Department policy
that visiting foreign scientists be subjected to background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Lab officials resented the intrusions caused by
counterintelligence measures, arguing that restrictions on foreign
visitors would clash with the labs' new mandate to help Russia and
other nations safeguard their nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was also using increased access to
the laboratories to support its policy of engagement with China, as
had been done under previous, Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, for example, China's defense minister, Gen.
Chi Haotian, visited Sandia on a Pentagon-sponsored trip. Energy
Department officials were not told in advance, and they later
complained that Chi and his delegation had not received proper
clearances, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no evidence in this case that foreign visitors
were involved in the theft of information.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and early 1996, Trulock and his team took their
findings to the FBI. A team of FBI and Energy Department officials
traveled to the three weapons labs and pored over travel and work
records of lab scientists who had access to the relevant
technology.
</P>
<P>
   By February the team had narrowed its focus to five possible
suspects, including a computer scientist working in the nuclear
weapons area at Los Alamos, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This suspect ``stuck out like a sore thumb,'' said one official.
In 1985, for example, the suspect's wife was invited to address a
Chinese conference on sophisticated computer topics even though she
was only a secretary at Los Alamos. Her husband, the real expert,
accompanied her, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1996, the Energy Department decided to brief the White
House. A group of senior officials including Trulock sat down with
Sandy Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, to
tell him that China appeared to have acquired the W-88 and that a
spy for China might still be at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was first made aware of this in 1996,'' Berger, now national
security adviser, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   By June the FBI formally opened a criminal investigation into
the theft of the W-88 design. But the inquiry made little progress
over the rest of the year. When Energy Department officials asked
about the inquiry at the end of 1996, they came away convinced that
the bureau had assigned few resources to the case.
</P>
<P>
   A senior bureau official acknowledged that his agency was aware
of the Energy Department's criticism but pointed out that it was
difficult to investigate the case without alerting the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau maintained tight control over the case. The CIA
counterintelligence office, for one, was not kept informed of its
status, according to Redmond, who has since retired.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials were also being stymied in their
efforts to address security problems at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After Frederico Pena became energy secretary in early 1997, a
previously approved counterintelligence program was quietly placed
on the back burner for more than a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the FBI issued a classified report on the labs
that recommended, among other things, reinstating background checks
on visitors to Los Alamos and Sandia, officials said. The Energy
Department and the labs ignored the FBI recommendation for 17
months. An Energy Department spokeswoman was unable to explain the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said, ``We couldn't get an order requiring the
labs to report to counterintelligence officials when the Chinese
were present. All those requirements had been waived.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, with the FBI's investigation making scant
progress and the Energy Department's counterintelligence program in
limbo, Trulock and other intelligence officials began to see new
evidence that the Chinese had other, ongoing spy operations at the
weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   But Trulock was unable to quickly inform senior U.S. officials
about the new evidence. He asked to speak directly with Pena, the
energy secretary, but had to wait four months for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pena said he did not know why Trulock was kept
waiting until July but recalled that he ``brought some very
important issues to my attention and that's what we need in the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena immediately sent Trulock back to the White House _ and to
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July 1997 Sandy was briefed fully by the DOE on China's
full access to nuclear weapons designs, a much broader pattern''
said one White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Berger was told that there was evidence of
several other Chinese espionage operations that were still under
way inside the weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   That news, several officials said, raised the importance of the
issue. The suspected Chinese thefts were no longer just ancient
history, problems that had happened on another administration's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Berger quickly briefed Clinton on what he had learned and kept
him updated over the next few months, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   As Trulock spread the alarm, his warnings were reinforced by CIA
Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh, who met with
Pena to discuss the lax security at the labs that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shocked by it, and I went to work on shifting the
balance in favor of security,'' Pena said. He and his aides began
to meet with White House officials to prepare a presidential order
on lab security.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI assigned more agents to the W-88 investigation,
gathering new and more troubling evidence about the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the agents learned that the suspect had
traveled to Hong Kong without reporting the trip as required by
government regulations. In Hong Kong, officials said, the FBI found
records showing that the scientist had obtained $700 from the
American Express office. Investigators suspect he used it to buy an
airline ticket to Shanghai, inside the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   With Berger now paying close attention, the White House became
deeply involved in evaluating the seriousness of the thefts and
solving the counterintelligence problems at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's new findings came at a crucial moment in U.S.-China
relations. Congress was examining the role of foreign money in the
1996 campaign, amid charges that Beijing had secretly funneled
money into Democratic coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was also moving to strengthen its strategic
and commercial links with China. Clinton had already eased the
commercial sale of supercomputers and satellite technology to
China, and now he wanted to cement a nuclear cooperation agreement
at the upcoming summit, enabling American companies to sell China
new commercial nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Berger flew to Beijing to prepare for the
October summit. He assigned Samore, a senior NSC aide in charge of
proliferation issues, to assess the damage from the Los Alamos spy
case.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a briefing from Trulock in August, Samore asked
the CIA's directorate of intelligence to get a second opinion on
how China had developed its smaller nuclear warheads. It was, an
NSC aide said, ``a quick study done at our request.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts agreed that there had been a serious compromise of
sensitive technology through espionage at the weapons labs, but
were far less conclusive about the extent of the damage. The CIA
argued that China's sudden advance in nuclear design could be
traced in part to other causes, including the ingenuity of
Beijing's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The areas of agreement between DOE and CIA were that China
definitely benefited from access to U.S. nuclear weapons
information that was obtained from open sources, conversations with
DOE scientists in the U.S. and China, and espionage,'' said a U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disagreement is in the area of specific nuclear weapons
designs. Trulock's briefing was based on a worst-case scenario,
which CIA believes was not supported by available intelligence. CIA
thinks the Chinese have benefited from a variety of sources,
including from the Russians and their own indigenous efforts.''

CLINTON WISHES `A GOOD LIFE' FOR LEWINSKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton wished Monica Lewinsky the best
Friday and expressed hope everything works out for the former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema at his
side, made extensive comments about the 26-year-old Beverly Hills
siren whose interview this week by ABC-TV's Barbara Walters drew 70
million viewers and whose new book ran up the best-seller charts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's re-emergence onto the national scene comes as she
seeks to make money, in part, to pay for her substantial legal fees
stemming from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of
her affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pretty tough thing for everybody involved, and I
wish her well. I hope it works out all right for her,'' Clinton
said during a joint news conference at the Old Executive Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not watch Lewinsky's interview Wednesday
night so he could not comment on it. On Wednesday night, Clinton
was raising money for the Democratic Party in New Jersey and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was in New York for a series of
appearances as she ponders whether to run for a Senate seat from
that state in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, who expected to receive at least one question
on the fading sex scandal, offered more than the perfunctory
remarks made of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her
life, and I hope it will be a good life,'' Clinton said when asked
for a response to the interview and to Lewinsky's attempts to earn
money off the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope that the efforts that I have made, and that I
continue to make every day at home and at work, will bear fruit,''
Clinton said, apparently referring to his past statements of
rededicating himself to his family and his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope that all the people who have been hurt by this,
including totally innocent people who have massive legal bills,
will get the help they need; and I'm determined to do what I can to
help them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, mostly smiling and sometimes tearful, appeared on ABC
for a two-hour interview in which she spoke publicly for the first
time about her off-and-on affair with the president. The affair
began when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
   She called Clinton her ``sexual soul mate,'' defined phone sex
for Walters and talked of how her love for Clinton soured as he
denied any sexual relationship with ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, her book, ``Monica's Story,'' written by Andrew
Morton, the biographer of Princess Diana, hit the book stores and
became a top seller on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her effort to make money was OK, Clinton said, ``that's
not a decision for me to make ... I don't wish anyone ill who was
caught up in this, and she paid quite a high price for a long time,
and I feel badly for that. So I just hope it works out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate in February acquitted Clinton of impeachment charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice brought by the House stemming
from the affair. House trial managers summoned Lewinsky to testify
on videotape. Clinton was the second president in history to be
impeached and tried.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also testified before a grand jury impaneled by Starr
who granted her immunity. Clinton denied the affair until last
August when Starr's office made clear it had DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's return to the airwaves was a setback for White House
efforts to get some closure and move past the 13-month scandal.
Administration officials have worked hard to present a
business-as-usual appearance since the Senate verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has held three brief joint news conferences with
world leaders in the past three weeks, has fielded at least one
scandal question at each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are virtually screaming at us to get on
with their lives and their business and to do their business, and
I'm going to do my best to do that as well as I possibly can,''
Clinton said.

 WASHINGTON: indigenous efforts.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samore assembled the competing teams of CIA and DOE analysts in
mid-October for a meeting in his White House office that turned
into a tense debate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA report noted that China and Russia were cooperating on
nuclear issues, indicating that this was another possible
explanation of Beijing's improved warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said this was a misreading of the evidence, which
included intercepted communications between Russian and Chinese
experts. The Russians were offering advice on how to measure the
success of nuclear tests, not design secrets. In fact, Trulock
argued, the Russian measurement techniques were used to help the
Chinese analyze the performance of a weapon that Los Alamos experts
believed was based on a U.S. design.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the meeting, Notra Trulock said that he thought the CIA was
underplaying the effect that successful Chinese espionage
operations in the weapons labs had had on the Chinese nuclear
weapons program,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the CIA report, Samore told Berger in late September
that the picture was less conclusive than Trulock was arguing.
Officials said he began to relay that view before hearing Trulock's
rebuttal of the CIA study at the October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Samore told Berger ``there isn't enough information to resolve
the debate, there is no definitive answer, but in any event this
clearly illustrates weaknesses in DOE's counterintelligence
capability,'' said one official familiar with Samore's
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials strenuously deny that the agency's analysts
intended to downplay Trulock's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI inquiry was stalled. At a September 1997 meeting between
FBI and Energy Department officials, Freeh concluded that the
bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest the suspect,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   The crime was believed to have occurred more than a decade
earlier. Investigators did not then have sufficient evidence to
obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect, making it difficult to
build a strong criminal case, according to U.S. officials. FBI
officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to
investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the bureau couldn't build a case, the Energy
Department could still take some action against someone holding a
U.S. security clearance. Freeh told DOE officials that there was no
longer an investigative reason to allow the suspect to remain in
his sensitive position, officials said. In espionage cases, the FBI
often wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of
tipping them off prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspect was allowed to keep his job and retain his
security clearances for more than a year after the meeting with
Freeh, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the NSC did begin to draft a new
counterintelligence plan for the weapons labs, and Clinton signed
the order mandating the new measures in February 1998. In April, a
former FBI counterintelligence agent, Ed Curran, was named to run a
more vigorous counterintelligence office at Energy Department
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The administration explained aspects of the case to aides
working for the House and Senate intelligence committees beginning
in 1996. But few in Congress grasped the magnitude of what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the House Intelligence Committee requested an
update on the case, officials said. Trulock forwarded the request
in a memo to, and in conversations with, Elizabeth Moler, then
acting energy secretary. Ms. Moler ordered him not to brief the
House panel for fear that the information would be used to attack
the president's China policy, according to an account he later gave
congressional investigators. Ms. Moler, now a Washington lawyer,
says she does not remember the request to allow Trulock to brief
Congress and denies delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Ms. Moler, then deputy secretary, stopped Trulock
from delivering written testimony on espionage activities in the
labs to a closed session of the House National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler told Trulock to rewrite his testimony to limit it to
the announced subject of the hearing, foreign visitors to the labs,
an Energy Department spokeswoman said. The issue came up
nonetheless when committee members asked follow-up questions,
Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers began to learn about the extent of the Chinese
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets late in 1998, when a select committee
investigating the transfers of sensitive U.S. technology to China,
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., heard from Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that Congress was adequately
informed, but leading Democrats and Republicans disagree. Rep.
Norman Dicks, D-Wash., the ranking minority member on the House
Intelligence Committee and also a member of the Cox committee, said
that he and Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House
intelligence panel, were not adequately informed.

 WASHINGTON: adequately informed.

<P>
   ``Porter Goss and I were not properly briefed about the
dimensions of the problem,'' he said, adding: ``It was
compartmentalized and disseminated over the years in dribs and
drabs so that the full extent of the problem was not known until
the Cox committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, midway through the Cox panel's inquiry, a new
secretary of energy, Bill Richardson, arrived on the job.
</P>
<P>
   After being briefed by Trulock, Richardson quickly reinstated
background checks on all foreign visitors, a move recommended 17
months earlier by the FBI. He also doubled the counterintelligence
budget and placed more former FBI counterintelligence experts at
the labs.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson also became concerned about what the Cox panel
was finding out.
</P>
<P>
   So in October he cornered Berger at a high-level meeting and
urged him to put someone in charge of coordinating the
administration's dealings with the Cox committee.
</P>
<P>
   Berger turned again to Samore, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By December, Dicks, in his role as the ranking Democratic member
of the Cox panel, was growing impatient with the administration's
slow response to ongoing requests from the committee and its
inaction on the Los Alamos spy case. Dicks told Richardson, a
former colleague in the House, that he needed to take action,
Richardson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks' complaints helped prompt Richardson to call Freeh twice
in one day in December about the inquiry, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was given a polygraph, or lie-detector test, in
December, by the Energy Department. Unsatisfied, the FBI
administered a second test in February, and officials said the
suspect was found to be deceptive. It is not known what questions
prompted the purportedly deceptive answers.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI investigation intensified, the Cox Committee
completed a 700-page secret report which found that China's theft
of US secrets had harmed U.S. national security _ saving the
Chinese untold time and money in nuclear weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from both the CIA and Energy Department analysts,
the bi-partisan panel unanimously came down on the side of
Trulock's assessment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the CIA and other agencies, at the request of the Cox
Committee, are conducting a new, more thorough damage assessment of
the case, even as the debate continues to rage throughout the
intelligence community over whether Trulock has overstated the
damage from Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Trulock has been moved from head of DOE's
intelligence office to acting deputy. While Richardson and other
Energy Department officials praise Trulock's work and deny he has
been mistreated, some in Congress suspect he has been demoted for
helping the Cox Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, the CIA's former counterintelligence chief, who made
his name by unmasking Soviet mole Aldrich Ames at the CIA, has no
doubts about the significance of what Trulock uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``This was far more damaging to the national security
than Aldrich Ames.''

<P>
   SYLACAUGA, Ala. _ The closets that gay people build in small,
severe towns like this one are thick and difficult to penetrate,
and Billy Jack Gaither's was locked tighter than most.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day two weeks ago when he was beaten to death and
burned, Gaither, 39, lived with his disabled parents in their white
clapboard house, tending to their needs, cooking dinner and
cleaning up, singing in the choir of his Baptist church. His
parents swear they had no idea he was gay, and his father, Marion
Gaither, is still half in denial, desperately pointing out that his
son once had a girlfriend in Birmingham whom he almost married.
</P>
<P>
   But the small group of gay residents in this central Alabama
city of 13,000 knew Billy Jack Gaither as one of their own, sharing
their fears of public knowledge. A friend who grew up with him and
used to accompany him on the nearly 40-mile trip to the gay bars of
Birmingham said Gaither would probably have escaped Sylacauga, like
most gay people who grow up here, but was too devoted to his
parents to contemplate leaving. The friend, who refused to be
identified for fear of losing business, said Gaither had never
wanted to hurt his deeply religious, Baptist parents by revealing
the nature of his sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his parents and the rest of Sylacauga have found out about
Gaither, and in the worst possible way. On Thursday, officials
charged two local men with Gaither's murder, saying the men said
they had become angered after Gaither made a sexual advance toward
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The murder is already being called another signpost of hate,
alongside the deaths of Matthew Shepard, killed in Wyoming last
year because he was gay, and James Byrd Jr., the black man dragged
to his death behind a truck last year in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Coosa County sheriff's report said the arrested men, Steven
E. Mullins and Charles M. Butler Jr., had known Gaither and met him
on the night of Feb. 19 at a local nightclub. The report said the
killers locked Gaither in the trunk of his car and drove to a
deserted boat dock where they bludgeoned him to death with an ax
handle, then heaved his body onto a pyre of burning tires. His
remains were found the next day on the banks of Peckerwood Creek,
which churches use for baptizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither's parents had barely absorbed the horror of his gruesome
death before they learned the motive for his murder, and the secret
life that he had led for so long. They knew him as the kindest of
their four boys, the one who read his big illustrated Bible every
night before going to bed, who never came home late on those rare
occasions when he did go with friends to one of the local bars (all
of them straight).
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was gay, he sure never showed it,'' his mother, Lois
Gaither, said Friday morning. ``He never flaunted himself as being
gay or talked about it. And whether he was or not, it don't make me
love him any less. He was my young'un.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, in a kind of rueful acknowledgment of the truth,
``Whatever he did, he never brought it home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marion Gaither, debilitated by multiple heart attacks and a
stroke, sat on the couch near his wife, holding his forehead in his
hands, shaking his head at all references to his son's sexuality.
When a television news report came on saying his son was killed
because he was gay, Gaither shouted out, ``If he was gay. If he was
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the house, however, gave a glimpse of a separate world
that Billy Jack Gaither lived in. He had decorated his room with a
large collection of Scarlett O'Hara dolls and other figurines from
``Gone with the Wind,'' for which he hunted at flea markets on
weekends. A large picture of Clark Gable kissing Vivian Leigh hung
over his bedroom fireplace; pink chiffon curtains fluttered around
antique etchings of antebellum women in hoop skirts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the house, which his parents also allowed him to
decorate, was more conventional. In the living room he hung a
painting of the Last Supper, next to another of Jesus praying in
the garden; between them was a golden plaque of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The two rooms, one for the outside world, the other for himself,
seemed to illustrate the traditional dichotomy of small-town
Southern gay life. Billy Jack Gaither's friend said there are about
100 gay people in town, but none are open about their sexual
orientation. Though there had never been a violent incident like
this one against a gay person, the friend said, there was plenty of
evidence that homosexuality was not appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he said, citing one example, a group of downtown
merchants hung up a series of flags on lightpoles to spruce up the
image of the central business district. The merchants were not
aware that a rainbow symbol on one flag was sometimes used by gay
groups, but a local church recognized the symbol and began a
strident campaign to remove it, saying that its presence promoted a
gay lifestyle in Sylacauga. The flag quickly came down.

</P>
<P>
   Those gay people who have not moved out of town occasionally
travel together to gay bars in Birmingham or Montgomery, the friend
said. He said Gaither occasionally went on such trips and was known
to have had at least two short-term relationships with other men,
whom he would meet out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Sylacauga, with more than 70 churches in its boundaries, is not
unlike most rural southern towns in its conservatism and religious
beliefs. It is industrial rather than agricultural, with many
people working in the factories that ring the town. Gaither
operated a computer terminal at Russell Corp., an athletic wear
manufacturer, in nearby Alexander City. He dropped out of Sylacauga
High School in the 11th grade, but later got his equivalency
diploma and joined the Marines for a year before getting an
honorable discharge because of high blood pressure, his parents
said.
</P>
<P>
   David W. White, the Birmingham coordinator for the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance of Alabama, said Gaither frequented a Birmingham
bar called the Tool Box, one of five gay bars in the city. Many gay
people from surrounding small towns drive to Birmingham for
companionship, he said, because the slightest indication of
homosexuality in a town like Sylacauga would invite harassment, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider it difficult to live anywhere in Alabama
other than Birmingham,'' White said. ``Even in Birmingham, I would
never in a public place grab my partner's hand and walk down the
street. It would literally be a death wish in the state of Alabama.
You would almost be inciting violence to do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Gaither's friend said, gay people in town have been
more concerned about harassment and the loss of jobs or business
than about violence. That all changed with Gaither's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking over our shoulders now,'' said the friend,
who carefully closed the doors of his office before even discussing
the subject. ``You know, Mullins lived just two miles from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, who shaved his head, was known around town for wearing
Ku Klux Klan T-shirts and making racist comments, but Gaither's
friend said the gay community had not been aware of either him or
Butler as someone to fear. Mullins and Butler are being held in the
Coosa County jail on $500,000 bond each; their case will be handed
to a grand jury on March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men could face execution if they are convicted
of capital murder, they cannot be charged with a hate crime,
because Alabama's hate-crime statute covers crimes committed due to
race, religion, ethnicity and disability, but not sexual
orientation. White and other advocates of gay rights said the
murder would increase the pressure on the Alabama Legislature to
broaden the statute. Shephard's death led to similar calls for
hate-crime legislation that would apply to gays.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was explicit in comparing the two cases in
offering his prayers to Gaither's friends and family. ``In times
like this, the American people pull together and speak with one
voice, because the acts of hatred that led to the deaths of such
innocent men are also acts of defiance against the values our
society holds most dear,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gaither put it somewhat differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was gay or not, that still didn't give them no right to
kill him,'' she said.

CLINTON WISH: `GOOD LIFE' FOR LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also LEWINSKY-LIPSTICK) 
(js) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With downcast eye and bitten lip, President Clinton
said Friday that he was sorry about all that Monica Lewinsky had
been through this last year and wished her ``a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had not watched a two-hour television interview
with Ms. Lewinsky broadcast on Wednesday night, in which Ms.
Lewinsky described him as a ``good kisser'' but ultimately an
unsatisfying romantic partner.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say, ``What I hope is that she will be permitted to
go on with her life, and I hope it will be a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president said he would continue to work on
his fractured relations with his wife and daughter, as well as on
public policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented in response to yet another question about his
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, at an afternoon press conference with
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference largely dwelt on the accident in Italy last
year in which a Marine Corps plane on a training mission severed
ski gondola cables, killing 20 people. But in the third question to
Clinton, Laurence McQuillan, a White House correspondent for
Reuters, asked the president whether he had any thoughts on the
Lewinsky matter that ``perhaps might bring closure to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said: ``I think I can only __. One of the things
I've learned, that I've had to relearn all over again in this last
four-year episode, is that all I can control in life is what I do
and what I say. And if I do and say the right things, then that's
the thing that's best for me and my family and for the American
people. And that's what I'm concentrating on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the American public was ``virtually screaming'' at
leaders in Washington to return to the nation's business and that
he would try to heed their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know,'' he added, returning to his views on the
Lewinsky affair, ``this was a pretty tough thing for everybody
involved, and I wish her well. I hope it works out all right for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate acquitted him three weeks ago on two
impeachment charges arising from his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, Clinton cannot escape questions on his truthfulness and
his private conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he was asked at a news conference about a 20-year-old
accusation of sexual assault that recently surfaced. And Ms.
Lewinsky's television interview and the publication this week of
``Monica's Story,'' a book about her affair with the president,
renewed public and press interest in the tale of illicit sex in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's news conference, Clinton looked sad and resigned to
many more months of inquiries about the relationship and the
investigation it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish anyone ill who was caught up in this,'' the
president said, ``and she paid quite a high price for a long time,
and I feel badly for that. So I just hope it works out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, said she had no
comment on Clinton's remarks.

DROP IN PROFITS LEADS TO CUTS IN SALARY FOR MERRILL LYNCH'S TOP
EXECUTIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rising tide of executive pay did not lift all
boats on Wall Street last year, with the top bosses at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. taking a pay cut to reflect the firm's profit slump.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's chairman and chief executive, David H. Komansky, saw
his total pay drop by 10.8 percent to $9.9 million, from $11.1
million in 1997. The total compensation paid to Herbert M. Allison
Jr., the chief operating officer, dropped by a similar percentage,
from $8.82 to $7.87 million.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller paychecks came after Merrill posted weak results for
1998. The securities firm suffered losses on its bond holdings
after Russia defaulted on its debt in August, prompting a temporary
but deep plunge. Merrill cut 3,400 jobs, many of them in its fixed
income division. Most bankers at the firm received flat or reduced
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the top executives' pay did not quite match the
profit decrease. Merrill's operating profit was $1.6 billion in
1998, down 20 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street compensation experts said the reduced pay
demonstrated that securities firms peg their bonuses more closely
to performance than do companies in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes very clear to investors as well as employees that
Komansky puts his money where his mouth is,'' said Joan Zimmerman,
a vice president at GZ Stephens Inc., an executive search firm.
``When the firm's profits are down, people expect senior executives
to feel the heat of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The top bosses had little choice but to take a hit this year,
said one Merrill banker who asked to remain anonymous. The firm
frequently says employee compensation will be tightly linked to
performance and profits, and the people at the top can hardly
exempt themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The profit slump was particularly sensitive because Merrill had
been a juggernaut in recent years, expanding at a breakneck pace
both in the United States and abroad. When markets became turbulent
in the fall, Merrill cut faster and deeper than any other major
firm on Wall Street. It fired some top veterans in its bond and
risk management departments and slammed the brakes on growth in
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been a revolt around here if they paid
themselves more,'' the banker said. ``This is not a year anyone was
thrilled about.''
</P>
<P>
   Komansky, who has held Merrill's top post for almost two years,
would have seen his pay decline even more had it not been for a
one-time boost he and several other senior executives received just
before financial markets took a dive. In July, the firm's board of
directors concluded that Merrill had been paying its executives
less than their counterparts at rival Wall Street firms and decided
to use stock options to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Merrill paid Komansky a $4.54 million cash bonus, down
from $7.09 million a year earlier, and a salary of $700,000, the
same as in 1997. He also received $1.06 million in restricted
stock. This portion of his pay fell 36 percent from the previous
year, a figure directly tied to Merrill's formula for calculating
the change in earnings and return on equity. But Komansky got $3.62
million in stock options, an increase of 118 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Wall Street executives did better. Lehman Brothers paid
its chairman, Richard Fuld $13.3 million, an 18 percent increase
from 1997. Philip J. Purcell, chairman and chief executive of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took home total pay of $31 million,
including an exceptional options grant. His annual pay increased
about 8 percent. Profits at both Lehman and Morgan rose by about 15
percent last year.

BIG MO MEETS THE BIG CHEESE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Michael Eisner, chairman and CEO of the Walt
Disney Company, visited the Angels here Friday and finally got to
meet his $80 million man.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn will be paid the hefty sum by the Angels during the
course of a six-year deal he signed last November, a move that
surprised many, considering the Angels' reluctance to pay big money
to free agents in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said it was simply a case of deciding to ``play by the
rules,'' which means spending that kind of money in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we have no alternative but to be competitive,'' he
said. ``I don't think our fans would accept us if we weren't
competitive. If you're going to be on the field, you've got to be
competitive on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said he found Vaughn to be ``a nice guy and a lot
stronger than he expected,'' and added he didn't find it necessary
to meet Vaughn in person before making such a significant financial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they (begin ital)asked(end ital) me, they called me,''
Eisner said of team president Tony Tavares and general manager Bill
Bavasi. ``I have faith in them. I asked thousands of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also said that signing Vaughn was not an isolated event.
It's all part of the organization's long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing Mo Vaughn was not an accident,'' he said. ``We sat
down some time last summer and talked about the strategy of the
Angels and what we wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do one of (a number of) things. We could cut back and
not be competitive. We could stay in the middle, where we wouldn't
be competitive but wouldn't embarrass ourselves. Or we could have a
really competitive team and really put people in the seats. We
decided to go for it. There were six or seven things we could do,
and one of them was signing Mo Vaughn.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, though, admitted signing Vaughn was what it took to
convince Southern California fans that the Angels are in it to win
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people finally realize we are not going to do
short-term things,'' he said. ``We want to be fiscally responsible,
but not cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn put on a good show for Eisner in Friday's Cactus League
opener, a 17-4 loss to the Oakland A's at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
Vaughn played five innings, going 2 for 3 (two singles) with two
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get a good, solid base,'' Vaughn said. ``It's
not necessarily contact. As long as I'm swinging at strikes and
taking balls, that's how I develop over time. This is probably the
best I've ever watched the ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to be talked about for my bat,'' he said.
``That's the way I want it. People don't look too much at my glove.
Where I come from (Boston), there was not too much positive (said)
about my whole game anyway. Then you start seeing it in spring
training and say where's that coming from? That's when people
evaluate not on what they hear but what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so good: Vaughn was one of few bright spots for the Angels
on Friday. Starter Steve Sparks said he was happy with how he threw
his knuckleball but allowed five runs (three earned) and six hits
in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson and Jarrod Washburn, competing for the No.5 spot
in the starting rotation, were ineffective. Dickson gave up eight
runs (four earned) and six hits in 12/3 innings, and Washburn
allowed four runs (all earned) and five hits in 21/3 innings. The
Angels also made four errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``We hit the ball
good early, but that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Pitcher Chuck Finley (stiff back) has been scratched from
today's scheduled start against the A's in Phoenix. Omar Olivares
will start in his place and be followed by Mark Petkovsek, Mike
Magnante and Shigetoshi Hasegawa.... The Angels released their 1999
media guide Friday. On the cover is a picture of former owner Gene
Autry.... The Angels played a ``B'' game on Friday against the
Padres and singer Garth Brooks. Brooks caught a fly ball in left
field and grounded out to second in an at-bat against Angels
pitcher Geoff Edsell, according to Collins. ``He looks good in a
uniform, he's well-built,'' Collins said. ``They say he's got a
tremendous attitude. He's at the park by 6 a.m. every day and
leaves at 9 p.m.''

U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION TO HOLD HEARING ON NEW YORK CITY
POLICE
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT (Eds.: Subs 2d graf to correct that request for hearing came from
commissions own state advisory committee, and not ``leaders of
minority groups.'') 
 (fe) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government stepped into the heated
issue of the police treatment of black and Hispanic people in New
York City on Friday when the Civil Rights Commission voted to
conduct a hearing into the city's police practices.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from its own state advisory committee in
New York in the wake of the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed street peddler, the commission voted 3-2 to investigate
police practices and police-community relations in New York and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, the commission's chairwoman, said that the
agency had not yet determined which other cities would be included
in the inquiry. Ms. Berry said she expected city officials,
including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, to be asked to testify at the May hearings, which will be
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have subpoena power, and if we need to subpoena
documents and persons, we will,'' Ms. Berry said in a telephone
interview. ``But my experience is that mayors and government
officials are usually very cooperative. I would expect that they
would be as eager as we are in exploring these issues in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, emphasized that New
York is not the only city the commission will examine and indicated
that city officials would cooperate with the commission's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has worked very cooperatively with the
U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the past, and we look forward to
continuing that relationship,'' Ms. Roche said. ``New York City has
an excellent story to tell about the New York City Police
Department. and we look forward to telling it.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was established by the Civil Rights Act of
1957, is an independent fact-finding agency of the federal
government with eight members, half appointed by the president and
half by Congress. There are currently three vacancies, and two
members are Democrats, two are independents and one is a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The commission does not file civil complaints or prosecute
individuals for crimes. Rather, it produces reports for the
president, Congress or other federal agencies on how federal, state
or local government agencies treat the civil rights of individuals
or groups. The commission's critics say it moves too slowly in
releasing its findings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the commission has investigated police
practices in Los Angeles, in the wake of the Rodney King beating in
1991, and in Chicago, where police practices were examined as part
of a broader look at racial tensions in a number of cities. Its
report on Los Angeles is due out in April, and the report on
Chicago was issued last year.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Diallo has angered and alienated many blacks and
Latinos as well as some whites in New York. Diallo, an immigrant
from the West African nation of Guinea, died in a hail of 41
bullets fired by four plainclothes officers on Feb. 5 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A number of civil rights organizations have charged that racism
on the part of the officers, who are white, led them to be too
quick to shoot a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry emphasized that her agency's examination of the New
York City Police Department would range beyond the Diallo shooting
and that the public should not expect it to result in criminal
charges being lodged against anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a fact-finding agency, not a prosecuting agency,'' she
said. ``We're not prosecuting anybody or looking at any particular
incident. We're looking at how the Police Department functions,
whether they are operating according to standard operating
procedures, what problems and complaints have been made about the
agency and whether they have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche added that the mayor has not yet been contacted by the
commission about appearing at its hearing. She noted that Giuliani
had appeared before the commission three years ago to discuss
immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said her agency had been coming under some pressure to
examine the practice of New York City's police since Abner Louima,
a Haitian immigrant, reported being physically abused by officers
in the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, Brooklyn, in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something we've been keeping an eye on, and we now
think it's time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials _ from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation _ have been working closely
with the New York City Police Department in the investigation of
the Diallo case. And the four police officers accused in the Louima
case are facing federal civil rights charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of civil rights leaders have asserted that Diallo's
killing fit into a pattern of police abuse against minorities
across the country. Among other incidents the killing of Tyisha
Miller, 19, who was shot 12 times in the back by the police in
December as she sat in her car in Riverside, Calif., and the death
of Deron S. Grimmitt Sr., 32, who was shot by a police officer in
Pittsburgh after a police chase.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, leaders of the major civil
rights organizations, including Hugh Price of the National Urban
League, Kweisi Mfume of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Jesse Jackson of the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition and Raul Yzaguirre of the National Council of La Raza,
called on President Clinton to ``stem this national epidemic of
brutality and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., in whose district Diallo was
killed, has been pressing for the Civil Rights Commission to take
action. And on Friday he praised the agency's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a major breakthrough,'' he said. ``This sets
this issue where it should be set. This is a civil rights issue. If
it isn't, then it should be.''

AUTO CLUB WARNS SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE OWNERS TO RE-LEARN DRIVING
SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- &UR;  &LR; Memo to drivers muscling their way over Southern
California's freeways and city streets in hulking sport-utility
vehicles: Learn how to drive.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the message from the august Automobile Club of
Southern California, which not coincidentally insures lots of SUVs
and pays lots of claims for the damage they cause. Anyway, the Auto
Club issued Friday a six-pack of tips that can make driving an SUV
safer for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The basic message is that an SUV is a lot different than a sedan
or sports car, which makes sense because they don't look anything
alike. And because SUVs are different, they should be driven
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if (SUV drivers) are aggressive or overconfident
in the vehicle's ability, but it translates to more dangerous
behavior on the road,'' said Jeffrey Spring, Auto Club spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   So swallow some pride and brush up on the driving techniques,
the Auto Club says. It won't hurt nearly as much as a crash.
</P>
<P>
   For example, junk that ``road warrior'' mind-set, read the
owner's manual and get used to how an SUV handles in the rain by
practicing in an empty parking lot when the pavement is slick.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, 100 percent of SUV drivers in an informal poll
taken Friday afternoon agreed that the Auto Club tips are good
ideas, especially for first-time owners. And the advice couldn't
come at a better time since SUVs are among the most popular
vehicles on the road; in fact, about one in three vehicles on the
road today is an SUV, minivan or light truck.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Wooler, who has been tooling around in a Ford Explorer
for the last five years, thinks the state should consider requiring
a special license or driving test for SUV owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different from driving a car,'' Wooler said. ``(SUV)
drivers also feel a false sense of security. Granted, it's heavier,
but it also takes longer to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   David Gutekunst drives a 1977 Toyota Land Cruiser and bought an
old SUV for his daughter because he thinks they're safer to drive.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, believes a refresher course in driving would be good
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad idea,'' he said. ``I think all drivers could
benefit from some instruction on safer driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with SUVs is that they have a higher ground
clearance, ostensibly for clearing logs and boulders out in the
boondocks. Realistically, though, the biggest obstacle faced by
most of the SUVs in Los Angeles are shopping center speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their chic design is also their Achilles' heel since they
are more likely to roll over than closer-to-the-ground sedans.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs have a rollover rate of 98 deaths per million registered
vehicles, vs. 44 fatalities per million registered vehicles for all
other vehicle types, according to statistics compiled by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. About 60 percent of
SUV occupants killed during crashes in 1997 died in rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers the vehicle may
roll over or go out of control and crash,'' said safety
administration spokesman Tim Hurd. ``So it's always a good idea to
learn as much as you can about the vehicle you are driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Using safety equipment like seat belts is a smart move, too, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home this point, the administration announced Friday it
is requiring that new SUVs must display an illustrated warning
label noting the vehicle has a higher rollover risk than standard
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   It must be placed on either the sun visor or driver-side window
and cautions drivers to ``avoid abrupt maneuvers and excessive
speed'' and to ``always buckle up.''
</P>
<P>
   The old warning contained only text but the new one gets the
message across with a graphic showing an SUV pitching over and a
passenger wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   These new labels are required on vehicles with a wheelbase of
110 inches or less starting in 2000, so it includes popular models
like the Ford Explorer and Jeep Cherokee. But vehicles like the
super-sized Chevrolet Suburban with a longer wheelbase are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. said that getting this kind of message out makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can raise awareness of drivers about the handling
and characteristics of a vehicle, that's a good thing,'' said
spokeswoman Jennifer Flake.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hylan says it does take some time to get used to the size
of a sport-utility vehicle, especially when it comes to parking and
making left turns at intersections.
</P>
<P>
   She's been driving her Ford Explorer since 1994 and loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to learn how to drive them. It's a spatial
relationship thing. But with a large vehicle like this you can see
clearly. And then you have to get three jobs to feed it,'' she
said. &QL;

NYC POLICE DENY TREND IN 3 SEPARATE SLASHINGS ON SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan woman who refused to give money to some
homeless women on the D subway train was cut on the face with a
razor Friday, in one of three slashing incidents on the subways,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other incidents, a morning commuter riding the No. 4
train on the Upper East Side was slashed on the face after being
set upon by a gang of nearly 20 youths, and a 14-year-old boy was
cut on the face when a group of teen-agers attacked him on a
northbound F train near the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, police
said. None of the victims were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Although such assaults rarely occur in clusters, police
officials said the three incidents did not constitute a trend. The
slashings were unrelated, the officials said, adding that reports
of assaults within the subway system continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February, 64 assaults took place in subway cars
or on subway platforms, compared with 76 during the first two
months of last year, according to police statistics. There were
also two slayings in the subways this year, including the Jan. 3
death of Kendra Webdale, 32, who was pushed in front of an N train
in the 23rd Street station.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's first incident occurred around 2:30 a.m., shortly after
the Manhattan woman, Stephanie Eckert, 29, and her 30-year-old
roommate boarded a Manhattan-bound D train in Brooklyn, according
to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The women were on their way home to Red Square, an apartment
building on East Houston Street on the Lower East Side, when two
homeless women approached them and asked for some change, police
said. When the riders refused, another homeless woman, Vera Scott,
approached them and slashed Ms. Eckert in the face with a razor
blade, police said. It was unclear whether Ms. Scott, 69, knew the
other homeless women, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a Police
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The slashing occurred as the train was coming into a station
near Sara Delano Roosevelt Park, near Chrystie Street. When the
train stopped, several passengers rushed upstairs to seek help. Two
Parks Enforcement officers who were patrolling nearby took Ms.
Scott into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eckert was treated at New York University Downtown Hospital
and released, according to police. Ms. Scott was arrested on
charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police
said. A straight razor was found in her clothing, they said. Ms.
Scott has a minor criminal record for trespass, disorderly conduct
and petty larceny, said law enforcement officials, but she has not
been convicted of a crime since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old man was later slashed after boarding a southbound
No. 4 train at 125th Street around 9:30 a.m. The victim, Reynaldo
Figueroa, told detectives that a group of youths taunted him when
he entered the car; after shoving him around, one youth pulled out
what appeared to be a razor and slashed him across the face, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects fled when the train entered the subway station at
86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Figueroa then took a bus to
Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he was treated for a cut and
released.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, a 14-year-old boy was slashed as he rode a
northbound F train on his way home from Lafayette High School in
Brooklyn, police said. The boy was attacked by a group of 10 to 12
youths around 3:15 p.m., as the elevated train approached Smith and
Ninth Streets near the Gowanus Expressway. One of the youths pulled
out a razor blade and cut the boy across the face, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old suspect trying to flee with others from the train
was arrested by police officers standing on the platform there,
Detective Pentangelo said. He added that the suspect, Jason Smith,
of 300 Vernon Ave. in Brooklyn, was charged with assault and
criminal possession of a weapon, after officers found a razor blade
in his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, whom police identified as James Rogers, was taken to
Long Island College Hospital, where he was in stable condition,
police said.

SPORTS COLUMN: AN OUTSIDER PROVIDES THE INSIDE SCOOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last 10 seasons, Dermon Player has watched
March Madness from the outside. As the boys' basketball coach and
athletic director of the Riverside Church Hawks, Player's real
season was in the summer, when he took some of New York City's best
high school players and barnstormed the country. Three years ago
Player coached the Riverside team that was 67-1 in summer-league
competition. The team included the St. John's players Ron Artest,
Erick Barkley and Reggie Jessie.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Player, 31, came in from the cold and accepted an
invitation from Coach Mike Jarvis to join the St. John's coaching
staff. This was an odd but pragmatic marriage. Jarvis, who took
over the St. John's program last June, has been an ardent critic of
extensive summer-league competition and the often unsavory
relationships it fosters between street agents and hangers-on. But
as an outsider, with no New York roots, Jarvis made his first major
recruit for the Red Storm. Player would get the big-time coaching
experience he craved and the undergraduate degree he missed out on
when he left Long Island University after five semesters. St.
John's would get the entree to New York City's rich reservoir of
basketball talent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Player spoke passionately about the much-maligned Amateur
Athletic Union coaches who, in many ways, are the backbone of
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts at the AAU level,'' Player said. ``This isn't a
knock on high schools, but before a kid can be a great high school
player, someone had to take him at 9, 10, 11, 12 years old _ in
junior high school _ and teach him how to play and get him
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to the AAU's involvement with the young players
is rooted in jealousy and a lack of respect, he said. ``Lack of
respect from the NCAA,'' Player said. ``Lack of respect from other
high school coaches. Some people feel that the AAU programs are
ruining kids. The problem is not AAU coaches, it's the outside
people who just want to use the players to get what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is using everyone: St. John's is using Player for his
contacts and reassuring relationship with the players; Player is
using St. John's to be validated, and to earn a college degree. Of
course, everyone is using the players. While a 67-1 record sounds
impressive, a 68-game summer season that includes extensive travel
and tournament competition borders on sweatshop exploitation. And I
have often wondered how many of the Riverside Church players
consistently see the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   AAU coaches have been kept out of the college pipeline. The best
AAU coaches could be a humanizing bridge between big-time programs
and the players' communities. ``We're with the kids 365 days a
year,'' Player said. ``We deal with their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those 10 years, kids have slept in my house. I've taken
kids to movies. I've spent my last dollar. I remember once I had to
get on the train _ I didn't have a car _ to go get Stephon Marbury
to play a game in the city when he was 11 years old. We rode for
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of coaches who don't understand the players,''
he added. ``There are a lot of players who don't understand the
coaches. I help them understand the differences. Like, helping the
coach understand that maybe player X likes to dribble four or five
times. Maybe you don't appreciate that as a Division I head coach.
You think, That's flashy or that's showboating basketball. But if
that's what the kid brings to the table, you allow him to do that,
but make the player understand that you have to get results.''
</P>
<P>
   Player never thought he would be coaching at St. John's, and St.
John's _ perhaps Jarvis in particular _ probably never thought it
would hire a coach like Player. This could be one of those
arrangements that works beyond each party's mercenary expectations.
An instance where an institution and an individual serve as bridges
over a generation and a cultural gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't an easy decision for me,'' Player said. ``My love
for the kids, what I was bringing to the program and the community
was just as big as coming to a Division I program and working with
12 kids on scholarship who pretty much got their own set ways.
Still, I know where these kids come from, from being in the same
situation. I understand the little things people don't see in black
and white.''
</P>
<P>
   For Player, the basketball adjustment is secondary. ``It's not
so big a change,'' he said. ``The biggest thing I looked for was
more complicated Xs and Os. But it's not a complicated game. It's
just a matter of putting the ball in the basket and playing
defense.''

U.S. UNFAIRLY TYING IMAM TO TERROR SUSPECT, LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawyer for a Muslim clergyman in Arlington, Texas, accused
federal prosecutors in Manhattan Friday of slandering his client by
unfairly linking him to the suspected terrorist activities of Osama
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, the lawyer said that his client, Moataz Al-Hallak, the
imam of the Islamic Society of Arlington, had no involvement with
bin Laden or his group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice it to say the government is well aware that there
exists absolutely no credible evidence which connects Imam
Al-Hallak to any crime at any time or any place,'' wrote the
lawyer, Stanley Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his letter ``a formal protest against the government's
recent attack upon my client's good name both in and out of
court,'' Cohen threatened in the letter to sue the government if
the accusations against Al-Hallak continue.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, Herbert Hadad, would
not comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's letter comes about a month after Al-Hallak's name was
first mentioned publicly in conjunction with the investigation of
bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been charged in the 1998
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak has not been charged in the case. But in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, a prosecutor from Ms. White's office told Judge
Leonard Sand that the government had specific concerns about
Al-Hallak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moataz Al-Hallak has served as a contact between members of
the bin Laden organization,'' the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald,
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald made his comments during an explanation to Sand of
why the government was blocking one of the defendants in the
terrorism case, Wadih el Hage, from calling Al-Hallak from jail.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to
kill Americans abroad and lying in the federal investigation, said
he had wanted to speak to the imam in an effort to win his support
for a bail application. El Hage, who had lived in Arlington, had
been a member of Al-Hallak's mosque, and in court, el Hage's lawyer
had portrayed Al-Hallak as a purely religious figure.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, Fitzgerald, disputed that, saying, ``This is
a case about murder and conspiracy to murder, not about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone Friday, Al-Hallak declined to comment on the
letter. In an earlier interview, he said that he condemned
violence, and that he had no idea ``what they are talking about,''
referring to Fitzgerald's comments in court.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, which was addressed to Fitzgerald, Cohen
indicated that he believed that the attack on Hallak was part of a
calculated effort by the government to punish Muslims and to
repress their ``speech, association and religious practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your recent attack upon this highly respected imam is as
untrue as it is unprecedented,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has represented other prominent Muslim defendants in
Manhattan, including Mohammed Abu Marzook, the Hamas political
leader jailed in New York during an extradition battle with Israel
before he was released to Jordan; and Ismail Elbarasse, a
Palestinian who had been jailed for eight months for refusing to
testify before a federal grand jury investigating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said by phone that he was also concerned about comments
about his client that he said were made out of court by federal
officials who were quoted anonymously in news articles in Texas and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These not-for-attribution comments have made their way into
public newspapers throughout the country,'' Cohen said, adding that
they had caused Al-Hallak and his family ``great harm and personal
pain.''

LORD DENNING, POPULAR BRITISH JUDGE, DIES AT 100  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lord Denning, whose bent for favoring the relaxed
precepts of common sense over the starchier ones of common law
earned him the nickname the People's Judge, died Friday at
Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to prominence as the person in charge of the inquiry
into the 1963 sex and politics scandal caused when John Profumo,
the secretary of war in Harold Macmillan's government, lied to
Parliament about the affair he was conducting with Christine
Keeler, a model who also was sleeping with a Soviet diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Denning's populist appeal became fixed in the public mind when
one of the young women involved, Mandy Rice-Davies, said, ``He's
one of the nicest judges I know.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to build a reputation as the champion of the
underdog, with decisions protecting individuals from exploitation
by bureaucrats, large companies and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Sir Freddie Laker to compete with British Airways,
paving the way to low-cost trans-Atlantic fares. He ruled that
couples living together could have the same rights as married ones,
and broadened women's power to make claims on their husbands'
wealth in divorce cases. He favored legal aid for the middle
classes, and he eased the path for disabled veterans to obtain
compensation from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   But later in life he showed another side when the underdogs were
blacks or immigrants, student demonstrators or antinuclear
protesters, or Irish Republican sympathizers arrested on charges of
terrorism. He ridiculed the claims of police abuse levied by the
Guildford 4 and the Birmingham 6, two groups charged with fatal pub
bombings in 1974 but later exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   The ``good English common sense'' that he said guided his
thinking left him out of step when individuals increasingly
challenged the authority of the police. To accept the notion that
police might lie or set up suspects for conviction would, he said,
``open up an appalling vista.''
</P>
<P>
   Denning was obliged to withdraw from publication a book he wrote
in the early 1980s because it questioned the capacity of immigrants
to serve on juries and the impartiality of nonwhite Britons. He
argued, unconvincingly, that the perceived slurs were
misinterpretations, and he retired reluctantly in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   His maverick approach as an appeals court judge led to many
reversals from the Law Lords, but he took them philosophically.
``It's not the first time, and probably won't be the last,'' he
said after one.
</P>
<P>
   He gazed out at courtrooms from beneath his gray wig with a
mischievous grin, and he delivered verdicts in story-telling mode,
introducing one, ``It was bluebell time in Kent.''
</P>
<P>
   To one admiring lawyer, Peter Carter-Ruck, Denning ``steered the
law towards the administration of justice rather than the
administration of the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lord Hailsham, one of the lord chancellors he served under,
was less charitable. ``The trouble with Tom Denning,'' he said,
``is that he's always remaking the law, and we never know where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair recalled Friday how Denning treated
him as a young lawyer: ``He was always the soul of courtesy,
helping out the young barrister or someone with a hopeless case,
and sometimes I was both.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Thompson Denning was born on Jan. 23, 1899, in
Whitchurch, Hampshire, the son of a wool-cloth maker. He studied at
Magdalen College, Oxford, on a scholarship, earning honors in
mathematics and law.
</P>
<P>
   He was called to the bar in 1923, and in a rapid rise, he ``took
silk,'' gaining the robes of the upper ranking of king's or queen's
counsel, in 1938. So young was he on joining the High Court in 1944
that he was known as the Baby Judge.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the House of Lords in 1957 and five years later
became master of the Rolls, a 15th-century title given to the
third-ranking justice in Britain's court system.
</P>
<P>
   Denning resisted stepping down at the usual retirement age of
75, saying, ``I have all the Christian virtues _ except
resignation.'' When he retired at 83, he had served 38 years. ``I
want to go while I'm still at my peak,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   A nonsmoker and teetotaler, he ascribed his longevity to a
healthful lifestyle and a fondness for fish and chips. Asked once
how he remained so astute and alert in old age, he said: ``By
eating plain English food. I don't want any of that French
stuff.'' &QL;

CANCELED BONUS MAY SPARK LUGGAGE WOES, AMWEST WORKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America West baggage handlers say luggage problems may soar
after an announcement this week that they won't be getting last
year's bonus pay because they voted for a union in January.
</P>
<P>
   The airline gives AWArd Pay to non-union employees, and last
year passed out $7.2 million to about 7,200 workers, with payments
totaling about 5 percent of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we earned this money,'' baggage handler Jon Davis
said, adding that the 2,200 fleet service workers met their service
goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for the second consecutive year, America West ranked
first among the 10 largest carriers for the fewest mishandled bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be Number 1 next year, I can assure you of
that,'' said Davis, who got $700 last year and expected a little
more this year.
</P>
<P>
   America West declined comment Friday on complaints from the
fleet service workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the fact a majority of Fleet Service workers have
recently voted for the Transport Workers Union, the Total Pay
Programs that will apply to the non-union non-represented employees
will not apply to you at this time,'' Bruce Johnson, senior vice
president of human resources, said in a letter Tuesday to the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America West is appealing the union vote, accusing
the TWU of engaging in illegal activities during the election. A
National Mediation Board decision on the appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage handler Pat Rezler, a union organizer, said the company
is talking out both sides of its mouth, saying workers can't have
the bonus pay because they joined a union but at the same time
claiming the vote was illegal and there is no union.
</P>
<P>
   Rezler and Davis say the workers are so angry about being denied
the bonus pay that they may retaliate by misdirecting baggage or
just taking their time unloading luggage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rezler, who figures he's losing out on about $1,500, is
discouraging retaliation or a work slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The TWU also is telling workers not to engage in a sickout
today, which has been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   Bags are supposed to be on the luggage carousel within 14
minutes of a flight's arrival, but some workers might not push
themselves to accomplish that goal, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage handlers are among the lowest paid America West workers
and there is a very high rate of turnover, Rezler said. The pay
ranges from about $7 to 10.71 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up,'' said Davis, who is looking forward to
graduating from Arizona State University in May so he can leave
baggage handling behind.
</P>
<P>
   America West's flight attendants also are fighting for bonus pay
they feel they're entitled to after voting in a union four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants filed a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Phoenix against America West in 1996 in an effort
to force the company to award bonus pay to the flight attendants.
The lawsuit also seeks $250,000 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit still has not been settled, and the fight over the
bonus pay remains part of the AFA's contract dispute with America
West.
</P>
<P>
   The TWU is not planning to file suit over the bonus pay,
according to Rezler. &QL;

TERRY POPS TO TOP OF NATION'S ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a thick March afternoon four years ago, Jason Terry, a senior
guard at Seattle's Franklin High, faced O'Dea in a playoff game
before a sparse crowd at Washington's Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   All skin and limb, Terry scored 12 of his 18 points in the
fourth quarter. He rebounded like a center, he ran the offense, he
disrupted on defense, and he led cheers during his brief respites
on the bench. Franklin won _ it would eventually capture the state
title _ as Terry did everything but sell popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   That came an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Terry showered and dressed in a goofy green
concessionaire's uniform _ it included a maroon cap resembling a
cheap fez _ and sold popcorn during the evening event, Arizona
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Terry is his old sale _ err, self. An Arizona
senior, he's one of the best players in the nation, a first-team
All-American candidate and a Wooden Award finalist. Today he's
expected to be named Pac-10 Player of the Year, edging UCLA's Baron
Davis, who has been the league's best lately but can't match
Terry's season-long excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Terry leads the conference in scoring (22 ppg), assists (5.67),
steals (2.67) and leadership. He's shooting 84 percent from the
foul line, 39.3 percent from the 3-point line and has made the
game-breaking basket in five victories, including a Jan. 28
conquest of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the featured guy, so I've had to do everything, like
my senior year in high school,'' said Terry, who spent the 1997-98
seasons on the bench behind Mike Bibby. ``It's a big
responsibility, but I think I've earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the reason Arizona is 21-6 and fighting for a high seed in
the NCAA Tournament entering today's Senior Day showdown with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Without Terry, Arizona is Arizona State or Oregon _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one thing that separates them from us is Jason
Terry,'' Ducks coach Ernie Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry was a marquee recruit at Franklin. But no one, not even
Arizona coach Lute Olson, believed he'd be as good as Ronnie Lester
(Iowa), Steve Kerr, Khalid Reeves, Damon Stoudamire, Bibby or any
other guard Olson has coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, he belongs in that class,'' Olson said. ``No one
has done it better than JT. His improvement has been miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, who wears knee-high socks and slept in his uniform the
night before the 1997 NCAA title game, has even impressed his
competition _ namely, Davis. If the season ended next week, perhaps
Davis would snatch the league's highest honor; he has been
brilliant in the stretch. But evaluate them on a season-long basis,
and the choice is as easy as selling popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves it,'' Davis said. ``He's been doing it all year. I
do think we're similar in that we don't like to lose. You can see
it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for our other postseason awards, the napkin please...
</P>
<P>
   All-American (first five): Duke's Elton Brand; Utah's Andre
Miller; Miami-Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak; Auburn's Chris Porter; and
Terry.
</P>
<P>
   All-American (second five): Ohio State's Scoonie Penn; Michigan
State's Mateen Cleaves; Miami's Tim James; Connecticut's Rip
Hamilton; and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ That's right, no Trajan Langdon, who was Duke's
fourth-best player. Porter's numbers aren't first-team quality, but
his impact is. Miller is the nation's best all-around player, a
better rebounder than most forwards and a tenacious defensive
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Player of the Year: Arizona's Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ Utah's Miller is a close second, Szczerbiak third.
Take away the best player from all the top teams, and Arizona
suffers most.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Auburn's Cliff Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ Utah's Rick Majerus, UC Santa Barbara's Bob Williams,
Ohio State's Jim O'Brien and Miami's Leonard Hamilton also had
great seasons.
</P>
<P>
   All Pac-10: Arizona center A.J. Bramlett and Terry; Davis;
Arizona State forward Bobby Lazor and guard Eddie House; Stanford
forward Mark Madsen and guard Art Lee; Cal guard Thomas Kilgore;
Washington center Todd MacCulloch; and USC center Brian Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ Kilgore and Scalabrine played well in the stretch and
earned the final two spots, although the coaches probably won't
think so. Players who didn't make the cut: Washington's Donald
Watts, Oregon's Alex Scales, Oregon State's Deaundra Tanner and
Arizona State's Mike Batiste. No team with six league wins (ASU)
deserves three all-conference spots.
</P>
<P>
   All Pac-10 freshmen: Arizona's Michael Wright and Richard
Jefferson; UCLA's Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush; and Washington's
Senque Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 Freshman of the Year: Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ He's averaging 14 points, 8.7 rebounds, shooting 56
percent from the field and has been an impact performer all season.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 coach of the Year: Stanford's Mike Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Comment _ It was Oregon State's Eddie Payne until the Beavers
went 1-8 down the stretch. It was Olson until the Wildcats were
swept in the Bay Area. That leaves Montgomery, who guided Stanford
to a superb season without three of his top-10 players. Incredibly,
he's never won the award.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Baron Davis will be the third player picked in the
NBA draft, behind Rhode Island's Lamar Odom and Maryland's Steve
Francis. &QL;

ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT PACIFIC LUMBER DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the first half of last year, the Pacific
Lumber Co. surprised state forestry inspectors by obeying the
rules. Then, officials say, the company reverted to its old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Workers used heavy equipment near the nests of spotted owls, the
officials say, destroying the endangered birds' roosting area.
Loggers also drove across a riverbed rather than build the culverts
required by law to protect waters where threatened and endangered
fish spawn. They left slash piles along the banks of another river,
again threatening delicate fish habitat. They allowed a fire to
burn in a protected zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever count fish in a creel?'' asked Ken Nielson, the
California Department of Forestry's deputy chief of forest practice
enforcement, when asked to count Pacific Lumber's violations over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber amassed 16 violations last year, when it was
supposed to be on its best behavior. It was operating with a
conditional license for having amassed more than 100 violations in
1996 and 1997, not including violations made by subcontractors on
the company's property.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, state officials called a halt. In November, Pacific
Lumber Co. became the first logging company in California history
to have its timber license suspended.
</P>
<P>
   So environmental groups and others who have kept close watch on
Pacific Lumber for nearly 15 years do not believe the company can
live up to an agreement it signed on Monday when it sold California
and the federal government 10,000 acres of ancient redwood groves
250 miles north of here for $480 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal insures that the irreplaceable groves of old
redwoods in the Headwaters forest will be preserved, critics worry
about another part of the deal, a 50-year habitat conservation plan
to protect endangered species. That plan will govern how and where
Pacific Lumber cuts trees on the rest of its 211,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   To protect endangered species like the Northern spotted owl, the
coho salmon and the marbled murrelet, Pacific Lumber has to abide
by rules set by government wildlife biologists. But critics of the
company say it cannot be trusted. After it was acquired by Maxxam
Corp. of Houston in a $900 million hostile takeover in 1985 led by
the billionaire Charles Hurwitz, it began logging aggressively,
tripling its harvest to pay off junk bonds used in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, says that only
by watching the company's every move will environmental groups save
the nearly extinct bird and fish species on Pacific Lumber's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might actually do things that are illegal and we'll just
have to monitor that,'' Pope said. ``We will be working very
closely with the State of California to see that they do follow the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Pacific Lumber, John Campbell, said that the
company, which had its license conditionally reinstated a week ago,
already was doing a great deal to remedy its record. He said the
company had hired an outside firm to make recommendations and had
implemented all of them, including increasing training, doubling
the number of its compliance teams, which monitor the operations of
both the employees and outside contractors, and giving the monitors
the authority to halt all operations if something is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for absolute compliance with all the rules and
regulations,'' said Campbell, who contended that last year's
violations could be attributed to workers' being distracted by
Earth First protesters ``running around the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very nasty accident where a young man was killed,''
he said, referring to David Chain, an Earth First protester crushed
by a falling tree, ``and I think our people were not as focused as
they should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hayes, counsel to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, said
that the department planned to hire an outside monitor whose sole
duty would be to watch whether Pacific Lumber deviated from the
habitat conservation plan. ``After the incident in the fall,''
Hayes said, ``when the company had its license pulled and had
egregious problems, that suggested to us that we needed to have
enforcement and monitoring and liability that was a cut above
everything we had ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are watching Pacific Lumber these days. In Eureka,
Calif., a law clinic has devoted itself to filing claims against
the company. Three of the lawsuits are by homeowners who blame
Pacific Lumber's logging for mudslides that destroyed seven homes.
The Environmental Protection Information Center, based in
Garberville, on the southern edge of Pacific Lumber's base in
Humboldt County, said it planned to step up its already vigilant
watch over the company. So does the Bay Area Coalition for
Headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concern over the habitat conservation plan is that
it grants so-called ``incidental take'' permits. Those permits
absolve a company from blame if it ``incidentally'' destroys the
habitat of endangered species while following the approved plan.
Environmentalists call the permits a loophole that will allow
Pacific Lumber to destroy habitat, incidentally or not.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also concerned that Pacific Lumber will rush to
harvest in areas that will probably be declared off-limits in the
habitat conservation plan within five years, when watershed
analyses are completed. ``You just know they're going to run out
and start cutting trees,'' said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the
Environmental Protection Information Center, which may sue over the
habitat conservation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Passoff, a spokesman for the Bay Area Coalition to Save
Headwaters, said that perhaps the biggest reason Pacific Lumber was
so mistrusted was Hurwitz, whom environmentalists consider public
enemy No. 1. They point to a case sent to a judge in Houston last
week, in which the federal government accused Hurwitz of
mismanaging a failed Houston savings and loan association in the
1980s whose bailout cost taxpayers $1.6 billion as proof that he
mismanaged companies for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just environmentalists _ nobody trusts Hurwitz,''
Passoff said. ``That's why he is being sued by employees,
shareholders, government agencies, local landowners and
environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz does not grant interviews. But until the Headwaters
forest deal was completed, lawyers defending him against the
federal charges of reckless banking practices had called that suit
a politically motivated outgrowth of confrontations between him and
environmentalists over the future of Headwaters.

HOT AUTOS LEAVE HONEST BUYERS COLD
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
When James and Geneva Gooden drove their 1994 Chevy S-10 off a
Glendale used car lot, they didn't bargain for a wild three-month
ride down the road to despair.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's what the Glendale couple got, though, rolling headlong
into an auto theft ring that sneaked trade-ins off Tempe Dodge's
car lot and sold them to unwitting dealerships. Those dealers in
turn sold the stolen cars to honest customers like the Goodens.
</P>
<P>
   The result: As police began unraveling the scam, Tempe Dodge
sued _ the customers _ to recover the vehicles, without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last thing the Goodens could afford.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodens live on a tight single income supporting four kids,
two of them disabled. This was their only vehicle, and they didn't
have the money to buy another.
</P>
<P>
   If they lost the truck, they might still be on the hook for the
loan. Money for a lawyer was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   They were, in Geneva Gooden's words, ``devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Goodens' story finally found a happier ending this
week, Carrie Barnes of Chino Valley doesn't know whether she'll be
as fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said she and her husband, a Chino Valley police sergeant,
are trying to hang onto a 1994 Ford Explorer they bought from Phoe
nix's ABC Nissan in December. As it did with the Goodens, Tempe
Dodge is suing to take the Explorer back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for doing that is not to punish the consumer,''
insisted Doug Tobler, a lawyer representing Tempe Dodge. Tobler
said state law requires him to name whoever has the vehicle in
order to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tempe Dodge sued, it asked the dealerships to pay Tempe
Dodge for the cars and trucks, Tobler said. A few dealerships bit.
At least six didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd much prefer to take the action against the other
dealers,'' Tobler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hegyi of the Arizona Attorney General's consumer fraud unit
said there are legal ways to spare the consumers by shifting the
focus to the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealers and lenders ought to be reasonable and take the
consumer into account in all of this,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Zemek, director of trade practice for the Better Business
Bureau, said it makes good business sense for retailers to try to
resolve disputes in favor of customers who are not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Police Detective John Bier began to unravel the scam in
November. It started when Tempe Dodge realized it was missing a
used 1998 pickup, did a registration search and found it had been
registered in the name of someone named Anthony Leone.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the truck stolen. Bier learned in December that a
Peoria dealership bought the truck for $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Tempe police suspect the con worked: a former
employee of Tempe Dodge drove the car off the lot. An accomplice
filled out paperwork asking the state Motor Vehicle Division to
issue a duplicate title. He took the paperwork to an MVD office
and, posing as the real title holder, got a duplicate title.
</P>
<P>
   The duplicate title was transferred to Leone, and Leone took the
vehicle to a dealership to be sold. The group split the money.
</P>
<P>
   Leone, 51, was arrested in Janu ary and booked on a single fraud
count in connection with the auto theft. He told investigators
there were other cars.
</P>
<P>
   Bier told Tempe Dodge to take inventory. When it did, it found a
half-dozen other vehicles missing and the hunt was on. By the time
the vehicles were located, however, most had already been sold by
other dealerships to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodens bought their S-10 in November from the Used Car Mega
Store in Glendale. They paid $6,878.75, putting down $1,000 in cash
and financing the rest through WFS Financial.
</P>
<P>
   When they found out about a month later that it was stolen, they
asked the Used Car Mega Store to work it out with Tempe Dodge. The
dealers didn't. Then Tempe Dodge sued the Goodens and five other
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Gooden personally went before Superior Court Commis
sioner Robert Budoff last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `How would Tempe Dodge feel if the shoe was on the
other foot?' '' Geneva said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a 1919 law, Budoff con cluded that ``good faith and
honesty of purpose in purchasing the auto mobile is immaterial.''
He ordered the Goodens to turn the truck over to Tempe Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodens turned their atten tion to the $5,000-plus auto loan
they still owed WFS Financial.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, they got some help.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a reporter called WFS' California headquarters
this week, the firm sent the Goodens back to the Used Car Mega
Store where they were permitted to pick out another truck.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodens _ more than 60 days after the nightmare began _
drove away in a 1994 Dodge Dakota priced slightly more than the
S-10. It cost them nothing extra, though they were still haggling
with the dealership Friday to get new license tags for the truck.
The original loan was transferred to the Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Barneses haven't been nearly so lucky yet. They bought their
1994 Ford Explorer from ABC Nissan in December in a deal that left
them with a $15,800 loan.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, they were told they'd bought a stolen truck.
Feeling that she was getting no satisfaction from ABC Nissan,
Carrie Barnes hired a lawyer for $500. Tempe Dodge sued, the
lawyers talked and ABC Nissan assigned its lawyer to represent the
Barneses.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is pending in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   A deal may be in the works, Barnes said, but she's been warned
to be patient because ``it could be weeks, maybe months'' before an
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Plitt, counsel for ABC Nissan, said he has ``offered just
about every imaginable proposal'' to Tempe Dodge to remove the
Barneses from the suit and leave them with clear title to the
Explorer. Taking the couple out of the loop would leave ABC Nissan
and Tempe Dodge to settle up between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Tempe Dodge) recognize, as well, that we need to get
these people out of it,'' Plitt said. ``The people who don't need
to be the victims are the Barneses.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, meanwhile, wants to be reimbursed for what the mess has
cost her in long-distance calls, trips to Phoenix and the $500
lawyer's fee. Though Plitt guaranteed Thurs day that ``they will
not be out of pocket in this case, period,'' Barnes was left
wondering how they be came a target to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is just shame ful, that they can get away with
this,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: As the dealers haggled this week, Tempe police
arrested two more people in connection with the scheme: Johnny
Campbell, 43, and Dawuud Abdul-Aziz, 34, both of whom were booked
on eight fraud counts. Bier said Campbell is a former Tempe Dodge
employee who quit his job on the same January day that Leone was
arrested by Phoenix police. &QL;

IN RESTORING PARK, NEW YORK CITY DIGS CAREFULLY INTO ITS PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A nondescript chain-link fence separates New York
City's present from its past. On one side, people hustle to the
subway stations and soaring office buildings of lower Manhattan. On
the other, archeologists on their knees dig by hand through the
historically fertile soil of City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   They have uncovered pieces of the long clay pipes popular in the
18th and 19th centuries, a coin from the Dutch East Indies from
1806, shards of pottery, scattered bits of human bone. The starkest
juxtaposition of then and now was found a couple of weeks ago: less
than five feet from a well-traveled sidewalk along Chambers Street,
workers came upon the partial skeletal remains of two bodies from
another century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both laid out in the same way,'' Marilyn London said
the other day, her blue hard hat more suggestive of a construction
worker than the physical anthropologist that she is. ``One has its
hands crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   In late January a group of archeologists, equipped with sifting
screens and a command of the city's history, quietly brought their
talents to the 10-acre park that surrounds City Hall. They are
essentially an advance team, assigned to make sure that a $12
million renovation of the park does not disturb the buried legacy
of a city.
</P>
<P>
   It is a legitimate concern. The earth beneath the grass in some
sections provides a kind of tablet of the city's raucous past, said
Michael Wallace, who with Edwin G. Burrows is co-author of
``Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'' (Oxford University
Press, 1998). ``There is probably no place else in the city where
there is such a dense agglomeration from past events,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one time this former sheep meadow lay on the young town's
northern outskirts, set aside by elders as an unofficial dumping
ground for the poor, the diseased, the criminal. An almshouse was
built here in 1736, intended for thieves, rogues, unruly servants
and ``Poor Needy Persons and Idle Wandering Vagabonds.'' Here too
was the looming Bridewell, a jail that one newspaper said was for
``the great number of vagabonds daily sculking about this city.''
</P>
<P>
   But the park, part of what was then known as ``the Commons,''
also came to represent a community's thirst for liberty, free
speech and social justice. The Sons of Liberty paraded here, often
taunting their British occupiers who were stationed in barracks on
the grounds. And with the completion of City Hall in 1811, the
park's reputation as the place for public, even violent, protest
was secured, attracting massive demonstrations on everything from
abolition to a hike in the cost of flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was both a place for civic castoffs and a place for civic
rallies,'' Wallace said. ``It is drenched in many varieties of
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the park's history _ and its inclusion in a landmark
district with the African Burial Ground, just north of Chambers
Street _ the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission finds itself
with considerable input in the Parks Department's project, which is
scheduled to be completed in the fall. Those intertwined missions
have made for a careful choreography between landscape architects
charged with recreating the park's 19th century elegance and the
archeologists charged with preserving its ghostly remnants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing an archeological dig here,'' Jennifer Raab,
chairwoman of the landmarks commission said. ``At this point, we're
trying to protect an area that should not be disturbed. And it's
our goal to be ahead of'' the construction workers.

</P>
<P>
   The archeologists first poke and examine the ground, digging
test pits in various locations in the park but giving particular
scrutiny to the northwestern corner, a grassy area left relatively
undisturbed by progress. For example, in that corner they have dug
by hand a trench _ 110 feet long, three feet wide and
two-and-a-half-feet deep _ along the perimeter where a Colonial-era
fence is to go, then poured the dirt through sifting screens.
</P>
<P>
   When the archeologists find nothing of interest, or if they
determine that the ground has been previously disturbed, the
construction workers are generally free to erect a section of the
fence, lay down the bluestone path, or plant the ornate lamppost.
</P>
<P>
   But when the archeologists find a piece of the city's past _ the
foundation for an 18th century dispensary, for example _ in the
path of construction, the chief landscape architect, George
Vellonakis, modifies the design accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   With sifting screens that catch anything larger than
one-quarter-inch wide, the archeologists have come across their
share of curious. On Thursday, for example, they found a coin that
was apparently struck to promote a temperance movement in the
mid-19th century. Its inscription reads: ``Tis here we pledge
perpetual hate to all that can intoxicate.''
</P>
<P>
   They have also come across a couple of old rubbish pits _
potential mother lodes for archeologists, who generally believe
that pottery shards, animal bones and other debris can provide a
sociological snapshot of a culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubbish is the unvarnished, unbiased story of what people
are,'' explained Dr. Petar Glumac, the archeologist hired by the
city to oversee the project. In keeping with his passionate
feelings on the subject, Glumac keeps an unearthed piece of a clay
pipe in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Sutphin, an archeologist for the landmarks commission,
said that the most sensitive aspect of the project centers on human
remains. From the beginning, she and her colleagues say, they have
known of the great potential for finding bones and bodies in the
clay, particularly in the northwestern corner.
</P>
<P>
   The remains could be of British soldiers, American Revolutionary
soldiers, military prisoners quietly executed, and poor or diseased
people who died, were wrapped in shrouds and buried in the shadow
of an almshouse.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 200 pieces of human bone have been found
scattered throughout the park. Ms. London, the physical
anthropologist, has wrapped them in acid-free tissue paper and kept
them in archival boxes _ at first in her hotel suite, because she
had nowhere else to secure them.
</P>
<P>
   When city officials learned of this arrangement of necessity, in
the presence of a reporter, they accommodated Ms. London by
providing her with office space near the park. They also said that
the fragments will be preserved, along with those that have been
unearthed during other construction projects over the years.
</P>
<P>
   More delicate was the recent discovery of the two partial
skeletons buried rather shallowly along the edge of Chambers
Street. Although the bodies have been disturbed, Ms. London said,
``this is probably their primary burial place.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is no clue to who they were or when they died
_ no telling shred of clothing, no coffin nails, no coins that
might have been placed on their eyes. And because of the nature of
this project, there is no plan for further inquiry, a policy that
conflicts with the understandable curiosity of the archeologists
who uncovered them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, pieces of wood protect the exposed skeletons from the
vagaries of March weather. The design for the perimeter fence will
be adjusted accordingly. And soon the remains of two nameless
witnesses to New York's past will lay again beneath the grass and
footpaths of City Hall Park.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The image of the two Rudys _ Rudy Giuliani, the
tough-talking, take-no-prisoners mayor, and Rudy Crew, the canny
but charming schools chancellor _ standing shoulder to shoulder in
the Blue Room of City Hall, celebrating the latest educational
achievement for New York City public schools, is a familiar one.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the peaceful performance there have often been stirrings
of disagreement between the two men on issues from school safety to
social promotion. But for three-and-a-half years, they were largely
able to find common ground, maintaining a relationship that was
mutually beneficial, politically advantageous and often more than
cordial.
</P>
<P>
   They met at City Hall most Monday mornings, sometimes sharing
cigars, and the regular talks seemed to ease the tension that has
historically developed between New York City's mayors and its
semi-autonomous chancellors. But associates of Crew's now say the
chancellor was privately starting to chafe at what he saw as the
mayor's intrusions into his territory, and that friction burst into
the open three days ago when Crew abruptly threatened to resign
over the mayor's plan to use city money to finance private-school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Crew sees vouchers as a direct assault on public education, and
as leader of the nation's largest public school system he can
hardly sanction them. To Giuliani, his proposal is a modest attempt
to provide children in poor neighborhoods a choice beyond often
troubled public schools. It would also help solidify his
conservative credentials in national Republican circles and
potentially win him support among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has arisen as the mayor is contemplating life
beyond City Hall and as Crew has confided to some aides and friends
that he is weary of the balancing act, and has even mused about
what he might do next.
</P>
<P>
   Crew was in seclusion Friday, staying with friends and nursing
an ear infection and lingering flu, said his spokeswoman, Chiara
Coletti. She said the chancellor stood by his threat to resign if
the mayor wins Board of Education approval of a voucher plan,
adding that it could take weeks before the board votes on such a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coletti said that the board was likely to discuss the issue
in an executive session before next Wednesday's regular board
meeting. But she said the meeting would be closed to the public
because the board would be discussing the legal issue of whether
vouchers could be approved without the consent of the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coletti said Crew and his closest aides were baffled by the
mayor's aggressive campaign to push a voucher plan through the
Board of Education. Crew, who left New York on Feb. 26 for
California, where he was speaking at a conference of early
childhood educators, knew that Giuliani would be voicing his
support for vouchers ``out of town,'' and had heard ``through the
grapevine'' that Giuliani had approached board members, asking what
they thought.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I honestly know that the chancellor thought
this wasn't going to be pushed to a confrontation. I think he was
quite surprised that the issue was sort of called.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dispute is in many ways characteristic of the relationship
between mayors and chancellors in a city that has gone through
eight chancellors since Frank Macchiarola left in 1983. Crew, who
was embraced by Giuliani as a compromise choice in the fall of
1995, has lasted longer than anyone since Macchiarola, who stayed
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous mayors, Giuliani said he would have preferred to
have direct control over the schools. But short of that, the mayor
said he had found in Crew a chancellor who agreed with the board
outlines of his desire to inject more accountability into the
school system. Their disagreements until now have been tempered by
what they say is their ability to agree to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani insisted on police control of school safety, Crew
managed to preserve the authority of principals over their
buildings. The chancellor refused to let high-school yearbooks be
used as a source of photos for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Crew aggressively lobbied against taxpayer-financed charter
schools, saying he could not support them unless he controlled
them. But once the law was adopted, the chancellor said he would
create his own.
</P>
<P>
   But vouchers, which raise so many fundamental political and
educational issues, are different. Crew and Giuliani locked horns
on vouchers once before, in the fall of 1996, when Crew refused to
help the mayor send 1,000 children from the city's worst public
schools to private schools. The mayor went on to help create a
private scholarship program, but found financing among Wall Street
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But for Crew, the mayor's insistence on renewing the voucher
debate _ even going so far as to lobby the Board of Education to
defy the chancellor's opposition to vouchers _ could simply be the
last straw. It comes on the heels of Gov. George Pataki's decision
to create a commission to investigate school construction and
spending in New York City _ a move that infuriated Crew.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, persistent rumors have floated that his
name has been circulated at the Department of Education in
Washington; that he was suggested as a candidate for the school
superintendent's job in Seattle, and that he has been approached to
run a suburban New York college.
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York with his wife, Kathy, from Tacoma, Wash.,
and still has ties to the West Coast. His ex-wife and teen-age
daughter live in Sacramento, Calif., where he has been teaching
urban education on and off since 1993, and Crew still owns a house
in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Coletti said Crew has made no moves to leave. ``There
have been numerous offers and inquiries,'' she said. ``He has not
entertained any of them.''

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The bullet-riddled bodies of three Americans
kidnapped last week by suspected Colombian guerrillas were
discovered Friday just across the border in Venezuela, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Freitas, 24, of Oakland, Calif., Ingrid Washinawatok,
41, of New York City, and Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, were
working on education projects with the U'wa Indians in northeastern
Colombia when they were snatched by armed men at a roadblock Feb.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said soldiers found their bound and blindfolded
bodies Friday in the Venezuelan hamlet of Guatalita. Tucked in the
underwear of one of the women was an American Express credit card
with Washinawatok's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs that they were tortured. The two women had
four bullet holes, and the man had six,'' said Col. Luis Tafur,
police chief in Arauca, a Colombian town not far from where the
bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said
that, according to available information, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia _ the country's largest Marxist rebel group,
known as the FARC _ was to blame for the Americans' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn the FARC in the strongest possible terms for this
barbaric terrorist act,'' McClenny said in a statement. .
</P>
<P>
   ``We also demand that the FARC accept responsibility for this
cold-blooded murder and turn over those of its members who
perpetrated this crime to be held accountable by the courts,''
McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken to the city of San Cristobal in Venezuela.
Their families had been notified, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters in Colombia, funds its
35-year-old civil war, in part, by kidnapping civilians and
demanding ransom payments.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans were members of Pacific Cultural Conservancy
International, a Hawaii-based indigenous-rights organization,
according to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. Freitas had worked with
the U'wa for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa have resisted the settlement of non-Indians as well as
efforts by Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Bakersfield, Calif., to
drill for oil on their land. In recent months, the Indians
reportedly have told FARC guerrillas to stay out of their
territory. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At the invitation of the U'wa, the Americans spent about two
weeks meeting with tribal elders in Arauca state, an oil-rich area
that is infested with guerrillas, said Ernesto Tagrilla, an U'wa
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional leaders received them warmly. They wanted to
know more about our culture, our needs, our problems and to that
way help to defend the U'wa people,'' Tagrilla told Radionet of
Bogota. ``They were on this mission when they were detained by the
FARC.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Americans were driving to a nearby airport Feb. 25 to
catch a flight to Bogota, they were snatched at a roadblock manned
by rebels of the FARC's 45th Front, according to Tafur, the police
chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were forced from their vehicle and taken to another
vehicle, and that's the last the U'wa community knows of their
whereabouts,'' Tagrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Radionet on Friday broadcast a scratchy tape recording made by
Colombian intelligence officials. On the tape, a man identified by
authorities as FARC 45th Front commander German Briceno Suarez,
says, ``Let her die'' in an apparent reference to one of the U.S.
captives.
</P>
<P>
   Briceno Suarez is the brother of the FARC's top military
strategist, Jorge ``Mono Joyjoy'' Briceno.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was genocide committed by the FARC,'' said Colombian army
Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the crimes remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Like the U'wa, the FARC has criticized U.S. oil companies for
``exploiting'' Colombia's natural resources. Another Colombian
rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, routinely bombs
oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota's Caracol Television speculated that the U'wa, one of
about 60 indigenous groups in Colombia, may have earned the wrath
of the FARC by refusing to support the guerrillas' cause.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana met late Friday with his
foreign minister, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, to discuss a
response to the killings. Pastrana began peace talks with the FARC
in January.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations have come under increased criticism in
Colombia and from Republicans in the U.S. Congress, who claim that
the FARC has no intention of giving up its arms or ending its
practice of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, nearly 100 Americans have been kidnapped by criminal
and rebel groups in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC is blamed for kidnapping three U.S. missionaries of the
New Tribes Mission in 1993 near the Panamanian border. All three
are believed to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the guerrilla organization kidnapped four U.S.
bird-watchers. All were released unharmed.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE WEIGHT OF WINTER RAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about now a certain winter weariness sets in, at least for
those of us who live in the country. Every morning and evening you
can feel the sun pushing back the margins of night, and it's a dull
soul who hasn't checked sunrise or sunset against his watch several
times by now, struck by how early the light comes and how late it
begins to go.
</P>
<P>
   But that just makes a day of heavy overcast and freezing rain
feel all the worse, more of an impairment than it would have been
when the sodden year was still shrinking. The rain falls as it has
all winter, over ice and snow, as if to make a none-too-subtle
point about the climate in this part of New York state, a point
that those of us who live here start to take seriously only about
now.
</P>
<P>
   The rain falls on frozen ground, and the barnyard looks
medieval, a vile compost tea brewing in every puddle. Where the
bird feeders hang, it looks as though we're running a goldfinch
feedlot. Sullen birds shoulder each other aside and seem to
squabble more than finches ordinarily do, which is constantly.
</P>
<P>
   The other day a mob of robins appeared in the lower pasture on a
southeastern slope where the ice cap had retreated. They moved like
shore birds across the frozen turf, stuttering forward and falling
back, not just that lone bird _ the first robin, sign of spring _
but a herd, as though there wouldn't be enough assurance in the
sight of only one.
</P>
<P>
   I filled the horses' water tank the other morning, and as I did
a pileated woodpecker cut across the hillside with a cry of
demented hilarity. On dry, cold mornings, the woodpecker goes to
work at early light stitching a row of holes in a hollow tree
trunk, waking the woods from hibernation, raising the sap in the
sugar maples.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing prognosticative about the pileated woodpecker's
presence, as far as I can tell. It lives here year round, and its
plumage doesn't seem to change, nor does its lunatic cry. Before
long, the woodpecker will begin trying to drill through the metal
roof of the barn the way it did last year. It will sound as though
the world were an empty 55-gallon drum with only the bird on the
outside, hammering away. The racket puzzles even the crows in the
ash trees, and they are foxed by nothing.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon the rain will let up, and the frost will leave the
ground as stealthily as it came. There will be yielding all around
and a sudden insistent adhesion in the barnyard. The urge to clean
away winter from the corners of the lawn, from the deep shade
beneath the hemlocks, will become irresistible. But all of this
hides somewhere on the next page of the calendar. The good news now
lies deep within the beehive, where the workers, their dead cast
aside into the melting snow, have set the queen laying eggs once
again.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The bullet-riddled bodies of three Americans
kidnapped last week by suspected Colombian guerrillas were
discovered just across the border in Venezuela, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Freitas, 24, of Oakland, Calif., Ingrid Washinawatok,
41, of New York City, and Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, were
working on education projects with the U'wa Indians in northeastern
Colombia when they were snatched by armed men at a roadblock Feb.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said soldiers found their bound and blindfolded
bodies Thursday in the Venezuelan hamlet of Guatalita. Tucked in
the underwear of one of the women was an American Express credit
card with Washinawatok's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs that they were tortured. The two women had
four bullet holes, and the man had six,'' said Col. Luis Tafur,
police chief in Arauca, a Colombian town not far from where the
bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said
that, according to available information, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia _ the country's largest Marxist rebel group,
known as the FARC _ was to blame for the Americans' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn the FARC in the strongest possible terms for this
barbaric terrorist act,'' McClenny said in a statement. .
</P>
<P>
   ``We also demand that the FARC accept responsibility for this
cold-blooded murder and turn over those of its members who
perpetrated this crime to be held accountable by the courts,''
McClenny said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken to the city of San Cristobal in Venezuela.
Their families had been notified, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters in Colombia, funds its
35-year-old civil war, in part, by kidnapping civilians and
demanding ransom payments.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans were members of Pacific Cultural Conservancy
International, a Hawaii-based indigenous-rights organization,
according to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. Freitas had worked with
the U'wa for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa have resisted the settlement of non-Indians as well as
efforts by Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Bakersfield, Calif., to
drill for oil on their land. In recent months, the Indians
reportedly have told FARC guerrillas to stay out of their
territory. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At the invitation of the U'wa, the Americans spent about two
weeks meeting with tribal elders in Arauca state, an oil-rich area
that is infested with guerrillas, said Ernesto Tagrilla, an U'wa
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional leaders received them warmly. They wanted to
know more about our culture, our needs, our problems and to that
way help to defend the U'wa people,'' Tagrilla told Radionet of
Bogota. ``They were on this mission when they were detained by the
FARC.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Americans were driving to a nearby airport Feb. 25 to
catch a flight to Bogota, they were snatched at a roadblock manned
by FARC rebels, according to Tafur, the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were forced from their vehicle and taken to another
vehicle, and that's the last the U'wa community knows of their
whereabouts,'' Tagrilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Radionet on Friday broadcast a scratchy tape recording made by
Colombian intelligence officials. On the tape, a man identified by
authorities as FARC commander German Briceno Suarez says, ``Let her
die'' in what officials said could be a reference to one of the
U.S. captives.
</P>
<P>
   Briceno Suarez is the brother of the FARC's top military
strategist, Jorge ``Mono Joyjoy'' Briceno.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was genocide committed by the FARC,'' said Colombian army
Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the crimes remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Like the U'wa, the FARC has criticized U.S. oil companies for
``exploiting'' Colombia's natural resources. Another Colombian
rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, routinely bombs
oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota's Caracol Television speculated that the U'wa, one of
about 60 indigenous groups in Colombia, may have earned the wrath
of the FARC by refusing to support the guerrillas' cause.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana met late Friday with his
foreign minister, Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, to discuss a
response to the killings. Pastrana began peace talks with the FARC
in January.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations have come under increased criticism in
Colombia and from Republicans in the U.S. Congress, who claim that
the FARC has no intention of giving up its arms or ending its
practice of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, nearly 100 Americans have been kidnapped by criminal
and rebel groups in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC is blamed for kidnapping three U.S. missionaries of the
New Tribes Mission in 1993 near the Panamanian border. All three
are believed to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the guerrilla organization kidnapped four U.S.
bird-watchers. All were released unharmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Working with nuclear secrets stolen from a U.S.
government laboratory, China has made a leap in the development of
nuclear weapons: the miniaturization of its bombs, according to
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing was unable to produce small warheads that could be launched
from a single missile at multiple targets and form the backbone of
a modern nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough that officials say was accelerated by the
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the mid-1980s,
officials said. But it was not detected until 1995, when American
experts analyzing Chinese nuclear test results found similarities
to America's most advanced miniature warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, government investigators had identified a
suspect, an American scientist at Los Alamos laboratory, where the
atomic bomb was first developed. The investigators also concluded
that Beijing was continuing to steal secrets from the government's
major nuclear weapons laboratories, which had been increasingly
opened to foreign visitors since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was told of the full extent of China's spying in
the summer of 1997, on the eve of the first U.S.-Chinese summit
meeting in eight years _ a meeting intended to dramatize the
success of President Clinton's efforts to improve relations with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say they took the allegations seriously;
as proof of this they cite Clinton's ordering the labs within six
months to improve security.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. officials assert that the White House sought to
minimize the espionage issue for policy reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conflicted with their China policy,'' said a U.S.
official, who like many others in this article spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``It undercut the administration's efforts to have a
strategic partnership with the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies the assertions. ``The idea that we tried
to cover up or downplay these allegations to limit the damage to
United States-Chinese relations is absolutely wrong,'' said Gary
Samore, the senior National Security Council official who handled
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a reconstruction by The New York Times reveals that
throughout the government, the response to the nuclear theft was
marked by delays, inaction and skepticism _ even though senior
intelligence officials regarded it as one of the most damaging spy
cases in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the FBI did not aggressively pursue the criminal
investigation of lab theft, U.S. officials said. Now, nearly three
years later, no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the secretary of energy, have government officials administered lie
detector tests to the main suspect, a Los Alamos computer scientist
who is Chinese-American. The suspect failed a test in February,
according to senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the Energy Department, officials waited more than a year to
act on the FBI's 1997 recommendations to improve security at the
weapons laboratories and restrict the suspect's access to
classified information, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's chief of intelligence, who raised the first
alarm about the case, was ordered last year by senior officials not
to tell Congress about his findings because critics might use them
to attack the administration's China policies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the White House, senior aides to Clinton fostered a
skeptical view of the evidence of Chinese espionage and its
significance.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, for example, said they determined on
learning of it that the Chinese spying would have no bearing on the
administration's dealings with China, which included the increased
exports of satellites and other militarily useful items. They
continued to advocate looser controls over sales of supercomputers
and other equipment, even as intelligence analysts documented the
scope of China's espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning that Samore had insisted that this case had
no implications for China policy, the president's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, acknowledged Friday night that the case was
clearly relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew that China was a country that ought not to get
sensitive technology,'' Berger said. ``This reinforced that.''
</P>
<P>
   Samore, the Security Council official, did not accept the Energy
Department's conclusion that China's nuclear advances stemmed
largely from the theft of U.S. secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as Clinton prepared to meet with President Jiang Zemin
of China, he asked the CIA for a quick alternative analysis of the
issue. The agency found that China had stolen secrets from Los
Alamos but differed with the Energy Department over the
significance of the spying.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In personal terms, the handling of this case is very much the
story of the Energy Department intelligence official who first
raised questions about the Los Alamos case, Notra Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock became a secret star witness before a select
congressional committee last fall. In a unanimous report that
remains secret, the bipartisan panel embraced his conclusions about
Chinese espionage, officials said. Taking issue with the White
House's view, the panel saw clear implications in the espionage
case for U.S.-China policy, and has now made dozens of
policy-related recommendations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A debate still rages within the government over whether Trulock
was right about the significance of the Los Alamos nuclear theft.
But even senior administration officials who do not think so credit
Trulock with forcing them to confront the realities of Chinese
atomic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   China's technical advance allows it to make mobile missiles,
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and small warheads for
submarines _ the main elements of a modern nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   While White House officials question whether China will actually
deploy a more advanced nuclear force soon, they acknowledge that
Beijing has made plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996 Trulock traveled to CIA headquarters to tell
officials there of the evidence his team had gathered on the
apparent Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear designs.
</P>
<P>
   As Trulock gathered his charts and drawings and wrapped up his
top-secret briefing, the agency's chief spy hunter, Paul Redmond,
sat stunned.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the Atomic Age, a Soviet spy ring that included
Julius Rosenberg had stolen the first nuclear secrets out of Los
Alamos. Now, at the end of the Cold War, the Chinese seemed to have
succeeded in penetrating the same weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be just as bad as the Rosenbergs,'' Redmond
recalled saying.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that so alarmed him had surfaced a year earlier.
Senior nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos, poring over data from
the most recent Chinese underground nuclear tests, had detected
eerie similarities between the latest Chinese and U.S. bomb
designs.
</P>
<P>
   From what they could tell, Beijing was testing a smaller and
more lethal nuclear device configured remarkably like the W-88, the
most modern, miniaturized warhead in the U.S. arsenal. In April
1995, they brought their findings to Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to detail the evidence uncovered by the Los
Alamos scientists, who have access to a wide range of classified
intelligence data and seismic and other measurements.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the scientists were piecing it together, they were
handed an intelligence windfall from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, they were told, a Chinese official gave CIA
analysts what appeared to be a 1988 Chinese government document
describing the country's nuclear weapons program. The document, a
senior official said, specifically mentioned the W-88 and described
some of the warhead's key design features.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos laboratory, where the W-88 had been designed,
quickly emerged as the most likely source of the leak.
</P>
<P>
   One of three national weapons labs owned by the Department of
Energy, Los Alamos, 35 miles outside Sante Fe, N.M., was
established in 1943 during the Manhattan Project. Trulock and his
team knew just how vulnerable Los Alamos was to modern espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The three labs had long resisted FBI and congressional pressure
to tighten their security policies. Energy officials acknowledge
that there have long been security problems at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, also in New Mexico,
had in 1994 been granted waivers from an Energy Department policy
that visiting foreign scientists be subjected to background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Lab officials resented the intrusions caused by
counterintelligence measures, arguing that restrictions on foreign
visitors would clash with the labs' new mandate to help Russia and
other nations safeguard their nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was also using increased access to
the laboratories to support its policy of engagement with China, as
had been done under previous, Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, for example, China's defense minister, Gen.
Chi Haotian, visited Sandia on a Pentagon-sponsored trip. Energy
Department officials were not told in advance, and they later
complained that Chi and his delegation had not received proper
clearances, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no evidence in this case that foreign visitors
were involved in the theft of information.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and early 1996, Trulock and his team took their
findings to the FBI. A team of FBI and Energy Department officials
traveled to the three weapons labs and pored over travel and work
records of lab scientists who had access to the relevant
technology.
</P>
<P>
   By February the team had narrowed its focus to five possible
suspects, including a computer scientist working in the nuclear
weapons area at Los Alamos, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This suspect ``stuck out like a sore thumb,'' said one official.
In 1985, for example, the suspect's wife was invited to address a
Chinese conference on sophisticated computer topics even though she
was only a secretary at Los Alamos. Her husband, the real expert,
accompanied her, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1996, the Energy Department decided to brief the White
House. A group of senior officials including Trulock sat down with
Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, to tell
him that China appeared to have acquired the W-88 and that a spy
for China might still be at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was first made aware of this in 1996,'' Berger said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   By June the FBI formally opened a criminal investigation into
the theft of the W-88 design. But the inquiry made little progress
over the rest of the year. When Energy Department officials asked
about the inquiry at the end of 1996, they came away convinced that
the bureau had assigned few resources to the case.
</P>
<P>
   A senior bureau official acknowledged that his agency was aware
of the Energy Department's criticism but pointed out that it was
difficult to investigate the case without alerting the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau maintained tight control over the case. The CIA
counterintelligence office, for one, was not kept informed of its
status, according to Redmond, who has since retired.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials were also being stymied in their
efforts to address security problems at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After Federico Pena became energy secretary in early 1997, a
previously approved counterintelligence program was quietly placed
on the back burner for more than a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the FBI issued a classified report on the labs
that recommended, among other things, reinstating background checks
on visitors to Los Alamos and Sandia, officials said. The Energy
Department and the labs ignored the FBI recommendation for 17
months. An Energy Department spokeswoman was unable to explain the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said, ``We couldn't get an order requiring the
labs to report to counterintelligence officials when the Chinese
were present. All those requirements had been waived.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, with the FBI's investigation making scant
progress and the Energy Department's counterintelligence program in
limbo, Trulock and other intelligence officials began to see new
evidence that the Chinese had other, ongoing spy operations at the
weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   But Trulock was unable to quickly inform senior U.S. officials
about the new evidence. He asked to speak directly with Pena, the
energy secretary, but had to wait four months for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pena said he did not know why Trulock was kept
waiting until July but recalled that he ``brought some very
important issues to my attention and that's what we need in the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena immediately sent Trulock back to the White House _ and to
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July 1997 Sandy was briefed fully by the DOE on China's
full access to nuclear weapons designs, a much broader pattern''
said one White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Berger was told that there was evidence of
several other Chinese espionage operations that were still under
way inside the weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   That news, several officials said, raised the importance of the
issue. The suspected Chinese thefts were no longer just ancient
history, problems that had happened on another administration's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Berger quickly briefed Clinton on what he had learned and kept
him updated over the next few months, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   As Trulock spread the alarm, his warnings were reinforced by CIA
Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh, who met with
Pena to discuss the lax security at the labs that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shocked by it, and I went to work on shifting the
balance in favor of security,'' Pena said. He and his aides began
to meet with White House officials to prepare a presidential order
on lab security.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI assigned more agents to the W-88 investigation,
gathering new and more troubling evidence about the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the agents learned that the suspect had
traveled to Hong Kong without reporting the trip as required by
government regulations. In Hong Kong, officials said, the FBI found
records showing that the scientist had obtained $700 from the
American Express office. Investigators suspect he used it to buy an
airline ticket to Shanghai, inside the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   With Berger now paying close attention, the White House became
deeply involved in evaluating the seriousness of the thefts and
solving the counterintelligence problems at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's new findings came at a crucial moment in U.S.-China
relations. Congress was examining the role of foreign money in the
1996 campaign, amid charges that Beijing had secretly funneled
money into Democratic coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was also moving to strengthen its strategic
and commercial links with China. Clinton had already eased the
commercial sale of supercomputers and satellite technology to
China, and now he wanted to cement a nuclear cooperation agreement
at the upcoming summit, enabling American companies to sell China
new commercial nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Berger flew to Beijing to prepare for the
October summit. He assigned Samore, a senior NSC aide in charge of
proliferation issues, to assess the damage from the Los Alamos spy
case.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a briefing from Trulock in August, Samore asked
the CIA's directorate of intelligence to get a second opinion on
how China had developed its smaller nuclear warheads. It was, an
NSC aide said, ``a quick study done at our request.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts agreed that there had been a serious compromise of
sensitive technology through espionage at the weapons labs, but
were far less conclusive about the extent of the damage. The CIA
argued that China's sudden advance in nuclear design could be
traced in part to other causes, including the ingenuity of
Beijing's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The areas of agreement between DOE and CIA were that China
definitely benefited from access to U.S. nuclear weapons
information that was obtained from open sources, conversations with
DOE scientists in the U.S. and China, and espionage,'' said a U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disagreement is in the area of specific nuclear weapons
designs. Trulock's briefing was based on a worst-case scenario,
which CIA believes was not supported by available intelligence. CIA
thinks the Chinese have benefited from a variety of sources,
including from the Russians and their own indigenous efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Samore assembled the competing teams of CIA and DOE analysts in
mid-October for a meeting in his White House office that turned
into a tense debate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA report noted that China and Russia were cooperating on
nuclear issues, indicating that this was another possible
explanation of Beijing's improved warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock said this was a misreading of the evidence, which
included intercepted communications between Russian and Chinese
experts. The Russians were offering advice on how to measure the
success of nuclear tests, not design secrets. In fact, Trulock
argued, the Russian measurement techniques were used to help the
Chinese analyze the performance of a weapon that Los Alamos experts
believed was based on a U.S. design.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the meeting, Notra Trulock said that he thought the CIA was
underplaying the effect that successful Chinese espionage
operations in the weapons labs had had on the Chinese nuclear
weapons program,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the CIA report, Samore told Berger in late September
that the picture was less conclusive than Trulock was arguing.
Officials said he began to relay that view before hearing Trulock's
rebuttal of the CIA study at the October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Samore told Berger ``there isn't enough information to resolve
the debate, there is no definitive answer, but in any event this
clearly illustrates weaknesses in DOE's counterintelligence
capability,'' said one official familiar with Samore's
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials strenuously deny that the agency's analysts
intended to downplay Trulock's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI inquiry was stalled. At a September 1997 meeting between
FBI and Energy Department officials, Freeh concluded that the
bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest the suspect,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   The crime was believed to have occurred more than a decade
earlier. Investigators did not then have sufficient evidence to
obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect, making it difficult to
build a strong criminal case, according to U.S. officials. FBI
officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to
investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the bureau couldn't build a case, the Energy
Department could still take some action against someone holding a
U.S. security clearance. Freeh told DOE officials that there was no
longer an investigative reason to allow the suspect to remain in
his sensitive position, officials said. In espionage cases, the FBI
often wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of
tipping them off prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspect was allowed to keep his job and retain his
security clearances for more than a year after the meeting with
Freeh, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the NSC did begin to draft a new
counterintelligence plan for the weapons labs, and Clinton signed
the order mandating the new measures in February 1998. In April, a
former FBI counterintelligence agent, Ed Curran, was named to run a
more vigorous counterintelligence office at Energy Department
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The administration explained aspects of the case to aides
working for the House and Senate intelligence committees beginning
in 1996. But few in Congress grasped the magnitude of what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the House Intelligence Committee requested an
update on the case, officials said. Trulock forwarded the request
in a memo to, and in conversations with, Elizabeth Moler, then
acting energy secretary. Ms. Moler ordered him not to brief the
House panel for fear that the information would be used to attack
the president's China policy, according to an account he later gave
congressional investigators. Ms. Moler, now a Washington lawyer,
says she does not remember the request to allow Trulock to brief
Congress and denies delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Ms. Moler, then deputy secretary, stopped Trulock
from delivering written testimony on espionage activities in the
labs to a closed session of the House National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler told Trulock to rewrite his testimony to limit it to
the announced subject of the hearing, foreign visitors to the labs,
an Energy Department spokeswoman said. The issue came up
nonetheless when committee members asked follow-up questions,
Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers began to learn about the extent of the Chinese
theft of U.S. nuclear secrets late in 1998, when a select committee
investigating the transfers of sensitive U.S. technology to China,
chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., heard from Trulock.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sa that Congress was adequately
informed, but leading Democrats and Republicans disagree. Rep.
Norman Dicks, D-Wash., the ranking minority member on the House
Intelligence Committee and also a member of the Cox committee, said
that he and Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House
intelligence panel, were not adequately informed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Porter Goss and I were not properly briefed about the
dimensions of the problem,'' he said, adding: ``It was
compartmentalized and disseminated over the years in dribs and
drabs so that the full extent of the problem was not known until
the Cox committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, midway through the Cox panel's inquiry, a new
secretary of energy, Bill Richardson, arrived on the job.
</P>
<P>
   After being briefed by Trulock, Richardson quickly reinstated
background checks on all foreign visitors, a move recommended 17
months earlier by the FBI. He also doubled the counterintelligence
budget and placed more former FBI counterintelligence experts at
the labs.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson also became concerned about what the Cox panel
was finding out.
</P>
<P>
   So in October he cornered Berger at a high-level meeting and
urged him to put someone in charge of coordinating the
administration's dealings with the Cox committee.
</P>
<P>
   Berger turned again to Samore, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By December, Dicks, in his role as the ranking Democratic member
of the Cox panel, was growing impatient with the administration's
slow response to ongoing requests from the committee and its
inaction on the Los Alamos spy case. Dicks told Richardson, a
former colleague in the House, that he needed to take action,
Richardson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks' complaints helped prompt Richardson to call Freeh twice
in one day in December about the inquiry, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was given a polygraph, or lie-detector test, in
December, by the Energy Department. Unsatisfied, the FBI
administered a second test in February, and officials said the
suspect was found to be deceptive. It is not known what questions
prompted the purportedly deceptive answers.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI investigation intensified, the Cox Committee
completed a 700-page secret report which found that China's theft
of US secrets had harmed U.S. national security _ saving the
Chinese untold time and money in nuclear weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from both the CIA and Energy Department analysts,
the bi-partisan panel unanimously came down on the side of
Trulock's assessment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the CIA and other agencies, at the request of the Cox
Committee, are conducting a new, more thorough damage assessment of
the case, even as the debate continues to rage throughout the
intelligence community over whether Trulock has overstated the
damage from Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Trulock has been moved from head of DOE's
intelligence office to acting deputy. While Richardson and other
Energy Department officials praise Trulock's work and deny he has
been mistreated, some in Congress suspect he has been demoted for
helping the Cox Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, the CIA's former counterintelligence chief, who made
his name by unmasking Soviet mole Aldrich Ames at the CIA, has no
doubts about the significance of what Trulock uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``This was far more damaging to the national security
than Aldrich Ames.''

ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT PACIFIC LUMBER DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to improve graf which begins ``Michael Passoff'';
editorial refinements throughout.)  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the first half of last year, the Pacific
Lumber Co. surprised state forestry inspectors by obeying the
rules. Then, officials say, the company reverted to its old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Workers used heavy equipment near the nests of spotted owls, the
officials say, destroying the endangered birds' roosting area.
Loggers also drove across a riverbed rather than build the culverts
required by law to protect waters where threatened and endangered
fish spawn. They left slash piles along the banks of another river,
again threatening delicate fish habitat. They allowed a fire to
burn in a protected zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever count fish in a creel?'' asked Ken Nielson, the
California Department of Forestry's deputy chief of forest practice
enforcement, when asked to count Pacific Lumber's violations over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber amassed 16 violations last year, when it was
supposed to be on its best behavior. It was operating with a
conditional license for having amassed more than 100 violations in
1996 and 1997, not including violations made by subcontractors on
the company's property.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, state officials called a halt. In November, Pacific
Lumber became the first logging company in California history to
have its timber license suspended.
</P>
<P>
   So environmental groups and others who have kept close watch on
Pacific Lumber for nearly 15 years do not believe the company can
live up to an agreement it signed on Monday when it sold California
and the federal government 10,000 acres of ancient redwood groves
250 miles north of here for $480 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal insures that the irreplaceable groves of old
redwoods in the Headwaters forest will be preserved, critics worry
about another part of the deal, a 50-year conservation plan to
protect endangered species. That plan will govern how and where
Pacific Lumber cuts trees on the rest of its 211,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   To protect endangered species like the Northern spotted owl, the
coho salmon and the marbled murrelet, Pacific Lumber has to abide
by rules set by government wildlife biologists. But critics say the
company cannot be trusted. After it was acquired by Maxxam Corp. of
Houston in a $900 million hostile takeover in 1985 led by the
billionaire Charles Hurwitz, it began logging aggressively,
tripling its harvest to pay off junk bonds used in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said that only
by watching the company's every move would environmental groups
save the nearly extinct bird and fish species on Pacific Lumber's
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might actually do things that are illegal and we'll just
have to monitor that,'' Pope said. ``We will be working very
closely with the State of California to see that they do follow the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Pacific Lumber, John Campbell, said that the
company, which had its license conditionally reinstated a week ago,
already was doing a great deal to remedy its record. He said the
company had hired an outside firm to make recommendations and had
implemented all of them, including increasing training, doubling
the number of its compliance teams, which monitor the operations of
both the employees and outside contractors, and giving the monitors
the authority to halt all operations if something is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for absolute compliance with all the rules and
regulations,'' said Campbell, who contended that last year's
violations could be attributed to workers' being distracted by
Earth First protesters ``running around the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very nasty accident where a young man was killed,''
he said, referring to David Chain, an Earth First protester crushed
by a falling tree, ``and I think our people were not as focused as
they should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hayes, counsel to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, said
that the department planned to hire an outside monitor whose sole
duty would be to watch whether Pacific Lumber deviated from the
habitat conservation plan. ``After the incident in the fall,''
Hayes said, ``when the company had its license pulled and had
egregious problems, that suggested to us that we needed to have
enforcement and monitoring and liability that was a cut above
everything we had ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are watching Pacific Lumber these days. In Eureka,
Calif., a law clinic has devoted itself to filing claims against
the company. Three of the lawsuits are by homeowners who blame
Pacific Lumber's logging for mudslides that destroyed seven homes.
The Environmental Protection Information Center, based in
Garberville, on the southern edge of Pacific Lumber's base in
Humboldt County, said it planned to step up its already vigilant
watch over the company. So does the Bay Area Coalition for
Headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concern over the habitat conservation plan is that
it grants so-called ``incidental take'' permits. Those permits
absolve a company from blame if it ``incidentally'' destroys the
habitat of endangered species while following the approved plan.
Environmentalists call the permits a loophole that will allow
Pacific Lumber to destroy habitat, incidentally or not.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also concerned that Pacific Lumber will rush to
harvest in areas that will probably be declared off-limits in the
habitat conservation plan within five years, when watershed
analyses are completed. ``You just know they're going to run out
and start cutting trees,'' said Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the
Environmental Protection Information Center, which may sue over the
habitat conservation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Passoff, a spokesman for the Bay Area Coalition to Save
Headwaters, said that perhaps the biggest reason Pacific Lumber was
so mistrusted was Hurwitz, whom environmentalists consider public
enemy No. 1. As proof that he mismanaged companies for profit, they
point to a case sent to a judge in Houston last week, in which the
federal government accused Hurwitz of mismanaging a failed Houston
savings and loan association in the 1980s whose bailout cost
taxpayers $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just environmentalists _ nobody trusts Hurwitz,''
Passoff said. ``That's why he is being sued by employees,
shareholders, government agencies, local landowners and
environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz does not grant interviews. But until the Headwaters
forest deal was completed, lawyers defending him against the
federal charges of reckless banking practices had called that suit
a politically motivated outgrowth of confrontations between him and
environmentalists over the future of Headwaters.

SWING VOTER WON'T RUSH HER DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-GIULIANI-CREW) 
(lh) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One school board member's vote on vouchers could
ultimately determine whether Chancellor Rudy Crew stays in New York
City long enough to preside over the opening of his fifth school
year next fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in Terri Thomson's two-decade career in public service, much
of it spent working behind the scenes, she says, she never aspired
to be thrust onto such a prominent and politically painful perch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is so squeamish in the limelight that as Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and the chancellor vied like jealous suitors this
week for her tie-breaking vote on the experimental voucher program,
Ms. Thomson pleaded with a reporter to leave her name out of it _
or at least the name of her employer, even though it had been
widely disseminated when she was appointed to the Board of
Education in July. She is director of city and state affairs at
Citibank, which she represents in meetings around New York with
community groups and chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Thomson, who has come a long way since graduating from
secretarial school and working for a yellow pages publisher in the
late 1960s, is indebted for her seat on the seven-member board not
to Citibank, but to the woman who appointed her: Claire Shulman,
the longtime Queens borough president and recent mayoral ally, who
began her own political career in the borough's schools as
president of a parent-teacher association.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson met Ms. Shulman, then the deputy borough president,
in the early 1980s, when Ms. Thomson was an aide to Rep. Gary
Ackerman, serving as a conduit for borough residents' issues and
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson had first streaked across Ackerman's political radar
a decade earlier, when she brought together a disparate band of
fellow parents at the Electchester Co-op in Flushing to rebuild a
decrepit playground.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ms. Thomson has become close friends with
Ackerman and his wife, Rita, a psychiatric social worker. And Ms.
Thomson and Ms. Shulman have come to know each other better as
well, through Ms. Thomson's position at Citibank and in a
semiregular kaffeeklatsch _ actually, they meet for lunch _ with a
handful of others who travel in the borough's political, business
and academic circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claire is sort of the queen of the lunch group,'' said one
person who has attended. ``And everyone likes Terri. She's very
cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind Ms. Thomson's obviously warm demeanor, say those who
know her, are the sharp instincts of a savvy politician who takes
herself and her work seriously. Indeed, in December, at age 50, Ms.
Thomson met a 30-year goal: she earned a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   It was a journey that she had set aside for two decades to bring
up her two daughters, but one that she resumed in earnest 10 years
ago, taking a couple of night courses a year at Queens College,
where her majors were urban studies, political science and sign
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who knows me knows the value I put on education,''
Ms. Thomson said last year. ``We worked very hard to make sure our
children went to the best colleges. I think I'll go to school the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   How Ms. Thomson and Ms. Shulman, whom Ms. Thomson has promised
to consult, will come down on the voucher issue remains anyone's
guess. Ms. Thomson cautioned, in an interview in July, that her
parents' decision to send her to Catholic school _ and her family's
decision to send her daughters to Catholic schools _ should not be
interpreted as laying the foundation for her support of vouchers,
in which tax dollars are used to pay private tuition. At the time,
she said, she was in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor, among others, has pressed her to rethink her
position, and Ms. Thomson has pledged to do just that, collecting
as many disparate opinions as she can by reading and listening.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that she has made clear is that she will
take her time, at least until the end of the month, leaving the
mayor and the chancellor, who has threatened to resign if the board
votes in favor of vouchers, in a state of suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has never been in a public position, subject to the
pressures that public policy makers face,'' Ackerman said. ``This
is her first real test.''

 ELBRIDGE T. GERRY, 90, POLO STAR AND BANKER WHO BRED TROTTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elbridge T. Gerry, a banker, polo star and breeder of harness
horses that twice won the Hambletonian, died on Feb. 26 at his home
in Delhi, N.Y. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry, known as Ebby, was a partner in the private banking firm
of Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. and came from a family steeped in
American history. He was a great-great-grandson of Elbridge Gerry,
a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of
Confederation and the politician for whom the term gerrymander was
reportedly named.
</P>
<P>
   The word, pronounced with a soft G, unlike the family name,
describes the act of designing an oddly shaped electoral district
to favor a particular candidate or party.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry numbered among his uncles Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New
York and E. Rowland Harriman, the latter of whom he joined as a
partner in the Arden Homestead Stable, which campaigned many
champion trotting horses.
</P>
<P>
   Their stable produced Florican and Star's Pride and the two
horses who won the Hambletonian, the premier trotting race in the
world: Titan Hanover in 1945 and Flirth in 1973. His family, which
also was active in thoroughbred racing, produced such champions as
Forego, the Horse of the Year in 1974, 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry was born in New York City on Nov. 22, 1908, and attended
St. Bernard's School, the Aiken Preparatory School in South
Carolina, St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and Harvard College.
When he graduated from Harvard in 1931, he joined the Hanover Bank
in New York and, five years later, joined Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co., where he became a general partner in 1956. From 1957 to 1986,
he was also director of Union Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   He served for 63 years as a trustee and president of the New
York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was
founded by his grandfather Elbridge T. Gerry in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   While at Harvard, Gerry had been captain of the polo team and
continued as a star of the sport after graduation; he played on
teams that won the U.S. Open Championship and competed successfully
in England. He was also captain of a team consisting of himself and
his three younger brothers, and he played alongside Tommy Hitchcock
and Stewart Iglehart and other legendary figures of a way of life
that has since faded into memory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, he earned a ranking of nine goals. (The highest is 10.)
He later served as chairman of the U.S. Polo Association and was
inducted into the Polo Fall of Fame in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A founding member and president of the Harness Racing Museum and
Hall of Fame in Goshen, N.Y., he was inducted into the Harness
Racing Living Hall of Fame in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry's wife of 67 years, the former Marjorie Kane, died
Thursday morning at their home in Delhi. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   They are survived by two sons, Elbridge T. Jr. of Locust Valley,
N.Y., and Peter G. of Hopewell, N.J.; a daughter, Marjorie Gerry
Ryland of Beverly, Mass.; two brothers, Henry A. Gerry and Edward
H. Gerry; 11 grandchildren; two step-grandchildren, and seven
great-grandchildren.

IRABU TAKING CUES FROM NEW GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ David Wells was good for Hideki Irabu last year,
making an effort to indoctrinate Irabu into the New York Yankees'
clubhouse. Now it is Roger Clemens who seems to be having an effect
on the pitcher from Japan, but the influence is different.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu shared sushi and taverns with Wells; since Clemens
arrived, Irabu quit drinking diet soda.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to determine how much effect Clemens is having on
Irabu, Yankees manager Joe Torre said Friday, after the
right-hander pitched three shutout innings in an 8-6 exhibition
loss against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But say this for Irabu, whose conditioning and work ethic faded
in the second half of last season after a remarkable start: he is
trying to change, and it is apparent that he is willing to embrace
Clemens as a mentor. ``I'm doing the conditioning, which I need,''
Irabu said, through his interpreter, George Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu sought advice from Clemens long before the Yankees traded
for the five-time Cy Young Award winner. Clemens once was part of
an all-star team touring Japan, and Irabu asked a reporter to
forward some written questions to Clemens. The Texan, who appears
generous with his advice, answered.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Clemens is in pinstripes, Irabu takes his instruction
in first person. Discussing the mechanics of pitching with Irabu
and Orlando Hernandez last week, Clemens suggested that Irabu stand
straighter on the mound, taller. That way, a pitcher is better able
to drive toward home plate on a downward plane, rather than lean to
the side and lose the impetus of his body. Clemens reminded Irabu
to keep his delivery compact, to prevent himself from pulling out
his left shoulder too soon.
</P>
<P>
   And when Irabu asked if throwing the splitter bothered Clemens'
elbow, as it sometimes bothers Irabu's, Clemens suggested a new
grip. When a pitcher holds the ball on the seams, Clemens
explained, the stitching almost seems to grip back. To avoid that,
Clemens widens his fingers and holds the ball on the smooth
leather, making the release of the ball easier, and causing less
torque on the elbow. Irabu threw the splitter with the new grip
Friday ``and couldn't believe how much it moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has a good relationship with Yankees pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre and improved under his guise last year. But advice from
Clemens _ an active pitcher who is already something of a legend _
carries its own weight. Clemens says something, does something,
Irabu seems to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has been more diligent in his running, Torre reports, and
when his weight approached 250 pounds, he made another major
change. Accustomed to drinking two liters of soda a day, Irabu quit
earlier this week and, by ending his intake of the liquid, has
already dropped four pounds. ``I'm sure I'll be losing 10 pounds
quickly,'' said Irabu, poking fun at himself.
</P>
<P>
   In Irabu's first start last spring, an umpire's call infuriated
him. He lost his composure and accidentally hit a Cleveland batter,
and the day ended with the Yankees engaged in a beanball war with
the Indians. He raged at Japanese reporters two weeks later,
confiscating a videotape and stomping on it.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu carries himself much differently now. He is much less
defensive with reporters, more freely demonstrating the wry sense
of humor that Rose, Wells and David Cone have talked about. He
still does not regularly engage teammates. Rather, he often sits by
himself in the clubhouse. But Irabu readily offers a smile that was
once extinct. Sometimes unwilling to embrace his own failings in
the past, Irabu now talks openly about what he needs to do to get
better, about his weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   And he does have weaknesses to overcome. This being his first
outing of the spring, he was inconsistent, throwing a first-pitch
ball to 10 of the 12 batters he faced. His curveball _ which
catcher Joe Girardi feels is a crucial pitch in Irabu's development
_ was better Friday, but generally has been erratic. Quitting diet
soda in spring training and maintaining his conditioning and
intensity over a full season are distinct challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But he is trying, and in spring training, that's a start.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ Seeking a pitcher who is effective against left-handers, club
officials have an interest in the former Yankee JIM MECIR,
currently with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Mecir, a right-hander, had
a terrific season in 1998, when left-handed batters hit just .227
against him, right-handers .224.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVID WELLS, the pitcher traded for ROGER CLEMENS in February,
watched some of Friday's game and waved a hello to Yankee left
fielder CHAD CURTIS. HOMER BUSH, another player included in the
deal, says Wells has adjusted quickly to his surroundings in
Toronto. ``If he's still in mourning,'' Bush said, ``then he's
doing a pretty good job of hiding it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clemens will pitch Saturday, against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVID CONE remains on track to pitch in an exhibition Monday.

TYSON NEED NOT RETURN TO PRISON IN INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Mike Tyson cleared a major legal hurdle Friday when an Indiana
judge approved an agreement that would not require him to serve
extra prison time in that state for violating his probation on a
1992 rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Marion County Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford agreed to
allow the boxer to serve out the terms of his probation in the
Maryland jail in which he is currently serving a one-year sentence
on two misdemeanor assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which was worked out between Marion County
prosecutor Scott Newman and Jim Voyles, Tyson's Indianapolis-based
lawyer, Tyson will serve an additional 60 days tacked on to the
jail time he is serving in Montgomery County, Md. He will serve all
of the time in Maryland and does not have to go back to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Tyson acknowledged that he violated the
terms of his probation. After he finishes his jail term in
Maryland, Tyson's Indiana probation will be terminated as
unsatisfactory, a stipulation that could be a factor if Tyson
encounters legal trouble again. He must pay Indiana $80 a day as
the cost of his jail term, and Indiana will then reimburse
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will still be under two years of probation in Maryland on
the two assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 32, signed the agreement on Thursday night, and it was
filed with Judge Gifford in Indianapolis on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frankly not anxious _ and I don't think the people of
Indiana were anxious _ to have Mike Tyson back in our court and in
our jails,'' Newman was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 1, Tyson pleaded no contest to the two charges of
misdemeanor assault stemming from a minor car accident in
Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. On Feb. 5, Tyson was sentenced to
one year in jail in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in further legal jeopardy, because his probation had
not expired on his 1992 conviction for rape. Tyson was released
from prison in March 1995, when his four-year probation began.
</P>
<P>
   So Tyson's lawyers immediately went to the Marion County
prosecutors to work out an agreement. Under terms of the agreement
in Indiana, Tyson agreed not to appeal his Maryland sentence.
Tyson's Maryland lawyer, Paul Kemp, is still negotiating with
Montgomery County prosecutors to get Tyson's jail sentence reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Voyles said he could not comment on the negotiations in
Maryland. As for the Indiana agreement, Voyles said that with
good-time credit, those 60 days could be reduced to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has already had one jailhouse outburst. He became upset
and threw a television set into a set of bars two weeks ago.
Tyson's advisers say he was taken off his anti-depressant
medication two days before the incident. Tyson was placed in an
isolation cell and lost some of his privileges for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Voyles said both sides agreed that the modification in its
present form was in the best interest for both Tyson and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In the request for modification that was filed with Judge
Gifford, Tyson's Indiana probation officer, George Walker, said
that one of the reasons he approved the agreement was because
Tyson's probation was set to expire on March 24 and that a hearing
in Indiana would have ``resulted in an unnecessary drain on court
time/resources and considerable cost to local taxpayers for
returning him from Maryland in a prisoner status.''
