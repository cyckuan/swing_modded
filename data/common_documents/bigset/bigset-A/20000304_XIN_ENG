<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges U.S. to Grant China Permanent NTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Friday night urged the United States to grant
China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status regardless of
transient ups and downs in their bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
This is "because having china in the WTO is in America's own
profound interest, and in the long term is indeed the best way to
keep relations on an even keel," lee told the 28th Williamburg
Conference here about the relations between United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Unite States has taken a major step in putting
relations with China on a sound footing by concluding the deal
last November on China's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Lee said, "The momentous move has profound positive
strategic implications, well beyond the economic sphere."
</P>
<P>
The United States must now follow up by granting China
permanent NTR status as an integral part of its WTO deal with
China. he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said, "Another key issue in U.S.-China relations is
Taiwan and the idea of a unified China is deeply embedded in the
Chinese psyche."
</P>
<P>
After Lee Teng-hui's policies to expand Taiwan's international
space and redefine Taiwan's relations with China's mainland,
reunification has become an urgent issue for China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No Chinese leader can afford to be seen to accord a low
priority to this issue, and to take the risk of losing Taiwan," he
said,adding that the timing of the release of China's recent white
paper on the one-China principle must be seen in this context.
</P>
<P>
"There will continue to be differences between the U.S. and
China,but they should not lead to enmity or hostility," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Williamburg Conference, established in 1971 by John D.
Rockefeller 3rd, is a preeminent non-government gathering of
leading Americans and Asians dedicated to nurturing U.S.-Asian
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee opened the 28th conference, attended
by some 60 people, with his speech entitled "U.S. Role in Asia in
the 21st Century."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cannot Force Asian Nations to Change: Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said here Friday night that the United States
cannot compel Asian countries to change and that each country must
find its own way forward.
</P>
<P>
Lee, currently the country's acting prime minister, made the
remarks while delivering a speech to the 28th Williamburg
Conference attended by some 60 people.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the subject of the globalization challenge to Asia,
Lee said, "Each Asian country must decide for itself how best to
meet globalization challenge, given its own specific circumstances.
"
</P>
<P>
Noting that the distinction between the "domestic" and the"
international" has become blurred, he emphasized, "This does not
mean that countries have a free hand to intervene in one another's
domestic affairs, or that it is easy to turn good intentions for
another country into good outcomes."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the international financial system, Lee said,"We
cannot afford to assume that the existing system is too flawless
to need improvement and that the Asian crisis was simply an
unavoidable mishap that was bound to happen from time to time."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that one symbolically significant aspect of the
reform will be the way the leadership of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are chosen.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now it has been convenient simply to have the World Bank
and IMF posts divided up between the U.S. and Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in the long term this arrangement is not tenable," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If all countries are to have a stake in these institutions,
and if the actions of these institutions are to have legitimacy,
then their leaders have to be chosen by an impartial and open
process,"he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan has put forward Eisuke Sakakibara as a candidate
for the IMF managing director and Singapore supports Japan in
taking the lead to do this.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the best candidate should be chosen for the
job, regardless of nationality," he said.
</P>

Rockefeller 3rd, is a non-governmental gathering of leading

understanding.

<HEADLINE> WWF Welcomes New Fisheries Eco-Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Friday hailed the launch of the first seafood products certified
by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as a major step forward
for consumers and the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
"The MSC's new eco-label creates real market incentives for
healthy fisheries," said Scott Burns, Director of WWF's Endangered
Seas Campaign. "For the first time, fishers can be recognized for
managing their fisheries in a responsible way, and consumers will
be able to purchase seafood that they know comes from sustainable
sources. This can only be good news for consumers, and for marine
conservation."
</P>
<P>
The non-profit MSC was formed by WWF, the conservation
organization, and Unilever, a leading consumer goods company and
major buyer of frozen fish in their joint effort to halt
overfishing.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations estimates, at least 60 percent
of the world's most valuable fisheries are either overfished or
fished to the limit.
</P>
<P>
Through a series of international consultations with key
stakeholders, from fishers and scientists to lawmakers and
retailers, the MSC developed the first-ever global standards for
well-managed fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Drummond Wants to Break 60m World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- There's a 5,000 U.S. dollar
bonus for breaking the world record in the 60 meters Friday and
Saturday at the U.S. Indoor Track and Field Championships in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Jon Drummond's top priority isn't the money. "That would be a
wonderful thing if it happened," says Drummond, also known as the
clown prince of track and field,"but Jon Drummond just needs to
win races now."
</P>
<P>
Drummond is 2-for-3 in the 60 this year, equaling his best of 6.
46 seconds. The record is 6.39 by training partner Maurice Greene,
who beat Drummond at the Millrose Games and who will be a
spectator at the Georgia Dome this time.
</P>
<P>
Last summer Drummond ranked No. 5 in the USA in the 100 and
fell out of the world top 10 in a season disrupted twice by bouts
of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit I am feeling very, very good. Atltanta has a
very fast track. If I execute as I've been doing, I believe I can
go under world-record time," Drummond said. Eenditem

<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- World champions Wang Nan/Li Ju
from powerhouse China slumped to a shock defeat to South Korea's
newly paired Lee Eun Sil/Su Eun Mi here Friday in the women's
doubles at the COSCO 2000 Olympics Table Tennis Asian Qualifying
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
Though the Chinese pair was outclassed with a score of 22-20
and 21-15 in Group A by the South Koreans, they still got double
berths at the Sydney Olympic Games by ranking second in the group
with three wins and one loss.
</P>
<P>
"We could not get excited in the contest, because we have
already clinched the Olympic berths with three straight wins
before meeting the South Korean pair," said world cup winner Li Ju.
</P>
<P>
There were 17 men pairs and 17 women duos competing in the
doubles, dividing into four groups.
</P>
<P>
After the group matches, four berths to the Sydney Olympic
Games in men and women doubles respectively have found their
gainers. The men's qualifiers are Wang Liqing and Yan Sen, both
from China, Shibutani Hiroshi of Japan and Oh Sang Eun of South
Korea. The women qualifiers are Yang Ying of China, Fujinuma Ai
and Naito Kazuko from Japan and Kim Moo Kyo of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In addition to players qualified for singles, six men and women
from Asia will take part only in doubles events at the Olympic
Games. A maximum of two doubles pairs per NOC may be selected
respectively in men's and women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
The six-day tournament features four events -- men's singles,
women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles, which are
played on a round robin format.

</P>
<P>

<P>
ANKARA -- Fatos Eron, representative of Choice International in

reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eron said in a statement Friday that Turkish businessmen must
search for new markets while keeping existing ones, emphasizing
that China was a very attractive option in this regard.
</P>
<P>
She characterized China as an emerging market with its huge
population and a growing potential for a 1 trillion dollars market
in imports. She added that the Chinese market was far from being
saturated and the market offered many possibilities for the sale of
different kinds of products.

<HEADLINE> Russia Gives Order to Arrest Chechen President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday officially put
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on the federal wanted list on
charges of armed mutiny.
</P>
<P>
A warrant for the arrest of Maskhadov, the supreme commander of
rebel forces, has been issued, and formal charges of stirring up
and participating in armed mutiny were brought against him in a
trial by default, said Yury Biryukov, chief of the North Caucasus
directorate of the Russian Prosecutor-General Office, in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
Biryukov said investigation shows that "since May 1998, with
permission of Aslan Maskhadov, the Congress of Peoples of Ichkeria
and Dagestan acted in Grozny under the chairmanship of well-known
terrorist Shamil Basayev."
</P>
<P>
The congress had it as its goal to change Russia's
constitutional order and to create an Islamic republic of Chechnya
and Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
The results of the congress' activities were Chechen armed
incursions into Dagestan last August and September, he said.
</P>
<P>
An expert evaluation of Maskhadov's call on rebels to put up
every resistance to federal forces is underway, Biryukov said.
</P>
<P>
If experts find it authentic, another criminal case could be
opened against Maskhadov, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov in his hysteria-tainted address to rebel groups in
February called on them to kill federal troops wherever possible"
and enjoy it."

ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Saturday launched a
rose farm with an outlay of more than 60 million birr (about 7.4
million U.S. dollars) in Tafki Town, about 40 kilometers southwest
of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony, General Manager of the
Ethiopian Investment Authority Taddesse Haile said the rose farm
project was the result of the overall macro economic reform
programs and investment policy of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the cultivation of well tested and improved products in
the floriculture could earn more foreign currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will be competitive in the international flower market
although it is a later comer in the floriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the flower industry, the 13-hectare
rose farm would enable the African country to earn several million
U.S. dollars annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged rebels who are wreaking havoc in the northern part of
the country to take advantage of the recently passed Amnesty Law
and surrender to the government.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal while inspecting roads being
constructed under the Northern Road Emergency Project on Saturday,

</P>

crimes and atrocities they had committed on the Ugandan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president told local people that the government
troops are steadily weakening the rebels, assuring that they would
be able to return to their homes soon.

<HEADLINE> Four Drug Traffickers Hanged in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran has hanged four drug
traffickers in Khorramabad, southwestern province of Lorestan, the
evening newspaper Kayhan reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The four offenders were sentenced to death by the provincial
Islamic revolutionary court on charge of distributing narcotics.
But the daily did not say when the execution was carried out.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Majlis
(parliament) passed an anti-drug law, under which any one caught
with 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of opium will be
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that over 4,000 smugglers have been executed in the
country since the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from Afghanistan
and neighboring Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
Over 253 tons of various drugs have been seized across the country
in the first 11 months of the current Iranian calendar year to end
on March 20.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Statement on Oil Production Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday welcomed the
statements made by oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
Mexico, who favored an increase of oil production during a meeting
in London on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait considered the stance as a right step for reaching a
consensus by oil producing countries to consolidate their essential
aims, preserve oil market's stability and avoid price fluctuation,
said Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Any decision to be made during the next meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) due in Vienna late this
month will take all these factors into consideration for the
benefit of both oil producers and consumers, Sheikh Saud said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this strategic product should depend on the
balance of supply, demand and the world's oil reserves, which
rapidly built up in the last two years resulted in the drastic fall
of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and
non-OPEC Mexico met in London on Thursday to prepare a proposal for
the oil cartel to consider at its March 27 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The trio said they favored an output increase but declined to
comment on the timing and amount.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Secretary-General Nigerian Rilwanu Lukman has also said
that OPEC members would definitely raise output but the timing and
amount had to be carefully managed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports reaching here quoted delegates of the tripartite
London meeting as saying the three ministers favored a rise in OPEC
output of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from April plus another
500,000 bpd later if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The move would also allow Mexico to add 90,000 bpd in its oil
exports from April with other non-OPEC members like Norway and Oman
to join in.
</P>
<P>
Major oil producing countries began to slash their output by
some 2.1 million bpd from last April, with OPEC members taking a
share of about 1.7 million bpd, with an aim to lift the oil prices
from below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel at the start last year.
</P>
<P>
The joint move has driven the prices for North Sea Benchmark
Brent crude to a nine-year high of 29.47 dollars per barrel on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Major world oil consumers especially the United States have
warned that a continuing surge in oil prices would harm the global
economy by inflicting world-wide inflation.
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC members have vowed to maintain a stable world oil
market, they still need to reach a unified stance on a specific
plan to ease the production curbs in order to calm the anxious
market.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM Meets U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government was ready to
allow U.S envoy Harry Johnston to be acquainted with the government
policy and attitudes on the various issues at any expense, a top
Sudanese official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local Um Durman radio quoted Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman
Ismail as saying that at a meeting with Johnston the two sides
discusses the bilateral ties and how to overcome the obstacles
impeding these relations.
</P>
<P>
Johnston said he came to Khartoum with an "open heart and mind"
to listen to the official Sudanese viewpoint, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Othman stressed earlier Saturday that his government was ready
to comment on the questions that Johnston may raise over peace,
relief works and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was too early to decide whether the U.S envoy's
visit would mean the opening a new chapter in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
U.S State Department spokesman James Rubin has said that
Johnston would discuss with Sudanese officials the reopening of the
U.S embassy in Khartoum and whether its staff can return to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Washington closed the embassy in February 1996 and moved the
staff to Nairobi, Kenya, in the wake of the imposition of
international sanctions on Sudan for failing to extradite
perpetrators of the abortive assassination attempt against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Washington, however, sent in 1997 a roving diplomatic mission to
Khartoum but such representation froze after the terrorist attack
on two U.S embassies in east Africa in August 1998, killing 12
Americans among 224 others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, U.S warplanes bombed a chemical factory near
Khartoum thought to be owned by Osama bin Laden whom Washington
blamed for the embassy bombings and other anti-American activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S accused Khartoum of fomenting terrorism and condemned
its policy in the protracted civil war between the government and
the southern rebels.
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who arrived here Saturday morning on a three-day
visit, is to meet with President Omar al-Bashir.
</P>

He will also meet Sudanese ministers of engineering affairs and
of justice, chairman of the Advisory Council for Human Rights, and
leading political figures from the rebellious south.

<HEADLINE> Hoss calls Shareh on AL Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has great hope for the
coming Arab League ministerial meeting which will focus on the
Lebanese Issue, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss told Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh during a phone conversation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese National Information Agency said Hoss and Shareh also
discussed the developments of the Middle East peace process and the
Israeli-imposed obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is close to working out a paper underlining the Lebanese
standing to be put forward at the Arab foreign ministers meeting in
Beirut on March 11-12, Hoss told a press statement here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also stressed that Lebanon will take diplomatic actions to
prevent further Israeli attacks on Lebanese infrastructure while
reactivating the Monitoring Committee on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the breakdown of newly revived Syrian-Israeli
talks, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas intensified attacks on Israeli
positions in the Israeli-occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
Israel launched punishing air raids on Lebanese infrastructure and
suspected Hezbollah targets.
</P>
<P>
The Monitoring Committee, set up to watch over compliance with
rules of engagement agreed in 1996 after Israeli attacks on
Lebanon, convened amid the surge of fire trading last month. But
the meeting fell apart shortly.
</P>
<P>
Hoss pointed out the strategic goal of Lebanese diplomacy
focused on consolidating the Arab unity in Lebanon's favor at
present and in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab foreign ministers meeting is nothing but an expression
by Arab brothers that they are ready to support Lebanon at any
time," he added.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the meeting, Hoss met here on saturday with
Egyptian Ambassador Adel al-Khudari to discuss regional
developments and bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Keen on Horn 0f Africa Stability, Security: official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Yemen is closely observing the
developments in the Horn of Africa region, especially the border
dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the peaceful efforts in
this regard, a Yemeni Foreign Ministry official said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Yemen reiterates its deep keenness on the stability and
security of the Horn of Africa region " he said, adding that it
will continue to exercise its impartial attitude towards the
conflict between the two neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the Yemeni government supported the
peace initiative of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which
called for a negotiated solution to the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict
and restoring the stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993, but the two
neighbors entered a border war in May, 1998, which claimed
thousands of lives on both sides and left hundreds of thousands
others homeless.
</P>
<P>
But the two conflicting African countries expressed willingness
for a peaceful solution after intensive OAU and international
community brokerage.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Organizes Forum to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday organized an
international investment forum with the aim of pushing forward the
country's economy with the help of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 countries and over 60 international companies and
banks are participating in the forum, which is co-organized by
Kuwaiti Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Arab Research
Center (ARC).
</P>
<P>
About 120 workshops will be organized during the seven-day
forum, which will end on March 9, according to Ali Al-Shemali, ARC
chairman and director general of the forum's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shemali said on Friday that Kuwait would, during the meeting,
offer two projects in the manufacturing of steel barrels and
painting metals.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the U.S., Canada and China will also present many
projects in the fields of petrochemicals, oil refining, food
manufacturing and construction materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a paper addressed to the forum, Al-Shemali called
for the establishment of an international investment organization
based in Kuwait to protect foreign investment and arbitrate in
investment disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said that such an organization should be in charge of
managing investment deals and trade throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
It should be responsible for reviewing local investment policies
in each state and giving advice to necessary revisions, Al-Shemali
added.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, French Ministers Discuss Impact of Jospin's Pro-Israeli Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine reaffirmed on Saturday that France will fully adhere to the
principles on which French-Arab ties were set up.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine reiterated the French stand in a telephone conversation
with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk shareh Saturday to water down
the impact of French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's recent pro-
Israeli statements on French-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
In his Mideast tour last week, Jospin termed the Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas, which are spearheading a war of attrition to
try to end Israeli occupation of parts of south Lebanon, as "
terrorists," which has unleashed a storm of criticism from Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the power broker in Lebanon, condemned Jospin's pro-
Israeli statements, saying the prime minister's words were
inconsistent with French policy towards the Mideast peace process
and reneged on the spirit of the Monitoring Committee.
</P>
<P>
France has been adopting a more sympathetic attitude toward the
Arab states than the United States in their territorial
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is also a member of the Monitoring Committee, which was set
up to watch over the compliance by Israel and Hezbollah with rules
of engagement agreed in 1996 after "Grapes of Wrath" attacks
launched by Israel, in which 200 Lebanese civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
In the phone conversation, Vedrine promised to relay to Jospin
Syria's views on impact of his statements.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed to work to bring things back
to normal and surmount any negative result on French-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
arrived in Damascus Saturday for a two-day visit to Syria for talks
with officials on the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks on the return of occupied Golan
Heights stalled again in January only after two rounds of talks
since resumed in December last year. Lebanon, whose peace talks
with Israel broke down in 1996, follows closely Syria's foreign
policy, especially on the peace-making with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Italy Alarmed by Lack of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Trade Minister Piero
Fassino Saturday sounded the alarm over Italy's inability to
attract sufficient levels of foreign investment, putting part of
the blame on market inflexibility and a poorly trained workforce.
</P>
<P>
At a conference in the Italian northwestern city of Turin on
globalization, Fassino said that "a rigid labour market and high
labor costs" were frightening off foreign investment, noting that
Italy was almost last among European Union nations in terms of
investment levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that another major stumbling block was the "low
standard of professional training" among workers.
</P>
<P>
He said that, according to a recent survey of 500 foreign
multinationals, this problem worried potential investors more than
the country's high tax levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of Italy's engineering employers'
association Federmeccanica, Andrea Pininfarina, delivered a
similar message in his speech at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a study carried out for Business International
claimed that red tape was the main obstacle to foreign investment,
saying that it concerned multinationals investing in Italy four
times more than the cost of labour and twice as much  as fiscal
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Foreign managers also asked for greater security and a small
percentage said they wanted to see better infrastructure,
financial incentives, research and innovation.
</P>
<P>
Business International underscored the fact that in 1998, Italy
attracted only 1 percent of incoming foreign investment, compared
to Britain's 24 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Than 10,000 People Still to Be Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 victims of
flooding in Chokwe district, in the southern mozambican province
of Gaza, are still to be rescued, according to a release by the
country's National Disasters Management Institute (INGC) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The INGC added that the South African Air Force helicopters
operating in Chokwe and Chibuto districts had, by Friday, rescued
6,600 people.
</P>
<P>
The disasters management body believes that the number of people
affected by the floods in Gaza, Sofala, Maputo and Inhambane
provinces has risen to around two million.
</P>
<P>
Many of these people could be completely isolated with neither
food nor drinking water. The rivers have been contaminated by
carcasses of dead animals and human faeces.
</P>
<P>
The water levels in the flooded river valleys are now
subsiding, but there is a new danger lurking: there has been an
outbreak of malaria at the various accommodation centers. The
authorities are also on the alert for cases of cholera.
</P>
<P>
The authorities point out that there is still a shortage of
medicine and foodstuffs, and have called for more international
aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Friday about 30 helicopters and light aircraft
continued searching for people still stranded on roofs and tree
tops.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts to rescue more victims, five children were
found dead -- four drowned and one succumbed to hunger.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll has reached 200, but aid workers fear
that thousands could have died.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more aid continues to arrive. Britain, the United
States, Germany, France, and Spain have sent planes carrying
trucks, boats and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Help is not confined to the rich nations. Lesotho and Zambia
have provide their only cargo planes for the distribution of
medicines and foodstuffs.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Progress in Dialog With OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced on Saturday
that it has made significant progress in dialog with envoys of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United States over
peaceful settlement of Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
This is Ethiopia's first official statement over the recent
shuttle visits between Ethiopia and Eritrea by Ahmed Ouyahia,
special envoy of OAU Chairman and Algerian President Abdul Aziz
Bouteflika, and Antony Lake, special envoy of U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Both the OAU and the U.S. have reportedly been trying to seek a
possible way to make a breakthrough in political settlement of the
Ethio-Eritrean conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of
lives from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving any details about the dialogs, the Ethiopian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the OAU and its current
chairman have been striving in good faith to work out a peace
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The move "is clear and consistent with the peace plan endorsed
in Algiers and with the principle of the return to the status quo
ante on which the OAU peace plan is based", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Ethiopia's active engagement in a constructive dialog
with the OAU and its peace partners, the statement reiterated that
Ethiopia will, as always, continue cooperation with the OAU to
realize peaceful settlement of its war with Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Appeals for 21Million U.S. Dollar International Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Saturday
appealed for some 21 million U.S. dollars from the international
community to meet the humanitarian needs of food, shelter,
clothing and emergency supplies to the flood victims of the
tropical Cyclone Eline in the country.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 500,000 people were affected by the floods with
roughly 250,000 of them believed to be in need of urgent
assistance, the government said in a statement, adding that some
20,000 people were actually displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, over 70 people have lost their lives due to the
floods," the government said.
</P>
<P>
It said the relief items needed include three months' supply of
food worth over 250,000 U.S. dollars, 12,000 tents, 45,000
blankets, 4,000 temporary toilets, 100,000 plastic water
containers and 40,000 clothing items.
</P>
<P>
Other items include 100,000 square meters of plastic sheeting,
mosquito repellents, medical and surgical items and essential
services like primary health clinics.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has been providing emergency
assistance to most of the affected areas through the Civil
Protection Unit and local communities like churches and the
private and civil society at large.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Eline, which hit Zimbabwe on February 22, was preceded
by extensive rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the
country, resulting in the devastation of houses, crops and
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Veterans Refuse to Withdraw From White-Owned Farms </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans Association Saturday vowed to continue
occupying white-owned farms despite threats by Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa that they should move out by Saturday or
risk being arrested for breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of war veterans who converged at
headquarters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front on Saturday, chairman of the association
Chenjerai Hunzvi said the ex-combatants would remain at the farms
until the bill to necessitate compulsory land acquisition without
compensation is passed by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I do not care what Dabengwa said," Hunzvi said. "The people
want land and it must be given to them."
</P>
<P>
He said "President Robert Mugabe is supporting us and as a
result we should not listen to other things which are contrary to
this."
</P>
<P>
"The reactionary forces must know that we fought to liberate
this country, this is an economic warfare and we are the only ones
who can unite this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Land-hungry war veterans have invaded about 30 commercial farms
 countrywide since last month in a massive show of displeasure
over the rejection of the draft constitution and to exert pressure
on the government to speed up the land resettlement program.

HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Fuel supplies, which
have been in critical shortage since last November, are set to

</P>
<P>
The government task force on fuel, meeting on Saturday, noted

liters of Jet Al and seven million liters of petrol will be
released at the Beira Port on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Companies to Hold Exhibition in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish companies will hold a five-
day exhibition here starting from April 17, in a bid to promote
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) Saturday quoted a source at
the Iraqi Trade Ministry as saying that the Turkish companies will
display their products, ranging from food, medicine to
agricultural, irrigation and engineering equipments, as well as
electronic and office apparatus.
</P>
<P>
The trade exchange between Iraq and Turkey are mainly food and
medicine under the U.N. oil-for-food program launched in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to export a limited
amount of crude to finance imports of food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies to help offset the effects of the stringent
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition follows the visit to Iraq by the Turkish State
Minister Edip Safter Gaydali, who ended his five-day visit on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Gaydali held talks with Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan and the ministers of finance, trade, oil and
industry, on ways of strengthening and developing bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Upon departure, Gaydali said his visit to Iraq was "fruitful"
and "very positive," and voiced Ankara's willingness to expand the
spheres of cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to an expanded trade with Iraq within
the framework of the oil-for-food program," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, political relations have remained cool between the two
countries. Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the U.S.
and British war planes to take off from its bases to patrol the
northern no-fly zone, with the claimed aim of preventing Iraqi
government troops from attacking the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The restricted zone, along with a similar one in the south, was
set up by the allied forces following the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq never
recognizes the no-fly zones for their lack of U.N. authorization.

DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The president of the American
Chamber in Bangladesh Forrest Cookson said here Saturday that the
United States will urge Bangladesh to open up its gas and oil
sector during U.S.President Bill Clinton's visit to Bangladesh on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that our president should talk to both the prime
minister and leader of the opposition in regard to opening up the
gas and oil sector," Cookson said.
</P>
<P>
Cookson, however, dismissed the notion that U.S.-based
multinational companies engaged in oil and gas exploration worked
as the major catalyst to the visit of the U.S. president. He said
that even though the gas and oil sector accounts for much in the U.
S.-Bangladesh trade relations, it is not the major and lone reason
for President Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Micro Credit Program which provides credit to poor
farmers throughout the country and the democratic transition of
Bangladesh worked as the driving elements for the visit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Against Belgian Judge Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on Saturday
summoned Belgian ambassador to Tehran Guillaume Matin to lodge a
strong protest against a recent order given by a Belgian judge.
The Belgian judge has ordered a police investigation of charges
filed by an Iranian-born Belgian national that former Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani was responsible for kidnapping,
torture, harassment and psychological violence perpetrated between
April 1983 and February 1989 in Tehran and two other Iranian
cities.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian court move is an open example of interference in
Iran's internal affairs, said Bahram Qassemi, director general for
West Europe affairs at the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
Qassemi further added that the Belgian government should explicitly
clear its stance toward such an issue which he said is "completely
against legal and international rules."
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep regret over the incident, the Belgian ambassador
assured that he would rapidly convey the issue to his country and
would follow the case seriously, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tehran Times daily on Saturday termed the act by
the Belgian court as politically motivated, aiming to tarnishing
Rafsanjani's image.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary in any country shoulders a heavy responsibility, and
if any court decides to order investigation against officials of
other countries simply on allegations made against them, total
chaos will prevail, the paper said in a comment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Attack on Palestinians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday severely condemned Israel for
attacking civilian Palestinians following the Thursday clashes
between Israeli military forces and suspected Palestinian
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Asefi termed as a "clear example of state terrorism" the Israeli
attack on a building in the Israeli Arab town of Taibeh, in which
four Palestinians were killed and several others injured.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tel Aviv is the key element behind tension and
instability in the region, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also called on the international community
and human rights organizations to take more serious steps towards
safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Israeli military forces exchanged fire on
Thursday with a group of Palestinian terrorist suspects in an
apartment building in Taibeh and demolished the building following
an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources believed that the Palestinians, who
reportedly belong to the Islamic militant group Hamas, had been
preparing a large-scale suicide bomb attack in a major Israeli city
with an aim to sabotage the Israel-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which does not recognize Israel, has always insisted on
its opposition to the Middle East peace process and called for
military struggle to root out the Israeli regime.

<HEADLINE> Veteran CPI Leader Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Veteran leader of the Communist
Party of India (CPI) Geeta Mukherjee died here Saturday morning
following a massive heart attack, it was officially announced by
the party.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee, 76, who was the moving force behind the
controversial women's reservation bill, suffered a heart attack as
she was preparing to leave here for a party program in the north
Uttar Pradesh and died at her residence.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee joined the CPI as a student during the freedom
movement in the 1940s and fought for uplifting the downtrodden
women's rights throughout her life. She served as the party's
deputy leader in Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Indian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and Vice President Krishan
Kant expressed grief and sorrow on the sudden demise of Mukherjee
and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was among the first
prominent leaders to pay homage to her by placing a wreath on her
body.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee described her as a "true representative" of the people
of India who "tirelessly championed the cause of the poor and the
working class throughout her life," saying, "She was a shining
example of women's empowerment."
</P>
<P>
Born on January 8, 1924, Mukherjee, widow of veteran CPI leader
Bishwanath Mukherjee, was elected to the West Bengal Legislative
Assembly in 1967 and again in 1972. She was elected to the Lower
House of the Indian Parliament in 1980.
</P>
<P>
She was secretary of the CPI National Council and chairperson
of the Joint Select Committee on the reservation of one-third of
the seats for women in Lok Sabha and the legislative assemblies at
the state level.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Propose Free Trade With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is actively considering
to raise the issue of setting up a bilateral free-trade
arrangement with the United States during President Bill Clinton's
upcoming visit to the country, a high official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the press here, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria
said a free-trade arrangement would help Bangladesh's growing
export-oriented industries as the country's main export
destinations are the United States and Europe. The volume of
export would increase significantly if a free trade arrangement is
worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the increasing competitive market worldwide, the
minister said the future of the country's economic development in
the country would depend on the export base. "The free trade
arrangement would help in boosting our exports," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would gain from higher foreign investment from such
free trade arrangements, Kibria said, adding that investors from
the United States would be interested in taking advantage of the
lower labor cost in Bangladesh to produce for the American market.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's exports to the United States are
several times higher than its imports from that country. According
to official statistics, during fiscal 1999, Bangladesh's export to
the United States reached nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars while
import was worth 300 million dollars only.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Mobilized to Put out Bush Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
Ethiopians have been mobilized to extinguish wild fires spreading
in the south of the country for about three weeks, the Ethiopian
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 12,000 people have been deployed so far to put out
the fire that erupted in the Bale region, about 400 km south of
Addis Ababa, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the shortage of fire extinguishing implements has
hampered the efforts to snuff out the flame.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the blaze has destroyed dozens of houses
and nearly 27,000 hectares of virgin forest and coffee plantations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Many livestock and wild animals have also been burnt to death
in the bush fire, which has forced 13 species of wild animals to
flee the National Park of Bale Mountains, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The wild fire in the Borena region bordering with Kenya was
also reportedly out of control for weeks, with more than 30,000
hectares of forest having burned to ashes, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Ethiopian government appeal to help put out
the fire, Germany and South Africa have sent fire fighters to the
country, the state radio reported.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Voices Confidence in Austrian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Saturday reiterated his confidence that Austrian Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel will be able to counteract the negative
European Union (EU) reaction to the five far-right ministers in
his new government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Rome daily La Repubblica, Dini said that "I
have confidence in Schuessel," former Austrian foreign minister
whom he has met on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
"If the Austrian government moves in the right direction, we
can start a normalization of relations," Dini added.
</P>
<P>
The EU demoted its ties with Austria to a technical level and
refused international backing for Austrian candidates after
Schuessel's conservative People's Party formed a government with
Joerg Haider's anti-foreigner Freedom Party on February 4.
</P>
<P>
The EU confirmed its freeze after Haider quit the leadership of
the party a few days ago. He is to be replaced by Vice-Chancellor
Susanne Riess-Passer.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's interview, Dini said the EU initiative against
Austria was "fully justified," but adding that "we must view the
fact that Haider has resigned from the presidency of his party as
a positive fact."
</P>
<P>
Dini also assured La Repubblica that he "knows Chancellor
Schuessel very well, and Austria has not broken any of the clauses
of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the EU, Austria has behaved in an impeccable
way. And its agreement is essential to make the Union work. We
have to take that into account," Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Underlines Role of Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Science, technology and education
should start off before other businesses in the course of
implementing China's strategy of accelerating growth in its
western areas, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
The scientific and educational personnel should be provided
with improved living standards in the western area so that their
work enthusiasm will be brought into fuller play and more talents
be introduced into the area, Li said at a panel discussion with
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from the sectors of
education, literature and arts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the western area, enhanced efforts should be made
to translate technological research findings into commodities so
as to accelerate the growth of new and high-tech industries there,
Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vice-premier spoke highly of the members of
China's top advisory body for the advices and suggestions they had
made on implementing the strategy of invigorating China with
science, technology and education, promoting quality education and
popularizing the socialist ethical and moral education among the
youth.
</P>
<P>
In another panel discussion with representatives from the
circle of writers and performing artists, the vice-premier noted
that socialist culture and art constitutes an important integral
part of the cause of socialism, and art programs with better
quality should be created and cultural exchanges be further
increased so as to facilitate the socialist ethical and cultural
progress.
</P>
<P>
The culture and art of ethnic groups should be protected better
still, and traditional art forms should be geared to the
requirements of modern society, said CPPCC National Committee
members.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Reports of Peace Accord With Syria Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel has denied a local
television report that it will finish a peace accord with Syria
soon, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report that Israel and Syria will finalize a peace agreement
soon is groundless, the radio quoted Prime Minister's Office as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Television (Channel Nine) reported Friday night
that Israel and Syria will finalize a peace accord, which will
include an agreement on Lebanon, within four to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The television also said that soon after its finalization, the
peace accord will put to the cabinet for approval, then the Knesset
(parliament), and then be put to the people for approval in a
national referendum before the Jewish festival of Passover in late
April.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear that from where the Channel Nine got such
information and the Prime Minister's Office has to deny this report
because it is not true, the office added.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, who attended a late night
program at Channel Nine Friday night, refused to comment on whether
Israel will finalize a peace accord with Syria with four to five
weeks, saying only the television report was "a good guess."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks by the end of 1999. The
talks have been stalled in January after the two sides held two
rounds of talks in the United States due to Israel's refusal of
promising to return the entire Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Besides Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights which Israel
occupied during the 1967 Middle East War, security arrangement,
normalization of ties and water, will also be settled in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Due to Syria's good relations with Lebanon, reaching a peace
agreement between Israel and Syria could help solve Israel's troop
withdrawal from the security zone in south Lebanon, which Israeli
set up in 1985 with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its
northern areas from cross border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

KHARTOUM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Harry Johnston
arrived here Saturday for the first visit since his appointment
last August, which is believed to focus on peace, human rights and
relief to famine-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Johnston is expected to hold talks
with Sudanese government officials, including President Omar Hassan
el-Bashir and Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail, and
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper quoted Social Planning
Minister Qotbi al-Mahdi as saying,"Johnston will discuss the main
issues of peace, human rights and relief."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on
Friday that Johnston would also raise the issue of the bombing of
civilians in Khartoum's fight against rebels in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government initially rejected the appointment of
Johnston, saying Bill Clinton's decision did not recognize Sudanese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The envoy met Sudanese officials and leading rebel leaders,
including Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John Garang,
in Nairobi last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Washington imposed sanctions on Sudan's
state-owned oil company Sudapet amid fears Khartoum was allegedly
using oil revenues to fuel the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Sudan denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million people have been killed in Sudan's civil
war. The SPLA is seeking more autonomy for the mainly Christian and
animist south from the Arab, Muslim north.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that Johnston's visit imply a change in the
Sudanese-U.S. ties, which might be triggered by the sidelining of
Hassan al-Turabi, former Sudanese parliament speaker who has been
associated with anti-U.S. hardline Islamists, from mainstream
politics in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Turkmenistan Call for Afghan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Turkmenistan
Saturday stressed the need for the return of peace and stability
to the war-ravaged Afghanistan, saying the whole region would
benefit immensely from the end of the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
The call was made during talks here between visiting Foreign
Minister of Turkmenistan Boris Shikhmuradov and his Pakistani
counterpart, Abdul Sattar.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered a wide range of subjects and the two sides
held an "in-depth exchange on enhancement of bilateral cooperation
in various fields specially in developing communication and
economic links," according to a statement of the Pakistan Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan situation was among the issues to which priority was
given during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions were held on important regional and international
issues with special emphasis on Afghanistan and Kashmir," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov, who is also vice-premier of the Central Asian
republic, briefed the Pakistani side on the peace talks between
Afghanistan's Taliban militia and its opposition in the Turkmen
capital of Ashgabat last year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister also stressed the need for
resolving the long-standing Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and
India through peaceful dialogue, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Pakistan and Turkmenistan are members of the "Six Plus Two
"group on the Afghan issue, which comprises Afghanistan's six
immediate neighbors plus the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the protracted Afghan civil war would pave
the way for an ambitious plan to lay a proposed giant pipeline to
transport natural gas from Turkmenistan's gas fields to Pakistan
via Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov, who arrived here on Saturday morning, will also
call on Pakistan's President Rafiq Tarar, Chief Executive General
Pervez Musharraf and Minister of Petroleum Usman Aminuddin during
his three-day stay here.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Allows U.S.,British Task Force to Use Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Saturday
allowed U.S. and British task forces to use its air base to launch
rescue and relief efforts for Mozambican flood victims, thus
ending a diplomatic wrangling.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria gave green light after Mozambique officially requested
South Africa to permit U.S. and British teams to use the
Hoedspruit air base in the Mpumalanga province, the South African
Department of Foreign Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
An advance team for the British task force was turned away from
 Hoedspruit on Friday night, while the U.S. fleet was delaying its
departure pending clearance to use the base.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British teams prefer Hoedspruit because it
provided, among others, hangar space for helicopters to be
assembled under shelter.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs Director-General Sipho Pityana on
Saturday played down suggestions that diplomatic problems had been
delaying relief efforts in flood-stricken Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am aware, there is no diplomatic hitch," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"All of us are involved in efforts to assist the Mozambican
government. In that regard, all of us have to be directed by the
Mozambican authorities. "
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was prepared to render assistance to
international relief teams, but had to await an official request
in each case from Mozambique to do so.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the British Embassy in Pretoria, Richard
Morgan, on Saturday said a British Tristar landed at Hoedspruit on
Friday night, but was refused permission to stay.
</P>
<P>
They were told they had no clearance to land there, and were
forced to fly to Johannesburg where they spent the night.
</P>
<P>
A second British Tristar carrying helicopters was already on
its way to South Africa by Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the two aircraft will converge at
Hoedspruit by 2 pm Saturday afternoon," Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had so far spent more than 4.2 million rand
(666,000 US dollars) to airlift 12,142 Mozambicans trapped by
floods to safety and deliver 577 tons of food aid, according to
South African Press Association.

<HEADLINE> SW China Region Ready for Economic Take-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The ethnic minority economy in
southwestern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will be
fueled with hundreds of billions of yuan under the country's
strategic plan to develop the spacious, lackluster western region.
</P>
<P>
Li Yaozhuo, chairman of the regional people's government, said
recently that the anticipated economic boom will help to shrink
the economic gap between the huge western expanse and the eastern
coastal area in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
His target is based on a series of tactics designed to
invigorate the regional economy, ranging from infrastructure
development and improving its outlets to the South China Sea for
its products, and poverty elimination to tourism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to utilizing ample mineral resources, the region
will tap new growth potential by developing bio-engineering
technology, promoting herbal medicine, and upgrading technology in
industrial processing.
</P>
<P>
A number of large-scale water-conservation projects will begin
operation in Guangxi, including the 5.6-billion cu.m. Baise
Reservoir and the Longtan Hydro-Power Project, which is said to be
second only to the world's largest hydro-power project underway at
the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region has shouldered the important ecological
responsibility of returning some 200,000 ha. farmland to forest
and grassland to protect the headwaters of the Pearl River and
other rivers running through tourist spots. It plans to stop
farming on 110,000 ha in the coming two years.

<HEADLINE> Gender Little Affects Parents' Care for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese parents are getting rid of
the old "boy first, girl second" attitude, and are now judging
their children according to their conduct.
</P>
<P>
Some 212 parents among a survey of 360 families conducted by
the Tianjin Education Research Institute in this north China port
city said they are pleased with a girl as well as a boy, and what
they really care about is their children's character, school
grades, and IQs.
</P>
<P>
Unlike earlier times, the survey also shows that 73 families
said they would prefer to have a girl, while 69 preferred boys.
</P>
<P>
The reason may be that girls show more consideration for their
parents, and they will not be a heavy financial burden for their
families when they marry.
</P>
<P>
In China, it is, in most cases, the husband's family that pays
for most of the wedding cost, said Meng Yuqun, the professor in
charge of the survey.
</P>
<P>
Also, according to the survey, children's appearances and
characteristics influence fathers more, demonstrating the truth of
the old Chinese saying that "maternal love is unconditional."
</P>
<P>
Rural families were once extremely fond of boys, as in the
parents' minds a boy would become a needed worker and care for his
parents in their old age.
</P>
<P>
Family planning policy now allows rural families to have
another baby if their first is a girl.
</P>
<P>
Girls used to be the first ones deprived of the opportunity for
an education if the family could only afford it for one child, in
spite of the fact that the 1986 Constitution of the People's
Republic of China stipulates that all the children at the age of
six are entitled to receive nine years of compulsory education
regardless of sex, ethnic group or race.
</P>
<P>
Technological development makes knowledge rather than labors a
valuable commodity now, and publicity and family planning policy
nationwide have changed the minds of many, according to officials.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Soldier Appeals for Worldwide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier will
appeal for international support after he was convicted in a
Japanese court for telling the truth about the war crimes
committed by Japanese troops in Nanjing, China, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, 88, was a soldier in the Japanese brigade that
occupied Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In
the following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians. Shiro recorded the atrocities in a secret
diary.
</P>
<P>
He published his diary in April 1996, and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken against
him.
</P>
<P>
Shiro took his case to a higher court but his appeal was
denied in December, 1998. He was convicted by the Japanese Supreme
Court early this year.
</P>
<P>
"I will not only continue the appeal in Japan, but will appeal
for worldwide support for justice and truth through the United
Nations," Shiro said today in Shanghai, the last stop on his tour
of China. He visited Nanjing, Beijing and Shenyang cities in the
past week to seek new evidence and public backing.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Shiro claimed that the man who sued him took part
in war crimes, including one particularly horrific incident in
which he forced a Chinese civilian into a sack soaked in gasoline
and fastened shut with hand grenades, then ignited the sack and
kicked it into a pond in front of what was then the Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tokyo High Court ruled that there was never such a
pond in front of the Nanjing Supreme Court in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 items of evidence, such as maps and aerial photos,
have been provided throughout China, which proved the ponds in
front of the court did exist then, according to Zhu Chengshan,
curator of the Memorial Hall of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 Chinese people mailed letters to the memorial hall
to express their support for Shiro, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"I must continue the appeal because this has not been my
personal issue. I believe the world opinion will strongly support
the historical facts and justice," Shiro said.

<HEADLINE> "Lei Feng Spirit" Reemphasized in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In the past few days Chinese
people have marked the 37th anniversary of the late Chairman Mao
Zedong's call to "Learn from Lei Feng" by donating blood, planting
trees, cleaning streets and helping others.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, China's most famous symbol of sacrifice for others,
was born in 1940 in central China's Hunan Province. He died on
August 15, 1962, in an accident at the age of 22. During his short
life, Lei Feng performed countless Good Samaritan-style acts.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng's name has been widely known to the vast majority of
Chinese since Mao made the call and wrote the special inscription
to "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng" on March 5, 1963. March is
designated as the month in which Chinese remember Lei by donating
their spare time to social causes.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of east China's Jiangsu Province, more
than 12 million young people have volunteered for various
charitable projects over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers help keep traffic order, clean streets, plant
trees, fight floods, relieve poverty, teach in the countryside,
and help out in orphanages and welfare houses.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers with the PLA's Shenyang Military Area Command, where
Lei Feng worked as a truck driver nearly 38 years ago, vie to
become model soldiers and spread "Lei Feng spirit" to primary and
middle schools and universities in China.

<HEADLINE> CPC Represents Advanced Productive Forces: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The key to running China well lies
with the Communist Party of China (CPC), according to a commentary
to be carried tomorrow in China's leading newspaper the People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the paper says as long
as the CPC represents advanced productive forces, advanced culture
and the interests of the Chinese people, it will enjoy the support
of all nationalities and remain invincible.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that the top priority of the CPC is to
embody the development needs of an advanced society. Higher
productive forces added to an advanced social system will ensure
China stands tall among all nations.
</P>
<P>
All of its policies are geared toward promoting productive
forces, strengthening the national economy, and improving people's
living standards, it says, adding that this is the mission of the
Chinese Communists.
</P>
<P>
The commentary highlights the past two decades, during which
the CPC has done its utmost to enhance the nation's productive
forces, and hence China has achieved successes that have attracted
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that the CPC will focus on science and technology
as they are primary productive forces, and will attach great
importance to training scientific and technical talents and to
developing the cause of science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Delta to Become Eco-Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program involves a 200-million-yuan irrigation project, a
66,000-hectare forest park, a mammoth garden and other development
projects.
</P>
<P>
As one of three largest deltas in China, the Yellow River Delta
around Dongying City in eastern Shandong Province is suffering
from shrinking wetland, desertification and salinization, said
Dongying mayor Shi Jun, a deputy to the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment on the Yellow River Delta, where
China's second largest oilfield Shengli locates, has had negative
impacts on the ecological environment of Shandong Peninsula,
Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In an inspection tour to Dongying City in June 1999, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin called for accelerating construction and
development of the Yellow River Delta and turning the delta into a
new and prosperous zone with beautiful environment.
</P>
<P>
Development and ecological protection of the Yellow River Delta
has also attracted close attention of the international community.
The United Nations Development Program has listed the delta's
development and eco-protection projects as a priority on its aid
list in developing countries. A great number of experts and
business people from both home and abroad have visited the area.
</P>
<P>
With its rich deposits of oil and gas, favorable geographic
location and convenient communications conditions, the Yellow
River Delta has a bright future and will be turned into an eco-
economic zone early next century, concluded a report released by
40 specialists from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the
Chinese Research Institute of Forestry who conducted many study
tours to the delta.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Water Resources recently approved the irrigation project in
Dongying City which will cover 122,000 ha of farmland. And
construction of the 66,000-hectare forest park is now underway.
</P>
<P>
After completion of those projects, the ecology-based economy
at the delta is expected to take off, experts said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Opening of NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily carries on
Sunday an editorial entitled "For the Prosperity of the Motherland
and Well-being of the People" to mark the opening of the third
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The session is a great event in the political life of the
country. NPC deputies are expected to carefully examine strategic
issues concerning reform, opening up and socialist modernization
and make decisions accordingly, the People's Daily says.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China achieved its goal for economic growth and made
new achievements in all fields, the editorial says. It claims that
last year's three political campaigns against NATO's bombing of
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, Lee Teng-hui's "two-state"
statement, and the Falun Gong cult had created a sound political
environment for the country to concentrate on economic work.
</P>
<P>
To do this year's job well is of great importance for achieving
the country's cross-century goal, the paper says. In the new year,
"we must hold higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
continue implementing the spirit of the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the fourth session of the
15th CPC Central Committee," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for an all-around implementation of
policies concerning reform, opening up and socialist modernization
and correctly handling the relationship between reform,
development and stability, adding China should achieve development
amid stability, while maintaining social stability in the process
of reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Experience of the past five decades proves that only under the
leadership of the CPC and by firmly taking a socialist road with
China's own characteristics has China been able to become a
prosperous country and make its people happy and prosperous, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it says, the Party and the government must go all
out for the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the
people.
</P>
<P>
For years, the NPC, as the country top law-making body, has
been exercising its powers and functions endorsed by the
Constitution and has given remarkable push to the process of
governing the nation according to law, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress system is the fundamental political
system of the country and is expected keep improving and play an
increasingly bigger role, along with the development of reform,
opening up and social modernization, it says.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Asked to Play Still Bigger Role in Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade Unions should work harder
still to press ahead with the whole-hearted implementation of the
Communist Party of China (CPC)'s guiding principle of relying on
the working class and carry out their functions of safeguarding
the rights and interests of enterprise employees.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, made the remarks here today during his visit to members of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from the sector of trade unions
who are attending the current annual session of the CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Taking Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line as the
guidelines, and implementing the spirit of the 15th CPC National
Congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15th CPC Central
Committee, trade unions across the country should arouse factory
workers to contribute more to achieving the goal of the
government's three-year State enterprise reform program, according
to Wei, who is member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade union organizations should help further
improve democratic supervision in enterprises, Wei said, and all
State-owned enterprises should have representatives of employees
join the board of directors and the board of supervisors to
maintain and improve the system of the workers' representative
conference and further effect democratic enterprise management
system.
</P>
<P>
At present, Wei noted, as there are the occurrence of quite a
number of cases concerning infringement into workers and staff
members' rights and interests because of the existence of
bureaucracy and corruption among enterprise leaders, so it is an
arduous job for trade unions to protect the rights and interests
of their workers.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Wei today also called on those members
of the CPPCC National Committee, who are representing returned
overseas Chinese to attend the ongoing 3rd session of the Ninth
CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Emphasizes Prosperity and Stability for Hong Kong, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
urged today greater support for maintaining long-term prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, which he said is a common
wish of all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin made the remark at a joint-group discussion
attended by National Committee members of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from Hong Kong and Macao
Special Administrative Regions (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao, after they returned to the motherland,
have both entered a new development period characterized by
freedom from foreign colonial rule and by self-administration
under the framework of "One Country, Two Systems", Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed satisfaction at Hong Kong's economic recovery
and stability, speaking highly of the work of the HKSAR Government
and reiterating that the motherland will continue to provide
strong backing for Hong Kong and Macao in maintaining their
prosperity and stability and overcoming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Realities in Hong Kong during the last two years and more have
fully indicated that the concept of 'one country, two systems' is
correct and the principles of 'Hong Kong people administrating
Hong Kong' and 'a high degree of autonomy' are viable," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang talked about the smooth return of Macao last December and
the current favorable situation in the region. He expressed his
belief that the Macao Sar has a bright and promising future, which
he said is guaranteed by a firm implementation of the principles
of "one country, two systems", "Macao People administering Macao"
and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, the CPPCC National Committee members
also voiced opinions on topics such as reunifying the motherland,
speeding up the development of western areas, accelerating
economic development in Macao and strengthening ties between Hong
Kong and the inland areas after China joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and overseas Chinese fully
support the Chinese government's stance of resolving the Taiwan
question soon so as to achieve a complete reunification of the
motherland, according to discussion participants.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should go with the historical trend and
give up their "State-to-State" fallacy to facilitate the
development of cross-Strait relations and achieve an early and
complete reunification of the motherland, a National Committee
member of the CPPCC urged in the discussion.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Regional Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military officer on
Saturday urged Gulf countries to strengthen military cooperation in
order to restore peace in the region and end foreign military
presence.
</P>
<P>
"We have announced our readiness to ink defense accords with
regional countries," and cooperation in the military field will
prevent infiltration of the foreign powers into the strategic
Persian Gulf region, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rear
Admiral Abbas Mohtaj, commander of the naval forces, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the Iran's nine-day "Vahdat(Unity) 78" war
games in the Gulf, which ended on Friday, was meant to send the
message of unity and friendship to states in this region.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in launching joint military operations with
neighboring states in order to restore peace and stability to the
Gulf region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise was jointly held by the armed forces and
the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps with small battle boats,
destroyers, helicopters, C-130 planes, hovercraft and speed boats
equipped with improved missile systems.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj said the exercise had achieved all its pre-determined
objectives. "Deployment of modern defense instruments, designed and
manufactured by the Iranian experts for the first time, is one of
the major characteristics of the war games," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has the potential to manufacture the most
modern and complicated defense instruments, adding domestic experts
are designing a new submarine to be manufactured in the near future
inside the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with its Gulf neighbors have improved
considerably since moderate President Mohammed Khatami came to
power in 1997. The Islamic republic has repeatedly called for
regional cooperation to end U.S. and British military presence in
the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Be Pressured to Sign CTBT: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said here on Saturday that his country will not
succumb to any pressure on the issue of signing the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"India will not come under any pressure to sign the CTBT,"
Vajpayee was quoted by the Press Trust of India (PTI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that "India's sovereignty and rights
will be preserved."
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other countries have repeatedly
urged India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT since the two countries
conducted nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The PTI said Vajpayee's remarks "assume significance" because
they were made just a couple of weeks ahead of U.S. President Bill

<HEADLINE> 500 Stone Relics from Imperial Garden Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
determined that the 500-plus stone relics recently dug up by road
construction workers in northwestern Beijing belong to
Yuanmingyuan, an imperial garden of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The precious relics have been returned to Yuanmingyuan, where
they will be used to reconstruct old buildings in the garden,
known for its exquisite blend of different styles of gardens in
China and the West.
</P>
<P>
The stone sculptures and inscriptions were discovered in the
capital city's Haidian District during the construction of the
fourth ring road that will circle the periphery of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmingyuan, built over a 150-year period from 1709-1859,
covers 330 hectares. It was destroyed in a fire set by British and
French forces in October, 1860. And in 1900, it was again looted
and burned by the Eight-Power Allied Forces.
</P>
<P>
Emperors of the Qing Dynasty enjoyed leisure hours in the
magnificent garden, and many ministers built their homes near it.
Documents from the period show, however, that the ministers
secretly carted away cultural relics from the imperial garden and
buried them in their backyards.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe that more similar treasures will be
discovered with the further development of Zhongguancun, known as
China's Silicon Valley, located in the northwestern part of
Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today called
on compatriots across the Taiwan Straits to cherish their
brotherly affection and join efforts for the realization of
reunification of the motherland at an early date.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made the call during his visit this morning to
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are representing the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, and All-China Federation of
Taiwan Compatriots to attend the current third annual session of
the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
accompanied President Jiang during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who also participated in a joint panel of the CPPCC
National Committee members from the three groups, described the
return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland as major victories
on the way to the fulfillment of the reunification of the
motherland, stressing that the eventual settlement of Taiwan issue
and realization of the complete reunification of the motherland
have been an even more ardent aspiration and demand by the entire
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of
resolving the Taiwan Issue and accomplish the great cause of the
motherland at an early date, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president pledged to continue carrying out the
basic principle of "peaceful reunification", and "one country, two
systems" and his 1995 eight-point proposals on the cross-straits
relations and promoting the process of the reunification of the
motherland. The white paper, titled "The One-China Principle and
the Taiwan Issue", which was issued recently, has given a full
expression to the firm stance of the entire Chinese people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that peaceful reunification represents the
best way of resolving the Taiwan Issue, which is in the interest
of the Taiwan compatriots, the whole Chinese people, and peace and
development in the Asian Pacific Region as well as the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"For the fundamental interests of compatriots across the
straits, we will exert our utmost and greatest possibility to

<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "we will definitely not commit to
abandoning the use of force." the Chinese government will have to
adopt all possible, determined measures to safeguard the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, provided major incidents
causing Taiwan to separate from China occurred under any premise,
provided Taiwan is invaded and occupied by any foreign power, or
provided Taiwan Authorities postpones indefinitely the peacefully
settlement of reunification issue by negotiations. "This has been
our consistent position," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are in firm opposition to any ghosts and
evils, and any schemes detrimental to the fundamental interests of
the Chinese nation, such as "Taiwan Independence", "two Chinas"
and "one China, one Taiwan", will never succeed, no matter
whichever Taiwan-based political parties and factions have been
involved and whatever outside political forces are backing them up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Jiang acknowledged that Taiwan compatriots
have a glorious tradition of patriotism. "We have consistently and
sincerely been placing our hopes on the people of Taiwan," he said.
He also expressed the conviction that Taiwan compatriots are sure
to make the correct choice on major issues regarding the State
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the fundamental interests
of the Chinese nation, and the destiny and future of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect the wish of Taiwan compatriots as the masters
of their own destiny and to develop economy, and to safeguard
their own interests. We are ready to undertake extensive contacts
and exchanges with all Taiwan-based parties, groups and
individuals who are adhering to the One-China Principle, for the
increase in mutual understanding and consensus, and making joint
efforts to promote the cross-straits relations and peaceful
reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to resume the cross-straits talks and negotiations on
the basis of the One-China Principle as conditions mature, to
resolve disputes across the straits through consultations, so as
to pave the way for the growth of the cross-straits relations and
lay the foundation for the eventual accomplishment of the
reunification of the motherland," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan compatriots should be helped and facilitated to have an
all-around recognition and correct understanding of the central
government's policies on Taiwan issue and to further deepen their
knowledge about the Chinese mainland, thus creating favorable
conditions for resolving the Taiwan issue at an early date,
President Jiang said.

</P>
<P>
Zhu joined some members of the Ninth National Committee of the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Flies Third Batch of Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday flew another batch
of 114 pilgrims for Mecca, Saudi Arabia to perform the annual
rituals of haj, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the third group of pilgrims that the Iraqi authorities
sent to Saudi Arabia for the haj, which begins on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Airways planes on Wednesday and Friday flew over 220
elderly pilgrims as well as Iraq's Minister of Religious Endowment
and Religious Affairs Abdel Mouna'm Ahmed Saleh to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The flights are aimed at meeting the humanitarian needs of the
elderly pilgrims who can not travel by land. Iraq plans to send a
total of 7,000 pilgrims to Mecca this year, 3,000 more than last
year but fewer than the 22,000 quotas it is allowed by the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Thursday formally rejected the U.N. proposed
arrangements for its haj pilgrims, saying that they were too late
for this year's pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal that the U.N. Security Council agreed on
Wednesday, each Iraqi pilgrim would be given 250 U.S. dollars in
cash and 1,750 dollars in traveller check by the U.N. from
Baghdad's oil revenue account without being transferred through
Iraq's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Iraq previously demanded the U.N. deposit 49.4 million dollars
in oil sales revenues in a U.N. escrow account so that poor Iraqis
could perform the haj.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year in a row since 1997 that Iraq flew
pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Last year, Iraq sent three planeloads of
pilgrims to Mecca for the haj, in defiance of the air ban imposed
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has exempted air travel to Islam's
most sacred sites in Mecca from the sweeping sanctions on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Adopts Broad Strategies to Develop Inforcomm Manpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister for Communications and Information Technology Yeo
Cheow Tong made the statement at the Singapore Computer Society
Gala Dinner Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The three strategies announced include enhancing an environment
to nurture a net-savvy workforce, attracting and retaining
international talents and establishing Singapore as the e-Learning
hub for the region.
</P>
<P>
An Infocomm Manpower Committee was formed to discuss high level
issues and make recommendations to the government relating to
infocomm manpower and a number of measures have been set forth to
implement the strategies.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry has set a target to have 30 percent of
the school curriculum computer-based and plans to continuously
upgrade and review school curriculum to train students to be
infocomm specialists and application developers.
</P>
<P>
Several bodies from the government and the trade unions will
develop national E-CREST program to train participants in core
infocomm skills.
</P>
<P>
The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) will embark on focused
recruitment trips to attract international inforcomm talents and
students and to facilitate work pass applications for them.
</P>
<P>
Various government bodies such as the IDA and the Ministry of
Manpower will collaborate with the industry to put in place an e-
Learning infrastructure and develop on-line content.
</P>
<P>
A recent industry survey shows that at the end of 1999, the
number of infocomm manpower in Singapore was estimated at 93,000
with 19 percent of them involved in networking, 17 percent in
operations/technical support, 16 percent in sales and marketing
and 13 percent in software research and development and 10 percent
in management.
</P>
<P>
Foreseeing there will be a surge in demand for infocomm
manpower as a result of the growth in e-business, the industry has
projected a need for 250,000 infocomm manpower by 2010, which is
more than two-and-a-half times the current manpower.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Plans to Meet With Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shihab did not give the exact date of the president's meeting
with Soeharto, saying it "may be in the middle of next week."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the president has asked permission to meet
with Soeharto from the former president's eldest daughter Siti
Hardiyanti Rukmana.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting is part of a series of meetings with
Indonesian figures -- with former President B.J. Habibie on
Saturday and with suspended Coordinating Minister of Political and
Security Affairs General Wiranto on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been named a suspect by the Attorney General's
Office in a probe into the alleged corruption during his 32-year-
rule.
</P>
<P>
But the 78-year-old Soeharto failed to answer a summons at the
Attorney General's Office last month. His lawyers said their
client was too ill to meet the requirement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Wahid-Habibie meeting on Saturday, Shihab said
it was only a "friendly get-together."
</P>
<P>
Shihab said Habibie plans to go on a two-week visit to Germany
to seek health treatment and attend a meeting with German
industrialists late this month.
</P>
<P>
Wahid told Habibie that during the visit to Germany, he should
be accompanied by a minister who will also be tasked to promote
the investment climate in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the president is also slated to open a
meeting to be held by the Habibie Center here. South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung is scheduled to attend the meeting in May.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Philippine Economic Outlook Remains Bullish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A significant improvement in
revenue collections, surging exports and other rosy indicators
during the first quarter of 2000 show that the outlook remains
bullish for the Philippine economy this year, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio-TV program here with other senior officials,
Director General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and
Development Authority said interest rates of the benchmark 91-day
treasury bills are still below 9 percent, with inflation
registering a low of 2.6 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
"Early reports we have received showed a drastic increase in
electricity sales in the industry sector last January. Some
selected companies such as San Miguel Corporation are reporting
sales increases of 10 to 20 percent. In short, we did good last
December, January and February," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same program, Acting Commissioner Renato Ampil of the
Bureau of Customs said that for the first two months of the year,
customs revenue targets already exceeded 800 million pesos (20
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chairman Dakila Fonacier of the Bureau of International Revenue
reported a similar positive output at his bureau, with 3.5 billion
pesos (8.7 million dollars) in excess of its cumulative goal
recorded for the first two months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in the program that
the pump priming efforts of the government last year is now
starting to show results, as manifested by more jobs and higher
incomes in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
A very simple, but classic proof of this, he said, is the
increase in the sales of non-essential goods, such as beer, which
shows that people have extra money to buy these products.
</P>
<P>
"We created jobs in the countryside and this gave people extra
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Manuel Roxas said exports last year increased
significantly to 35 billion dollars, with electronics accounting
for 72 percent of this growth.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the strong showing of the agriculture
sector, which grew 6.49 percent last year, also helped pull down
inflation and keep prices of basic commodities stable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government projected a 3.5- to 4-percent growth
for the country's gross domestic product in 2000, lower than other
Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Benefit from Debt Relief Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among 20 countries to
benefit from the 400 million U.S. dollars Britain has committed to
a debt relief trust fund under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative, British ambassador to Zambia Thomas Young said.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the British high commission said Young
stressed his government's support for the HIPC initiative,
Saturday's Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The initiative aimed to reduce the debts of over 20 of the
world's poorest countries by the end of the year, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Young encouraged the Zambian government to pursue its strategy
for reducing poverty in the country through debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku
hoped that the Paris Club of creditor nations will grant Zambia
relief under HIPC at a meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1998 alone, 120 million dollars accounting for 69
percent of social budget was paid to Paris Club and multilateral
creditors.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sentences between three to six years
in jail and a fine between 20 to 100 billion Turkish liras (equal
to 33,333 to 166,666 U.S. dollars) for hackers are under
consideration in Turkey, the Ministry of Culture has announced.
</P>
<P>
A new law against computer pirates, known as "hackers,"who
attack Internet companies and sites, is being drafted by the
Ministry, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry told reporters that as other
countries are also considering to adopt anti-hacker legislation,
Turkey wanted to take precautions before it faced this serious
problem.
</P>
<P>
The ministry suggested to add an extra article, related to the
banning of illegal activities in the computer world, to the "
Intellectual Property and Art Law" which is currently being
modified.
</P>
<P>
The official added that all rights concerning presentation or
any kind of production on the Internet would be protected against
hackers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new overhaul by the Ministry of Culture, hackers will
be dissuaded from entering private pages on the Internet without
permission and from producing and distributing the illegal copy
versions of original works on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, accepted as a candidate for membership of the 15-member
European Union last December, has tried its utmost to act in
accordance with the standards and norms required by the European

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A team of homoeopaths in
Malaysia Saturday claimed to have found a cure for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome(AIDS).
</P>
<P>
The team discovered the remedy after a two-year research, its
head Amir Hamzah Abdul Hamid told a news conference in Malacca,
145 kilometers south from here, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the treatment which takes 3 to 6 months,
AIDS patients would be able to fight the human immuno deficiency
virus(HIV) which causes AIDS through the build-up of cells which
were resilient to withstand the virus.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has been informed of the breakthrough, he
said, hoping the ministry would accord its recognition.
</P>
<P>
He said that tests had been conducted on 20 inmates of a drug

<HEADLINE> Some 19 Kilograms of Heroin Seized in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police confiscated more than
19 kilograms of heroin worth around 500 billion Turkish Liras
(about 0.88 million U.S. dollars) in the southeastern province of
Hakkari on Friday, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to tips, the provincial police intercepted a car going
from Yuksekova to the neighboring province of Van and discovered
the heroin hidden in a special compartment.
</P>
<P>
The driver was arrested and an investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report quoted a U.S. State Department report as
saying that the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is still
engaged in drug trafficking, although it has lost much influence
following the death sentence of its leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Turkey's geographic location still makes
it a prime transit country for drugs smuggling from Asia to Europe.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the report said, a total of 2.2 tons of heroin were
seized and over 5,000 smugglers were arrested by the Turkish
security forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government's
policy of not censoring the Internet will stay, Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie affirmed
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is some misunderstanding over the policy, he
stressed that there would be no censorship in the Internet's usage.
</P>
<P>
"The government's open policy remains. It has no intention to
block access to the Internet," the minister told reporters after
addressing the small-and medium-scale industries E-commerce
Roadshow in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
As such, the free flow of information over the net, whether
truthful or not, would still be allowed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Bernama news agency, Deputy Prime
Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Saturday also
stressed that the government is steadfast in its policy of not
curbing the dissemination of information on the Internet and the
public would not be curtailed in their quest to seek information
through such facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We understand and appreciate the right to disseminate
information through cyberspace, internet and such facilities,"
Abdullah was quoted as saying in an interview with the Bernama

</P>
<P>
Both Leo Moggie and Abdullah made the statements following
press reports quoting Deputy Home Minister Chor Chee Heung as
saying on Thursday that the government would take strict action,
including revoking or suspending the permit of Harakah, the
official newspaper of the opposition Parti Islam Se Malaysia (PAS),
if its Internet edition is published more than twice a month.
</P>
<P>
Denying the reports, Chor said in a statement "At no time did I
state that the government will take action against Harakah if it
published more than two on-line issues a month as is the condition
attached for its printed version."
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry renewed Harakah's annual publication permit
on Wednesday but with a new condition, that is, its frequency of
publication cut to twice monthly from twice weekly.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Escalates HIV Transmission in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a meeting in Lusaka to mark Women's Week, an official from
the association said more efforts were needed to control the
transmission, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Margaret Siwale, Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines paediatrics consultant, as saying of the three
million children infected with HIV in the last two years, 90
percent were from Africa.
</P>
<P>
Siwale said this caused by devastating poverty, which led to
inadequate measures to control child infections.
</P>
<P>
She added breastfeeding, maternal clinical conditions,
premature births, viral burden as well as maternal immune system
greatly contributed to child infections.
</P>
<P>
She said that the nutritional status of the mother, viral
strain and duration of labor increased chances of the mother
transmitting the virus to the baby.
</P>
<P>
Newborn babies usually contract the HIV through breast feeding
while the unborn ones get infected during the last four to six
weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
She, however, assured that efforts by medical authorities were
being made to curb baby infections.
</P>
<P>
She called on the donor community, business houses and the
community to participate in preventing and controlling baby
infection in Africa.

The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted an army

Friday in the capital Nairobi that another Kenyan peace mission
team will be sent after the end of this year if the U.N.
Assistant Mission in Sierra Leone is not concluded.

However, Abdullahi did not mention the number of soldiers to be
sent for the next mission and also could not state when the U.N.
peace assignment in Sirra Leone will end.

"This tournament marks the first time of using 40 millimeter

<P>
ITTF decided at its general meeting a week ago to increase the
diameter of the table tennis ball from 38 mm to 40 mm beginning
October 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Legislation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National People's
Congress, China's legislature, will step up legislation to achieve
the goal of basically establishing a socialist legal system with
Chinese characteristics by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, spokesman for the Third Session of the Ninth NPC,
said at a press conference here this morning that the Ninth NPC
will set its legislative agenda at the upcoming session, which
includes speeding up revising the Corporate Law, drafting a social
security law, strengthening legislation in education, science and
technology, formulating and revising laws in financial services,
international trade and economic cooperation, speeding up the
drafting of a supervision law, completing the revision of an
autonomy law for regions inhabited predominantly by ethnic
minority people.
</P>
<P>
"The Ninth NPC will strive to draft a civil code before its
term expires in 2003," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The Third Session of the Ninth NPC is scheduled to open
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The NPC has enacted more than 370 laws and decisions of a legal
nature since the launch of the reform and opening-up drive in 1979,
with the Ninth NPC having adopted 44 of such laws and decisions,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Council has formulated more than 800
administrative laws and regulations during the period, while the
people's congresses at local levels and their standing committees
have enacted more than 7,000 local laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"With the enactment of these laws and regulations, the
framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics
has been basically established," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming NPC session is scheduled to review and enact a
legislation law to standardize the nation's legislative work. (

<P>
Zeng also pointed out that the NPC and its standing committee
will continue to step up anti-corruption legislation in the future.
</P>
<P>
In that regard the NPC and its standing committee have adopted
a decision to crack down on economic crimes and additional
regulations on punishing criminal offences such as bribery, graft
and smuggling, added a special chapter dealing with graft and
bribery to the Criminal Law, and formulated an administrative
supervision law and an administrative penalty law.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also told the conference that China is making
full preparations to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
is studying related laws and regulations on foreign trade and
investment to adapt its legal framework to new requirements.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question about the NPC Standing
Committee vice-chairman Cheng Kejie, Zeng said Cheng is suspected
of being involved in activities violating the law and discipline
and is now reflecting on his own problems while being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Cheng has asked the NPC and its Standing Committee for a leave,
Zeng said, adding that the NPC Standing Committee, after a
discussion, proposed approving of his request for absence from the
NPC session and agreed that he does not become a member of the NPC
Presidium.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is equal before law and whoever violates laws will be
punished," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, 67, of Zhuang nationality, was deputy secretary of the
CPC Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Committee and chairman of
the regional government before he assumed the position of vice-
chairman of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Zeng said the so-called Taiwan election on
March 18 must not have consequences that will lead possibly to the
separation of China such as "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
"Change of leaders in the Taiwan region cannot change the fact
that Taiwan is part of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Hong Kong and Macao has made the task of
resolving the Taiwan question and realizing a complete
reunification of the motherland stand out even more prominently as
a sacred mission of the Chinese people, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, adhere to the basic principles of
'peaceful reunification', 'one country, two systems' and the eight-
point proposal on developing cross-Strait relations and promoting
a peaceful reunification of China put forward by President Jiang
Zemin, and continue to work hard to promote a peaceful
reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities will not run against the
historical trend and will not create obstacles for the
development of cross-Strait relations and reunification of the
motherland," he said, stressing "if confronted with any serious
separatist activity aimed at undermining China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, we will not sit idle."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides across the Taiwan Strait can
conduct dialogue on the premise of 'one China' and develop healthy
relations," he said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister of Turkmenistan Boris Shikhmuradov arrived here on
Saturday morning to start his three-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmenistan foreign minister was received at the airport
by his Pakistani counterpart Abdul Sattar. Besides Sattar,
Shikhmuradov will meet with Pakistan's President Rafiq Tarar,
Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf and Minister for
Petroleum Usman Aminuddin during his stay here.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious plan of a giant pipeline, envisioned to transport
natural gas from the Central Asian country to Pakistan, will be on
top of the agenda of the visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Shikhmuradov will hold in-depth
talks on the project with high level officials of the Pakistani
government, said a curtain raiser issued by the Foreign Office.
</P>

Both a member of the "Six Plus Two" group comprising
Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the United States and
Russia, Pakistan and Turkmenistan have repeatedly called for an
expeditious and peaceful settlement of the Afghan imbroglio.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Veterans Vow Not to Leave Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean veterans Friday set
themselves on a collision course with the police when they vowed
not to leave white-owned commercial farms they occupied last
month, the daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans Association Cosmos Gonese said the former freedom
fighters would not bow to the government's threat to kick them out
of the farms.
</P>
<P>
"We are not moving out of the farms but rather we will sit out
the 30 days it will take the government to gazette the amendment
on land," he said in an interview with The Herald.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is not to chase out white farmers but to make a
 statement that our patience has run out. We are not going
anywhere until we get the land for the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think anyone will be attacked by the police because
we are talking to the police all the time and they know we stand
for non-violence, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa on Thursday gave them
an ultimatum to retreat from the farms by Friday or face
unspecified consequences.
</P>
<P>
The minister who admitted in an interview that the authorities
"did not move fast enough" to stop the invasions, said he would
now move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will sit down with their leaders first because they
too now realize that the invasions have become disorderly. We
cannot allow this to continue spreading," he said when asked what
his next step would be if the ex-combatants refused to end the
siege of the farms.
</P>
<P>
The land-hungry war veterans poured onto at least 30 commercial
farms countrywide last month in a massive show of displeasure over
the rejection of draft constitution and to exert pressure on the
government to speed up the land redistribution program.

<HEADLINE> Top-seeded Rafter Went down in Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Patrick Rafter lost
a quarter-final match on Friday to Amarican Paul Goldtein 4-6, 6-1,
6-2 at the Citrix Tennis Championships held in Delray Beach,
Florida, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Playing in his first singles match since right rotator cuff
surgery last autumn, the Australian was worn down by constant
baseline rallies, especially long backhand duels that most often
ended to Goldstein's advantage.
</P>
<P>
After the first set, Rafter was certainly frustrated. Although
he kept his cool, there were a number of times he was clearly
tempted to swipe his racket on the ground but thought better of it.
</P>
<P>
In another surprising upset Friday, fifth-seeded Chris
Woodruff was ousted by qualifier Alex Calatrava of Spain 6-7(7-9),
6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The four semifinalists are all baseliners. Sixth-seeded Stefan
Koubek of Austria will meet Richard Fromberg of Australia in one
semifinal, while Goldstein takes on Calatrava.
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Koubek won his first semifinal berth of the
year with a 6-1, 1-6, 6-1 victory over Andre Sa of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Fromberg moved into his first semifinal since Amsterdam 1998
with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 win over American Justin Gimelstob.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shaquille O'Neal led the
Lakers avenged a big loss against the Indiana Pacers 107-92 Friday
for their 14th straight win with 31 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant had 22 points, seven assists, five rebounds and a
pair of blocked shots forLos Angeles, which had its NBA season-
high 16-game winning streak snapped in a 111-102 loss at Conseco
Fieldhouse on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles won its seventh straight at the Staples Center and
improved to 27-4 there. The Lakers (48-11) remained 1 1/2 games
ahead of Portland for the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, the Raptors completed a home-and-home sweep of the
Celtics with a 114-104 victory that left Boston coach Rick Pitino
boiling over with frustration for the second game in a row.
</P>
<P>
Muggsy Bogues, the smallest player in NBA history at 5-foot-3
(1.60 meters), did not miss a shot, scoring a career-high 24
points. He went 8-for-8 from the line and knocked down all six of
his shots from the floor, including 4-of-4 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
But Vince Carter was better scoring 30 points. Tracy McGrady
matched a season high with 24 for the Raptors, who have won four
in a row.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Toronto had a thrilling 96-94 victory at Boston
on Carter's 3-pointer at the buzzer, igniting Pitino's verbal
assault on booing fans and critical media.
</P>
<P>
Again, Pitino lost control. He stormed the floor after a non-
call on an apparent trip by Bogues against Boston point guard
Kenny Anderson with 32 seconds left in the third quarter. He was
ejected for arguing.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Walker, the Celtics' leading scorer, managed just 11
points on 3-of-10 shooting before himself getting ejected early in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Steve Smith scored nine of his 19 points during a
key third-quarter run and led six players in double figures as the
Trail Blazers disposed of the Vancouver Grizzlies 101-91.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the Hawks downed the New York Knicks 83-70 despite
the club's leading scorer at over 21 points per game Isaiah Rider
did not start. Veteran Jim Jackson started in his place and
struggled with five points on 2-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jason Terry took Bimbo Coles's starting spot at point
guard and responded with 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Terry had
gone scoreless and missed all seven of his shots in Wednesday's
102-83 home loss to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell scored 17 points and Allan Houston 16 for the
Knicks, who lost for the seventh time in their last eight road
games. New York is 11-16 away from Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
In Charlotte, John Stockton scored 22 points and made clutch
plays down the stretch as the Utah Jazz notched their eighth win
in nine games with an 89-87 victory over the Hornets. Karl Malone
had 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, Raef LaFrentz scored 18 points and grabbed 12
rebounds as the Nuggets produced a 122-88 rout of the Golden State
Warriors.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcies Decrease in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by the New
Zealand Insolvency and Trustee Service Saturday show a seven
percent decrease in the number of bankruptcies and a five percent
decrease in company liquidations in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There were 3,003 people adjudicated bankrupt during 1999, as
against 3,224 in 1998 and 2,658 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of bankruptcies were instigated by the
debtor rather than the creditor. During 1999, 59 percent of
bankruptcies resulted from debtor's petitions.
</P>
<P>
Consumer bankrupts continue to represent the majority of
bankrupts, contributing to 63 percent of all bankrupt estates for
1999. This was an increase from 1998 when 55 percent of all
bankrupts were consumer related.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Addresses Health Concerns of Mayon Evacuees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
addressing the health concerns of more than 65,000 residents
affected by the eruption of Mayon Volcano, a senior official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health has already mobilized the resources
needed to prevent the spread of disease among residents affected
by Mayon's eruptions, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a
radio interview here.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who also heads the National Disaster Coordinating
Council, said that the government has learned from the experience
of the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, when many evacuees died
from upper respiratory and other ailments caused by congestion in
evacuation sites.
</P>
<P>
"More people died in the evacuation areas because of disease
than from direct effects of Mt. Pinatubo's explosion," he said.
</P>
<P>
In June 1991, Mt. Pinatubo, a part of the chain of volcanoes
which borders the western side of Luzon, exploded in one of the
world's most violent and destructive eruptions this century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology said that the status of Mayon Volcano, which exploded
several times since its eruption on February 24, remains at alert
level five, or still in eruptive activity.
</P>
<P>
"Lava emission with sporadic episodes of minor ash puffs
dominated Mayon's eruptive activity," it said in its latest
bulletin Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Provide Aid to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is to
provide some aid to Mozambique to help victims of floods which
have devastated the south African country.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs
disclosed Friday that he had contacted the Vice President's
Office and the Prime Minister's Office to mobilize the aid, the
New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not say how much money and what forms
of aid Uganda would extend to Mozambique where reportedly more
than 350 people had been killed and 100,000 people trapped by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Minister for Disaster Preparedness Tom Butime
was handling the matter and urged Ugandans to donate money,
foodstuffs and blankets.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Mozambique is in further danger of floods
from yet another cyclone. The cyclone was expected to sweep in
from Madagascar, bringing torrential rains and may hit the Port
City of Beira and central Mozambique. More water roaring down
river from neighboring countries may worsen the already desperate
situation.
</P>
<P>
Presently, South African and British helicopters are busy
transporting those flood victims marooned in trees and on
rooftops as another cyclone brews offshore.

followed all the races of the 30th America's Cup finals. They were
extremely excited when they saw their sailing idols.
</P>
<P>
It was a repeat of the celebrations when Team New Zealand
returned with the Auld Mug from San Diego of the United States in
1995. Mayor Christine Fletcher of Auckland, the biggest city of
New Zealand, said Saturday's parade is a fitting conclusion to one
of New Zealand's greatest sporting events.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Two Cross-border Railways in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are underway for the
construction of two cross-border railways in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,a sign that China is speeding up
the opening of its vast west to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
One railway links China with Kirghizia and Uzbekistan in
southern Xinjiang, while the other runs to Kazakhstan via Jinghe
County, Yining city and Horgos in northern Xinjiang, according to
Quo Minje, director of the Urumqi Railway Administration, who is
here to attend the 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress, which is to open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the two railways will provide quicker and
lower-cost land passage between China and central Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang shares border with eight countries and has opened 15
points of entries and exits along its 5,400-kilometer border. The
second Eurasian continental bridge which runs across Xinjiang is
the first railway linking China with Western countries. Cargo
volume through the railway's Alataw Pass on the Chinese-Kazakhstan
border has doubled over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang chairman Abdul'ahat Abdurixit said, "We will take the
advantage of the strategy of developing western China to build
Xinjiang into one of the most economically active and open regions.
"
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has worked out a development plan, according to which
180 billion yuan will be injected into large-scale projects in 10
major sectors, in a bid to improve the investment environment
there.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Jute Industry to Suffer Big Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's jute industry is going
to face a loss of more than 2.5 billion taka (50 million U.S.
dollars) during 1999-2000 fiscal due to a sharp gap between the
production cost and prices of jute goods in the international
market,The Financial Express reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country's jute mills have been incurring heavy losses over
the years, and the government had also shared the losses by
providing cash subsidy and loss financing for the jute goods
exports.
</P>
<P>
The price gap between the production cost and the prices of
exported jute goods is widening day by day and resulted in the
increase of the losses of jute industry.
</P>
<P>
Besides, tough competition in the world market, increase in
labor wages, introduction of peak-hour electricity rate to jute
mills, major devaluation of the Indian currency and higher
production cost were responsible for making losses of the jute
mills.
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavy losses, a large number of looms both in
public and private sector mills had to be closed down over the
years and many others are facing closure.
</P>
<P>
Expressing a grave concern over the existing undercut in the
sales of jute goods to the export markets, a senior official at
the Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA) stressed the urgent
need for fixation of prices of exportable jute goods by Bangladesh
Jute Mill Corporation, BJMA, Bangladesh Jute Spinning Association
and the Jute Goods Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
The official also suggested that all exports of jute goods
should be registered as was done earlier by the Bangladesh Bank.

<HEADLINE> 62 Rhinos Killed in Nepal's Chitwan Park in 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest toll have brought the total number of rhinos killed
in Chitwan park, one of the world's two prime one-horned rhino
habitats,to 62 in less two years, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's total 1800-odd one-horned rhinos, 600 are
surviving in Nepal, while Chitwan park shelters between 500 to 550
of them.
</P>
<P>
According to a conservation education official at the
Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, some of
the rhinos were killed by poachers, who wish to benefit from
trading of rhino horns and skin.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, conservation officials attribute the
shocking rhino death rate in Chitwan to the loss of appropriate
rhino habitat-- short grasslands -- inside the national park.
</P>
<P>
As rhinos proceed towards villages and cultivated areas where
they can graze on green crops and vegetables, angry and innocent
farmers attack them with spear, poisoning and electrocution.
</P>
<P>
However, conservation officials did not rule out chances of
deaths due to mutual fightings. Eight rhinos had died as a result
of mutual fighting during the previous 15 months, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is scheduled to
open its first nuclear test monitoring station Monday on the
Chatham Islands, the easternmost territory of the country.

bankrupts were consumer related.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 3 Finnish Officials Arrested on Bribery Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the Finnish
Maritime Directorate Kyoesti Vesterinen and other two maritime
directorate officials were arrested Thursday for allegedly taking
bribes from Norway's DSND Shipping company, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, the police raided the maritime directorate
headquarters. Besides Vesterinen, the police arrested Lennart
Hagelstam and Eeropekke Koivumaki, director and vice-director of
the Maritime Department. The police also confiscated some files
and computers there.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, during the years when Finland leased
icebreakers to the DSND company, the three officials mentioned
above accepted gifts and free tours, worth 90 million Norwegian
kroner (10.8 million U.S. dollars), offered by the company.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish Ministry of Communications has suspended
Vesterinen's duties as Director-General of the Finnish Maritime
Directorate.
</P>
<P>
Finland is thought to be one of the cleanest countries in the
world in terms of corruption scandals. From 1995 to 1999, there
were only 10 cases of bribes reported.

MEXICO CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Belizean Prime Minister Said
Musa Friday said that the capture of three soldiers and a
policeman of his country by the Guatemalan Army is "an unfortunate
event" that can be solved in a political way, said news report
reaching here from Guatemala.
</P>

Guatemala detained the four men in a border row on February 24,

The meeting yielded no result because of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Manila Scraps 2-Tier Borrowing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report published here Saturday, the central bank said that
the decision thus brings its the overnight borrowing rate to 8.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central bank adopted a two-tier overnight
borrowing rate, which gives the first 500 million pesos (12.5
million U.S.dollars) a rate of 8.75 percent with the succeeding
amount to be slapped a lower rate, to bring the average overnight
borrowing rate to 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is a signal that our borrowing rates have gone up slightly,
"said Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the bank's overnight lending rate of 11
percent still remain.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move intends to discourage banks against
parking their excess funds with the central bank and, instead,
start opening up their lending facilities.
</P>
<P>
But economists here said that the move was mainly aimed at
quashing speculative play in the foreign exchange market in
anticipation of another round of increase of interest rates by the
U.S. Federal Reserves.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Denies Rumors on Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After having a dinner with Gen. Wiranto who was just
deactivated in mid February from his post of coordinating minister
for political and security affairs on Friday night, the president
stressed that there would be no reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of questions on reshuffle. There is no
reshuffle of the cabinet. It was the media which made this (uproar)
," Wahid was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Kwik Kian Gie's impending resignation were linked to
the alleged involvement of his son Inghie Kwik in negotiations for
the acquisition of PT Humpuss Terminal Petikemas, the operator of
the Koja container terminal at Tanjung Priok seaport, with
Hutchison Port Holdings of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Inghie Kwik has denied involvement in the sale, arguing that he,
as an executive of the Asset Management Group of Indonesia, acted
only as a consultant for Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
Separately, State Secretary Bondan Gunawan said the president
would not consider dismissing Kwik Kian Gie from his post.
</P>
<P>
"No, it is not true at all. Pak (Mr) Kwik will remain in the
cabinet. It is true that he met with the president this evening(
Friday) but they only discussed routine work," Gunawan said.
</P>
<P>
Saying he would weed out who spread the rumours as such talk
was aimed at hampering the government's efforts to restore
economic stability, Gunawan said," I will seek out those
responsible because they only want to create chaos."
</P>
<P>
The meeting however triggered a strong speculation that the
senior economic minister who just have four months in his post was
about to leave his job in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But, Kwik Kian Gie himself has denied on Friday night that he
would resign from his post.
</P>
<P>
Confirming a meeting with Wahid, the minister was quoted by the
Kompas daily as saying: "I am not surprise with such a rumors
because I have been rocked by 'black businesspeople', the bad
conglomerates...I don't know where the rumors comes from."

<HEADLINE> Croatia Shocked at Hague Tribunal's Verdict on War General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Croatian leaders said Friday they
were shocked at the Hague Tribunal's jail-term verdict on Croatian
General Tihomir Blaskic and demanded it retry the case.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court of war crimes sentenced Blaskic, 39, to 45 years
in prison, the longest jail term it has handed down so far and the
first verdict against a senior military officer in the 1992-1995
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Croatian President Stipe Mesic, Parliament Speaker Zlatko
Tomcic and Prime Minister Ivica Racan all expressed objection to
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
They said that Croatia is willing to continue its cooperation
with the tribunal, but the court should reconsider the ruling,
which is the harshest since its establishment in 1993 to punish
those responsible for atrocities in the conflicts following the
disintegration of former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Other Croatian leaders also protested the three-judge court's
verdict on Blaskic, who was charged with leading a blitz across
the Lasva River Valley that killed hundreds of Muslims and sent
thousands more fleeing the area.
</P>
<P>
The court said that in April 1993 alone, Blaskic ordered the
killing of more than 100 Muslims and emptied the Bosnian village
of Ahmici of every one of its Muslim inhabitants.

<HEADLINE> Revitalizing China's West -- NPC Deputies' New Focal Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputies to the upcoming Third Session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) -- from the coastal, central as well as western
regions -- hailed the program as "timely and far-sighted" and
offered suggestions for the go-ahead of the trans-century project
which, after completion, is expected to bring the landlocked
region into China's new economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to implement the strategy of developing China's
west comes just in good time and will prove far-sighted, and
people there have been greatly encouraged," said NPC deputy Wu
Dengchang, who is also mayor of Baoji city of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The western region includes nine provinces and autonomous
regions and one municipality, with a total of 5.4 million square
kilometers and a population of 285 million, accounting for the
nation's 56 percent and 23 percent, respectively. However, its per-
capita gross domestic product (GDP) is only equal to 60 percent of
the national average.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy provides an opportunity for us to catch up with
China's coastal region. My province will strive to become an
ecological shelter along the Yangtze River Valley as well as an
economic power in the western areas," said governor Zhang Zhongwei
of southwestern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinsheng, a deputy from the largest metropolis of Shanghai
in east China, said that the whole country can share balanced
development only when an economically developed western China
emerges and east-west cooperation goes hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises of Shanghai have gone on a "gold-rush" spree
in the western parts of China by investing over 10 billion yuan (
more than one billion U.S. dollars) in setting up more than 1,000
businesses, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The most positive response to the decision comes from western
China itself, and in particular, local ethnic minority groups. "
The strategy opens a historic opportunity for the western areas to
speed up economic development and improve the living standard of
ethnic minority groups, to greatly strengthen the national unity,"
said Ma Qizhi, a deputy from northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China is home to 55 ethnic minority groups of some 110 million
people, mostly inhabited in the west.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs show special concern to the strategy. Dong
Weiping, chairman of a Hangzhou-based listed company, vowed that
he will lose no time in exploring market opportunities in the
western region.
</P>
<P>
The central government has defined ecological and environmental
protection as the base in developing the vast region. And in the
long run, improved eco-system in the west will be conducive to
ecological protection along the Yangtze and Huanghe rivers as well
as to a sustainable development across the country, according to
Wang Xianjin, an expert on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhang Litong
said that the strategy not only offers ample development space for
the national economy as a whole, but more importantly can further
improve the layout of productive forces and promote the formation
of a unified national market system.

<HEADLINE> NPC Motions, Proposals of Top Advisory Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Following is a definition of
motions of the National People's Congress (NPC) and proposals of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
NPC motions are put forward by NPC deputies or relevant
departments to the NPC. According to the Constitution, NPC
deputies and members of the NPC Standing Committee have the right
to table motions on issues within the power of the NPC through
procedures in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
According to Organic Law of the NPC and NPC rules for the
discharging of its duties,the presidium of the NPC, the Standing
Committee of the NPC, the State Council, the Supreme People's
Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, a provincial-level
delegation (of deputies) to the NPC or a group of NPC deputies
numbering 30 or above have the right to raise motions to the NPC
on issues within the power of the NPC. Afterwards, the NPC
presidium decides if a motion is to be included in the agenda of a
NPC session, or a motion is first handed over for examination to a
sub-committee, which is to suggest to the presidium whether or not
it is to be included in the agenda.
</P>
<P>
A motion, after examination by NPC deputies at full meetings or
panels, will be transferred by the presidium to a sub-committee
for further examination. Afterwards, the motion will be handed
over to a general session of all NPC deputies for a vote and
adoption requires a simple majority of all deputies voting in
favor.
</P>
<P>
Members of the CPPCC National Committee put forward proposals
to offer comments and suggestions on major political and social
issues of the country.
</P>
<P>
For the presentation of a proposal, there is no restriction on
timing, scope and number of sponsoring members.
</P>
<P>
Generally, members can raise a proposal in one of the following
ways:
</P>
<P>
-- By one member or a group of members;
</P>
<P>
-- By one or more groups jointly, when the CPPCC National
Committee is in session;
</P>
<P>
-- In the name of a party or non-government group that has
joined the CPPCC;
</P>
<P>
-- In the name of a sub-committee of the CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
A department in charge of handling proposals is obliged to give
reply to each of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
The difference between a NPC motion and a proposal of the CPPCC
National Committee is that as the NPC is the country's top law-

<HEADLINE> Thailand Holds First Senate Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thais began casting their ballot
for a new senate at 8 a.m. (0100 GMT) at 58,694 polling stations
around the country, the first time since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The election is widely seen as the first test of the country's
political reform under its 1997 constitution, which seeks to
foster democracy and clean up politics.
</P>
<P>
Under the new charter, dubbed as "the people's constitution",
senators will be elected, rather than handpicked by the prime
minister, and will be entitled with more substantial power than
their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
The new senators can dismiss unscrupulous politicians and
install mechanisms to monitor corruption and power abuse.
</P>
<P>
So the competition for the 200 seats in the upper house turned
out to be quite fierce, with 1532 candidates seeking after.
</P>
<P>
The major outcomes of the election are expected to be known
after the midnight.
</P>
<P>
The senate term is for six years and is non-renewable.
</P>
<P>
The term of the present senate will end on March 21 and the new
senate is expected to take over on March 22.
</P>
<P>
But if the results of the election are challenged and the
election commission cannot declare a full list of 200 winners by
March 21, the current chamber could assume as an acting role,
which is allowed under a provisional article in the charter, but
with limited power.
</P>
<P>
Although the new senate is viewed as the key player in Thailand
's political reform striving for the establishment of a strong
system to monitor power abuse, reports of vote-buying, open
campaigning and gift-giving filled up local newspaper pages every
day.
</P>
<P>
People were warned not place high expectations in the election,
but see it as a continuation of the democratic reform process.

Indonesia.
</P>

Gross foreign exchange reserves, which are net reserves plus
outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also increased to 28.16

<HEADLINE> Thai Researchers Produce Organic Gas From  Elephant Dung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai researchers had found success
in producing organic gas from elephant dung, according to an
official release of the Government Public Relations Department
available here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The gas had the same quality as that produced from pig and cow
dung, and could be used to fire a small electricity generating
unit.
</P>
<P>
Director of Energy Study, Research and Development Bureau
Umnuai Tongsadhit was quoted as saying that the experiment was
done at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center at Hang Chat
district, Lampang Province in the north.
</P>
<P>
The gas was produced by mixing the dung with water at the
ratio of 1 to 3, and fermenting it in a cement well for a month.
</P>
<P>
The daily supply of 1,500--2,000 kilograms of dung, the amount
produced by 40 elephants at the center, could be used to make 75--
100 cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
This was enough to replace the amount of cooking gas the
center use, it was also enough to produce 75 kilowatts of
electricity for one hour.
</P>
<P>
The center, which now had 40 elephants, would soon accept an
addition of 60 elephants.

ZAGREB, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Croatia is planning to cut down the
numbers of its troops by a big margin and simplify its military
institutions, said Croatian Defense Minister Jozo Rados Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government will reduce the army by one fourth to
one third and restructure the Defense Ministry, the Croatian

</P>
<P>
Other measures will include cutting the number of combat
branches and shortening military service term by four to six
months.
</P>
<P>
Rados stressed that the military reform aims to build better-
equipped, smaller armed forces and a highly efficient defense
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian army was established during the civil war of
former Yugoslavia. Its increasing expenditure has posed a negative
impact on the nation's economy.

MEXICO CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto

agreement, which is expected to promote trade between the two
countries.
</P>

The Mexican Commerce and Industrial Development Ministry said
trade volume with Israel now only makes up less than 1 percent of
Mexico's total foreign trade and the new deal will hopefully raise
that level once it is in force.

Last year, Mexico had 119 million U.S. dollars of deficit in
trade with Israel, with exports of 25 million U.S. dollars and
imports of 144 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mexico exports to Israel oil, equipment and electric appliances,
as well as food products and imports from it agricultural
machinery and products, medicine, and electronic goods and parts.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes to Win Two Titles in All England Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) is holding out hope for its shuttlers to take the
men's singles and doubles at the All England championships in
Birmingham, England, next week.
</P>
<P>
PBSI training director Christian Hadinata said that based on
last year's experience, Indonesia held an outstanding chance of
retaining the men's doubles title and triumphing in the men's
singles.
</P>
<P>
"Our men's singles are expected to bring home the title for the
first time since 1994, when Hariyanto Arbi won the All England a
second time," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Top ranked Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan defeated South
Koreans Lee Dong-soo and Yoo Yong-sung for the country's sole All
England title in 1999. Teenager Taufik Hidayat lost to Dane Peter
Gade Christensen in last year's men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
PBSI will send Taufik, who is ranked fifth in the world,
Hendrawan (12th) and Budi Santoso (13th) in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said earlier that his target was to at least reach the
final. In the absence of Sun Jun of China due to back pain, Taufik
has a major chance of fulfilling his ambition.
</P>
<P>
Christian said the women's singles and doubles players should
not lose to lower-ranked opponents in the remaining three
tournaments -- All England, Swiss Open and Japan Open -- to
qualify for the Olympic Games in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
"I have urged them to do their best to beat higher-ranking
players to enable them to gain bonus points which will be useful
to qualify for the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, only Lidya Djaelawidjaja, ranked 13th
in the world, has qualified for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I am to reach the quarterfinals in the All England. I really
want to beat seeded players in the event. After the Uber Cup
qualifying round in New Delhi last month, I have been able to
concentrate more on each match and gain self-confidence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles specialist Deyana Lomban, partnering Elysa
Nathanael, said she was determined to unseat the Chinese doubles
teams, the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for me to compete in the All England
with Elysa and I really want to win. The experience in the Uber
Cup boosted my motivation and self-confidence. I feel I can play
much better than before," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics executive training director Arie Sudewo, who is
also the vice chairman of the National Sports Council, urged
shuttlers not to be daunted by their opponents.
</P>
<P>
"If they have the guts to challenge you, what are you afraid of?
You can also beat them. Just play as usual and be relaxed.
Consider yourselves to be underdogs to release the burden on your
shoulders," he added.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Power of Supervision of the National People's Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The nature of the power of
supervision of the National People's Congress (NPC) and its
Standing Committee is to impose restrictions on other national
political organs and ensure that the government be run in
accordance with the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
The power of supervision of the NPC and its Standing Committee,
as defined by the Constitution, includes supervising the
enforcement of the Constitution and laws and supervising the work
of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, the NPC and its Standing Committee
supervise the enforcement of the Constitution, while people's
congresses and their standing committees at local levels ensure
that the Constitution, laws, administrative regulations and
decisions by people's congresses and their standing committees at
higher levels be abided by and enforced in their respective
regions.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the supervisory function of the NPC and its
Standing Committee is to see whether or not the work of the State
Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate accords with the Constitution and laws, whether or
not they appropriately implement the principles and policies of
the Chinese Communist Party and the State, and whether or not
relevant officials do their jobs competently. Supervision also
covers the examination and approval (or non-approval) of the
national economic and social development plan and its
implementation at the national or local level, the examination and
approval (or non-approval) of the fiscal budget and its
implementation at the national or local level, and the election,
appointment and dismissal of government officials.

<HEADLINE> North China Province To Build More Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cargo transportation in north
China's Hebei Province is expected to rise markedly as 1,900
kilometers of railways are planned to be built in the six years to
come.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's railways development plan, 12 lines
of provincial railways totaling more than 200 kilometers will be
built during this period, with an investment of 26 billion yuan (
some 3.1 billion US dollars). Situated in central, eastern and
western Hebei, these new railways will link its harbors, new
cities and large mineral zones with national artery railways.
</P>
<P>
Of the new lines is a railway along the coast of Bohai Bay and
it is expected to become a convenient route between northeast and
east China.
</P>
<P>
The province has so far built 11 provincial railways, totaling
665.8 kilometers and connecting 31 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hebei Province, together with some state
departments, will jointly build 1,219.7 kilometers of railways
inside the province.
</P>
<P>
For example, the railway from Shuozhou in Shanxi Province to
Huanghua Port in Hebei, a national key line designated for
transporting coal from western to eastern China, is being jointly
built by the state, Shenhua Group Co., Hebei and Shanxi provinces.
Some 408 kilometers of this 587-kilometer-long railway are inside
Hebei.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the province's total cargo transportation
capacity will be raised by 2.45 billion tons when these projects
are complete.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Steps Up Campaign for China Trade Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
stepped up its campaign in recent days to win an uphill battle
with Congress for supporting China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and granting it a Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status.
</P>
<P>
"The United States would gain unprecedented access to China's
markets" in return for China's entry as a full partner in the WTO,
U.S. President Bill Clinton told more than 1,000 high-tech workers
at a meeting sponsored by UUNET, a subsidiary of MCIWorldCom, on
Wednesday in Ashburn, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
He said that any president in this country, regardless of party,
would welcome changes resulting from China's entry into the WTO, "
because presidents, regardless of party, have worked to bring
about these changes for more than 30 years now."
</P>
<P>
When joining the WTO, China's tariffs on information technology,
which at present averages 13 percent, will start to fall and be
eliminated by 2005, and this will allow China's Internet and
telecom markets open to American investment and services for the
first time, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"That's a huge deal," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's information technology equipment
market is estimated to be rising by 20-40 percent annually, and
between 1990 and 1998, U.S. high technology industry exports to
China have increased over five times and its exports of
communications equipment grown over nine times.
</P>
<P>
Internet users in China quadrupled in 1999, jumping from 2
million at the beginning of the year to 9 million, and are
expected to grow to 20 million by the end of 2000. Some analysts
predict that China will become the world's second largest personal
computer market by the end of this year and the third largest
semiconductor market by 2001.
</P>
<P>
China, where there were 40 million cellular subscribers by the
end of 1999, also represents the fastest growing
telecommunications market in the world, but only 5 percent of this
market has been tapped up to now.
</P>
<P>
"If we turn our backs on this opportunity, we will be
unilaterally disarming in perhaps the most vital area of our
future economic growth," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
reiterated the importance of China's entry into the WTO, and
called for a delinkage between the PNTR and the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the WTO deal that was negotiated very
painstakingly is good for U.S. exports and for our workers and for
farm interests," Albright said at a hearing of the Commerce,
Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee of the Senate
Appropriations Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She billed China's WTO accession as "something that works in
our favor and is worth doing for the national and economic
interests."
</P>
<P>
"For economic reasons we believe that permanent NTR is
important," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the timing is important to get this done early,
" and "I hope very much that we can get permanent trading status
done as soon as possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that the WTO accession and permanent NTR for
China "should be looked at separately" from the Taiwan issue,
which has been raised to a new high pitch in the Capitol Hill
since China issued a white paper on Taiwan last month.
</P>
<P>
Albright said it is important to engage with China, "even
though we disagree on a whole host of issues."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Thursday
that the Clinton administration is "making good progress" in
educating Congress and the public on the necessity of granting
China the PNTR.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-China agreement on the WTO "is an economic winner for
the United States," Barshefsky said in a speech on U.S. trade
policy in the 21st century at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
"All we have to do, to ensure ourselves of the benefits of the
agreement, is to grant China on a permanent basis the trade status
we have given them every year since 1979, when we normalized
diplomatic relations," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
"It is to make permanent what has already essentially become
permanent," she added.

<HEADLINE> 24 Goals in 6 Bundesliga Matches Friday Evening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The German Bundesliga entered the
23rd round and the Second Devision the 21st Friday evening. The
two divisions saw altogether 24 goals in six games.
</P>
<P>
In First Division, VfL Wolfsburg tied with Hamburg SV 4-4 while
FC Freiburg also fought to a draw with Arminia Bielefeld 1-1.
</P>
<P>
In Second Division, FC Cologne defeated VfL Bochum 3-0,
Alemannia Aachen tied with Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-1,
Chemnitzer FC beat Fortuna 2-1 while Cottbus Energie overwhelmed
SpVgg Greuther Fuerth 4-2.
</P>
<P>
VfL Wolfsburg played against Hamburg which places third in the
league table. The 24-year-old Zoltan Sebescen scored a remarkable
hat-trick for Wolfsburg, hitting the net in the 43rd, 54th and
59th minute. Wolfsburg's other goal came from Juergen Rische in
the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Mehdi Mahdavikia scored a double in the 9th and 41st
minute and teammate Brazilian Rodolfo Cardoso also netted twice.
Cardoso scored in the 21st and 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
When the match entered into the 53rd minute Cardoso's goal made
Hamburg lead 4-1. But Wolfsburg staged a strong rally to equalize
the score.
</P>
<P>
Arminia Bielefeld, who put an end to its ten-match losing
streak last Monday at home, was no good luck tonight.
</P>
<P>
Bielefeld captain Bruno Labbadia headed the ball into the net
in the 18th minute for a 1-0 lead before break.
</P>
<P>
A injury-haunted Freiburg could only start seven of its top
players and had to be on the defensive. But in the second half,
Stefan Mueller levelled the score in the 61st minute.
</P>
<P>
After the draw Freiburg has 26 points at 13th on the table and
gains an advantage over Frankfurt by six points. Bielefeld stands
still at the end of the league table with 15 points.

SHENYANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- All people will be welcomed to
express their own opinions about Lei Feng on a new website at: www.
leifeng.com, beginning at 6:30 pm today.
</P>

Feng in the market economy?" The website will remain open for 30

</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, born in 1939, joined the People's Liberation Army in
1960. He was always ready to help people in trouble, and put the
interests of others before his own. Lei Feng died in an accident
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Late Chairman Mao Zedong's epigraph on March 5, 1963, calls on
all the Chinese people to learn from Lei Feng. And since then,
every year they commemorate Lei Feng on a special day by offering
help to the people around them.

<HEADLINE> BSKYB Tightens Grip on Premiership  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Broadcaster BSkyB is tightening its
grip on English soccer premiership with the acquisition of a 9.9
per cent stake in Chelsea for 40 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Following the collapse of their attempted takeover of European
champions Manchester United, BSkyB have turned to buying smaller
stakes in a number of clubs, although they have kept below the
limit of 10% of shares imposed by the Football Association and
Premier League.
</P>
<P>
The latest deal with Chelsea now gives them an interest in four
Premiership clubs - the Blues, Manchester United, Leeds and
Sunderland - as well as Manchester City, who could win promotion
from the First Division this season.
</P>
<P>
But even if City were to go up, BSkyB would still be two short
of having minority stakes in seven top-flight clubs - the number
required to block proposals in Premiership chairmen's meetings.
</P>
<P>
With cable TV rivals NTL having also recently bought into
Newcastle and Aston Villa, while Liverpool have linked up with
Granada, Chelsea have now joined the bandwagon to receive an
immediate investment.
</P>
<P>
The deal values parent company Chelsea Village at 400 million
pounds - making them the Premiership's second most valuable club
behind Manchester United at 831 million pounds - and the Blues
have certainly received more than any other club, apart from
United.
</P>
<P>
For while Chelsea were given 40 million pounds, Liverpool got
22 million for 9.9%, Aston Villa 17 million for 9.9%, Leeds
Sporting 13.8 million for 9.1%, Manchester City 5.5 million for 9.
9% and Sunderland 6.5 million for 5%.
</P>
<P>
However, Chelsea chairman Ken Bates insisted tonight that no
decision had yet been taken on whether to invest the extra funds
in new signings, developing home-grown talent or renovating the
stadium complex.
</P>
<P>
He said: "That will be decided by the board and we have not yet
had a board meeting yet. When we do decide, our fans will be the
first to hear it."
</P>
<P>
Bates added: "I'm delighted for both the supporters and
shareholders. This strategic alliance represents another milestone
along the road of Chelsea becoming an enduring major force in
European football and strengthens our move into new media."

<HEADLINE> Matthews Waved Final Farewell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 people lined the
streets of Stoke-on-Trent on Friday to say 'thank you and goodbye'
to their most famous son, soccer legend Sir Stanley Matthews.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand people watched his funeral cortege leave the
Britannia Stadium, where many had left scarves and flowers, before
it wound its way along a 14-mile route through his beloved
Potteries to St Peter's Church.
</P>
<P>
The hearse, which was decorated with floral tributes in the
shape of his number seven Stoke shirt and the club's initials,
paused briefly outside his old primary school, his home, his
statue in Hanley and the former Victoria Ground, which he lit up
on so many occasions.
</P>
<P>
Once at the church, football legends Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir
Tom Finney, Gordon Banks and Nat Lofthouse were among the
pallbearers who took his coffin inside at 1pm precisely.
</P>
<P>
During the funeral service various figures from all aspects of
Sir Stanley's life paid tribute to the man who many regard as the
finest to wear the three lions on his chest.
</P>
<P>
Former England international Jimmy Armfield, who played with
the 'Wizard of Dribble' at Blackpool, told the congregation - and
the crowds who braved the wind and rain to listen outside on loud
speakers - that he was "a true great".
</P>
<P>
Armfield said of the former European Footballer of the Year,
who died last week aged 85: "He was a man who could reach for the
stars,but somehow still keep his feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"All the trappings of a champions - that was Stan. In our time
together at Blackpool, I thought of him as a role model for anyone
in a tangerine shirt.
</P>
<P>
"I now realise that he was a role model for every footballer in
the land. He was the first real football man. He was often kicked
and fouled, but he never retaliated. I never saw him lose his
temper and of course he was never booked," he said. Endite

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- German veteran sweeper Lothar
Matthaeus will extend his professional career till 2001, said he
in an interview with the German "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" published
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I will stay longer in the U.S., maybe I will do
something else," said Matthaeus, who has played 144 times for the
German national team and established a new world record.
He told the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung"that he had received a "very
good offer" from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Lothar Matthaeus will be 39 on March 21. On Saturday he will
still take part in his last Bundesliga's match against VfB
Stuttgart and then his last game for Bayern Munich against Real
Madrid in the second phase of the European Champions League next
Wednesday. From March 10 on he will go to New York to take part in
the Major League Soccer for New York/New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the national team Oliver Bierhoff said that
Matthaeus would become the successor of the present head coach
Erich Ribbeck, but Matthaeus declared that he had no ambitions to
take over the national team for now: "National team coach - that
won't interest me for another three, five or ten years."
</P>
<P>
As the captain he led the team to gain the World Cup in 1990 in
Italy and therefore has been expected by many German football
experts to become an ideal national team coach.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Belgian Charges against Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's top security body, the
Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), on Saturday condemned a
Belgian court action against former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC session, chaired by President Mohammad Khatami, ordered
the Foreign Ministry to seriously follow up the case.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian judge has ordered a police investigation into
complaints filed by an Iranian-born Belgian national against
Rafsanjani over alleged kidnapping, torture, harassment and
psychological violence perpetrated between April 1983 and February
1989 in Tehran and two other Iranian cities.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC termed the court action "intolerable and an obvious
insult to the great Iranian nation," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC urged the Belgian government to clearly announce its
stance towards the "insulting and unfriendly" move against a top
Iranian leader.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Saturday morning summoned the Belgian
ambassador to Tehran Guillaume Matin to lodge a strong protest over
the case.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Director General for West Europe Affairs Bahram
Qassemi said the Belgian court action was an open example of "
interference in Iran's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was the Majlis (Parliament) speaker from 1980 to 1989
and president from 1989 to 1997. He was believed to be the
strongest candidate for the post of speaker after he announced to
run in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
However, his popularity suffered a serious setback in the
February 18 balloting, as he narrowly entered the powerful
legislative body by ranking the last in a list of 30 elected in the
Tehran constituency.

<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian assistant Foreign Minister
Mohammad Sadr arrived here saturday carrying a message from
President Mohammad Khatami to his Lebanese counterpart Emile
Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued upon his arrival, Sadr said the message
confirmed khatami's support to the Lebanese government and
resistance in their struggle against Israeli aggression. No details
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He said that whatever the Israeli excuses for the aggressions
are, they will never attain their target as the Lebanese resistance
will be vigilant to foil their attempts.
</P>
<P>
On his country's stance towards the peace process, Sadr said
that a resumption of the Mideast peace march is a matter that
concerns Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Israeli claim that Iran sends rockets to
Lebanon which can reach the heart of Israel, Sadr said the Jewish
state made a fuss because it failed to withstand the Lebanese
resistance.
</P>
<P>
As for relations between Iran and the U.S., Sadr conditioned
that Washington should change its policy towards Tehran first.

<HEADLINE> Indictment Against Three Kurdish Mayors In Offing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An indictment prepared by the Chief
Prosecutor of the State Security Court against the controversial
pro-Kurdish mayors in southeastern Turkey is ready, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The indictment bill said Diyarbakir Mayor Feridun Celik, Siirt
Mayor Selim Ozalp and Bingol Mayor Feyzullah Karaaslan were
involved in structuring ERNK, political wing of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the southeastern province of
Diyarbakir, and in contact with members of the terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
The indictment also charged that the three mayors, who were
members of the People's Democratic Party (HADEP), aided and abetted
the the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The indictment claimed that Mayor Celik was taken into custody
because he, as HADEP provincial chairman, made a statement when PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan was seized and brought back to Turkey in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that Celik, together with seven other HADEP mayors,
participated in "Local Administration Conference" between February
8 and 23 this year upon the invitation of German Hanover mayor and
made statements that supposedly criticized the policies of the
Turkish government on the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been since 1984 waging a guerrilla war for
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The three mayors, who were arrested on February 19 and released
on bail last Monday, will stand trial in the coming days and may be
sentenced to seven years in prison if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Turkish Daily News Saturday, Celik said, "
we have no link with the PKK. We state the problem clearly -- it is
the Kurdish problem, but some call it the southeastern question."
</P>
<P>
"This cannot possibly show that there is any link between HADEP
and the PKK," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have been on trial many times, and the verdict has always
been that we have no relation with the PKK," Celik declared.

BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was seriously
wounded Saturday night in an attack launched by Lebanese guerrillas
on the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said.

<P>
BOGOTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombia added 250 million dollars
to the emission of foreign debt bonds for 500 million dollars in
the international market more than three weeks ago, said Finance
Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase the Colombian global bonds is
attributed to delays occurred in the plan of privatization,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of the emission now is 750 million dollars.
The original bonds are quoted at 97.53 percent with a yield of 12.
08 percent, the equivalent of 550 base points above the U.S.
Treasure Bonds.
</P>
<P>
The government expects at least two billion dollars from
privatization this year, which are crucial for the fulfillment of
the agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
last December.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, tied to a credit for 2.7 billion dollars,
foresees a rigorous budget adjustment to put the country again on
the road to growth, after the economy dropped to an unprecedented
low level of five percent, which is estimated the third lowest
experienced by any Latin American country in 1999.

NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Chief Justice Bernard
Chunga Saturday gave the nation a personal guarantee that he will
fight corruption within the ranks of the judiciary no matter what
the cost is, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at a session on the implementation of
non-custodial sentence as envisaged in the new Community Service
Order Act, Chunga pledged that "I will deal firmly and decisively
on corruption."
</P>
<P>
Chunga said that his main pre-occupation would be to ensure
"speedy and skilful delivery of justice'' in the country, adding
that he will use his tenure in office to stop the runaway sleaze
and inefficiency which have been the hallmark of the Kenyan
judiciary system.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop, attended by judges, magistrates,
community service officers, security personnel and members of the
prisons department, sought to formulate strategies that would
help the smooth implementation of the Community Service Order Act
which came in to force last July.
</P>
<P>
The idea of introducing non-custodial sentences was prompted by
the congestion of prisons and the need to cut down on the amount
of public funds used in prison maintenance in the country.

<P>
SANTIAGO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 persons on
Saturday took part in a demonstration in the center of Santiago
against the return to Chile of the former military ruler and now
lifetime senator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The march demonstration, called by the Human Rights National
Assembly of Chile, became tense when the demonstrators chanted
slogans against Pinochet and threw objets in front of the armed
forces barracks.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched by the southern lane of the Alameda,
continued by the Ahumada Boulevard, and concluded their tour in
the Plaza of the Constitution, where they lowered the flags to
half mast as a show of mourning.
</P>
<P>
A group of relatives of political detained and disappeared

a document with the names of the victims of the Pinochet military
regime repression, whose whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Carabinero (uniformed police) agents dissolved the
demonstration when unidentified people threw glass bottles against
the La Moneda Palace and against the press that covered the march.
</P>
<P>
No reports on people detained and injured by the projectiles
was provided. It was said that a photograph of the La Nacion
newspaper had been injured in the head.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Congress to Take Measures on Gun Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In a country of 270 million people, no law can stop every act
of gun violence. But we can't just throw up our hands as if gun
safety laws don't make a difference," Clinton said in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
He made remarks in the wake of the fatal shooting Tuesday of a
6-year-old girl by a classmate in Michigan State. A day later, a
gunman killed two people and critically wounded three others in
Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will push for a requirement that handguns come
with child safety locks, a ban on importation of large-capacity
ammunition clips and mandatory background checks on handgun
purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
He said he will insist that lawmakers "get the job done" at
Tuesday's meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he also wants Congress to approve state-issued
licenses for newly purchased handguns; stricter punishment for
adults whose guns fall into children's hands; and money to hire 1,
000 new prosecutors for firearms cases and to develop "smart gun"
technology that makes the weapon work only for its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
Clinton blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for
Congress' inaction. The NRA has a 20-million-U.S.-dollar
advertising campaign under way on gun control.
</P>
<P>
"The only reason Congress hasn't already sent me a bill with
comprehensive gun safety provisions is because of the pressure
tactics and the threats of the NRA," he added.

Ahern said concern was focused on dissident groups but there
was no evidence to suggest the main republican and loyalist
terrorist groups were implicated.
</P>
<P>
"We have no particular information, but it has been well known
for a long time that the security forces north and south of the
border and in Britain have been very concerned about groups of
dissidents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in advance of an address to his party's annual
conference in Dublin in which he is expected to outline the
government's efforts to rescue the deadlocked peace process,Ahern
said the security forces would have to remain "very vigilant".
</P>
<P>
"They are dealing with smaller numbers now, but obviously
people who are highly dangerous."
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister's comments followed the publication of
the annual report on the Prevention of Terrorism Act by Crown
Court recorder John Rowe.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his "regular visits" to Northern Ireland he
was convinced there was still a need for tough powers to curb the
activities of republican and loyalist paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
The draft order to renew the act was presented to the House of
Commons on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said it will be debated some
time in the next three weeks before the Act expires at midnight on
March 21.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, weapons seizures have not dropped
during the past year and terror groups have been carrying out
weapons and arms training.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis said although
the report was "very disturbing" it was not surprising to people
who lived in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein assembly member Mitchel McLaughlin criticized the
timing of the report's publication and accused the Home Office of
"news management".
</P>
<P>
He said the sole purpose of the report is to justify the
renewal of the legislation - which under the terms of the Good
Friday Agreement the government agreed to abolish.

<HEADLINE> Two Computer Hacker Arrested in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Two computer hackers from the
Sicilian city of Catania were arrested Friday night, charged with
breaking into the computer systems of two U.S. banks and stealing
clients' credit card numbers, in what was the first case of
alleged computer crime ever in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Russo, 34, and his Croatian wife Sandra Elazar, 33,
were accused by the Italian finance police of using the credit
card numbers of over 1,000 American bank customers to gamble and
shop on the internet.
</P>
<P>
The couple apparently bet more than a million dollars in
virtual sums on lottery web sites, winning some 800,000 U.S.
dollars in all and thereby converting their hypothetical money
into hard cash.
</P>
<P>
The credit card numbers were stolen from a branch of the Chase
Manhattan Bank in the state of Delaware and a Georgia branch of
Citybank Universal and also used to buy goods on the web,
including clothes, books and computer programs.
</P>
<P>
Italian prosecutors said that the U.S. authorities would be
helping them with their investigations.
</P>
<P>
Catania's public prosecutor Vincenzo D'Agata told reporters
that stiffer sentences were now required for computer hacking
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, sentences are inadequate given the huge growth
in computer crimes such as e-commerce fraud," D'Agata said.
</P>
<P>
"The figures are alarming and we need to find solutions which
reflect the gravity of the crimes committed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the couple, if found guilty, faced a maximum of
five years in prison, but the sentence would be double that if
they had robbed a bank in a more conventional raid.
