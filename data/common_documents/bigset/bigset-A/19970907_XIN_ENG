<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Necessity of Albright's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan reaffirmed today the
necessity of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
upcoming Middle East trip and gave it an optimistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affair Samir Mutawe said at
today`s cabinet meeting that "we hope that Albright will go ahead
with her visit because of the very serious consequences" incurred
by Thursday`s suicide bombings in West Jerusalem which killed seven
people and injured 190 others.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the secretary`s maiden trip to the region, King
Hussein of Jordan will attend a tripartite summit with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Sunday in Cairo to deal with the latest developments in the
region, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S.`s) very determination of going ahead with the
visit is an indication that the U.S. is now (still) active in
playing its role as a partner in making the peace process
works," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that Jordan is optimistic about
Albright`s visit which is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said after the suicide bombings
that Albright would go ahead next week with her planned trip to
the Middle East despite the attack.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Albright's trip will be to rebuild diminishing
confidence between Israel and the Palestinians following months
of stalemate in the peace process which has been stalled since
Israel began construction of new Jewish settlements in Arab East
Jerusalem in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Albrigt's tour will include Israel, Palestinian-held
territory, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia.

<P>
The summit would deal with the "very serious consequences" and

The summit comes "as a part of the continuing process of

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's six largest banks
raked in huge profits in the third quarter of their fiscal year,
generating another round of double-digit profit increases.
</P>
<P>
Their total net earnings hit 1.97 billion Canadian dollars
(1.41 billion US dollars) in the three-month period ended July 31,
said reports today.
</P>
<P>
This figure is 15 percent higher than in the second quarter and
24 percent higher than in the same quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the year to date, Canada's Big Six banks have earned 5.4
billion dollars (3.8 billion US dollars), putting them within easy
distance of surpassing the 6.26 billion dollar (4.5 billion US
dollar) profit they earned in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Nova Scotia, the country's fourth largest bank,
recorded the most spectacular showing in the third quarter. Its
profit was 40 percent higher than in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
The only bank to show a drop in earnings was the sixth largest
National Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
But its 11-percent fall was a result of artificially high
profits in last year's third quarter, when it sold off a foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Call for Saving Oslo Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan said today a
tripartite Arab summit will be convened Sunday to discuss the
crisis in the Mideast and save Oslo accord, the cornerstone of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today invited King Hussein of
Jordan and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat to a summit meeting here Sunday for consultations on the
latest developments of the Mideast peace process, especially on
the Palestinian-Israeli peace track.
</P>
<P>
"The summit aims at finding ways to salvage the peace drive,
especially its terms of reference, based on the land-for-peace
principle and abidance of both parties by the Oslo agreement and
negotiations on various issues including security," Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, Mubarak will hold contacts with a number
of Arab leaders, as the tripartite summit will be based on the
Arab references expressed in the June 1996 Arab summit
resolutions, namely peace is an Arab option, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the situation is critical in the occupied
territories and the Mideast peace process," Moussa said,
explaining the reason behind the convocation of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is the implementation of the agreement and not
just reconsidering them," Moussa said, in response to the latest
Israeli decision not to withdraw from new areas in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Friday
that Oslo will soon be buried and ruled out handing over more land
to Palestinians until Arafat cracked down on Muslim militants in
the wake of Thursday's triple suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has held the PNA "indirectly responsible" for the
attacks, the second in the city in five weeks, and reimposed a
complete closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which had been
eased earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Israel has withdrawn its troops, handing over much of the Gaza
Strip and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule under
peace deals with Arafat starting in 1993. It is supposed to
withdraw from more of the West Bank by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordanian Ambassador to Egypt and Jordan's permanent
delegate to the Arab League Nayef Saud Al Qadi stressed the
importance of the tripartite summit.
</P>
<P>
Al Qadi said that talks among the three leaders will focus on
boosting the peace process and salvaging the staggered peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was in fact in a very bad situation even
before the Jerusalem blasts due to Israeli practices, especially
the erection of settlements and non commitment to signed
agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is important now to save the peace process which
is facing many challenges, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking has been in crisis since
last March over Jewish settlement construction in East Jerusalem
which the Palestinians want as part of a future state.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate has been deepened by the suicide attacks, first
on July 30 when 15 Israelis were killed by two suicidal bombs in a
Jerusalem market and the second on Thursday that killed six people
and wounded 192.

Iranian government sources even claimed that Iran was not in a
hurry to have the ambassadors of EU members return to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian evening paper Kayhan reported today that the EU
special envoy came here in "an attempt to bring about a return of
European ambassadors to Tehran."
</P>
<P>
All the EU countries, except Greece, recalled their ambassadors
home from Tehran after a German court last April implicated top
Iranian leaders in the killing of three Kurdish dissidents and
their translator in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to punish Iran, EU also decided not to hold
ministerial meetings between any of its member state and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has insisted that the German ambassador be at the tail
of any return by EU envoys to Iran -- a condition Germany views as
an unacceptable "divide and conquer" tactic.
</P>
<P>
Iran's new president, 54-year-old moderate cleric Mohammad
Khatami who was sworn in office on August 4 after a landslide
victory, has signaled a new era in Tehran's attitude to foreign
relations, calling for an "active and fresh presence."

<HEADLINE> Iran to Produce 140 Tonnes of Caviar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that it would
produce 140 tonnes of caviar by the end of the current Iranian
year ending on March 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Qassemi, Director General of Mazandaran Provincial
Fisheries Organization, said that 852 fishermen were busy catching
Beluga fish in Caspian Sea's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 8 million Beluga roes are to be poured into
the Caspian Sea this year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian caviar is a product of the southern coast of the
Caspian Sea which has an ideal environment for sturgeon fish.
</P>
<P>
Unpolluted and healthy nature, appropriate depth of water,
temperate climate, traditional method of fishing together with
precise processing by skilled and experienced caviar processors
create the famous Iranian caviar of high quality.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the world's caviar come from three different
Caspian Sea sturgeon fishes: Beluga, Asetra, and Sevrouga. Caviar,
energetic and delicious foodstuff, became famous as the "black
pearl of the Caspian Sea."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Exchanges to Beef Up Internet Policing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's stock exchanges are
beefing up their policing of stock promotion on the Internet,
following a similar move by the U.S. stock market Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
Canada's largest stock exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSE), has announced a two-phase plan to step up its surveillance
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The first phase is a software program that will take all the
"usenet" discussion groups the exchange receives on its server and
send them to its market surveillance department, using a filter
that highlights TSE-listed stocks.
</P>
<P>
That phase should be in place before the end of the year,
according to Rob Cook, TSE's director of market surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"In phase two, we'll get a Web crawler to look for new
information appearing on Web sites, related to TSE-listed stocks,"
he was quoted by a report today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move by the TSE came as Nasdaq had said it would be
increasing its policing of the Internet through a search engine,
which is designed to patrol the internet for illegal hyping of
4,000 Nasdaq-listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The new tool will be programmed with a series of stock phrases
such as "Invest now! You'll double your money in two months" --
phrases people have been using.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq's new search engine is expected to be put into use
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Romanzin, an Alberta Stock Exchange spokesman, said five
market surveillance staff there spend up to two hours each a day
surfing the Net.
</P>
<P>
"It's a common area of concern amongst all exchanges," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The British Columbia Securities Commission said it is also
looking at specialized search engines to police the Internet stock
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Yet, one Canadian regulator conceded that the fight against
stock promotion on the Internet will be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
"We're regulators with a finite amount of resources and it's
tough to keep up," he said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Trade Unions Reject Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian trade unions are
determined not to establish any relations with their Israeli
counterparts before Arab rights are fully restored, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) Sayed
Rashed made the statement at the inauguration of the extraordinary
session of the Central Council of the International Confederation
of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU).
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened here today to discuss means of supporting
Arab workers in the Palestinian self-rule areas, in the Golan
Heights and in southern Lebanon against Israel's oppressive
measures.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Rashed hailed efforts exerted by Egypt
to salvage the peace process and to bring about a just and
comprehensive peace in the area that would be based on the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
"ETUF will never set up normal ties with the Israeli General
Federation of Labor (HISTADRUT) unless Arab rights were restored
and the Mideast peace is achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1979, but
most of its professional unions have not normalized ties with the
Jewish state because of lack of progress in the Mideast peace
process.

WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today mourned the deaths of Mother Teresa and Princess Diana,
praising them for their deep compassion for those in need.
</P>
<P>
"Mother Teresa and Princess Diana -- two women of vastly
different background and worlds -- are gone, but each of them in
her own ways has shown us what it is to live a life of meaning
through concern for others," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the two from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts,
where he was vacationing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described Mother Teresa, who died in Calcutta Friday at
age 87, as "one of this century's greatest humanitarians."
</P>
<P>
He said the two had much in common. "Their lives were very
different but ultimately bound together by a common concern for,
and commitment to, the dignity and worth of every human being,
especially those too often overlooked, the desperately poor and
abandoned, the sick and dying," Clinton said.
</P>

Diana, 36, died last Sunday in a car crash in Paris, along with

<HEADLINE> Viruses Crowd Saskatchewan Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Canadian scientists have
discovered that wetlands and ponds in the province of Saskatchewan
have one of the highest concentrations of viruses in the world.
</P>
<P>
The count of 2.5 billion viruses per milliliter of water
astounded the two scientists, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Robarts of Environment Canada's National Hydrology
Research Institute and Prof. David Bird of the University of
Quebec said that more research is required to determine the nature
of viruses.
</P>
<P>
The findings are not likely to have serious implications for
human or animal health, the scientists said. Rather, they fit an
emerging picture of an invisible but extraordinary active part of
most aquatic ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
Previous research found high concentrations of viruses in
marine water -- about 10 million per milliliter of water.
</P>
<P>
The latest findings appear to show that other aquatic systems
are just as virally active as the oceans, said Prof. Curtis Suttle
at the University of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"We are filling the picture. Viruses are not only extremely
important in the oceans, but in lakes and ponds and sediments.
Basically they are everywhere we look," Prof. Suttle said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed that it would be alarmist to raise
questions about the quality of drinking water in the prairie
province.
</P>
<P>
"There is no relationship between the abundance of viruses in
the environment and the abundance of animal pathogens," Prof.
Suttle added.

YAOUNDE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A bill to amend certain
provisions of the law governing Cameroon's presidencial elections
was adopted by the National assembly Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill was examined by the Costitutional Laws Committee and
adopted by the majority parliamentarians at the plenary session
of the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The bill was adopted in the absence of parliamentarians of the
major opposition party, Social Democratic Front (SDF), which staged
a walkout during dileberations to protest against the draft
report of the bill, which is said to be compiled without concerns
of the SDF parliamentarians in the Constitutional Laws Committee.
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of the Constitutional Laws Committee had
severly critisized the issue that empowers the Ministry of
Territorial Administration to receive, examine and reject
application files of candidates.
</P>
<P>
They also called for independent group to be much invloved in
the various supervisory commissions.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill was finally adopted since the ruling
Cameroon Peoples' Democratic Movement (CPDM ), has an
overwhelming majority in the Constitutional Laws Committee.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tightens Siege on Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 6 (Xinhua)-- Israel has been tightening
its siege on Palestinian self-rule areas and arrested more
Palestinians inside the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center (JMCC) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops set up road blocks at the entrances of
Palestinian cities, towns, villages and refugee camps on the third
day of the total closure re-imposed on Palestinian territories
following three explosions in Jerusalem Thursday, the JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian students were not allowed to go to school,
patients and doctors barred from going to hospital and Christian
pilgrims were refused to enter Bethlehem, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Ministry of Education declared today a "state
of emergency" in education, because a great number of students and
teachers could not go to school due to the closure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Nablus, all schools were closed today,
because most of the students and teachers live in the outskirts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee for Education, Culture and Science of
Palestine has warned individuals and employees of non-government
organizations not to enter Israel for any meetings or workshops
due to security and political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's bombings in Jerusalem that killed seven people and
wounded 192 others triggered another round of hostilities between
the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tripartite summit of Palestine, Egypt and Jordan
was reportedly scheduled to be held in Cairo Sunday to discuss the
latest developments in the Mideast, seek ways of reviving the

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Situation Peaceful and Stable: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today stressed that situation in kenya is peaceful and stable,
criticizing continuous negative reports about Kenya and its
leadership by foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
These foreign journalists enjoyed the peace, security and
other modern facilities available here which cannot be found in
the troubled spots of Africa they wrote about, said the
73-year-old Moi who has been in power for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
They described the eastern African country as being in chaos,
Moi charged. More than 150 foreign correspondents are based in
Nairobi currently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on his ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) and the opposition to make efforts to maintain peace
and development in the country, saying a coalition of parties
will promote tribalism and scare away potential investors.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks at the national gathering where more than
845 million Shillings (13.6 million U.S. Dollars) were donated by
all walks of life to assist Kenya's women development programs.
</P>
<P>
The money will be distributed fairly and accordingly to all
provinces, Moi assured.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the inter-parties parliamental group completed its
technical work on minimum constitutional reforms which will have
some so-called oppressive laws on public security and election
repealed or revised, the Kenya TV Network (KTN) reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen foreign embassies here, mainly from western
countries, have announced their support for the work of the
13-member parliamental group, formed by KANU and the opposition
jointly, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition umbrella body National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC) has dismissed the group's talks and
called national strikes and demonstrations to press the
government for total constitutional reforms before the general
election.
</P>
<P>
The strikes and demonstrations have been scheduled for
September 17,18, and October 8,9, NCEC senior member Willy
Mutunga said Thursday. He said that rallies are also to be held
in Kisumu, Kenya's third-largest city, on Sunday, and in Nairobi
on October 10, a public holiday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 parliamental members held a meeting last
Thursday and resolved to form a 13-member inter-parties
parliamentary body to replace NCEC to spearhead reforms talks
between KANU and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KANU reiterated it will not hold dialogue with the
NCEC as the latter is unregistered, insisting that the reforms
talks should only be undertaken within legal framework.
</P>
<P>
KANU will open its National Delegate Conference on September
16 over reform talks and the forthcoming general elections. At a
KANU conference before the first multi-party election in 1992,
Moi was elected as KANU's sole presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Political atmosphere has been tightening in the country
following several rounds of violent clashes between the
government and the opposition since May, the key loan cut by the
International Monetary Fund and killings on the Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that he would soon announce the poll date.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Peace, Development Remain a Dream for Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- When the Philippine government
and the separatist Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) signed a
historic peace accord one year ago, many believed that the main
southern island of Mindanao would embark on a road to peace and
prosperity from then on.
</P>
<P>
But the past 12 months showed that peace and development have
eluded Mindanao, where the nearly 20 million population has grown
so familiar with war and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the landmark peace agreement has made a positive impact
on the region, home to 14 million Christians and six million
Bangsamoro people or Philippine Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord ended the 24-year-long bitter war between the
government troops and the MNLF, which had claimed nearly 120,000
and caused more than 30 million U.S. dollars in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM), composed of four provinces, was set up with MNLF chairman
Nur Misuari as its governor. The Southern Philippines Council for
Peace and Development (SPCPD) was also created to oversee peace
and development in the ARMM and other 10 southern provinces and
nine cities.
</P>
<P>
To help develop war-battered infrastructure in Mindanao, the
government nearly doubled its budget for the SPCPD-covered
provinces this year and did a lot to lure foreign investors into
the region.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the peace agreement failed to silence guns in the
region, and an economic boom as predicted by the government and
the rebel-turned governor Misuari remains a distant dream of the
Mindanao people.
</P>
<P>
Just one month after the signing of the accord, the fragile
peace was shattered after another Muslim rebel group, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), attacked some military posts to
remind the government of their influence on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF but more radical, has
been strongly opposed to the Manila-MNLF peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes between the military and the MILF escalated to a
large-scale conflict in late June this year, during which the
military seized the MILF's second largest stronghold in Cotabato
province.
</P>
<P>
The three weeks of conflict claimed lives of more than 100
people, including some civilians, and displaced more than 70,000
residents, many of whom have refused to return for fear of a
flare-up of the war.
</P>
<P>
The military and the MILF later reached an initial truce accord
with the mediation of Misuari. But both sides failed to agree on
principles on a general truce in their seventh round of initial
peace talks early this month.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the MILF, some extremist Muslim groups such as Abu
Sayyaf have also refused to open peace talks with Manila and
mounted terrorist attacks on government troops in southern
Mindanao from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rampant kidnap-for-ransom syndicates struck hard in
Mindanao despite a massive presence of anti-kidnapping forces in
the region, forcing many local businessmen to live a secluded life
or flee the island.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the unstable law and order situation, many
potential domestic and foreign investors are staying away from
Mindanao, which had already been neglected for decades. Lack of
the badly-needed investments made the hopes of economic
development in Mindanao dim.
</P>
<P>
When the peace accord was signed, officials in Manila
confidently predicted that the Mindanao economy would be soon on
the verge of take-off with investors flocking to the resource-rich
region.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign business delegations did visit the region and show
great interest in tapping opportunities there, but few of them
have actually taken follow-up actions.
</P>
<P>
According official figures, foreign investors committed nearly
60 billion pesos (two billion U.S. dollars) of investments in some
200 projects in Mindanao during the period between September 1995
and this April. But only one sixth of them had already been
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
An official at the SPCPD regional investment board explains
that both foreign and domestic investors still maintain a
wait-and-see attitude, due to insecurity, poor infrastructure and
lack of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
A failure to show peace dividends -- stability and economic
miracle -- as promised to the Mindanao people has, in turn, taken
its toll on the trust in Misuari and the peace agreement itself.
</P>
<P>
Wide dissatisfaction is growing among Misuari's followers,
especially within the MNLF camp, at the slow progress in the
implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, 7,500 of the nearly 30,000 MNLF members should
be integrated into the government troops and the national police
force. Others can get a job with the government-sponsored
livelihood programs after being disarmed.
</P>
<P>
But during the past year, only 1,100 MNLF members were made
regulars. Among those disarmed, many remain unemployed due to lack
of livelihood projects. As a result, thousands of disgruntled MNLF
men have reportedly defected to the MILF camp.
</P>
<P>
The current peace initiative may lose steam if the government
and Misuari fail to show peace dividends to Mindanao in coming
years, political observers here warn.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Serve As Window for Progressing Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- An ongoing exhibition titled
"Glorious Five Years" has given spectators a complete picture of
the economic growth and social progress in China's northermost
Heilongjiang Province since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which opened Saturday in Beijing, outlines the
economic advances in Heilongjiang through photographs and words.
</P>
<P>
The province scored 240.26 billion yuan in its gross domestic
product in 1996, a rise of 41.7 percent over five years ago,
seeing an annual growth rate of 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the application of more advanced technology in farming,
the province has been one of China's major commodity grain
production bases, and the total grain output reached 30.47 billion
kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
The animal husbandry in the region has also developed rapidly,
according to the exhibition, which shows that the province now has
970,000 cows, ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, as the country's old base of energy, forestry,
and mechanical and electronics industries, is hurrying to improve
the competitiveness of its products.
</P>
<P>
The Daqing Oilfield's success in using hi-tech in oil
exploitation and its annual output of crude oil have provided more
than 50 million tons over the past successive 21 years.
</P>
<P>
Petrochemicals, electronics, food processing and
pharmaceuticals have become new pillar industries in the region,
while forestry and coal industries are working to improve their
sagging profits.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition shows that Heilongjiang has forged closer ties
with the outside world by opening 25 ports, and its foreign trade
volume in bordering areas has ranked first in China, seeing 6.3
billion US dollars in the 1992-96 period. It also introduced 7.1
billion yuan in funding from other provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
In the cultural sphere, artists in Heilongjiang province have
been encouraged to take searches into their heritage for
inspiration, and as a result 14 dramas have won national prizes.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rebukes Call for Unilateral S. Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today rejected the call for a unilateral
pullout from South Lebanon, where 13 Israeli soldiers were killed
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was making the statement this morning at the weekly
Cabinet meeting attended by senior defense officials to discuss
the situation in South Lebanon, especially the Friday incident
that killed 12 Israeli soldiers and stunned the army as well as
the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
A special Israeli naval squad was ambushed by Hezbollah forces
early Friday near a village between Sidon and Tyre while on their
way to carry out a raid mission. Eleven commandos were killed,
another soldier went missing, presumed dead, and four others
wounded in the fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
This morning, one more Israeli soldier was killed when
Hezbollah gunmen shelled Israeli outposts in the eastern sector
of the Israeli-proclaimed South Lebanon security zone.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu ruled out an immediate unilateral withdrawal from
South Lebanon despite the recent disaster and blamed politicians
from the opposition for calling for such a pullout.
</P>
<P>
He said such a call would only hurt the troops stationed in
South Lebanon, while encouraging the Hezbollah by "adding oil
into the engines of Hezbollah rockets."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also criticized some government officials for
disclosing the details of the discussions on South Lebanon during
the emergency security Cabinet meeting held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the meeting discussed several options
presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, including
reducing Israeli military presence and carrying out unilateral
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The latest tragedy has heated up the debate on Israel's
continued military presence in South Lebanon, at a time when the
nation was caught in grief over the triple suicide bombings
Thursday in a central Jerusalem pedestrian mall that killed seven
people and wounded 190 others.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel established the so-called South Lebanon Security
Zone in 1985, its troops have been bogged down in a cruel
guerrilla war with Muslim guerrilla forces fighting to liberate
South Lebanon from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
So far there have been 219 Israeli soldiers killed in South
Lebanese fightings, excluding the 73 killed in February this year
when two transport helicopters collided.
</P>
<P>
Following Friday's incident, the opposition Labor party's
lawmaker Yossi Beilin once again called for the government to
pull out troops unilaterally and unconditionally from South
Lebanon. He said Israel can be far better defended behind a good
fence along the northern border.
</P>
<P>
Beilin is organizing a multi-party campaign to push for the
unilateral withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, other lawmakers disagreed with Beilin's view. Labor
lawmaker Ephraim Sneh criticized Beilin's remarks as "shameful
defeatism." The ruling Likud party's lawmaker Uzi Landau warned
that "disasters ought not be exploited to further pet political
projects."
</P>
<P>
The Leftist Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid also disagreed
with Beilin, saying a unilateral withdrawal would only bring
terrorist groups along the northern border. He said a deal was
needed with Syria, which is regarded by Israel as the main sponsor
of Hezbollah forces.
</P>
<P>
Labor's leader Ehud Barak convened a party meeting today to
discuss the Lebanese issue. Former prime minister Shimon Peres
echoed Sarid's view that the only way to solve the South Lebanon
problem was through conducting negotiations with Syria in order
to reach a peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> China's Computer Market on High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's computer market
registered a 39.1 percent growth during the first half of this
year, making the country the fastest emerging consumer of personal
computers in the world.
</P>
<P>
China claimed 23 percent of the PC sales of the Asia-Pacific
region, with the exception of Japan, in the January-June period
this year, representing the largest buying force in the region,
according to a survey report from Dataquest, an
internationally-renowned market survey firm based in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legend Group, the biggest PC seller in China, ranked
eighth among the region's top 10 PC makers, and held a market
share of 2.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the high growth and profitability of the market,
more and more newcomers, mainly from the domestic industrial
sector, jumped on the bandwagon in spite of the increasingly stiff
competition among Chinese and foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
Heguang Group, one of the leading computer agents in China,
launched its own PC brand at the end of August in Beijing,
Shanghai and three other Chinese cities, and opened more than 30
specialty shops and seven maintenance centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lingyu, vice-president of Heguang, said that the group has
formed a production capacity of 200,000 PCs annually in addition
to having one of the strongest sales networks in the country, and
thus is prepared to draw lines in the sand with any PC giant.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the market began a new round of competition with
the participation of several big-sized electronics firms,
including Hisense, one of the country's largest household
electronic appliance manufacturers, and Shida Group in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Joel Stead, vice-president of Seagate, the world's largest
supplier of hard discs, said that about three million PCs will be
sold on the Chinese mainland this year, and thus providing a great
business opportunity for most computer makers here.
</P>
<P>
The company spent 25 million US dollars on its producing base
in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, last year, and the Seagate investment
will reach 200 million dollars in the Chinese market this year, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Building Materials Industry Witnesses Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's building materials
industry has witnessed an annual growth rate of 25.2 percent in
output value over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
With a large number of infrastructural and housing projects
underway, the industry has entered its best development period
yet, officials say, adding that the industry accomplished its
tasks outlined in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the output of cement reached 490 million
tons last year, accounting for more than a third of the world
total. Output of plate glass came to 160 million boxes, accounting
for nearly 30 percent of the world total.
</P>
<P>
The production of glass has registered a rapid increase and has
basically met the demand by the country's building and automobile
industries, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The industry's overall output value reached 435.2 billion
yuan (54.4 billion US dollars) in 1996 and its sales
income came to 396.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The state has adjusted the structure of the cement and glass
sectors, encouraging the launching of large projects and the
production of quality products.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the production proportion of large and
medium-sized factories is on the rise, as is the ratio of
high-grade products such as toughened glass.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey of industrial products shows that
first-class products of the building materials industry account
for more than 70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Another survey showed that 86.4 percent of the building
materials meet the state standards set in 1996, 9.2 percentage
points higher than the country's average level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more products in the industry have adopted
international standards, with the ratio climbing to 41 percent
from 15 percent in 1985. Early this year, 113 million tons of
cement were reported to be up to international standards.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, some 11.7 billion dollars worth of
building materials have been exported, with an annual growth rate
of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year witnessed the exportation of 2.17 billion
dollars of building materials, 6.4-fold higher than in 1987.
</P>
<P>
More end products have been exported, with the ratio rising to
70 percent last year, the survey shows.

BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing aims to build its
experimental zone of new technology industrial development into an
international hub of high and new technology in three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
The zone is the first national high and new technology
development zone in the Chinese capital city. Centered around
Zhongguancun district in the northwest part of the city, the zone

transformation of the present growth mode, innovation of
technology, enlargement of the industrial scope, and expansion of
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 4,506 new technology businesses in the
zone, including some of China's leading computer and information
companies like Legend, Stone and Founder.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the zone turned out an industrial output value of 13
billion yuan, and an export volume of 267 million US dollars. The
targets for the year 2000 are: 35 billion yuan in industrial
output value, one billion US dollars in export volume, and two

<HEADLINE> China's Success Provides Example for Others, Cuban Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China has made amazing
achievements since its adopting the opening-up and reform policy
and the forthcoming 15th congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) is important to the country's future, a high-ranking Cuban
official said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lage Davila, vice chairman of the Council of State and
executive secretary of the Council of Ministers, said in an
interview with Xinhua, " Great changes have taken place in China
in recent 20 years. Its economy has obtained a rapid development
and the people's living standards have been greatly improved."
</P>
<P>
"I witnessed the changes during my two visits to China in 1992
and 1993," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lage said that the great success of China should be attributed
to the CPC's correct leadership and the opening-up and reform
policy.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has been growing at an average annual rate
of 9 percent, as a result, China realized the target of doubling
its gross national product (GNP) five years ahead of schedule,
Lage said.
</P>
<P>
The grain output of China has reached 500 million tons and its
steel production has gone up to 100 million tons, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has successfully curbed inflation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is remarkable that China is able to feed a huge population
which accounts for 22 percent of the world's total while it is
blessed with only seven percent of the world's arable land, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its development course according to its own
national conditions and did not blindly follow others, he said.
</P>
<P>
This, as part of China's experiences in economic development,
is what other nations could draw on, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba also values late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's wise
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and will
learn what is suitable for Cuba," Lage said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the CPC's forthcoming congress, which he
said would further consolidate China's political system and lead
to an economically stronger China.
</P>
<P>
China will make greater contribution to peace and stability in
the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Industry Registers Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum industry
made a big leap forward in the 1991-1996 period, increasing output
from 137 million tons to 141 million tons. The country is now the
fifth largest oil producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, president of China National Petroleum
Corporation, the biggest state-owned oil company, which turns out
90 percent of the country's crude oil and 86 percent of its
natural gas, said that a stable output was maintained in the
oilfields in eastern China during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The Daqing Oilfield, the largest in China, for instance, has
kept an annual output of more than 50 million tons for 21 years
running.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development of the oil industry was in full
swing in the west. Annual output of crude oil increased
from 7.02 million tons to 14.33 million tons in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
An additional three billion tons of oil were found in Xinjiang
during the past five years, largely easing the shortage of energy
sources there, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country explored 606 billion cubic meters of
natural gas reserves, and increased the gas output to 16.44
billion cubic meters in 1996, 1.33 billion cubic meters more than
the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
Two natural gas pipelines, one connecting the north of Shaanxi
Province and Beijing, and the other running from Shanshan to
Urumqi in Xinjiang, has gone into operation, supplementing the
energy supply in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The oil refining capacity of the country was doubled during the
last five years, hitting 28.4 million tons annually. Last year
China refined a total of 18.2 millions of crude oil, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
China has clinched 36 oil projects with other countries since
1991, attracting 790 million US dollars in foreign fund. So far,
21 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have approved
foreign-funded petroleum projects.
</P>
<P>
Also, China has signed seven oil exploration contracts with
Peru, Sudan, Venezuela and Kazakhstan, and will get 12 million
tons of oil by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said his company generated 145 billion yuan (17.7 billion
US dollars) in petroleum and natural gas sales last year, and made
8.96 billion yuan (1.1 billion US dollars) in profit.

Villeneuve can appeal but the timing of this heavy sanction,

TOKYO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazuyoshi Miura scored four

</P>
<P>
The win gave Japan the early lead in Group B, which also
includes South Korea, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Miura put the home side ahead in the fifth minute when he
converted a penalty after defender Masami Ihara was tripped in the

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Urge Intensified Efforts to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Egypt, Jordan
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today called on
Washington to double its efforts to salvage the jeopardized peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and
PNA President Yasser Arafat issued the call in a released
statement at the end of their two-and-half-hour urgent meeting
here, convened to coordinate their stance before the first trip
to the Mideast by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this
week.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak greeted Hussein and Arafat at the airport this morning
and accompanied them directly to his palace. They did not speak
to reporters and seemed to avoid making any predictions about
Albright's multi-leg trip that include Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Jordan, Egypt, probably Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders welcomed the upcoming tour of Albright
to the region and expressed hope for its success.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to revive the Palestinian-Israeli
peacemaking that has been in crisis since March over Jewish
settlement construction on land the Palestinians want as part of
a future state.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate has been deepened by the suicide attacks in
Jerusalem, first on July 30 when two human bombs killed 15
Israelis and now on last Thursday when seven were killed by a
triple bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders condemn terrorism and the use of violence
targeting innocent civilians and said that violence runs
contrary to the spirit of peace, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they urged for taking measures to help the parties
directly concerned with the conflict, to transcend the current
stalemate and escape the crisis that threatened the region and
the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
"The three leaders called on the world community in general
and the forces that play a major role in sponsoring the Middle
East peace process in particular, to intensify efforts and double
their interests to confront the dangers to the peace process,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that people in the Mideast have to be aware that
peace is their "unnegotiable strategic option of no return" and
take viable measures to avoid creating any new obstacles in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders called for fully implementing the signed
agreements and avoiding unilateral decision that contradicted the
spirit of peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
diplomatic ties with Israel and played important roles in past
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders met in the aftermath of a triple
suicide bombing in Jerusalem Thursday and the tight Israeli
closure of Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has held the PNA "indirectly responsible" for the
attacks, the second in the city in five weeks, and reimposed a
complete closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip which had been
eased earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Friday ruled out handing over more land to Palestinians until
Arafat cracked down on Muslim militants, accusing him of failing
to honor a commitment under interim peace accords to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has redeployed its troops, handing over much of the
Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule
under peace deals with Arafat starting in 1993. It is supposed to
withdraw from more of the West Bank by mid-1998.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- With just five days to go
before the opening of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), Beijing residents are eagerly anticipating
the event designed to set China's social and economic development
course for the future.
</P>
<P>
Streets and alleys of the capital city are decked out with
flowers, billowing flags and colorful bunting to greet the
meeting, which is to start on September 12 as proposed by the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the Tian'anmen Square, horticulturists and gardeners are
arranging all kinds of potted flowers and creating artificial
landscapes, and onlookers and tourists stop to take photographs.
</P>
<P>
Among them was a retired cadre named Xue Minggui in his early
sixties, who was taking a picture of his grandson. "Every resident
can witness the great expansion of all businesses during the
course of the reform and opening-up, which were first launched in
the late 1970s," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, He said he hopes that the congress will further build
up the people's confidence in the country's successful march along
the road charted by Deng Xiaoping.

Beijing has approved a total of 12,000 foreign-funded
enterprises over the past two decades, with a combined contractual
investment of 20 billion US dollars from overseas, according to Yi
Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Commission on Foreign
Trade and Economic Relations.

opening-up pace after the congress and that Beijing, too, will
open still wider to the outside world.

rally at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the past
week on hectic short-covering and speculative buying by investors

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's New Pudong Area Seeks Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Pudong, formerly a remote,
backward corner in the metropolis of Shanghai, which emerged as a
major development zone in the early 1990s, is working to attract more
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the local government also hopes to increase
earnings from tourism. Local policymakers hope to transform the
rapidly developing district into a dreamland for both domestic and
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
The local New Pudong Area Administration recently
recommended four new tours and listed 15 tourism projects for
domestic and overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, tourists can now visit Asia's tallest
tower, the Orient Pearl TV Tower, and the nation's largest stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can also visit hundreds of garden-like modern factories
and office buildings in Pudong's four development zones, and view
the Bund on the opposite side of the Huangpu River, an area
featuring centuries-old western-style highrises.
</P>
<P>
Other attractions include a wildlife zoo, a park exhibiting the
unique lifestyles of ethnic groups in China, the Huaxia Tourist
City, and an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
The 15 proposed investment projects include a forest nature
reserve, a holiday resort, a coastal cable-car project, the World
Park, a seashore sports ground, a floral park, the Seashore Health
World, a recreational center, the Shanghai Historic Wax Museum, a
sports park, a festival park, a holiday farm project, and a forest
bathing zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The actual use of overseas
investment has gone up by 1.49 percent in the first half of this
year, though the number of newly-approved foreign-funded firms and
contractual foreign investment plunged notably.
</P>
<P>
The two figures plummeted to 9,753 companies and 22.81 billion
US dollars, down 30.64 percent and 50.01 percent respectively,
compared with the corresponding period of the last year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were presented at today's news conference on the
upcoming '97 China Investment and Trade Talks, which will be held
in Xiamen, Fujian Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
According to official numbers, by the end of June this year,
China had approved 293,573 overseas-financed enterprises, with a
contractual foreign investment of 492.2 billion US dollars and an
actual overseas investment of 197.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 230,000 of these firms are in operation, while
21,000 have halted business and another 38,000 plan to do the
same, citing lack of operating funds and technological
support. according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is still the largest overseas investor, accounting
for 49.63 percent of the total overseas investment, down from 51
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Receives Most Contracted Food Supplies: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has received some 75
percent of the food supplies contracted in the first stage of the
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, a U.N. official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Local daily "Babel" today quoted the U.N. Coordinator for
Humanitarian Affairs in Iraq Eric Valt as saying that Iraq has
received a total of 1.7 million tonnes of food and other essential
needs since the deal came into force last December.
</P>
<P>
But he said only 20 million U.S. dollars worth of medicines, or
10 percent of the amount Iraq is entitled to import during the
same stage, has arrived in the U.N. sanction-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which allows Iraq to sell oil for buying
food and medicine, Iraq is entitled to import 804 million dollars
worth of food and 210 million dollars worth of medicines during
the first six-month stage of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Another 1 billion dollars earned from oil sale is earmarked for
the needs of water, electricity, education and farming sectors
which also run short under the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The deal has been renewed for another six months, but the
second stage has seen no arrival of newly-contracted food supplies
due to some disagreements between Baghdad with the UN.

<HEADLINE> Color TV Sets Festival Opens In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The '97 Shanghai Color TV Sets
Festival opened today in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
city, giving domestic color TV manufacturers an opportunity to
show off their new products.
</P>
<P>
The event is sponsored by the State Information Center (SIC),
Shanghai's Municipal Commission of Commerce, and the country's
10 top color TV makers including Changhong and Konca.
</P>
<P>
The show has been held amid reports that domestic manufacturers
are competing favorably in a market war against foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to SIC statistics, home-made products now make up 76
percent of retail sales and 63 percent of wholesales in the
domestic market, up 15 percent and 20 percent over the figures of
early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show a remarkable increase in the sales of
locally-made large TV sets.
</P>
<P>
However, some local experts are worried about the present
situation of the country's color TV-making industry. Of China's
some 100 TV sets manufacturers, 80 percent has an annual output of
less than 500,000 sets each, while only five percent each produces
over one million sets a year.
</P>
<P>
And, there is a technological gap between home-made TV sets and
foreign ones, they say.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The police has cordoned off the
University of Lagos following violence between rival secret cult
members which claimed the lives of two students at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Another round of secret cult clashes killed a final year
philosophy student and a part three mechanical engineering
student on Thursday and Saturday respectively, the New Nigerian
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first one was shot dead while the other was killed during
a counter attack by one of the opposing cult groups, the official
newspaper said, quoted a students union leader.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the students union, government officials and
university authorities decided on Saturday that security
operatives should be drafted into the campus to protect lives and
property.
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures to checkmate the activities of the
campus hoodlums, the parley also decided to seal up the rooms of
the cultists within the campus.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the case has been transferred to
the State Criminal Investigation Department for investigation,
but no person l has so far been arrested in connection with the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Apart from increasing cases of armed robbery, secret cult
menace has constituted a source of worry to Nigerians as the
cultists have continued to unleash terror on the ivory towers
across the country, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Their nefarious activities have always led to a loss of lives
while in most occasions, academic activities have been paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
In a recent public outing, Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen.
Oladipo Diya said that stiffer penalties were being worked out
against campus cultists.

<HEADLINE> Arab Nations Praise China's Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries highly value
China's dedicated pursuit of an independent foreign policy of
peace which is based on the five principles of peaceful
co-existence and has achieved "tremendous success," said a top
Arab official.
</P>
<P>
In a recent written interview with Xinhua, Mohamed A. Saket,
head of the Mission of the League of Arab States, said China has
always taken a firm stand against hegemony and supports the just
causes of the third world countries.
</P>
<P>
China always joins other developing nations and all
peace-loving countries in "making positive contributions to
maintaining regional and world peace, promoting common development
and opposing hegemonism, power politics and unjust and
unreasonable behavior in the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that China is the sole developing country among
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
Saket said that "China has made important contributions to the UN
in safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries
and solving regional disputes."
</P>
<P>
The UN needs China's involvement, and "China will best
understand the aspiration of developing countries in the UN and
international affairs in the coming years," he said, hoping that
China will contribute still more to the reform of the UN
organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with Xinhua, Egyptian Ambassador to
China Helmy Bedeir said that as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, China is in the unique position to "continue the
positive and constructive role it has always played" in economic
and social growth facing the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Bedeir pointed out that China's role is much appreciated on a
global level regarding issues such as UN reform, disarmament and
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Saket also noted that China, as the biggest developing country,
needs a peaceful international environment for its domestic
construction and "China has made great efforts and scored
tremendous successes in establishing a peaceful international
environment."
</P>
<P>
Both men held that China's prosperity and development are
significant to Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Saket said that Arab countries have a traditional friendship
with China, and they are "willing to develop bilateral and
multilateral cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that China will continue to make unremitting
efforts with the Arab states for peace and stability in the Middle
East and the world as a whole and for safeguarding the interests
of the developing countries," Saket said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed by Land-mine in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and five others wounded when a land mine exploded on a
Toyota pickup truck belonging to forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
12 km west of Huddor town, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the truck was transporting
10 armed militiamen heading for Dhiil village where Hussein
Aidid's men were maintaining a militia base since the worst
battle against the rahanwein resistance army (RRA) took place on
August 14.
</P>
<P>
A RRA spokesman admitted that his forces have planted a number
of land mines for what he called defensive purposes against the
forces of leader of south Mogadishu faction Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle put the number of the
fatalities by the land mine to more than eight.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle today repeated his warning against the use of the
roads within bay and bakol regions by the civilians and ngos,
saying his forces have again cut off the road linking Dinsor and
Burhakaba towns of Bay region.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether his forces have also planted land
mines on this important road which has been widely used for the
commercial activities between Baidoa and Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
As the hit and run guerrilla fighting by the RRA forces have
been on halt these days, the land mine planting campaign seems to
be posing hazards to the forces of Hussein Aidid in the regions
of Bay and Bakol southwest of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Huddor town, another lorry mounted
with a towing machine and a double barrel anti-aircraft machine
gun has narrowly escaped an explosion of a land mine which only
destroyed the rear part of the vehicle, but claimed no lives of
its occupants.
</P>
<P>
These hazards are taking place at a time when peace
initiatives encouraged by Hussein Aidid are continuing in the
regions of Bay and Bakol since the beginning of this month. A
delegation led by Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein, the spokesman
of Somalia's first civilian parliament, and officials from
Hussein Aidid's self-styled government are meeting elders from
the different communities of Rahanwein.
</P>
<P>
RRA representatives have characterized these peace efforts as
nonsense. Qalinle said there can be no peace in these regions as
long as Hussein Aidid's men are in control of Bay and Bakol
regions.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle claimed that Sheikh Mukhtar cannot bring about peace
since he admitted that he's not independent for his moves and
decisions.

<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- In a couple of years, a TV
viewers in the Chinese capital may order a program from the
Beijing Cable TV Station, which will be sent at the time the
viewer prefers and on a special channel with limited access.
</P>
<P>
This scenario will come true when the construction of a major
optic cable network is completed in the city, according to the
Beijing Cable Broadcast and TV Network Center.
</P>
<P>
The urban part of the optic cable network consists of a
round-city super trunk line, as well as grade-1 and grade-2 trunk
lines.
</P>
<P>
People living in Hepingli district in the city's northern part
will be the first able to watch TV programs from the network, as
construction of the the section around their area is to be
completed in two months, said the center.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the suburban part of the network will start
soon, it added.
</P>
<P>
Once it is fully operational, the network will be able to send
programs on 47 TV channels and 18 stereo FM channels
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
"Then Beijing people can listen to hi-fi radio programs and
watch hi-definition TV shows," it said.
</P>
<P>
The network will also enable local residents to have access to
video phone, video conference, remote education, TV shopping, and
computer networking services, it said.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Pays Tribute to Mother Teresa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibia today joined
millions of mourners across the world to pay tribute to Mother
Teresa of the Missionaries of Charity who died in Calcutta, India
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"She was an illuminating light that lit our souls with hope as
humans," South African Press Association quoted Namibian Foreign
Minister Theo-ben Gurirab as saying in Windhoek, the capital of
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab described last week, which also claimed the life of
Diana, Princess of Wales, as one of major devastation.
</P>
<P>
Diana died in a car crash in Paris on August 31. She was 36.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strange coincidence in that two of the
extraordinary devotees of the world's poor, needy and dying should
have died in the same week.
</P>
<P>
"One was a tall, stunning beauty of great warmth, immense
glamor and wealth. The other was in rags, tiny, unattractive,
unassuming and virtually invisible," Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
"One would think of Mother Teresa as the tallest tree in the
fauna of humanity," he said of the Roman Catholic nun who has
devoted the last 50 years caring for the sick, dejected unwanted
and dying.
</P>
<P>
"As Namibians, government, community and individuals, we would
want to join the multitudes of mourners all over the world as we
pay tribute to Mother Teresa who was a living saint among us," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Builds World's Largest Reserve for David's Deer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has built the world's largest natural reserve for David's Deer,
local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Dafeng Natural Reserve, the only one for the protection of
David's Deer in China, now has 302 such animals living in over
78,000 hectares of woodland, grassland and marshland.
</P>
<P>
The number of David's Deer is still on the rise by an annual
rate of some 23 percent, according to the official in charge of
the reserve.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than five million yuan (600,000 US
dollars) has been invested in the reserve, and the local
government has decided to give another 78,000 hectares of beach
land this year to enlarge the deers' living space.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that seven research projects have been carried
out since the reserve was established in 1986. On the basis of the
research, they have obtained a wealth of data and statistics about
the natural conditions needed for the breeding of David's Deer.
</P>
<P>
Origninally, David's Deer was a rare animal in China. But it
disappeared in the country in 1900.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts by the World Wide Fund and the
Chinese Ministry of Forestry, 39 David's Deers were brought back
to their homeland from Britain in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Stresses Need to Protect Strategic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
today stressed the need to protect Zambia's strategic sectors
from "unfair competition" arising from imported goods, according
to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks at the Lusaka International Airport
here shortly before his departure for Blantyre, Malawi to attend
the annual summit scheduled Monday of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC). He is accompanied by the First Lady
and six ministers of the government.
</P>
<P>
There is need to give priority to sectors like agriculture and
manufacturing to prevent them from collapsing under stiff
competition from imported goods, said the president, while
explaining his country does not wish to take a "protectionist"
stand.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba complained that Zambia is sometimes used as a "dumping
ground" by others. Therefore, the country wants to "level the
playing field", he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian president didn't say what measures Zambia
is going to take to protect its strategic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Zambia declared a ban on importation of wheat
flour, which is aimed at promoting local wheat milling.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the integration of the SADC, Chiluba said Zambia
is consistent and will continue to fight for the removal of trade
barriers which is the key to the achievement of regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the SADC members will double their
efforts to remove the barriers and allow the free flow of
investment.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which was founded in 1992 and groups 12 countries,
is struggling for the integration of the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit to be held Monday is expected to review, among
other issues, the body's program of action in various sectors
such as agriculture, food and natural resources, mining, human
resources, employment and labor as well as trade tariffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Film star Sylvester Stallone
formally signed before Sunday's Italian Grand Prix to make a
major international film on Formula One motor racing.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, Stallone will star in the film with
an international cast including some current Grand Prix drivers.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them have star quality," said the actor.
</P>
<P>
He would not name any of the possible cast, but said that" many
of today's performers have an attraction to racing."
</P>
<P>
He formally signed a contract with Formula One supremo Bernie
Ecclestone, although it had been announced last July 17 that he
had bought the rights to make the film from Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
Stallone said the film would use new technology not seen in
films before" to allow the audience to be in the mind, emotions
and on the track with the drivers of these machines."
</P>
<P>
It will be shot mainly in Europe, mixing both real and staged
Grand Prix scenes.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be interesting all the way through," Stallone said,
who shot to fame after he played a boxer in Rocky.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (xinhua) -- Turnover at the
Shanghai-based fund center dropped markedly in August while
business through intermediary services surged, the latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Business volume in August was down 8.8 percent from July to
5.31 billion yuan, which was also 64 percent less than that for
the corresponding month of last year.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that borrowings in August plunged 57.9
percent to 1.223 billion yuan, while lendings dived 58.3 percent
to 1.227 billion yuan. Outstanding borrowings and lendings reached
653 million yuan by the end of last month, down 82.2 percent from
July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the drastic decline in total business volume
to an improved interbank money market and increased risk awareness
of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that deals struck through intermediary
services reached 28.66 billion yuan, about 141.6 percent of the
total for the first seven months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says His Option Is to Endorse Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today that what he meant by keeping his options open
includes endorsing his successor from the ruling party for next
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos caused public anxieties when he announced last week that
he was keeping his options open -- a remark interpreted by many as
a statement that Ramos was planning for re-election if amendments
are made to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Now, what are the options that I am talking about which has
created a lot of unhappiness..., the President has options,
including actions for the endorsement of a presidential candidate
under the banner of the majority party..." Ramos told reporters
today in Mabalacat, the Northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also denied that his administration is planning to impose
martial law in the country in order to extend his term.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for calm and sobriety in the face of rumors, saying
that speculative statements "can only undermine efforts to sustain
the country's economic gains and political stability."
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, Ramos is only allowed to
serve a single six-year term, and must step down in June next
year.
</P>
<P>
But opposition parties are accusing the Ramos administration of
creating instability by planting bombs in cities and using
explosion incidents as an excuse to impose martial law in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, two separate bomb blasts in Manila killed six
people and wounded over 60 others.

<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- ECOWAS travelers check, a
monetary instrument designed to facilitate economic integration
in west Africa, is expected to be launched at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The move is widely regarded by economic watchers as a prelude
to monetary integration and the eventual adoption of a single
west African currency by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Governors of Central Banks of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is scheduled to meet in
December to give a final touch for the launching.
</P>
<P>
The measure will enhance intra-community payments as a means
of boosting regional transactions.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal of a single monetary zone by the turn of
the century, ECOWAS leaders have established an ad hoc monitoring
committee, comprising the heads of state of Cape Verde, Cote
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of technical reports and proposals submitted to
it, the committee would give periodical policy direction and new
orientations to facilitate compliance by member states with
agreed monetary and financial targets.

<HEADLINE> Blair Sees Improving Britain As Way to Remember Diana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain can better remember
Diana, Princess of Wales, by becoming a better place, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said today.
</P>
<P>
"Let her legacy be compassion. Let us be a better, a more
compassionate Britain," Blair said in a BBC television interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was a tremendous desire for the death of the
Princess to be given lasting significance.
</P>
<P>
The funeral of Diana, who died on August 31 in a car crash in
Paris, was held on Saturday morning in London's Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair gave his backing to a permanent memorial for
Diana, saying Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown was to head
a committee on how the government might help with the memorial.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that he had seen a role for Diana as a
special ambassador for Britain before her death.
</P>
<P>
Diana had confided in an interview with The New Yorker that
Blair had wanted her to go on "mission" for Britain and she
believed Blair knew how to deploy her skills.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said much of last week's criticism of the royal
family was "very unfair", adding that the question throughout the
week had been what was best for Prince William and Prince Harry.
</P>
<P>
He said the media needed to "learn some lessons" from the death
of Diana about "the boundaries of proper conduct."

Thon, who last played for Germany in 1993, should play

<HEADLINE> Higher Input Prices, Misuse of Fertilizer Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Input price hikes and haphazard
use of fertilizers are hurting Bangladesh's agriculture and the
government should take measures to ensure the efficient
application of technology in the sector, a local newspaper said
today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the mainstay of the South Asian country's
economy and it accounts for about 37 percent of the GDP, though
that share will decline as industrial incomes and employment rise.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture's development, however, is now being curbed by
input price hikes, unplanned use of chemical fertilizers and
insecticides in farmland as well as inefficiency in applying
technology, the Independence newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
With the overwhelming majority of the population -- 87
percent-- living in the rural areas, and over half of them living
below the poverty line, no growth and poverty alleviation strategy
for Bangladesh can succeed without a healthy agricultural sector,
the newspaper stressed.
</P>
<P>
A special study report of the World Bank entitled "Bangladesh:
Agenda for Action, 1996" underlines the fact that the vast
majority of the Bangladesh population depend on agriculture and
natural resources for a large part of their food and incomes, the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already given serious attention
to the grave situation in the agriculture and its budgetary
allocations had been made to subsidize the agricultural sector,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
What is needed more urgently appears to be applying appropriate
and affordable technologies to ensure sustainable growth of the
sector, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> NAM Cultural Ministers Pledge to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) Cultural Ministers today pledged to strengthen
cultural cooperation among NAM member countries, aiming at
maintaining the cultural diversity and promoting cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
This came in the "Declaration of Principles" and "Action Plan"
approved by the first conference of NAM cultural ministers closed
on Saturday in the Columbian city of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
Cultural ministers and senior officials from 53 NAM member
countries attended the three-day meeting which started on
September 4.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reiterated that the principles of the Non-Aligned
Movement are still in effect in times of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration pointed out that the globalization of economy,
the enlarged technology gaps between the north and the south, and
aggressions and occupations are threatening the cultures of
developing countries, as well as their sovereignty and
survival. Therefore, "Each nation's sovereignty and culture should
be respected on the basis of international law, international
human rights law and the United Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
"International cultural relations should be based on
cooperation but not on confrontations," and "such cooperation
should be based on the recognition and respect for the unique
cultural properties and sovereignty of various peoples," the
Declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural diversity and viewing the world from a
multi-angle are beneficial to establishing a new world order," the
participants said.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration stressed that news media should play an
important role in promoting and defending the tolerance and
respect for the cultural diversity and the rights to cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The Action Plan covers concrete proposals concerning the ways
on how to make new cultural policies, reserve cultural heritages,
promote education, enhance cultural cooperation and defend
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and officials attending the meeting also agreed to
build a NAM cultural center in Cairo and a research institute in
Medellin. They decided to hold a NAM children and youth cultural
conference in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the conference of ministers of culture was
taken at the 11th Non-Aligned Movement Summit, which was held in
the Columbian city of Cartagena in 1995. The ministers' meeting
was the first of its kind since the establishment of the NAM in
1961.

SEOUL, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea resumed their aviation talks
Sunday in Bangkok, Thailand, to discuss the opening of air passage
routes, the Construction and Transportation Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to last until Tuesday, are sponsored by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
</P>
<P>
The two sides, having banned each other's flights from passing
through their skies since the division in 1945, had had several
rounds of meetings since last September.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to open their flight information regions (FIR) of
South Korea's southern city of Daegu and DPRK's capital Pyongyang
to all passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
But a full agreement has been delayed by differences on how to
set up a direct communication network between the two cities as
control transfer points.
</P>
<P>
Officials said South Korea has been trying to sign the pact as
soon as possible, because its national flag carrier will be able
to benefit from the accord by saving both time and costs.
</P>
<P>
Once the airspace is opened, South Korea's flights serving East
Asia, Northeast Russia and parts of the United States can shorten
their flight time by 20 to 47 minutes, said the officials.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Attracts More Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has attracted 74.5 billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds
since 1978 when China opened its doors to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Xu Dezhi, director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, announced the figure during a
Wednesday ceremony marking the premier issue of a special edition
of "Guangdong Grand Economy and Trade" covering China's resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xu attributed Guangdong's rapid economic cooperation and
foreign trade growth to constantly expanding trade cooperation
between Guangdong and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, Hong Kong contributed some 70 percent of
Guangdong's overseas funding, including one third of the
province's total construction funds.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, some 80 percent of the province's foreign
trade was conducted via Hong Kong. Projections call for the
province's 1997 foreign trade volume to hit 120 billion
U.S. dollars, including exports of 65 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu added that Guangdong has drafted a long-term development
plan which calls for its import-export volume to hit 440 billion
U.S. dollars by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Works with International Groups for Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
has made great progress in controling environmental pollution by
cooperating with foreign companies in technology, equipment and
funds.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of China's major energy and heavy industrial
bases, has contributed greatly to the Chinese economy by
developing various chemical and industrial products over the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
However, its environment is getting worse, due to poor
equipment and backward technology.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the province has worked jointly with financial
organizations in Germany, the United States, France and Japan, to
clean its air and rivers.
</P>
<P>
The city of Yangquan used 4.9 million US dollars in loans from
France to start a wastewater control project. Once completed,
80,000 tons of wastewater will be handled each day, half of which
is expected to be recycled, reported the province.
</P>
<P>
A donation of 3.21 million US dollars from Norway is to be used
next year to set up centers for air and water purification,
provincial authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,700 Dealers Start Off-Floor Trading At SSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,700 stock trading
companies from across China have started their off-floor business
at the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), one of the only two bourses
in China.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the trading volume of these off-floor dealers has
surpassed that of floor traders.
</P>
<P>
Off-floor trading was initiated at the bourse on October 14,
1996, and since then, the number of SSE members who have applied
to join has reached over 95 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,700-some off-floor dealers, 344 are based in Shanghai,
which account for over 70 perceqt of the city's stock traders.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 660 former floor members have withdrawn from SSE's
crowded trading hall.
</P>
<P>
All off-floor tradings, from any part of the country, can be
conducted through the market's computerized trading system.
</P>
<P>
The SSE authority issued a circular this May asking all its
members to supervise their own off-floor business so as to protect
the trading from unlawful practices.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the bourse has made a rule to keep copies of all
computer commands and trading results through two-way satellite
telecommunicational networks and other means.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city
in north China, attracted 475 million US dollars of funds for its
state-run enterprises during the first half of the year, 17
percent up from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 30 percent of the Chinese
industrial enterprises are struggling to drag themselves out of
the red into the black.
</P>
<P>
An offical in charge of the city's foreign investment affairs
said that the city's industry has 780 cooperative projects with
foreign investors, which have a total investment of 5.4 billion US
dollars. Two-thirds of the projects involve the city's state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Tianjin lays special emphasis on
approving high-tech cooperation projects with foreigners, and the
average foreign investment scale for each project has reached 14
million US dollars, more than twice the figure 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the major projects is the joint venture between the Tianjin
Engine Works and Japan's Toyota Company. It has a total investment
of more than 260 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Financing Center Plays Bigger Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Fund-Raising
Center, which was set up about nine years ago as a short-term
inter-bank loaning institution exclusively for local banking
bodies, has emerged as the largest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, the financing center has played an
increasingly bigger role as its influence has reached the majority
of provinces, ethnic autonomous regions and major cities.
</P>
<P>
Local experts observe that the center has contributed a lot to
bolstering the flow of domestic capital and improving the
country's monetary market.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures from the center, in the past five
and half years, it has dealt inter-bank loans amounting to 680.37
billion yuan, with most of the loans borrowed by institutions from
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, its trading volume topped 178.4 billion yuan, a more
than fivefold increase over the figure for 1992. The amount was
82.84 billion yuan in the first half of this year, though the
city's capital supply was relatively rich during the period.
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising center is a member of the National Inter-Bank
System, which was put into operation in Shanghai early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine foreign bank branches in Shanghai approved for
conducting Renminbi yuan business, six have engaged in inter-bank
loan trading at the center.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Afghanistan Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations envoy
to Afghanistan Lakhdar Ibrahimi is visiting Saudi Arabia in an
effort to find ways to end the Afghan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi arrived in the Saudi Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah
Saturday to continue his tour of countries concerned with the
prolonged conflict in Afghanistan, according to Kuwait News Agency
Kuna today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting chief of the Organization of Islamic Conference
Izzidine Al-Iraki in Jeddah today, Ibrahimi briefed him on the
results and details of his ongoing tour of Afghanistan and the
concerned states.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi had just finished visit to Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Russia and Tajikistan in search of a broad-based formula on ending
the protracted Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is expected to meet with a number of Saudi
officials on Riyadh's position on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is one of the major players in the Afghan
crisis. It had hosted a meeting of Afghan factions which resulted
in a Mecca declaration, bringing a short-lived peace to the
war-trodden Afghanistan people.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unidentified sources, Kuna said Ibrahimi may also hold
a meeting with Sheikh Mohammad Rabbani, prime minister of
Afghanistan's Taliban government, who is also in Saudi Arabia to
seek Saudi support.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia claimed it supports a peaceful settlement among
all warring factions in Afghanistan. But it was the second country
after Pakistan to give formal and immediate recognition to the
Taliban government in May.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Vows to Continue War Against Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister
Hassan el-Alfy has said that while he welcomed any attempts for
peace, he would continue to fight terrorism, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press Saturday after inspecting admission
measures at the Police Academy, the minister again rejected the
idea of a dialogue with Egypt's biggest militant organization the
Islamic Group, saying that any breach of law would be decisively
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"It is the mission of security bodies to maintain security and
law and not to make dialogue," el-Alfy said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a call made by various Islamic militant groups
last month to halt anti-government violence, he said this was a
unilateral act by the militant groups and his ministry has nothing
to do with it.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wants a halt, let him do that...For us, all firmness
will be shown against whoever breaks the law and legitimacy,"
el-Alfy said.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, spiritual leader of the
Islamic Group, known as Al Gamaa Islamiya in Arabic, announced
from his prison cell that he supports the peace initiative
forwarded by leading militants.
</P>
<P>
Since then, imprisoned leaders of a number of major militant
groups, including Gihad and Negoum Min Al Nar (Survivors of Hell),
have come out in support of the initiative. Militant leaders
abroad, however, have been reluctant to give definitive reactions.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the security bodies have managed to cut off
foreign financing for terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
In August 1993, former Interior Minister Abdel Halim Moussa
lost his job after opening up dialogue with militant groups.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,190 people have been killed in Egypt since 1992 in a
wave of violence unleashed by militant fundamentalist groups in an
attempt to topple the secular rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) was set up on August 17, 1992 by 10
countries which signed a treaty to replace the Southern African
Development Cooperation Conference (SADCC).
</P>
<P>
The SADCC was first held at Arusha, Tanzania in July 1979 to
harmonize development plans and to reduce the region's economic
dependence on South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has placed binding obligations on its member
countries, with the aim of promoting economic integration toward
a fully developed common market.
</P>
<P>
A tribunal was to be established to arbitrate in the case of
disputes between members states arising from the treaty. By
September 1993, all the 10 members such as Angola, Swaziland,
Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi
and Zimbabwe had ratified the treaty; it came into effect on
October 5.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Mauritius have subsequently become members of
the SADC, and Seychelles and the Democratic Republic of Congo
have applied to join the regional group and their memberships
will be discussed at the summit to be held Monday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty declares the following aims:
</P>
<P>
1, deeper economic cooperation and integration, on the basis
of balance, equality and mutual benefit, providing for
cross-border investment and trade, and freer movement of factors
of production, goods and services across national boundaries;
</P>
<P>
2, common economic, political and social values and systems,
enhancing enterprise competitiveness, democracy and good
governance, respect for the rule of law and human rights, popular
participation, and the alleviation of poverty; and
</P>
<P>
3, strengthened regional solidarity, peace and security, in
order for the people of the region to live and work in harmony.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting is held annually and is attended by Heads
of State and Government or their representatives. It is the
supreme policy-making organ of the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of SADC member states at ministerial level
meet at least twice a year; in addition, special meetings are
held to coordinate regional policy in a particular field by, for
example, ministers of energy and ministers of transport.
</P>
<P>
A conference with the SADC's "international cooperating
partners" or donor governments and international agencies is held
annually to review progress in the various sectors of the SADC
program and to present new projects requiring assistance.
</P>
<P>
the regional body's executive secretary is Kaire Mbuende, a
Namibian deputy agriculture minister.

BEIRUT, September 7 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was
killed in this morning's fighting with Lebanese guerrillas in
south Lebanon, according to Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Orient Radio quoted the sources as saying that the
Israeli soldier was killed when Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, launched an attack on a position of Israeli
troops in the western sector of the Israeli self-proclaimed
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops immediately retaliated the attack by
shelling Hezbollah's positions nearby. But the details of the
fighting have not been revealed by the sources, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, some 11 Israeli soldiers were killed, four
others wounded and one was missing in a fighting with Lebanese
army and resistance fighters.
</P>
<P>
The death of the Israeli soldier in today's fighting raised

</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 15-mile-wide "security zone" in South Lebanon
in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks by anti-Israeli Hezbollah
guerrillas who have been fighting to force Israel out of the
Lebanese territory.

</P>
<P>
The 19-seater Dornier 228 aircraft was on a regularly scheduled

flight for Miri from the Brunei capital Bandar Seri Begawan.
</P>
<P>
All the bodies were accounted for and they were being winched

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Technique to Cure Sterility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli doctors have
developed a new technique to produce an implanted embryo by
"fishing" for individual sperm in the testicles of an infertile
man, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
A man, 29, who bears an extra female sex chromosome, and his
wife, 22, were overjoyed to learn Saturday that doctors viewed
the heartbeat of the six-week-old embryo that has been
successfully implanted in the woman's uterus.
</P>
<P>
The man suffers from Klinefelter's syndrome, an abnormal
condition of male sexual characteristics in which the body cells
contain one or more extra X chromosome. Normally, men have an X
and a Y sex chromosome.
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of the syndrome include infertility and
atrophied testicles, and the condition affects one out of 900
men. The more extra X chromosomes the person carries, the more
severe the abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
An in-vitro fertilization unit team, headed by Dr. Aby Lewin,
performed multiple fine-needle aspirations of the man's
testicles and found two sperms which were used to impregnate ripe
ova taken from his wife.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Dr. Lewin as saying that "ours is the first
clinical pregnancy resulting from the aspiration technique on an
infertile man with this syndrome."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Adopt Common Stand on Currency Issue: Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN finance ministers
will adopt a common stand on the manipulative attacks on regional
currencies before attending the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)/World Bank meeting in Hong Kong, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Korn Dabbaransi said today.
</P>
<P>
The stand will be taken during the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
of finance ministers in Bangkok on September 18-19, Korn
Dabbaransi told reporters after meeting his Malaysian counterpart
Anwar Ibrahim here today.
</P>
<P>
Korn said, "We will have our own meeting first in Bangkok and
take a stand on the currency issue. We will decide on the ASEAN's
position."
</P>
<P>
Korn, also Thai's minister of industries and Thailand's
Badminton Association chief, is here to attend the Asian Badminton
Confederation (ABC) annual general meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that Myanmar, which joined ASEAN together
with Laos in July this year, is left out of the second ASEM in
London next year, Korn said Myanmar should not be isolated and it
should be "brought into the world community".
</P>
<P>
"We (ASEAN) will jointly discuss this issue and have a joint
position," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Thailand would boycott the ASEM if Yangon was left
out, Korn said Bangkok had yet to decide on this.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM held its inaugural meeting in Bangkok in March last
year where ASEAN members, the 15-member European Union (EU) and
South Korea, China and Japan, were present.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad indicated earlier
that he might opt out from the second ASEM meeting if the EU
persisted in leaving out Myanmar.

SHENYANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, one of the oldest and largest industrial bases in the
country, has made a rapid progress in its highway construction,
according to a recent local meeting on highways.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the province had more than 43,753 km of

<HEADLINE> China to Export More Machinery &AMP; Electronics in Second Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery and
electronics exports are expected to grow steadily in the second
half of the year owing to a number of favourable factors such as
low exchange rate and accelerated efforts to pay back rebates.
</P>
<P>
The three-percent growth in the world economy this year, the highest in
the 1990s as predicted by the United Nations, will demand a lot of
machinery and electronics, thus providing a chance for Chinese
exporters to increase their performance in the world market,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
China's exports of machinery and electronics grew 25 percent in
the first six months of this year to 25.6 billion US
dollars. Imports dropped nine percent to 1.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, general trade exports of machinery
and electronics rose 27.8 percent, compared to a 24.3 percent
growth in processing trade exports.
</P>
<P>
Of the three categories of machinery and electronics products,
electronics commodities led the other two with a volume of 9.7
billion US dollars, followed by machinery at 9.46 billion US
dollars, and light industry at 6.42 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Machinery exports grew fastest at 27.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's efforts to increase its export destinations
resulted in satisfying achievements. Exports to Latin America and
Africa developed at a rate of more than 30 percent.

BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China is considering propping
up its auto industry by forming three or four conglomerates
through restructuring, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Each group should have the ability to produce at least 400,000
vehicles annually and earn at least 1.2 billion yuan in profits on
40 billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
China has 123 automobile assembly plants, but 13 produce 90
percent of the industry's output, about 1.5 million units a year.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Machine Building Industry official stressed the
significance of achieving economies of scale, calling for
restructuring among the 13 large automakers.
</P>
<P>
The remaining plants could be transformed into parts suppliers
and subsidiaries to the auto giants or motor vehicle conversion
plants.
</P>
<P>
"The merger process is supposed to be handled through market
mechanism, rather than relying on the government to implement it,"
the official said.

<HEADLINE> China to Tap Mining Resources Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage the mining
industry to invest abroad and explore foreign mining resources,
said today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the country aims to create three to
five large and medium mineral resource development bases, plus
several small bases or shareholding projects in Latin America,
Africa and bordering Asian countries, the newspaper reported
quoting sources from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
China's annual demand for minerals in the next 20 years is
expected to grow five percent annually vs lower or negative
growth in identified reserves of most minerals.
</P>
<P>
With a mineral trade deficit of 10 billion US dollars, China is
the world's second largest mineral consumer and the third largest
importer, the mining ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the overseas mineral development plan, China will
create several mineral resource exploration teams focusing on
overseas business, including a large overseas mining corporation
and some small and medium mining firms.
</P>
<P>
The plan divides overseas mineral development into two stages.
During the 1997-2001 period, the government will draft laws to
regulate overseas mineral development. It also will select pilot
projects abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the second stage, 2002-2010, it will expand the scale of
overseas mineral development and create several overseas mineral
supply bases.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM to Meet U.S. Secretary of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini will be in Washington Monday for talks with U.S. secretary of
State Madeline Albright on the eve of her first Mideast mission
since taking office in January.
</P>
<P>
How to revive the stalled Middle East peace talks will be on
top of the agenda of their meeting. Italy is also keen to play a
role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Thursday that the peace process had been too slow in
recent months, leaving room for extremists to re-surface. He
called for greater efforts from Europe and the United States to
revive the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright, to begin her trip on September 9, will bring her
initiatives to help countries in the region resume dialogues. She
will travel to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories,
Syria, Jordan and possibly Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state is reportedly trying to save the
stalled peace process after an Israeli decision to build 6,500
houses in the Arab East Jerusalem prompted several suicide bombing
attacks against Israel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda of the meeting will be the reform of
the United Nations Security Council ahead of a U.N. General
Assembly session in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy believed reform should be based on the need to
uphold "the criteria of democracy and ample representation."
</P>
<P>
Dini and Albright will also discuss the situation in Albania
since the withdrawal of the Italy-led Multinational Protection
Force.

<HEADLINE> Sino-South African Trade to Intensify After Diplomatic Normalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The trade and economic
cooperation between China and South Africa is expected to take off
after the two countries establish diplomatic ties in near future, said
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa has grown into China's biggest trade
partner in Africa, the potential of bilateral economic ties has
not been fully tapped because of the absence of diplomatic ties,
said trade expert Tao Shui'e, a researcher with the Chinese Academy
of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She said that the bilateral trade and economic cooperation
should increase after the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chris Dlamini, director of the South African Center for Chinese
Studies, said trade and investment protection agreements, which
normally are entered into by countries with diplomatic relations,
would be the basis for trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said South Africa welcomed normalization of relations
with China and was willing to build substantive relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that with the expected most-favored nation treatment
and lower tariffs brought by trade agreement, bilateral trade will
increase remarkably. The most conservative prediction by Chinese
trade officials and experts set bilateral trade by the end of this
century at two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure for this year will be about 1.3 to 1.4 billion US
dollars, about the same as last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Chinese investment in South Africa totals 125
million US dollars, and that of South Africa in China is 60
million US dollars, according to the South African Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
today condemned the bombing attacks that occurred this week in
Cuba and expressed its solidarity with the people and the
government of that nation.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a communique,
"Mexico rejects terrorism, no matter which reasons are stated to
try to justify it."
</P>
<P>
"Mexico expresses its indignation for the damage to lives and
property caused by acts of violence against that sister nation,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, four bombs exploded in three hotels and a
restaurant in Havana, killing an Italian businessman. Bombings
also occurred in Cuba in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Mexico deplored "the injuries caused to innocent persons and
the death of Italian businessman Fabio Di Celmo," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cuban National Assembly Speaker Ricardo Alarcon, who
was attending an international parliamentary conference in Chile,
said the bombing attacks were part of a plan hatched by U.S.-based
exile groups.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to hurt the Cuban economy, to hit the tourism
industry because of its present importance," Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Cuban government has been trying to boost the
country's economy by promoting tourism which has overtaken sugar
as Cuba's main hard currency-earning industry.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon also criticized the U.S. government for turning a blind
eye to the exile groups that violently oppose the current Cuban
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany had a narrow escape
from their second ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier as they got
the equalizer only nine minutes before the final whistle in a
group nine match against Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who gave Germany their only loss so far on the way to
World Cup finals by beating them 1-0 in Stuttgart in 1985, nearly
did it again after opening the scoring through Pedro BArbosa in
the 71st minute.
</P>
<P>
But the Portuguese team lost their inspirational midfielder Rui
Costa who was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 76th
minute. The Germans took the chance and levelled the scoring
through substitute Ulf Kirsten in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
After the draw, the two teams both have 16 points, one point
behind group leader Ukraine. But Portugal have played one more
game than the German team.
</P>
<P>
Germany need to win their last two group matches to make sure
their qualification for the 1998 World Cup finals.

Estonia's Marko Kristal and Latvia's Vitaly Astafiev both

<HEADLINE> Dutch Qualify for 1998 World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands joined
Romania and Norway as European qualifiers for next year's World
Cup finals when it defeated Belgium 3-1 on Saturday in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch nationals almost duplicated their three-to-nothing
win from their away leg of the group seven qualifying tournament
which was held in Brussels last December.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo de Staelens converted a 67th-minute penalty for a
face-saving lone goal in the game which saw the hosts dominate by
controlling the ball from start to end.
</P>
<P>
Controversial Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert proved his worth
of transfer to AC Milan, by scoring one goal and setting up
another.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two minutes into play, defender Jaap Stam headed in a
corner kick from Wim Jonk to put the Dutch side on the scoreboard
first while Kluivert dribbled into the Belgian box after
receiving a pass from Denis Bergkamp only to make it 2-0 at the
54th minute.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes from the final whistle, Kluivert returned a clean
pass to advancing Bergkamp who duely scored with a left-footed
slot to seal the game away from the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert, who moved to AC Milan from Ajax, has been under
intense media pressure and been criticized at home after last
year's conviction for causing death by dangerous driving,
followed by this year's rape charges that were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
He had said that he would quit the Dutch eleven if he should
be booed in Saturday's match with Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen awarded the visiting sides
with a penalty kick after Jonk mowed down Luis Oliveira inside
the box.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians, who had hoped a miracle would send them to
France, have now to wait for more than a month before knowing for
sure whether they will join others in the cup finale.
</P>
<P>
A late goal by Georges Grun in another World Cup qualifier
against the Netherlands sent the Belgians into the 1986 cup
finals. That match was also played in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
Belgium next plays Wales on October 11 in Brussels and a win
would qualify the Red Demons into the play-off round.
</P>
<P>
The winners of the nine groups in the European qualifying
tourney go to France while the best runner-up will also qualify.
The remaining eight runners-up will then pair off and play a
home-and-away play-off in October and November to decide who will
be the last four of the 14 European qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
France is an automatic qualifier as the host to next year's
World Cup.

win the women's doubles final at the U.S. Open tennis tournament

</P>
<P>
Davenport and Novotna, seeded third, claimed their first Grand

Belarus and Gigi Fernandez of the United States in 75 minutes at
Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Davenport and Novotna were playing together for the 10th time
and had never before advanced to the semi-finals in a major as a
team.
</P>
<P>
However, top-seeded Zvereva and Fernandez have, as one of the
all-time great doubles teams, won 14 major titles -- three U.S.
Opens, five French Opens, two Australian Opens and four
Wimbledons.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who has won 68 doubles titles in her career,
including 17 Grand Slam crowns with partners including Novotna
and Martina Navratilova, announced after the match that she would
retire from doubles at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old American has won the French Open and Wimbledon
titles this season with Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
Zvereva, 26, was seeking an individual Grand Slam this year
after winning the Australian Open with Martina Hingis before

NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian 13th seed Patrick
Rafter upset second-seeded American Michael Chang in straight
sets and Greg Rusedski of Britain outlasted Sweden's Jonas
Bjorkman in five sets, both reaching the final of the 10.12
million U.S. dollars U.S. Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who had never been past the third round in this
tournament, spoiled Chang's dream of winning his first U.S. Open
title with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Rafter, who became the first Australian to
reach the U.S. Open final since Ken Rosewall in 1974, routed
Chang with 52 winners in the two-hour, two minutes victory. He
rushed the net 90 times to force the action against Chang.
</P>
<P>
The 14th ranked Rafter, who has been in five finals this year
without a victory, will meet unseeded Rusedski in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski advanced earlier with a 6-1, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5
semi-final victory over unseeded Swede Jonas Bjorkman.

Rusedski is the first British male to reach a Grand Slam

Australian Open to Vitas Gerulaitis.

endorses but won't require its Crown corporations to obey a new
international code of business practices and ethics, said reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said that like at other
companies, the managers of Crown corporations will decide for
themselves whether to adopt the code, because it is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa will not require federal Crown corporations to adopt the
code. Nor will private companies receiving federal export
assistance be required to adopt the code.
</P>
<P>
Though the code is voluntary, Axworthy expressed the belief
that Canadian companies will want to act ethically and support
human rights in the countries where they operate.
</P>
<P>
The new code, drafted by a group of Canadian companies and
associations with foreign operations, was published today.
</P>
<P>
It commits companies that participate to a set of principles on
how they will operate overseas. The code is similar to the one
adopted recently by several U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Among the new code's provisions are promises to:
</P>
<P>
-- promote human rights in areas where companies have
influence;
</P>
<P>
-- refrain from paying bribes or engaging in corrupt business
practices;
</P>
<P>
-- protect worker health and safety; and
</P>
<P>
-- shun child labor and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
It also says companies will promote social justice and allow
workers freedom of speech and association in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it stops short of saying workers can form their own labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
Among companies signing the code are Canadian Occidental
Petroleum Ltd., Alcan Aluminum Ltd., Cambior Inc., Chauvco
Resources Ltd. and Shell Canada Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Business associations supporting the code include the Business
Council on National Issues, the Alliance of Manufacturers and
Exporters Canada, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the
Conference Board of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Stresses Importance of Meeting Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A failure to meet economic
targets set for the next two years would jeopardize Greece's
efforts to enter the European Union's mainstream, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis said today.
</P>
<P>
"Remaining countries in the European Union (EU) are moving
ahead. The repercussions of a delay beyond 1999 would be highly
dangerous, and we are not going to play with the country's fate,"
Simitis said in his annual economic policy speech at this year's
Thessaloniki international trade fair.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that 1998 was an especially critical turning point
and Greece had difficult and pressing targets that the country had
to achieve simultaneously in two years at the most.
</P>
<P>
Consumer price inflation, he said, had to drop below 3 percent
in 1998, sinking to 2 percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
Although the Greek government had managed to cut inflation to
5.5 percent from 8.5 percent a year ago, tight fiscal and monetary
policies had to stay in place in order to drive it down further,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece's fiscal deficit had to drop below 3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the rate of GDP growth, estimated at 3.5 percent for
1997, was forecast to rise to 4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government also planned to bring about structural
reforms by increasing competitiveness through investments,
creating better conditions to tackle inflation, ensuring jobs by
investing in infrastructure and manpower, and by wide-ranging
administrative reforms, Simitis said.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa to Spend Money on Youth Internships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal government
will spend 90 million dollars (65 million US dollars) during the
next three years to create 1,000 public-service internships for
young Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien is expected to announce the
initiative Monday, two weeks before the new parliament opens, said
a report today.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to illustrate that assisting young people
in their search for work will be one of the top priorities of the
re-elected Liberal government.
</P>
<P>
Canada's youth unemployment rate has been notoriously high in
recent years. It stood at 16.7 percent in August, compared with an
overall jobless rate of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's government was constantly attacked in June's federal
election for failing to improve the employment of Canadian youths.
</P>
<P>
In February, the government announced a two-year, 225 million
dollar (162 million US dollar) plan to finance youth internships.
</P>
<P>
But demands were such that the funding for this year is close
to being exhausted after just a few months.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is expected to make the announcement after a meeting
in Toronto with senior executives involved in a private-sector
youth employment initiative.
