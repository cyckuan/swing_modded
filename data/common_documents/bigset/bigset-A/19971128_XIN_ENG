<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes China's Moves for WTO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
welcomed the latest move taken by China at the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Vancouver to cut the average
tariff on imported industrial products to 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that this is a major step forward which I warmly
welcome," said Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Union's executive body, adding that China had shown a "real
commitment" to its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession.
</P>
<P>
On the move announced by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the
APEC meeting, Brittan also said he agreed with Charlene
Barshefsky, trade representative of the United States, that the
new proposals put forward by China provided a "positive basis" for
further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Brittan recalled the negotiation over a set of principles in
Beijing in October with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, adding that the principles were
directly reflected in the latest Chinese proposals, particularly
in the acceptance of limit on peak tariffs and of a lower level of
average tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"Our task now is to flesh out the proposals in talks in Geneva
next week, and achieve progress in the detail, as well as deal
with the quite substantial number of other issues, such as
services," said Brittan.
</P>
<P>
The average tariff rate of China had been cut from 43 percent
in 1992 to 17 percent in October 1997. The Chinese government has
pledged to further the cut to 15 percent by 2000.

<HEADLINE> SADC Mining Sector under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) mining sector, facing viability
problems due to poor international market prices, can be saved
from the jaws of collapse through wholesale re-organisation, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This would involve such areas as training, production methods,
sourcing of capital, investment climate and labour relations.
</P>
<P>
While mining remains one of the region's economic backbones,
the sector is currently under a lean spell due to plummeting
world prices of minerals, increased global competition, as well
as production and labour costs.
</P>
<P>
The sector contributes approximately 10 percent of the
region's gross domestic product while accounting for 60 percent
of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
But its viability is under threat from an alarming decline in
prices of minerals particularly gold, nickel, copper and
ferrochrome.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and Tourism
Minister Simon Moyo as saying that although SADC is attracting
investment in mining, efforts to aggressively market the 14
member bloc should be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
He added that the region should move away from being suppliers
of raw materials and semi-processed products to producers of
finished goods.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Opposition Urged to Field Sole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition Safina
party, which was registered Wednesday, urged opposition parties
today to field sole presidential candidate so as to defeat
incumbent Daniel arap Moi in the December 29 poll.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties should try to choose one presidential racer
representing them all against Moi, the single presidential
candidate of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), Paul
Muite, a core member of Safina, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Safina, which was set up in June 1995, will try its best to
persuade other opposition parties to do so, he said, adding the
party itself will contest the elections only at the civic and
parliamentary level.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say it is of little possibility for
opposition leaders to reach consensus presidential candidate for
the ballot. Such efforts ended in vain in 1992 when the country's
first multi-party election was won by Moi.
</P>
<P>
Safina was denied registration on the grounds of posing
threats to "peace, welfare and good order in Kenya" at the
beginning of October when other 10 parties were registered.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 74 and in power for 19 years, is widely believed to
survive the election for another five-year rule owing to rifts
within the registered opposition parties whose number is expected
to reach some 30 before the poll.
</P>
<P>
KANU supporters selected their civic and parliamentary
candidates today in 210 constituencies across the eastern African
country.

MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari said today that cooperation between Finland
and Russia should not be damaged by territory disputes left over
by history, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the Moscow State Institute of International
Relations, Ahtisaari said that although differences remained over
the return of the Karelian area, the Finnish territories taken
over by the Soviet Union in 1940, the two countries should show
the world that they want to work together in a new Europe.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that he welcomed the recent conclusion
of a border treaty between the two countries and voiced the hope
that relations between Russia and the Baltic countries would
improve in the near future.
</P>
<P>
When talking with Ahtisaari at the Kremlin, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin echoed the Finnish president's opinion, and added
that his government was, in particular, interested in cooperation
with Finland on promoting tourist industry in the islands of the
Gulf of Finland.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say mutual claims exist regarding these
islands. However, we, as friends, can affirm that we will
cooperate over these islands," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that more tourist camps and improved travel routes are
to be established there.
</P>
<P>
"We can not say everything has been implemented, but several
issues were resolved," Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Says Millennium Problem "Manageable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today problems adjusting computer systems to the year
2000 were manageable in Britain although hard work must be done.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting, Blair said the "millennium bug" was a
serious issue on which the government had to maintain momentum.
</P>
<P>
"It should be manageable in the time but it will take quite a
lot of detailed work," an aide to Blair quoted the prime minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blair promised "decisive action" to ensure that the potential
problems caused by computers failing to recognize the year 2000
when it starts are dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Many older computers have dates in their programs which have
only two digits -- leading to a potential failure when 1999
changes to 2000, causing confusion in dates and data.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Office minister David Clark will issue a statement to
parliament later today, outlining the government's plans for
tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
President of the Board of Trade Margaret Beckett will chair a
ministerial committee to coordinate plans between the public and

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Rising temperatures look set to
make 1997 the earth's warmest year on record, showing more
evidence of global warming, British climate experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Meteorological Office said in a statement that the
average temperature of the earth will probably be about 0.43
degrees Celsius warmer than the 1960-1991 average.
</P>
<P>
"Global temperatures in 1997 have been boosted by El Nino, a
natural warming of the tropical east Pacific which occurs every
few years," said David Parker of the office's Hadley Center for
Climate Prediction and Research.
</P>
<P>
"Sea temperatures off Peru rose sharply in May, and are now up
to six degrees C higher than normal in some areas," Parker said,
adding temperature rise was causing great concern.
</P>
<P>
The five warmest years on records, which began in 1860, have
all come in this decade, and temperatures in the late 1990s have
risen about 0.6C above those at the end of the last century, the
Meteorological Office said.

LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The estimate for world wheat
production has been raised by 1 million tons to 599 million tons
in 1998 following an increased figure for China, International
Grains Council (IGC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Higher figures for Turkey and South Korea offset a decline for
China to take the forecast for trade 1 million higher to 95
million tons, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
The estimate for consumption is up 2 million to 593 million
tons, and that for stocks declines by the same amount to 104
million tons.
</P>
<P>
As far as world coarse grains production is concerned, it is
forecast 7 million higher at 886 million tons, reflecting
increases for Mexico and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Several minor revisions bring down the figure for trade by 1
million to 92 million tons, with the main reduction for South
Korea, according to IGC.
</P>
<P>
Larger overall availabilities push up the estimate for
consumption by 3 million to 900 million, and that for stocks by 4
million to 104 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Half-Billion-Dollar Power Plant to Be Built in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of
understanding was signed Wednesday to develop a half-billion-U.S.
dollar power plant in Namibia using gas from the vast Kudu gas
field off the southern Namibian coast, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The developers of the project would be Namibia's Nampower,
South Africa's Eskom and Shell International.
</P>
<P>
The 750-megawatt plant would make Namibia self-sufficient in
electricity for the foreseeable future and allow it to export
power to South Africa, Nampower said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A likely site would be Oranjemund, a port about 170 kilometers
away from the gas field.
</P>
<P>
A recent well drilled by Shell Exploration confirmed that the
Kudu gas field had reserves to supply Namibia for at least 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the gas-fired power station was estimated at
500 million dollars while the development of the Kudu gas field
would be around 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shell International Gas Ltd. Director Wim Hein Grasso said it
would be technically possible to bring gas onshore by 2000 or
2001 but the start of the power station would depend on the
demand for electricity from Namibia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said more funds would be spent on proving additional gas
reserves for larger scale development of the gas field starting
with 20 million dollars for an exploration well in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nampower Managing Director Leake Hangala said the project
would help boost Namibia's economy.
</P>
<P>
"It would provide a kick start to the economy, underpinning
the transformation of Walvis Bay into a major regional
manufacturing and trade center and breathing new life into
Oranjemund, where the power plant is likely to be built," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Grasso said even South Africa would benefit from the project.
</P>
<P>
"The development and utilization of natural gas further south
should also strengthen the economy of South Africa, in particular
the Northern and Western Cape provinces adjacent to Namibia."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Still Barrs UN Inspectors From Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today clarified that the
invitation of international observers to President Saddam
Hussein's palaces does not mean U.N. weapons inspectors are let in
there at all.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told a press
conference here that "those sovereign sites are from the very
beginning completely out of the work" of the U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. special commission for disarming Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction is seeking infringement upon Iraq
under the guidance by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"All the sovereign sites of Iraq are fully immuned from any
infringement upon them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the invitation to international observers is
meant to disprove "a wave of false allegations and lies" that the
presidential buildings are being used to hide biological and
chemical weapons, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We are to uncover all those liars," he added, but hosting
those people without ill wills is a different thing.
</P>
<P>
Iraq issued the invitation Wednesday to a limited number of
representatives from the countries involved in the U.N. inspection
work, and experts and diplomats from the U.N. Security Council
members.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf made it clear that U.N. inspectors are not invited.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that it is Iraqi initiative to "have full and
complete transparency with the world."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the number of presidential palaces open to the
observers, another sensitive issue widely discussed, the foreign
minister said "The number is not important, the principle is."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Iraq urged the Special Commission to end its
inspection in six months.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will not lift its economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has been disarmed of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Asks U.N. to Lift Arms Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has
requested the United Nations Security Council to lift the arms
embargo imposed on the country at the height of its civil war in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The government explained that the circumstances that
necessitated the embargo no longer existed, as the civil war had
already ended, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council through its permanent
representative William Bull, Liberia said the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) had already lifted all its
sanctions on Liberia after the inauguration of the elected
government in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The council embargoed deliveries of weapons and military
equipment to Liberia in 1992, seeking to facilitate the end of
the civil war which broke out at the end of 1989.
</P>
<P>
Although that did not stop the war, an ECOWAS peace plan that
went through many false starts, eventually led to the holding of
elections last July, during which Charles Taylor, a key player in
the brutal war, was elected president.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Hasina Struggling to Keep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina may take some pride in what it has
achieved after 17 months in office, as it hobbles along to the end
of yet another eventful year but enjoys relative political
stability at home.
</P>
<P>
But her government still seems hard pressed to hang on as the
opposition, bent on wresting back powers, are watching for their
chance and more political storms are in store for the ruling Awami
(people') League (AL).
</P>
<P>
Daughter of the late Bangladesh independence leader Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman, the sober-minded Hasina never hesitates to warn
her AL supporters of the danger of losing power, with her motto:
"It may be easier to assume power, but harder to retain."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to win more support for her government and also to
attract badly needed foreign investment, Hasina has traveled
around the world and made friends in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Back at home, she has been credited with nominating a neutral
state president and striving to make parliamentary democracy work.
Hasina makes regular appearances in parliament and frequently
takes part in debates, in contrast with her predecessors.
</P>
<P>
However, her bitter political foe Khaleda Zia, leader of the
main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has been
trying hard to stage a comeback since losing the general election
in June last year.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, the BNP staged its first ever nationwide shutdown,
mainly against the government's decision to provide a "corridor"
to India and its move to form a sub-regional economic bloc among
Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the BNP has held five countrywide general
strikes, along with a number of anti-government rallies and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda, the former prime minister, recently threatened to take
action to topple the government if it does not stop "suppressing
the opposition activities" and goes ahead with plans to sign a
peace accord with the pro-Indian tribal rebels in the Chittagong
Hill Tracts "at the cost of the country's independence."
</P>
<P>
The government is also under opponents' fire for its failure to
improve the law and order situation, reinvigorate the sluggish
economy, bring in more foreign investment, protect industry
against smuggling from India and ensure enough power for
factories.
</P>
<P>
What has embarrassed the government most was that the BNP often
organized strikes, rallies or demonstrations coinciding with
meetings of donor nations or visits by foreign dignitaries, which
served to convey the impression that the political situation in
the country is not stable.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has also been boycotting parliament since August 30,
urging the government to satisfy their 14-point demand including
withdrawal of "false" cases against opposition lawmakers as a
precondition for their return to parliament.
</P>
<P>
While the parties are moving slowly to a state of
confrontation, political watchers here are doubtful about an
effective opposition campaign at this stage.
</P>
<P>
For all their strongly worded speeches, BNP leaders have to
adopt the "go slow" policy since they need more time to bolster
the party and win more sympathy and wider support from the general
public, they said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a hurry," a BNP policy-maker said. "Let the
people suffer the mis-rule of the AL."
</P>
<P>
There are two major groups of political forces in Bangladesh.
The BNP leads the pro-Islamic and anti-Indian forces while the AL
represents secular and pro-liberation forces.
</P>
<P>
Under the banner of nationalist forces, the BNP,
Jamaat-e-Islami, a breakaway faction of Jatiya (national) Party,
and other right wing groups have joined forces to discredit the
Hasina administration in a bid to either force an early election
or expedite her downfall.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say some of the government's hasty decisions,
including fuel price hikes, and its policy towards India have
prompted opposition parties to get united a little earlier than
expected.
</P>
<P>
The August 24 general strike, called by the BNP-led seven-party
alliance to protest against the fuel price hikes, heralded the
beginning of a "simultaneous movement" by opposition groups, a
strategy used effectively against the previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
Hasina has also landed into another awkward situation as
General Ershad, who led the third Jatiya Party and gave crucial
support in forming the AL government last year, announced on
September 13 that it withdrew support for the government.
</P>
<P>
The move would not affect the strength of the AL in parliament,
but it would hurt the AL politically. JP's formal entry into the
opposition camp would virtually leave the AL alone to fight all
the major political groups within and outside parliament.

<P>
The signing, taking place today at a special ceremony held

</P>
<P>
"Canadian firms have an impressive record of success in China,
marked by a 35-percent increase in two-way trade over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
"The deals signed today reaffirm existing strengths and carve
out new areas of cooperation with China's future economic
development needs," Marchi said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Africa's High GDP Shows potentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Africa's gross domestic product
(GDP) and manufacturing value added (MVA), shows the continent
has great potential, says the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement reaching here today, UNIDO said that though
industrial growth in Africa was higher than those of Western
Europe, Japan and North America in the last two years, the
continent still trailed behind the east Asian countries, which
had double digit growth rates coming close to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to UNIDO, MVA in sub-Saharan Africa rose from a negative
growth in 1994 to almost two percent in 1995 and about four percent
last year, while that in north African countries showed the same
trend, climbing up from 2.4 percent in 1994 to bout five percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO also said that GDP in sub-Saharan Africa accelerated from 2.4
percent between 1970 and 1995 to about four percent in 1995 and 1996,
while north African economies performed even better with a robust
growth of almost six percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the UN body said while Africa had the lowest savings rate,
its spending on private and public consumption was among the highest
in the developing world, accounting for more than 75 percent and 14
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
It further said manufacturing in Africa contributed a modest 11
percent of GDP in 1970, and instead of increasing its share, it slid to
less than 10 percent in 1995, "thereby growing lower than the
continent's economies during the period".
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the rate of investment and per capita
incomes in Africa had steadily declined, with investment growth
falling sharply to below zero in the 1980s and 1990s, and the rate of
investment spending nose-dived from a record 27 percent in the
mid-1970s to 15 percent two decades later.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-Saharan Africa is still very much dominated by
labor-intensive, resource-based and low technology industries," UNIDO
said, adding that many African countries faced widespread poverty and
bore a heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
"They remain highly dependent on agriculture as their main source
of foreign exchange and they have the smallest manufacturing base
among the developing nations," it said.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO urged African countries to strive at accelerating and
sustaining their economic growth rate at a higher pace than population
growth which averaged 2.5 percent and three percent annually in 1980
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
This could only be achieved through accelerating industrialization
and higher investment in the region, it added.

<HEADLINE> EU-Asia Electronic Forum to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats, civil servants,
business executives, scholars, journalists, students and web users
are expected to join an electronic forum on European Union-Asia
relations in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The cyberforum will be launched on December 1 by the
Brussels-based European Institute for Asian Studies (EIAS) with an
aim at strengthening EU-Asian ties, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer and European
Parliament President Jose Maria Gil Robles took part in today's
pre-launch conference.
</P>
<P>
The interactive forum, with a web-site at
www.net7.net/eias/cyberforum, will offer not only debates on
EU-Asia relations but also EU-Asia-related news and background
information.
</P>
<P>
The cyberforum was designed by the EIAS with the support of the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, to
take the advantage of the Internet to meet the challenges facing
EU member states in their relations with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cyberforum participants are expected to compare notes on such
issues as the meeting between EU and Asian leaders and two-way
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
EIAS Chairman Willy de Clercq said at the pre-launch conference
that the cyberforum will add a tangible mobilization of public
opinion to the positive symbols created by high-level meetings
such as the Asia-Europe Summit Meeting.
</P>
<P>
English will be used as the common language in the discussion
which is also expected to be translated into several other
languages to help disseminate information.
</P>
<P>
The EIAS is a non-profit association founded in July 1989 and
aims at highlighting the importance of Asia in the future external
relations of the European Community and at developing a center of
expertise on contemporary Asian affairs and on relations between
the European Community and its partners in Asia, through
briefings, seminars, research publications and exchange of views
on political, economic and social issues.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Proposes More Land Handover Within Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today proposed handing over more West Bank
land to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) within five
months on conditions the PNA fights terrorism and agrees to
accelerate final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Israeli Editors' Association held in Tel Aviv,
Netanyahu refused to reveal the specific scope of land he is
willing to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
He said only that he hopes to discuss additional redeployments
within the framework of final-status talks, proposing blending all
three stages of redeployments into one operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu strongly attacked the PNA for failing to
honor the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement by failing to
fight terrorism, confiscate illegal weapons and revise the
Palestinian Covenant that called for destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Netanyahu publicly talked about
his proposal on further redeployments in the West Bank, despite
that hectic consultations have been held within the ruling
coalition in the past days on the second pullback.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was trying to gain the majority approval by his
rightist Cabinet to accept his proposal on pulling out from
another 6-8 percent of the West Bank in the second stage of the
three-phase redeployments as stipulated in the Hebron agreement
signed in January.
</P>
<P>
The PNA today accused Netanyahu of floating test balloons
instead of giving official offer to it on further redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Senior PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat said the PNA will not
respond before it receives any formal offer from the Israeli
government on the redeployments.
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that we haven't received any offer, proposal,
or idea and suggestion officially, written or orally, through
phone call or fax, from Netanyahu," Erekat told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat made it clear that the PNA will insist on Israel's
implementation of the signed agreements on the issue of
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
"We advise Netanyahu if he wants the peace process to go back
on track, he has to understand that we have agreements signed and
the implementation of further redeployments must be according to
the timetable provided for in the interim agreements that were
signed by Israeli government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement, Israel should have completed the
first two stages of three-phase redeployments from rural areas of
the West Bank by September this year. But the two redeployments
have been delayed because of the dispute over the scope and a wave
of terrorist attacks launched by Islamic militants in July and
September.
</P>
<P>
Just like what it did in early March, the PNA was believed to
reject again the Israel-unilaterally-set scope of second
redeployment. When Israel offered in March to pull back from 9
percent of the West Bank in the first stage, the PNA refused to

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon's Trade and Industry
Minister Justin Ndioro said here today that national trade fair
has given government an opportunity to evaluate the country's
social economic development each year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Participants at the national trade fair came from eight
foreign countries, the United States, France, Germany, China,
Syria, Iran, Australia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Declaring government's support to the Cameroon's Chambers of

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Against Debate on Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman said here today that he is against the public debate on
whether Israel should withdraw its military forces from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The debate could be held within the Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF) and the defense committee of the parliament and the
public debate on this issue could only cause damage to the
IDF and the interests of Israel," Weizman told Israeli Radio.
</P>
<P>
Public debate on IDF withdrawal from south Lebanon is gaining
more momentum over the past few days in Israel as military
conflicts intensified in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's state TV Channel One Wednesday night revealed that an
increasing number of IDF commanders are also against the current
IDF policy in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of peace activists held a demonstration here today,
urging the IDF to pull out from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At least nine Lebanese civilians, including women and
children, were killed Sunday when their homes in the southern part
of the security zone in south Lebanon were hit by Katyusha rockets
reportedly fired by Lebanese resistance forces of Amal Movement
and Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Israeli Air Force (IAF) jet fighters struck
twice at Amal and Hezbollah positions north of the security zone
in response to their bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Today, one IDF soldier was wounded in the security zone and the
IAF planes blasted again the targets of Hezbollah and Amal in
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, about 40 IDF officers and soldiers
lost their lives in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern towns from across the
border attacks by Lebanese resistance forces.

BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has called on Europe to play a bigger role in reviving the
stalled Middle East peace process, the official Lebanese National
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
His appeal came Wednesday at a meeting with a visiting
delegation from the International Catholic Union of the Press and
the content of his remarks was released by the agency today.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the United States' and European countries'
relations with Israel are stronger and better than those with Arab
countries. This makes the Arab world feel unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Europe keeps a balanced relationship
with Israel and the Arab world, adding that Europe, with its
strong economic relations with Israel, should play a greater role
in helping reopen the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri described Europe's good relations with Israel as an
important card, but said it was not used.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying Lebanon's 1,200 square kilometers'
territory, or 15 percent of the country's total, in the south
since 1985.

JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annualized
growth in broad-based money supply increased in October to 17.1
percent from a revised 16.3 percent in September, Central Bank
preliminary figures released today showed.
</P>
<P>
The growth is far beyond the South African Reserve Bank's guideline
of not more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the increase in money supply, South Africa's inflation
dropped to 7.5 percent in October from September's eight percent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's economic growth slowed down sharply in the third
quarter. The GDP growth rate nose-dived to only 0.3 percent from 2.4
percent in the second quarter, South African Central Statistics
Service said Tuesday.

Figures showed that the economy expanded 1.8 percent in the first
nine months of the year. Economists predicted that the annual GDP

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Stresses Israel's Commitment to Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy stressed here today that Israel would abide by its
commitment to further redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israeli Channel 1 Television, Levy
expressed his confidence that the Israeli government, which is
discussing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal on the
second troop withdrawal, will perform its obligation to the
signed agreements with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Levy noted that although the cabinet Tuesday discussed
Netanyahu's plan, there was not a precise specification of the
percentage of the West Bank to be handed over to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu proposed Sunday that Israel implement the second
pullback on condition that the PNA consents to accelerated final
status talks and suspension of the third redeployment stipulated
in the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
Levy also said that he expected to meet PNA deputy Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen) without any precondition in a bid to push
forward the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At the latest round of peace talks last week, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators were deadlocked over several
security-linked issues, such as the projected Gaza Strip airport
and seaport, and a safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
On another development, Levy today met with his visiting
Norwegian counterpart Knut Vollebaek in Jerusalem and briefed him
on the Netanyahu's proposal over second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek cast doubt on Likud government's sincerity to live
up to the Oslo accords, stressing that "there is something that
parties have agreed on, and I think such thing is to be honored."

Freetown today.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting include the executive secretary of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the United Nations special
envoy to Sierra Leone, the commander of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force

<P>
Under the agreement, the ruling junta that overthrew President

<HEADLINE> Khartoum Confident in Egypt's Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Justice Minister
Abdul-Basit Sabdarat today reiterated his country's absolute
confidence that the Egyptian leadership is concerned with Sudan's
unity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency,
Sabdarat said the Egyptian-Sudanese relations are excellent and of
security importance to the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government does not object to the visit to Egypt
by John Garang, leader of Sudan's largest rebel group, as the
Sudanese people believe that Egypt is concerned with their
country's unity, he added.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the talks Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa held earlier this week with Garang, who advocates
establishing a confederation between the south and the north. The
Sudanese government has rejected this demand.
</P>
<P>
Garang's Sudanese People's Liberation Army has been fighting
with the Islamic government since 1983 to press for an increased
autonomy for the southern third of Sudan dominated by Africans,
Christians and Animists.
</P>
<P>
Sabdarat, who is taking part in a conference of Arab justice
ministers in Cairo, made the remarks when the once-tense relations
between the two Nile valley neighbors are easing.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have been strained since Sudanese President
Omar Al-Bashir came to power in 1989 and worsened in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of involving in an assassination attempt on
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The present thaw in relations followed assurances from Khartoum
that it will no longer provide support to Egyptian Islamic
militants trying to undermine the Egyptian government, reported
local English weekly Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese First Vice President Al Zubeir Mohammed Salih visited
here three weeks ago, soon after Khartoum decided to return
Egypt's property in Khartoum which Sudan had appropriated two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has already nominated an ambassador to Cairo and Egypt is
expected to nominate an ambassador to Khartoum within the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that in the next few weeks a senior
Egyptian official, possibly Moussa, will pay a visit to Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat has emphasized that Cairo is keen to
pursue its rapprochement with Khartoum, whom Egypt it has accused
of harboring militants to overthrow the current Egyptian secular
government.

<HEADLINE> German Students Demonstrate to Protest Poorer Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- About 40,000 German university
students took to the street today in Bonn to protest against the
country's declining education spending and the deteriorating
conditions of their universities.
</P>
<P>
The mass protest in Bonn is a continuation of smaller
demonstrations held in several German cities over the past few
weeks and the biggest one seen in the German capital for some 20
years.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, students of about 50 of
Germany's 300 colleges and universities boycotted lectures and
participated in the protest.
</P>
<P>
What triggered the demonstrations was a combination of
education spending cuts, crowded classes, poor university
facilities, as well as a government plan to impose tuition fees on
students.
</P>
<P>
Almost all political parties have rushed to express sympathy
for the protesting students, with the government and the
opposition parties accusing each other of being responsible for
the country's education status quo.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government Wednesday announced provision of 40 million
marks (23 million U.S. dollars) in emergency funds to modernize
universities' libraries. The main opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) also announced today that it would push through a
university action program in parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are speaking of a profound crisis in Germany's
education system as the country struggles to streamline its social
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities in Germany currently offer free
tuition to all students and there are few restrictions on the
length of study.
</P>
<P>
These have fueled enormous growth in the number of students and
a deterioration in university conditions such as crowded classes
and shortages of teachers.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the situation and rein in education costs,
the government has proposed a reform package which includes a plan
to make students pay for their education. The proposal, however,
has met strong protest from students.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators said today that the government should spare money
in areas such as the costly Eurofighter warplane project and boost
education spending which is vital for the country's future.

<HEADLINE> African Fishermen Urged to Respect Code of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen in Africa are
called upon to respect strictly the established norms of the
sector to guarantee sustainable management and development of
fish products, Cameroon Tribune
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in Cameroon's economic capital Douala
recently by Cameroonian senior officials at the Ministry of
Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industry at a just ended seminar
on artisanal fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 20 central and west African countries
attended the 11th meeting of the liasion officers of the
Integrated Program for the Development of Artisanal Fisherires
(IDAF) in west Africa alongside with a workshop on the social
economic aspects of artizanal fisheries in west Africa held in
Douala.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the seminar, Cameroonian Minister of Livestock,
Fisheries and Animal Industry Hamadjoda Adjoudji, explained that
artisanal fisheries contributes immensely to food
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Artisanal fisheries, according to the minister, generates
employement to over 200,000 rural youths and adults with an
annual production figure of 110,000 tons of fish, 90 percent of
the country's total fish production.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, participants were treated to lectures on
code of conduct for artisanal fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed on the fact that only the practice of
friendly environmental fishing will ensure a sustainable
development and management of artisanal fisheries.
</P>
<P>
This will in turn have social and economic benefits to the
fishing communities in terms of employment, proteins and earning.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Makes Last-Ditch Efforts for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz today reaffirmed his country's desire for full European
Union (EU) membership before the scheduled mid-December EU summit,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remark while holding talks in Turkey's largest
city Istanbul with his Luxembourg counterpart Jean-Claude Juncker
on Ankara's involvement in the EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Juncker, whose country holds EU's term presidency,
is believed to be the last chance for Turkey to be chosen as a
candidate for EU membership before the EU summit in Luxembourg,
during which leaders of the 15 EU member countries will work out
important policies to further expand the bloc.
</P>
<P>
"We expressed in a very concrete way our minimum expectations
from this summit," Yilmaz told reporters following a three-hour
meeting with Juncker.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey hopes that a helpful and concrete formula
can be reached in the summit.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report issued by the European Commission, the EU
executive body, outraged Ankara because it excluded Turkey from
the ranks of the prospective candidates for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The EU is reluctant to promise Turkey a candidacy because of
its poor human rights record, weak economy as well as its
territorial disputes with Greece, which is an EU member.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, made it clear that Turkey will not yield to
any unreasonable demands even if it has longed for full EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Juncker reiterated that the EU considers Turkey a
European country.
</P>
<P>
The EU will continue to have close contacts with Turkey until
the summit meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos, who accompanied
Juncker on the one-day visit, said that Turkey should be treated
like other applicants but it has to solve its problems first.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been making efforts for full EU membership for
years, but so far no substantial results have been
achieved.

</P>
<P>
Barreto said that some institutions have spread booklet
saying that the shell fish have been contaminated with cholera
virus, but the fact is that the government is persuading

He said that the institutions which disseminate the news,
which is misleading, should coordinate their behavior with the
government, so to help fight cholera.

Institutions like the Ernest &AMP; Young Consultation Company and
Impar Insurance Company have warned people against eating shell
fish from the Maputo Bay, saying that the bay has been
infected with cholera virus.

The latest information from the Central Maputo Hospital tells
that 145 people have died of cholera in the hospital.

<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- About 400 corpses were
found in central Angola's Huambo Province by the government
forces.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found in Oruziro, 19 km from Huambo
Province's capital city of Huambo City, when the government
forces were clearing landmines there.
</P>
<P>
Joao Jossane, an official with the government forces said
that he suspected that these people had been killed by the
former rebel National Union for the Toatal
Independence of Angola (UNITA) before they were driven out of
the city in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said more bodies could be found in the city, adding that
the UN observation group in Angola has decided to establish a
committee to investigate into the matter.
</P>
<P>
About 600 bodies were reportedly found in a pond at the
former military academy campus three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Residents at the city have reported to the police that
UNITA had established quite a few concentration camps during
the two years when it controlled the city.
</P>
<P>
Huambo is the second biggest city in the country, a
city of strategic importance which had been a hot spot ever
since 1992 when civil war broke out in the country.
</P>
<P>
UNITA took control of the city after 50 days of war with
the government forces and ruled over it for two years until
November 1994.

MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that Anatoly Chubais would remain in his post as the
first deputy prime minister, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark after a meeting at the Kremlin with
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaker of the Federal Council
(the upper house) Yegor Stroyev and speaker of the State Duma (the
lower house) Gennady Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yeltsin rejected a proposal by Seleznyov to
form a coalition cabinet. He said that even if there were
complaints to some ministers, or even if some ministers were
dismissed, it did not mean the government would step down.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he hoped the 1998 draft budget, revised by a
commission formed by the government and the parliament, would be
approved in December.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said the State Duma would approve the draft budget soon
and the Federation Council would take it up in January.
</P>
<P>
He said all the four senior leaders agreed that further delay
in approval of the budget would have a very negative impact on the

ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government

<HEADLINE> Cameroun, Chad to Revise Convention on Freight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Transporters from Cameroun
and Chad have called on their respective governments to revise
the convention on inland transit freight transport signed in
1975, Radio Cameroon reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on November 26 in Ngaoundere, capital of
Adamaoua Province of Cameroon, at a meeting grouping Camerounians
and Chadians involved in freight transport from the sea port city
Douala through Ngaoundere to neighboring Chad.
</P>
<P>
The meeting chaired by the Adamaoua governor was initiated by
Camerounian inland freight transporters who complained that their
Chadian counterparts were not respecting the clauses of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
According to the convention, Camerounians are to handle 35
percent of the goods and transit it from Douala to Chad while 65
percent is in the hands of Chadians.
</P>
<P>
But today the situation has changed to the detriment of
Camerounians who only handle 10 percent of the freight transport
from Douala through Ngaounderians who enjoyed certain advantages
sometimes illegally in Cameroun while the Camerounians do not
have the same opportunities in Chad.
</P>
<P>
The Chadians, on their part, through the president of the
National Bureau of Freight Transportation of Chad and the
representative of Chadian Minister of Transportation, said the
problems have surfaced in the sector today because the convention
signed by the two countries 22 years ago was already outdated.
</P>
<P>
After heated and intense discussions coordinated by the
Adamaoua Governor, the two parties agreed that the convention has
to be revised by their respective governments for their mutual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Adamaouna governor announced that a
technical commission will be set up to meet and examine the
complexity in the sector. Meanwhile, a draft project will be
prepared to be submitted to higher authorities for study.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the proposals in the project shall be examined at
the Chad-Cameroun mixed commission to solve the problems of the
sector.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- As the representatives across the world gather in Japan to
discuss how best to counter the threat of global warming, the
American people are far more willing than their government to take
early and unilateral steps, a New York Times poll finds.
</P>
<P>
They appear to be unimpressed by arguments that cutting the
United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases into the
atmosphere might cause undue economic harm, as industrial groups
opposing a treaty have contended.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to carry
out a single Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank within five
months, if the Palestinians take adequate steps to fight
terrorism and start talks immediately on a final peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The offer seemed to strike a balance between growing pressure
from the United States to move peace efforts forward and from
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition partners not to cede more land
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Congress's refusal to pay the almost 1 billion U.S. dollars
the United States owes the United Nations has dashed the Clinton
Administration's hopes of reducing the U.S. share of the U.N.
budget next year and has forced administration officials to look
instead to 1999 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A U.N. AIDS report says more than 30 million people around
the world, or one in every 100 sexually active people under age
49, are infected with HIV. Only 10 percent know it.
</P>
<P>
-- OPEC ministers have agreed that the group's official
production ceiling should be raised though they remain divided
over how much. The move comes even as a host of bearish
fundamentals have contributed to sharp drops in oil prices this
week.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Situation Stabilized in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 28 (Xinhua) --The cholera epidemic which
broke out in Mozambique about three months ago, has been
stabilized with great efforts made on the part of the government.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic was first reported at the Maputo Central Hospital
on August 13, and expanded ten days later to Matola, a suburb 10
km away from the capital, and Boane, 30 km from Maputo and to the
neighboring Gaza province at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
In the past half month, Maputo had witnessed hot weather with
much rain. Dumped garbages which had not been disposed timely
made the spreading of the disease possible.
</P>
<P>
Maputo Central Hospital, the sole hospital which receives
cholera patients had rounded up 4,063 people up to November 26,
with 144 deaths. 296 people in Maputo province were affected by
the disease, with 30 deaths.
</P>
<P>
To fight the epidemic, a anti-cholera emergency coordination
committee was set up, which was headed by the country's prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the defense department, the department of internal
affairs and the department of calamity prevention are all
mobilized to clean the city of garbage and waste water, eliminate
breeding places for flies and other viruses.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pressure from the Maputo Central Hospital, a
mobile treatment station was put up in the suburban area, which
consists of six tents. In addition, three other such stations
will soon be established.
</P>
<P>
To cure the disease, the government also purchased 30 tons of
lactato de ringer from South Africa, besides the 100 tons of
donation of the medicine from Belgium, Spain and Portugal for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to Alvertino Barreto, spokesman for the National
Commission to Combat Cholera, the medicine was so far sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Health Department has dispatched people to the
suburban areas to examine residents' wells and water storing
containers, distribute medicines and help disinfection.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the hospital received a patient, it sent someone to
go to the patient's home to spray disinfectant to prevent further
infection.
</P>
<P>
The government also required residents to change their
tradition by not opening up the plastic bags wrapping the dead
before it was buried, for the cholera virus attached to the body
was highly infectious.
</P>
<P>
After all the precautionary measures, the number of cholera
out-patients going to the Maputo Central Hospital daily has
reduced from 190 on November 23 to 108 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Barreto pointed out, it was still early to say the
epidemic had been weakened.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has about 200,000 cholera virus carriers. Experts
estimated that it takes at least four months to take the epidemic
completely under control.

hands to maintain the momentum of Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) and the region's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Bolger's remarks came during the closing ceremony of a seminar
marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
ties between New Zealand and China.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated efforts by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and NZ Auckland University to co-sponsor the seminar. Both
China and New Zealand have seen increasing ties develop at the
government level in business and investment, and a multitude of
people-to-people links, Bolger said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the cooperation between the two countries in
educational and academic areas, and said that New Zealand has
allocated places in secondary and tertiary institutions
specifically for Chinese students for the 1998 academic year.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, the first country to both commence and conclude
bilateral negotiations with China over its entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), he said, adding that New Zealand "will
continue to actively support China's WTO accession negotiations
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's membership will promote the continued growth and
modernization of China as one of the leading global economies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral economic and trade cooperation, he said
that statistics show New Zealand is one of China's largest
overseas investment destinations.
</P>
<P>
There are 334 New Zealand projects in China ranging across
such areas as brewing, cement, iron and steel, dairy products and
real estate, he added.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will be chairing APEC in 1999 and China in 2001, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I also have no doubt that China's re-emergence as a global
political and economic leader will play an increasingly
significant role in New Zealand's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueyong, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and vice-minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, was among those attending the closing ceremony.

NANNING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese troops in south
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, by order of the State Council
and the Central Military Commission, today launched a new
minesweeping drive along the Sino-Vietnamese border.
</P>
<P>
This large minesweeping effort, the second of its kind since

plans within three years to clear more than 120 mine zones with an
overall area of nearly 20 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Military Area Command has formed five special
minesweeping teams for this action, which covers a dozen Chinese
border cities including Fangchenggang, Ningming, Pingxiang,
Longzhou and Jingxi.
</P>
<P>
In the last minesweeping drive in 1993, the border defense
troops in Guangxi removed more than 600,000 land mines and
recovered 18,000 hectares of farmland. The action also helped
restore more than 60 paths, 25 outlets and nine ports of entry for
border trade between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today underscored the importance of regional defense
cooperation and integration in resolving conflicts that have
plagued and ravaged the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told 38 graduating military students from various
southern African countries at the Zimbabwe Staff College in
Harare that African countries should be prepared to make
sacrifices and contribute to efforts of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU) towards the prevention, management and
resolution of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The condition of peace is absolutely essential for the
socio-economic development of our continent," said Mugabe, who is
also current chairman of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The high level and intense one-year long course is the 31st to
be run at the college, which is aimed at improving professional
knowledge and understanding of the participants in order to
prepare them for senior posts in the command.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also commented on the increase of women participation
in traditional male domains like the army, saying the development
was welcome as it was in line with the publicly acclaimed policy
of gender equality that seeks to reinforce the virtues and ideals
of women.
</P>
<P>
The president also encouraged other institutions of similar
nature to include the enrollment of students from neighbouring
countries as it would enhance mutual trust and cooperation within
the region.
</P>
<P>
The graduates were from the defense forces of Botswana,
Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will continue to
support the Middle East peace process and the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state, a senior Zimbabwe government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy foreign affairs minister Nicholas Goche told guests at
the commemoration of the international day of solidarity with the
Palestinian people that Zimbabwe would continue to urge Israel
and the State of Palestine to implement the peace process to
ensure stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties should honour United Nations Security
Council decisions and the 1993 Oslo Accords which recommended the
exchange of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Goche took a swipe at the Israeli government for dragging its
feet in the implementation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The reluctance by one of the parties to implement these
agreements has led to the present stalemate and threats to take
unilateral steps will continue to undermine the peace process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian ambassador to Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh said the
Israeli government had shown decreasing interest in ending the
conflict with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"This government is against a peaceful settlement and efforts
to solve the problems in our region," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP to Grow 5.5 Percent in 1997: Report Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is projected to grow by 5.5 percent in 1997 in real
terms, according to a government economic report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The Third Quarter Economic Report of 1997 on the economic
situation, updates the forecast of GDP and prices for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Government Economist Tang
Kwong-yiu said the forecast consumer price inflation is lowered
from 6.5 to 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy had a robust growth of 6.3 percent in real
terms in the first half of this year. Growth in the third quarter
slowed down and was estimated at around five percent in real
terms, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Economic performance in the third quarter was largely affected
by the further slackening in exports of services and continued
moderate growth in exports of goods, apart from weak inbound
tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the regional currency turmoil had spread to the
local financial markets and economic growth seems likely to slow
down further in the fourth quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Growth of exports of goods in the year was restrained by the
moderate import demand in some of Hong Kong's major markets and
the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But exports of goods are expected to attain a solid growth in
the fourth quarter, with exports to China's inland areas expected to
"stay on a firm growth track", according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Inbound tourism weakened considerably in the second quarter and
more so in the third. Operators in Hong Kong's tourism industry
are putting up strong promotion efforts to boost the business.
</P>
<P>
In view of the robust local consumer spending in the second and
third quarters, the forecast of annual growth in private
consumption expenditure is revised upwards.
</P>
<P>
Investment spending is forecast to sustain another year of
double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
The labor market continued to tighten in recent quarters, with
total employment rising faster than labor supply. In the third
quarter, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged down
further to 2.2 percent, from 2.4 percent in the second quarter,
according to the report.

</P>
<P>
Many of them expressed their willingness to represent the Hong
Kong people to participate in the management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
They said that the election is very important because this is
the first time for Hong Kong to elect its deputies to the NPC as
an independent constituency after its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Grace Lam, director of the House Living Property Company, was
the last to hand in the Registration Form.
</P>
<P>
Lam, who obtained nomination by more than 40 members of the
Election Conference, said she would work hard for the interests of
women and children if she was elected into the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong United Youth Association,
said that he was very happy to make contribution to the country,
and as a representative for the young people, he would be fully
committed.
</P>
<P>
Tse Wing Kwon, an editor at a publication house, said he would
promote cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and China's inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
Lew Mon Hung, marketing director and chief consultant for Asia
Investment Management Limited, said he was excited to have an
opportunity to make his contribution to Hong Kong and the country.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member Presidium of the Election Conference with Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa as the executive chairman will officially
announce the list of the nominees on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Since the number of nominees already exceeds the number to be
elected by more than one-half, a preliminary election will be held
on December 6 to determine the 54 official candidates on the merit
of votes according to the Election Method.
</P>
<P>
The election date is scheduled for December 8.

<P>
NANJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Jiangsu section of the
Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway passed state-level appraisal today,
receiving a mark of 96.12 because of its first-class facilities,
quality, service and economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
A state appraisal committee said contractors have done a
world-class job on the expressway, which was completed more than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The project has shown that China's ability in expressway design
and building, and management has reached a new stage, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
The expressway, linking Shanghai and Nanjing, capital of
Jiangsu Province, is 274 kilometers long. The Jiangsu section is
248.21 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
The section goes through Shanghai and five major cities in
Jiangsu, whose land area and population account for 0.4 percent
and 2.9 percent of the country's total, respectively. Yet the six
cities generate 9.2 percent of the country's total gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The project was started on June 14, 1992, with a budget of 7.04
billion yuan. It was completed on Sept 15, 1996, 27 months ahead

<HEADLINE> EU-Russian Cooperation Accord to Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Partnership and
Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the European Union (EU) and
Russia will take effect on December 1, the European Commission
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by the two sides in June 1994,
covers practically every aspect of cooperation between the two
parties, including trade, science and technology and education.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, believed that
the PCA would stimulate the participation of Russia in a wider
Europe and create a closer relationship between the two sides by
ensuring a more stable climate for traders and investors.
</P>
<P>
"The PCA is a positive affirmation of the evolving relationship
between the EU and Russia. It reflects the growing importance we
attach to improving and deepening all aspects of our partnership
with Russia," said Hans van den Broek, the EU Commissioner for
Relations with Central and Eastern European Countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the purposes of the accord is to set up regular
bilateral political dialogue through the establishment of a common
set of institutions at the level of heads of government, ministers
and parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said it is important for the EU and Russia to
create a better investment climate in Russia and cooperate in
crime fighting.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Russia will grant its Most Favored Nation
(MFN) treatment to EU companies in Russia, which is expected to
help loosen quantitative restrictions on imports from the EU and
ensure easier access to Russia's services market.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the EU considered Russia's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) as a vital objective that would
foster the reform process and provide mutual market access.
</P>
<P>
It said that it was providing technical assistance for Russia
in order to facilitate the country's accession to WTO.
</P>
<P>
The EU considers Russia one of its important trading
partners. In 1996, 40 percent of all Russian exports, worth 22
billion ECUs (about 26 billion U.S. dollars), went to the EU ,
while 38 percent of EU exports, worth 19 billion ECUs (23 billion
dollars), went to Russia, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's TACIS program would increasingly underpin the
implementation of the commitments made under the PCA, the
commission said in a press release issued today.
</P>
<P>
The TACIS has sponsored an expert mission on crime and crime
prevention, and also trained more than 250 Russian managers in EU
companies.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 million ECUs (about 1,200 million dollars) has
been made available for Russia under the TACIS program since 1991.
</P>
<P>
An interim agreement concerning trade-related provisions has
been put into force since February 1996. The PCA will be annually
renewable after 10 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A summit of west African
leaders in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
is to be held in the Togolese capital, Lome between December 14
and 15, diplomatic sources told Xinhua on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are anxious over the situation in Sierra Leone and this
will feature prominently at the summit. We will also adopt the
Conakry peace plan as the working document for returning the
country to civilian rule," one source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile talks by United Nations and ECOWAS officials to
bring peace to Sierra Leone ended Thursday in "stalemate" as
three key issues remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The talks which were held at Grafton, 13 miles east of the
capital failed to reach agreement on the release of rebel leader
Corporal Foday Sankoh, who is currently detained in Nigeria, the
dominance of Nigerian soldiers in ECOMOG and disarmament of
combatants including the Sierra Leone army.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOWAS director of information, Dr Andrienne
Diop, "these fundamental issues will be addressed at a higher
level", a statement which diplomatic observers say means the
coming Togo summit.
</P>
<P>
She told newsmen at the end of the talks, "disarmament has
been put on hold as we have set up a special committee to
implement it by stages." Observers said this will put back the
date slated for disarmament which was originally scheduled to
start from December 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Diop, "the Conakry peace plan is still valid
and should be looked on as a framework for the implementation and
return of peace in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Both the U.N. special envoy to Sierra Leone, Francis Okello
and the ECOWAS executive secretary, Lansana Kuyateh met junta
leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma for the first time since the May
25 coup and had private audience with him.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that Russia will not see a cardinal change in its
current economic situation during the remaining months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In his regular radio address, Yeltsin affirmed the government's
aim of increased production, stablized inflation, growing reserves
of gold and currency, impressive grain harvest and timely
delivered pensions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it remains a serious problem to clear arrears
of pay before the end of this year due to insufficient state
treasury.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Yeltsin said that foreign investments expected to
revive the Russian industry "did not lead to significant changes."
</P>
<P>
The steady development of Russia's industry might be guaranteed
"only at the expense of domestic resources," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the impact of the recent financial crisis started
from Southeast Asian nations, Yeltsin said as major foreign
investors are scared, "a new influx of foreign capital is not
foreseeable soon" for Russia.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the government changes, he did not rule out the
possibility that certain personnel decisions would have to be
made.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, it is bad when governmental members change
frequently but it is even worse when bad ministers keep their
positions.

BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's prestigious Beijing
University has spent 550,000 yuan (about 68,700 U.S. dollars) to
renovate its symbol, the front gate, to celebrate the 100th
anniversary of school's founding next year.
</P>
<P>
The gate, built in 1926, is one of the few university gates in
the classic style with red-lacquered doors, gold-lettered
signboard and stone-carved lions.
</P>
<P>
This is the gate's third renovation. The first was during the
Cultural Revolution and the second in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to make the renovated gate identical with the
old one both in style and color," said a university official in
charge of the project which was finished today.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this effect, all the paintings on the gate were
copied down before priming paint was applied," he said, adding
that the paintings were restored in the last process.
</P>
<P>
German-based Daimler Benz Corp donated 1 million yuan to the
university for its 100th anniversary celebrations. The money has
been spent on renovation of the gate and the university's old
library.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a senior leader of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), today urged all Party members,
especially leading officials, to unify their thinking with the
gist of the 15th CPC National Congress convened in Beijing in
September.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee and member of the Central Committee's
Secretariat, made these remarks here at the Party School of the
CPC Central Committee. He is the school's president.
</P>
<P>
At the commencement of a training class for senior officials at
the provincial and ministerial level, Hu told graduates that the
major theme of the 15th national Party congress is holding high
the great banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"To understand the essence of the congress, we must have a
profound understanding of the historical status and guiding
significance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and of our country's basic
situation of being in the primary stage of socialism," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is equally important to understand the Party's basic line
and major policies for promoting China's modernization in the
primary stage of socialism, and to realize the Party's major
responsibilities at the turn of the century, he added.
</P>
<P>
"While studying the documents of the 15th Party congress,
leading officials should play a leading role in carrying forward
the Marxist style of learning of combining theories with reality,
and making painstaking efforts to help the general masses to fully
understand the essence of the congress," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He asked all Party members and officials to seize the current
rare historical opportunity and work conscientiously to promote
the country's reform, opening-up and modernization drive.

<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy,
battered by the current region-wide financial crisis, slowed down
significantly in the first three quarters of this year, the
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Gross national product (GNP), adjusted for inflation, expanded
by 6 percent during the period, compared with the 7.3-percent
growth recorded for the same period of last year, according to a

</P>
<P>
But Socio-economic Planning Secretary Celieto Abito told
reporters that the GNP growth rate corresponded to the upper end
of the government's revised projection of 5.5 to 6 percent and was
higher than the forecast by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
Domestic output, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP),
grew by 5.2 percent in real terms during the period, slightly
lower than the 5.8-percent registered a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally expected the GNP to grow by 7 to
8 percent for 1997, but later scaled down the target due to the
currency crisis which began to hit Southeast Asia in July.
</P>
<P>
The GNP growth had already slowed down over the first two
quarters of this year to 5.9 percent, from 7.1 percent in the same
period of last year, due to weaker manufacturing output and
tighter credit conditions.
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter alone, the overall GNP growth expanded by
5.7 percent in real terms while the GDP increased by 4.9 percent,
both falling sharply from the year-ago levels of 6.9 percent and
6.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the major sectors, industry posted the highest growth of
5.8 percent, followed closely by services at 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the two sectors' growth rates were considerably lower than
the year-ago levels due to the currency crisis. In the third
quarter last year, the services sector grew 6.7 percent while the
industry sector expanded 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to the El Nino abnormal weather phenomenon, the agriculture
sector, contributing about 20 percent of the GNP, grew by only 1.1
percent during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the first three quarters performance of the
economy," Abito said, "We are confident that we will be able to
attain our revised GNP target for 1997 of 5.5 to 6 percent."
</P>
<P>
To ensure macroeconomic stability, Abito said the country needs
to continue implementing a six-point agenda the government
formulated earlier with the private sector to cope with the
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The agenda includes, among others, reducing the current account
deficit, maintaining fiscal and financial stability, keeping
prices stable and sustaining the momentum for reforms.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ministers to Discuss Second-Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A ministerial team headed
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to be appointed Sunday to
discuss the second phase of troop pullbacks in the West Bank,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai as saying
that the team will be set up at the weekly Cabinet meeting on
Sunday, and it will discuss all the options available on the
troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai added that while Israel can not disregard the second
stage of redeployments, efforts must be made to reach the
final-status talks. He was referring to Netanyahu's proposal for
holding the permanent talks immediately with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon today visited the
areas under the Area B near the West Bank city Hebron to inspect
the security aspects regarding the pending troop redeployment.
Area B is under the Palestinian civil administration, but under
Israel's sole security control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi said today he opposes
the second phase of redeployment which concerns about 10 percent
of West Bank before the PNA fulfills its commitments.
</P>
<P>
For the past week, heated discussions and debates have been
conducted either within the government or by the public over
Netanyahu's proposal on carrying out the second stage of the
three-phase further redeployments in the West Bank as stipulated
in the Hebron agreement signed in January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been trying to gain the majority approval by
his Cabinet to accept his proposal on pulling out from another
6-8 percent of West Bank in the second stage redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement, Israel should have completed the
first two stages of three-phase redeployments from rural areas of
the West Bank by last September. But the two redeployments have
been delayed because of the dispute over the scope and a wave of
terrorist attacks launched by Islamic militants in last July and
September.
</P>
<P>
Just like what it did in early March, the PNA was expected to
reject again the unilaterally-set scope of second redeployment.
When Israel offered in March to pull back from 9 percent from the
West Bank in the first stage, the PNA refused to accept, insisting
that it should have been consulted before deciding on the scope.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo accords stipulate that Israel should withdraw troops
from all the West Bank except for the settlements and unspecified
military zones. The PNA interpreted this as it will gain back
about 90 percent of the West Bank after Israel completes all
pullbacks by mid-1998, but the Israeli government has indicated
that it will only cede about 40 percent of the land in the final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In order to conduct the final-status talks in an advantageous
position to settle the most difficult issues of final borders,
Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees, Netanyahu is trying to derail
the Oslo process by demanding the PNA agree to accept the troop
redeployments as part of the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli rightist activists, who supported Netanyahu during last
year's elections, have mobilized to block the pending redeployment
in the West Bank. A rightist demonstration will be held for the
first time outside Netanyahu's residence in western Jerusalem to
protest the planned second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But some believed that Netanyahu is not serious in carrying
out further pullbacks since he knows the PNA will reject such
small percentage of land concession.

<HEADLINE> Anti-looting Squad Set up By Military Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone Friday established an anti-looting squad for what a
decree said as protecting people against looting, commandeering
of vehicles and harassment and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The decree, which is the sixth to be issued by the junta since
it seized power on May 25, was published in the government owned
Sierra Leone weekly gazette.
</P>
<P>
Members of the squad will be made up of both military and
police officers appointed by the ruling junta, the decree said.
</P>
<P>
The decree which has been backdated to take effect as from May
28 said that suspects arrested by the squad will be tried by
civilian courts within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
It makes it an offence for "any person to engage in or
actively prepare to be engaged in looting or property or the
commandeering of vehicles, to intimidate or harass another person
to occupy the premises of another person."
</P>
<P>
"Any person found guilty of looting, commandeering of vehicles
or receives any looted property or commandeered vehicle shall be
sentenced to death by a firing squad", the decree said.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulates five years or a maximum of life
imprisonment for persons in possession of looted property or
commandeered vehicle while any person who harasses or intimidates
another person will be jailed for between two years and seven
years.
</P>
<P>
A 500,000 U.S. dollar fine or two years imprisonment or both
will be levied on any person who obstructs the work of the squad,
according to the decree.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the decree will be welcomed by the
population as many residents have lost their vehicles through
massive commandeering orchestrated by soldiers in the wake of the
May 25 coup. Many of these vehicles have still not been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of houses are also still being illegally occupied by
members of the rebel revolutionary united front in the
outskirts of the capital.

ALMA ATA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Modernization and new

independence and dignity albeit it carries a defensive defense
policy, Amangeldy Kazhibayey, Committee of National Defense
Industry Chairman in the Defense Ministry, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Kazakhstan Pravda, he said, the number of
Kazakh military enterprises has dropped from 100 before the
disintegration of the Soviet Union to 15 now. Kazakhstan would not
remain unconcerned about the abnormal shrink of its military power.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of its economy, he said, Kazakhstan will
put in money to restore some of the enterprises and will also
expand export of some conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Kazhibayey pointed out that a strong military force is one of
the most reliable guarantees for national security. With it,
Kazakhstan will not depend solely on foreign military aid in face
of possible military threat or be manipulated by others on
security issues, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Post Launches 100 Projects for Better Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Post launched here
 today a campaign called 100 Projects 1997/98 for better services
in line with its commitment to providing outstanding services.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to be recognized as an outstanding service
organization, a further step forward from being an excellent
service provider," said Robert Footman, Hong Kong's postmaster
general.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the introduction of a new corporate
identity to reflect its commitment to excellent, customer-friendly
 and value for money services, freezing and restructuring of local
 postage rates to put saving back to the community and development
 of a long-term information technology strategy to maintain the
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months this year, Hong Kong Post had
completed 56 out of the 100 projects while nine projects are
being carried out and the remaining 35 are expected to be
completed before the end of the financial year in March, according
 to Footman.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Post has also achieved its target for 1997 of 98
percent next-day delivery of local letters.
</P>
<P>
A first ever structured customer satisfaction survey showed
that some 94, 96 and 86 percent of customers in the general
public, business and philately areas were satisfied or extremely
satisfied with the postal services.
</P>
<P>
As a result of exceptional interests in Hong Kong stamps, Hong
Kong Post's financial results for 1997/98 obtained a surplus after
 a tax of 1.35 billion HK dollars (173 million U.S. dollars), or a
 return of 47.8 percent on average net fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
"These results enabled us to freeze postage rates for 12 months
to July 1998," said Footman.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Dollar Peg Is to Stay: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
financial official today reaffirmed his government's determination
 to maintain the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you our linked exchange rate system, which has
served us so well for the last 14 years, is here to stay," Rafael
Hui Si-yan, acting Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) told participants in the 19th Asia
Pacific Financial Markets Assembly here today.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote opening address, Hui told more than 600
financial officials and foreign exchange dealers from around the
region: "Maintaining the system is the long-term commitment of the
 SAR government because it is the right policy for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"Our firm commitment is not made for any political
consideration, but for economic necessity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The financial official denied that Hong Kong's competitiveness
was sacrificed in order to keep the fixed exchange rate regime in
place. He said that if let the peg go, Hong Kong could face rising
 inflation pressure, higher interest rates for a longer time, and
even worse, financial uncertainty and turbulence. These results,
according to the official, would actually weaken Hong Kong's
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Hui pointed out that what Hong Kong should do is to improve
productivity and tighten cost control. With sound and stable
economic fundamentals, Hong Kong will reinforce its position as a
leading financial center in the region through quick and efficient
 adjustment, concluded the official.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong official also explored reasons for the recent
currency turmoil that first hit South East Asia and now spread to
North East Asia. He listed three major factors -- increasing
volatility in world capital flows, overheating assets market in
Asian economies and rapidly changing competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
Hui suggested that Asian economies follow what he said "the
cure approach" by taking painful and necessary adjustment
measures. The current crisis could prove to be blessing in
disguise, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific Financial Markets Assembly is an annual event
of Association Cambiste Internationale, which monitors
professional standards in financial markets around the world. The
Asian financial turmoil came to dominate over the two-day
discussions at this year's assembly, hosted by the Hong Kong

MADRID, November 28 (Xinhua) -- This weekend's Spanish first
division soccer program will go ahead -- despite the strike by
referees -- the Spanish football federation (RFEF) confirmed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first division referees are going ahead with their strike
in protest against the abuse they have been receiving from players
and club officials.
</P>
<P>
"Only 20 or 22 referees feel this way out of a group of more
than 8,600," RFEF general secretary Gerado Gonzalez said. "We
still have plenty of time to look for a solution."
</P>
<P>
Drafting in lower division officials could mean referees as
young as 19 taking charge of matches.
</P>

from Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Asia Seen to Enjoy Potential for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Asia still has significant
potential for economic growth despite the recent currency turmoil,
a Singapore monetary official told 19th Asia Pacific Financial
Markets Assembly here today.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Lian Sim, director of the International Department of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in a panel discussion: "No
one should underestimate the potential of this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "Asian Currencies Outlook," she was optimistic that
solid economic fundamentals would win in the end. She took
Singapore as an example, where the GDP growth remains robust,
exports continue to boom and inflation is still low.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that big and fast inflow of capital
into Asia, competition from other emerging markets, sudden
reversal of investors' sentiment and contagion effects in an
increasingly globalized financial market all contributed to the
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another panelist, Anthony Yuen, head of Asia foreign exchange
of Bank of America, said: "Rebuilding confidence in financial
markets is a key element to the Asia recovery." He suggested that
Asian economies make endeavors to build open, transparent and
efficient markets.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of transparency and disclosure will leave room for rumor,
speculation and uncertainty, and thus increase the cost of doing
business," he said.
</P>
<P>
Frank Wong from Natwest Markets said in the discussion that
there is no diversified source of fund in Asia, where bank loans
dominate the money market. He proposed that transparent and
well-developed local currency bond markets be formed as a
dependable source of capital.
</P>
<P>
The 19th Asia Pacific Financial Market Assembly opened here
today with the participation of more than 600 financial officials
and foreign exchange dealers from more than 30 countries and
regions. The recent financial turmoil in Asia is the most topical
theme at the two-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Publicize Highway Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a month-long
campaign in December to publicize the nation's first Highway Law
which goes into effect on January 1, 1998, according to the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress, the nation's highest
legislative body, passed the law in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources noted that the ministry attaches great
importance to publicizing the law.
</P>
<P>
Minister Huang Zhendong said that adoption of law confirms the
legal status of the highway sector in the national economy and
social development, and indicates that the sector has entered a
new period of development under the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the law also provides a clear orientation for the
future development and reform of the country's highway sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the nation's highway system
handles 88.7 percent of passengers and 91 percent of cargo. Some
97 percent of towns and townships and 81 percent of villages have
access to highways.
</P>
<P>
The nation's highway system had stretched a total 1.18 million
km by the end of 1996, including 3,400 km of expressways. The
respective figures are expected to reach 1.25 million km and 8,000
km by 2000, and will rise even further to 1.35 million km and
40,000 km by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Macao Telephone Company Proposes Cut in IDD Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Telecommunications
Company (CTM) has proposed to cut its much-complained charges for
long-distance telephone calls by an average of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
John Lindfield, chief executive officer of the CTM, which
monopolizes Macao's telephone service, said in a business
promotion fair on Thursday that his company hopes the Macao Posts
and Telecommunications Department would approve the cost-cut
program soon so that it will be started from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
While suggesting a cut of an average 14 percent from the
current cost, the CTM will reduce the cost of calls to some
destinations by as much as 40 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CTM plans to set preferential prices for calls
 to the United States, Canada and Australia on Saturdays and
Sundays. The preferential prices will be at 2.99 patacas (about
0.38 U.S. dollars) per minute, compared with the current
preferential charges of 7 patacas per minute to North America and
5.5 patacas per minute to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The cost of mobile phone service will also be reduced,
Lindfield said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said his company plans to add another 7 patacas
(about 0.89 dollars) to the fares of local telephone service
following last year's increase of 10 patacas (about 1.27 dollars)
a month. Currently, the monthly fee for a family-use phone stands
at 70 patacas (about 8.86 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Macao now has about one phone for three residents. The number
of mobile phone users has also increased rapidly. But there has
been much complaint over the past few years about the cost of
long-distance calls being too high.

<P>
Leading loyalist Jackie Mahood was shot in the head by two

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Almost Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dived
to a new four-year low today before a burst of short-covering
helped the unit recover to close almost unchanged from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The currency settled at 68.03 U.S. cents, little changed from
68.06 late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was again selling against the Japanese yen that sent the
local unit down to its intra-day low of 67.55 U.S. cents, dropping
lower than yesterday's bottom of 67.93 and hitting its lowest
point since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The selling was inspired by rumors about Australian
dollar-linked dual currency samurai bonds maturing today but
short-covering ahead of the weekend gave the local currency a
break from going lower.
</P>
<P>
The local unit has ultimately lost about 1.5 U.S. cents in
trading over the week and analysts said the downside is not over
yet.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the currency's woes has been a softening gold price.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion in Sydney closed at 295.7 U.S. dollars per ounce,
from 296.3 U.S. dollars at the close yesterday.
</P>
<P>
National Institute of Economic and Industry Research executive
director Peter Brain said the Asian currency turmoil would
continue to impact adversely on the Australian economy for another
year.
</P>
<P>
"The full effect of what has happened there has not yet been
translated into commodity prices," Brain said.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting the Australian dollar to go into the low 60
U.S. cents in the next six months and maybe for a short period of
time in the high 50 U.S. cents."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 86.75 Japanese yen from 86.5 and
at 1.1981 Deutsche marks from 1.2011 yesterday.

<P>
MAPUTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Romanian charge d'affaires to
Mozambique Nicolae Valerius has said that his country is
interested in being involved in Pande gas and other energies
development project in Mozambique, "Noticias" reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the local paper, Nicolae said here Thursday that
the Mozambican government and Enrom Company from the United
States which signed an agreement on the project in 1995 had been
informed of Romania's intention.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Enrom has the exclusive development and
sale rights of Pande gas field whose reserves are estimated to
reach 2,500 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the American has not started developing so far and
the Mozambican side have repeatedly expressed its discontent over
the delays in the past few months and threatened to suspend the
company's exclusive rights and seek new partners for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nicolae said that Romania has technology and experience of
mining and energy development besides its good political
relations and close trade ties with Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"Now the problem is whether Enrom will accept our technicians
or not," the Romanian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique owes a debt of 88 million U.S. Dollars to Romania,
which has proposed that the debt be turned into investment in
Mozambique. But the two sides have not reached an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Hopes Dashed for Early Bank Rate Cut in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Money supply and credit
extension growth in South Africa accelerated unexpectedly in
October, dashing hopes for an early cut in the bank rate, the
Business Day newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
It also cast renewed doubt on the reliability of these
economic indicators as anchors of monetary policy, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank lowered its lending rate to commercial banks
by one percentage point from 17 percent to 16 percent on October
20.
</P>
<P>
Hopes were high for more rate cuts next year as financial
indicators used by the central bank for monetary policy were
moving in the right direction at that time.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank said on Thursday that growth of the broadly
defined M3 money supply increased to 17.09 percent in October
from a revised 16.3 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private credit extension growth accelerated from a
revised 14.25 percent in September to 14.41 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Economists expected that money supply growth to drop below 16
percent and credit extension to below 14 percent in October
because of slack consumer spending and a general slowdown in
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Economists were surprised as the Central Statistics Service
announced earlier this week that the real economy almost came to
a standstill in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The GDP grew only 0.3 percent in the three months, compared
with 2.4 percent in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Drift After U.S. Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
edged up at the close today, but stocks were mostly treading water
after U.S. equities did not trade overnight because of the
Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of a half session on Wall Street
tonight.
</P>
<P>
"We have had very little influence from overseas players
today," one dealer from a Melbourne-based brokerage said.
</P>
<P>
However there was some "bottom fishing" in gold and base
metal-related shares after the Australian dollar hit a new low
which was perceived as good for companies exporting commodities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries closed up 2.8 points at 2,465.1.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index was up 0.7 points to 4,230.4 and the
All Resources Index 4.9 points to 1,056.7.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 467.5 million shares worth 1.156 billion
U.S. dollars, with falls of 489 beating rises of 460.
</P>
<P>
More than 83 million Telstra installment receipts worth a total
of 158.3 million U.S. dollars changed hands today, with the issue
falling 2 cents to 2.75 Australian dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. lifted 5 cents to 7.82 Australian
dollars and the preferred shares 3.2 cents to 7.12 Australian
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Banks were mixed today, with National Australia Bank up 7 cents
to 19.37 Australian dollars each and ANZ Bank gaining 4 cents to
10.04 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Commonwealth Bank fell 15.9 cents to 17.351 Australian
dollars while Westpac Bank slipped 2 cents to 9.19 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
There were some gains in the resources market today after those
stocks have recently been hammered by turbulence in Asian
financial markets, with investors being uncertain about the impact
on commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said weakness in the Australian dollar today helped
some miners because it made exports cheaper and therefore could
boost the volumes of commodities sold.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar continued its downward slide today to hit
a new low of 67.55 U.S. dollars, a level not seen in four years.
</P>
<P>
Mining company WMC was up 18.5 cents to 4.685 Australian
dollars with a turnover of 7.02 million shares and BHP 13 cents to
13.43 Australian dollars with 8.6 million shares exchanged.
</P>
<P>
The gold index increased 0.7 points to 861.8 defying a slight
fall of the precious metal to 295.60 U.S. dollars at noon in
Sydney, from 296.3 U.S. dollars in Sydney Thursday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is the first country
to receive free grant from the World Bank which will be provided
in the next three years, a bank official was quoted as saying by
today's local English newspaper "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Velez, the World Bank senior education specialist in
Kampala, said the bank will support Uganda's universal primary
education (UPE) program by 75 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The grant "will not be paid back," he said at a conference on
Wednesday, adding that the World Bank is happy with the healthy
economic policies Uganda has adopted.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank lends money but does not give grants. But it
is the first time in the World Bank's history" that it is
providing with a grant of 75 million U.S. Dollars to a country on
no recovery basis, the official said.
</P>
<P>
And still, a negotiation on a credit of 75 million U.S.
Dollars financing UPE in Uganda is under way, he told his
audience. The credit is also to be given in the next three years.

KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Under-weight newborns have
increased from 10 to 16 percent in Uganda, "The Monitor" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Jacinta Sabiiti, an official of the Nutrition Department of
Ugandan Health Ministry, told a monthly media meeting Thursday
that low birth weight is largely resulted from poor feeding
habits of the lying women when they were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Mothers are not allowed to eat some nutritious food such as
chicken and fish, and women eat late, less and last, according to
local customs.
</P>
<P>
Many newborns in rural areas continue to suffer from stunted
growth due to malnutrition, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Lack of iodized salts and vitamin also caused some health

MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia have agreed to
further strengthen their military cooperation and increase
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached when Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
the general staff of the People's Liberation Army of China, met
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Chief of General
Staff of the Russian armed forces Anatoly Kvashnin respectively
here on Thursday.

partnership oriented toward the 21st century, which is of great
significance to the relations between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his current visit, he said, is to promote the
good relations between the two armies, as both China and Russia
have much in common and they are opposed to hegemonism and support
multi-polarization.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not on Enmity With U.S.: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that his country is not
on enmity with other countries including the United States while
holding its firm stand in defending its interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
"We don't wish to be the enemy of other countries as we realize
that if we are on good terms with others including the United
States, it will bring much benefit to us," he said on TV3's
Malaysia Today talk show, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah described Malaysian-U.S. relations as healthy and
mature, saying Malaysia would support the United States if what it
does is proper but would oppose it if it is against Malaysia's
principles.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia acknowledges the importance of the United
States as a trading partner and as the third biggest investor in
this country and at the same time does not want this to be a "big
power-small power relationship with Malaysia becoming an errand
boy."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports to the United States last year totaled 14
billion U.S. dollars and the imports from that country amounted to
12 billion dollars. Meanwhile, U.S. investments in Malaysia were
worth 6 billion dollars in the capital sector and 2 billion
dollars in the equity sector.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said, "We also have more than 10,000
students in the United States while our investments there totaled
1 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
He denied the allegation that Malaysia is a trouble maker and
U.S. basher and felt such allegations have arisen because Malaysia
does not agree with the United States on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also spoke of Malaysia-Singapore relations, saying the
sensitive nature of the relationship is normal among close
friends. "What is important is that both countries should realize
the importance of their relationship and be cautious always."

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) has declared Somalia a disaster
zone following the deaths of more than 1,300 people in floods.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times today quoted IGAD's Director for Political and
Humanitarian Affairs Kinfe Abraham as saying here that an
estimated 10 million U.S. Dollars is needed to bring the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Abraham who had been to Somalia to assess the floods situation
in the country said that some 80,000 hectares of land had been
submerged after the country's two major rivers burst their banks.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some 200,000 people had been displaced and
another 900,000 adversely affected by the torrential rains in the
past one month in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need for the international community to
intervene to save Somalia from an expected explosion of epidemics
such as measles, cholera and malaria, the Ethiopian official
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the impact of the flooding had been aggravated
by the collapse of the country's infrastructure and other
institutions of governance.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the authority would set up an emergency fund
for future disasters in the region and appealed to member states
and international community to contribute to the fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France has authorized the cultivation of trans-genetic corn,
which is a victory for farmers who want genetically modified
plants. European experts affirm that these kinds of plants are
harmless to consumers, while some others are worried about their
negative effects on environment. The government will organize a
big public debate and promise to guarantee transparency over the
products which will come from the biological revolution.
</P>
<P>
-- Former President of the Congo Republic Pascal Lissouba, who
was toppled on October 15 by General Denis Sassou-Nguesso, has
accused the French oil group Elf of signing "a pact of corruption"
with Sassou-Nguesso. Lissouba has also launched a lawsuit against
Elf for "participation in the terrorist plot of General
Sassou-Nguesso" and asked the oil group to send its income from
oil exploration and production in Congo to the United Nations, so
that the latter can send a peace-keeping force to the country
before a presidential election is held.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Representatives of 170 nations will meet in Kyoto, Japan,
from Monday trying to agree upon the reduction of emission of
greenhouse gases. Participants to the meeting will be faced with
proposals which are completely in opposition. The United States
wants to establish a global market of licenses for pollution and
refuses to limit on national level the emission of greenhouse
gases, while Europe defends the principle of a 15 percent
reduction of such gas emissions. The third World countries, which
are moving toward industrialization, will not let themselves
remain behind in economic development.
</P>
<P>
-- The earth is warming up because of emission of greenhouse
gases and this climatic upheaval will not bring about paradise
sunshine but an accentuation of extreme heat and freeze. Although
disputes remain over the causes and consequences of the global
warming, two things are certain: The concentration of carbon
dioxide has increased by nearly one-third in two centuries and the
earth warmed up by half a degree in 150 years.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Sign Antipersonnel Land-mines Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will sign a
U.N. treaty banning antipersonnel land-mines, the Department of
Foreign Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would be the third of 120 countries to sign the
treaty next week in Ottawa, Canada, as Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo is expected to sign the document only after Canada and
Norway.
</P>
<P>
The treaty bans the use, development, production, transfer and
stockpiling of land mines within four years of the treaty coming
into force, and requires the clearing of all land mine areas
within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Forty countries should ratify the treaty before it could be
put into force.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official, Bennie Lombard, said Thursday
that the 10-year clearance clause would be most applicable to
southern Africa, and that South Africa would assist the region in
accomplishing this.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is possible and feasible to de-mine the entire
region in 10 year," Lombard said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Southern African Development Community would look
at establishing a capability next year to rehabilitate land mine
areas and compensate land mine victims.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Defense Force had destroyed some
240,000 stockpiled land mines in the past six months, saving only
18,000 pieces to be used for development and training in mine
detection, clearance and destruction techniques.
</P>
<P>
A retention of certain amount of mines was permissible in
terms of the U.N. treaty.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Climate Change Ends in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Local Government
Leaders' Summit on Climate Change closed today in Nagoya, western
Japan, with a declaration pledging maximum efforts to curtail
emissions of greenhouse gases, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Nagoya Declaration adopted at the three-day conference
lauded local governments as effective organizations that can be
mobilized in international efforts to cut emissions of carbon
dioxide and other global warming gases.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which will be presented at the 10-day third
conference of the parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change to be held in Kyoto on Monday, urged developed
countries to set 2005 as the first stage for emission cuts and to
aim for a 20 percent cut from 1990 level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Michael Cutajar, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change emphasized the crucial role to be
played by local governments on the issue of global warming.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, Cutajar said that he expected the Nagoya
Declaration to be reported officially at the Kyoto conference.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 local government leaders from 29 countries attended
the conference jointly sponsored by the International Council for
Local Environmental Initiatives, an international environmental
agency established in 1990 for local governments, the Nagoya
municipal government and the Aichi prefectural government.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's IFP Introduces Bill on Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A bill designed to amend
South Africa's constitution so as to allow for the death penalty
has been introduced in parliament by the Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), "The Citizen" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The private member's bill, in the name of IFP member Peter
Smith, is expected to be referred for consideration to the
Multi-party Committee on Private Members' Legislative Proposals
and Petitions.
</P>
<P>
The bill seeks to amend Section 12 (1) (e) of the
constitution, which at present reads that everyone has the right
"not to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman or degrading
way," by inserting the word "executed".
</P>
<P>
IFP justice spokesman Koos van der Merwe said on Thursday that
the use of the word "executed" would make it clear that the
constitution did not outlaw the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
South Africa abolished the capital punishment on the eve of
the first all-race general elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has been firmly
opposed to the restoration of the death penalty in spite of the
fact that the majority of South Africans are in favor of the
re-introduction of the death penalty in face of the unabated wave
of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
It argued that a restoration would be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
ANC President Nelson Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27
years by the apartheid regime, personally abominated the death
penalty on the ground that it was used as a major tool by the
regime to oppress the black majority.
</P>
<P>
He said repeatedly that there could be no referendum on the
issue and there could be no reopening of the question of death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel, a member of the opposition
National Party, called for a referendum on the issue in his
province last month, but was severely blasted by the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe said the IFP was the first party in South Africa
to call for a referendum to test the view of ordinary South
Africans on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution needs to be amended to bring it into line
with the clearly expressed democratic wishes of the South African
population."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the IFP proposal will be vetoed at the
committee level and will not reach the ANC-dominated National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament to Take Up No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lok Sabha, the lower
house of the Indian parliament, will be reconvened here on Tuesday
to consider a motion of no-confidence against the United Front
government moved by a Congress party member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangma made the announcement here today
after meeting with parliamentary leaders of the Congress party and
the ruling United Front, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party and the United Front have been locked in a
political standoff after a judicial investigation report released
last week indicted one major constituent of the front in the
assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha, which opened its winter session on November 19,
was adjourned sine die on November 24 following continuing
disruption of proceedings by members of parliament from the
Congress party and the ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has repeatedly demanded that the United
Front government drop three ministers from the indicted
constituent, the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK). But the United
Front minority government, which needs support from the Congress
party to survive, has flatly rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting with Sangma, parliamentary leaders of
both the Congress party and the United Front assured the speaker
of their cooperation in the smooth functioning of the house which
will take up the motion of no-confidence move by Mamata Banerjee
from the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top leaders of the Congress party met here this
afternoon to decide whether to withdraw support to the United
Front government and they will meet again in the evening.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Publishes List of Farms for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
today released the full list of 1,480 commercial farms that it
has designated for compulsory acquisition to resettle about
100,000 landless families.
</P>
<P>
The list comprised farms belonging to individuals both white
and black, private companies and some government parastatals
stretching across the country's 45 districts.
</P>
<P>
Those affected have up to December 28 to lodge their
objections in writing with the Minister of Lands and Agriculture
while those wishing to be compensated should submit written
claims to the minister explaining the nature of loss, the amount
of the claim and the basis upon which it was calculated.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has said farmers would not be
compensated for land but for the improvements they made on the
farms.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe met representatives of white commercial farmers this
week to brief them on the criteria government used to identify
farms for designation.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has already promised the nation the government will
this year acquire over five million hectares to resettle over
100,000 families who have been waiting for land since
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The land issue has hotted up in the last few weeks even
contributing to the fall of the Zimbabwe Dollar against major
currencies and eroding investor confidence on the local stock
market.

<HEADLINE> Bus Strike Disrupts Life in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chaos prevailed on the roads
of Indian capital New Delhi as an indefinite strike by operators
of private buses, the major public transport facilities in the
city, entered its third day today.
</P>
<P>
The private bus operators, including drivers, began the strike
on Wednesday in protest against a ruling of the Supreme Court
requiring an experience period of at least 10 years for becoming a
qualified bus driver.
</P>
<P>
The apex court issued the order after a school bus mishap in
north New Delhi on November 18 claimed the lives of 30 school
children.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India said the strikers also complained of
harassment and illegal detention of private bus operators by
police, urging the central government to mediate in the matter and
appealing to the Supreme Court to protect the fundamental rights
of private bus operators.
</P>
<P>
While some buses from neighboring Uttar Pradesh were seen
plying on the roads of the capital along with state-run buses,
serpentine queues at bus stands, overcrowded three-wheelers and
trucks were a common sight across the metropolis today.
</P>
<P>
Most school children returned home disappointed as their
contract school buses did not turn up although the apex court
Thursday reduced the experience period required for a qualified
bus driver from 10 years to five years.

working illegally," the Singapore Immigration said in a statement.

More than 500 Bangladeshi and Myanmar nationals were arrested
for overstaying in 1992. But the number nearly quintupled to 2,400
in 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said visas will be issued liberally to bona fide Bangladeshi
and Myanmar businessmen and tourists and businessmen who travel
frequently to Singapore can also apply for multiple-journey visas.

The Singapore Immigration also said visa applications can be
made from today at Singapore embassies and consulates in Yangon,
Myanmar, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, and other Singapore overseas
missions, as well as the Singapore Immigration Head Office in

<HEADLINE> Damage of El Nino in Uganda This Year the Worst: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Damage of El-Nino this year
is considered by specialists as the worst in this century, ''the
New Vision'' today quoted a specialist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Ssemazzi, the World Meteorological Organization's
(WMO) representative in the country, said the damage of this El
Nino will exceed that of 1982-1983 which caused a loss of 8-13
billion U.S. Dollars and 2,000 deaths, he added.
</P>
<P>
This El-Nino will likely continue to the next year and cause
further social economic disruption, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He delivered the speech at the fourth meteorological
conference held in Mukono, central Uganda. The conference which
started from Wednesday will come to an end Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Uganda had excessive rains recently. Floods and
landslides are witnessed in the west and the east of the country.
A report reaching here today said about 20,000 people have been
displaced by floods and landslides in eastern Mbale district. And
35 people have been killed in the district.
</P>
<P>
A fact-finding Ugandan Red Cross team to the district reported
the displaced people need food, clothes, blankets and utensils.
Geofrey Sserunjogi, the information officer of the Red Cross,
said the team visited 154 Parishes of the 156 Parishes in the
district.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Labor and Social Services has also sent a team to
the districtgi to estimate the damages caused by floods and
landslides.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Ranks 10th in Insurance Density in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria ranks 10th in the level
of insurance activity in Africa, the national newspaper This Day
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Insurance density, which measures that average Dollar
contribution of each member of the population, shows that an
average Nigerian contributes 3.4 U.S. Dollars per annum as
insurance premium.
</P>
<P>
The list is led by South Africa, with an insurance density of
83.4 Dollars, followed by Tunisia (30.9 Dollars), Morocco (26.3
Dollars), Zimbabwe (24 Dollars), Algeria (10.1 Dollars), Cote
d'Ivoire (8.1 Dollars), Egypt (7.9 Dollars) and Cameroun (6
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the figures reveals that the people in countries
with less per capita income like Cameroun, Kenya and Cote
d'Ivoire show better interest in insurance than Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The analysis also shows that even countries with greater
religious inhibitions like Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have higher
insurance penetration and density than Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Experts therefore believe that while economic and religious
factors have surely played their part, they undoubtedly do not
present the only serious threat to growth of the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Thus much work is to be done by operators of the sector as the
population of Nigeria is the largest in the continent.

In the past the 26-year-old Williams driver had criticized
those changes to rules for unnecessarily taking many risks out of

Despite the new rules, the champion still sees Ferrari's

<HEADLINE> UNDP Recommends 10 Percent Growth Rate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs from eight to 10
percent growth in its gross domestic product over a number of
years if the scourge of poverty is to be eliminated, according to
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
However, the country is far from gaining the target as its
economic growth rate is currently at a "modest 3-4 percent",
noted UNDP Resident Representative Babashola Chinsman.
</P>
<P>
Given this situation, "some stringent measure will be
necessary to achieve these higher growth rates," Chinsman said on
Thursday at the 1997 annual awards/lecture of the Human Impact
Foundation, a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
Amongest these, he said, are enhanced peace and security to
secure higher levels of investment from local and external
sources and opening the economy to competition through
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the promotion of competitive privatization
by ensuring that public monopolies do not transform to private
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP official blamed the slow growth in Nigeria on the
inability of the government.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria, like most other African countries,
lacks visionary leadership needed to manage multi-ethnic
diversity for nation building. This has led to political crisis
defeating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He also slashed at the Nigerian authorities for the failure to
complete a number of important projects mostly financed by 17
billion U.S. Dollars borrowed from international banks.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinsman, many of the projects, which are aimed
at shift from agrarian economy to industrial economy, are either
abandoned, partially completed or completed but constitute a
drain pipe.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Nigerian government to fully optimize or tap the
country's potentials to save the companies nationwide, most of
which are operating very much below capacity.
</P>
<P>
The government should also abandoned its unsure involvement in
economic activities that are best left to the private sectors, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Governor Hosts Dinner for Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Governor-General Romeo
LeBlanc today hosted a state dinner in honor of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, who arrived here to continue his state visit to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Canada," LeBlanc told
Jiang at the dinner held at the governor-general's residence.
</P>
<P>
He noted the fact that Canada was the first country in North
America to establish diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"We were proud then to take that step, and we are proud today
that our linkages with China, whether in trade, education, or ties
between people, have grown ever stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is a vital partner of Canada. With Canada's trade with
Hong Kong taken into account, China stands as Canada's third
largest trading partner. The two-way trade between the two
countries reached over 10 billion U.S. dollars last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But our trade can grow to far greater volumes ... Canada can
offer expertise, friendship, and partnership as China builds a
modern and prosperous economy," LeBlanc told the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit will help strengthen our close and productive
cooperation for the next century," the governor-general said in
the toast.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang spoke enthusiastically of the "warm
hospitality" accorded him by the Canadian government and people
since he arrived in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he came to Canada "with the purpose of deepening
mutual understanding, enhancing friendship, looking towards the
future and developing cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to meeting Canadian leaders and
exchanging views with them on the bilateral relations and some
major international and regional issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and believe that with our concerted efforts, this visit
will further promote China-Canada friendly relations and
cooperation," Jiang told his host.
</P>
<P>
There exists favorable conditions for China and Canada to
develop a relationship of long-term friendship and mutually
beneficial cooperation oriented toward the 21st century, the
Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations of cooperation and friendship are blessed with a
combination of 'opportune time, geographical convenience and
friendly people', as what is described in an old Chinese saying,"
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada should set an example of developing friendship
and cooperation between countries with different history, culture
and social systems and at varying levels of development, Jiang
said. "I am fully confident about the prospect of our relations."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the friendship between China and Canada will
surge forward and last forever like the Yangtze River and the
Niagara," the Chinese president said.

<HEADLINE> African Coffee Producers to Retain Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- African coffee producers have
decided to retain their stocks of 850,000 bags (60 kilograms per
bag) to increase the price, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
''We think that we can increase market prices by up to 25
percent,'' said Alain Gauze, the outgoing chairman of the Inter
African Coffee Organization (IACO).
</P>
<P>
Africa's quota in the Association of Coffee Producing
Countries (ACPC) is 12 million bags.
</P>
<P>
The move is necessary because recent decrease in price reached
5 percent, the outgoing chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
IACO also resolved to increase coffee production at its 37th
conference held in Kampala on November 24 to 26.
</P>
<P>
IACO has formed a finance and sales committee to collect
arrears of 780,000 of U.S. Dollars as its operation fund.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from 25 African countries have selected Abel
Rwendeire, Ugandan State Minister for Trade and Industry, as the
new chairman of the organization.

<HEADLINE> Australia Called Regional Mate of Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's financial help to
Asia during the latter's recent economic crisis has transformed
the country from a regional beggar to a regional mate, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to prop up the Thai and Indonesian economies and
provide fire-fighting help to Indonesia and Malaysia have earned
Australia enormous credibility, removing the "beggar of Asia"
image, Downer told a gathering of Australia's Metal Trades
Industry Association in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Australia has promised about 1 billion U.S. dollars as part of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue package to the
troubled Thai economy and a similar sum to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We have at times given the impression we are begging to be
embraced by Asia," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"The thousands of words of enthusiasm for Asia issuing from the
mouths of national opinion-formers are worth nothing when compared
to the practical actions we have taken in recent months ... to
change Australia's image from ... regional mendicant to a regional
mate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been quite struck by the positive impact among Asian
ministerial colleagues of our decision to join the Thai and
Indonesian IMF packages and our positive sentiment toward helping
(the Republic of) Korea," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic crisis in Asia will have some impact
on Australian trade and investment interests, "but it is too early
to reach sensible conclusions about its magnitude."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the crisis has forced Southeast Asian
economies to adopt tougher financial standards and liberalize
foreign trading rules and this would be to Australia's advantage.
</P>
<P>
With about 60 percent of Australian exports going to Asia,
Downer said, the Australian government does not want to see a
slowdown in the rapid economic growth in Asia as a slowdown would
lead to Asia's weaker demand for Australian products or services,
thus hurting the country's economy.

GUIYANG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 places where the
tree, cathaya argyrophlla, a rare species, is growing densely have
been discovered in the Dashahe Forest in Daozhen County in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The find brings the number of such trees known to exist to
1,050 and accounts for a third of the total known to exist in
China. The others are found in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and the provinces of Hunan and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Cathaya argyrophlla is an evergreen that is regarded as a
"living fossil". It was first discovered in China in 1955.
</P>
<P>
In some countries like France, Germany and Poland, only
fossilized forms of cathaya argyrophlla trees have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The Dashahe Forest area has 23 known species of rare plants
that are under state protection, including davidia involucrata.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Officials Urge WTO Membership for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's early entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is essential given the current
turmoil in the Asian financial market, said Terence O'Brien,
director of the New Zealand Center for Strategic Studies, here
today.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, a former New Zealand Ambassador to the United Nations,
made the remarks at the ongoing conference being held to mark the
25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between China and New Zealand. The University of Auckland and the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences are jointly sponsoring the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The current economic situation in Asia could possibly slow the
movement of APEC efforts to promote trade liberalization, O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
"China's full participation in the WTO will be essential if
APEC does indeed slow down," according to O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The present regional turmoil provides ample evidence
of the shortsightedness of the policy delaying China's WTO
membership."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from compelling trade and economic factors, WTO
membership would significantly complement China's active
participation in and contributions to the international community
of nations," said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
Richard Nottage, New Zealand's secretary of foreign affairs and
trade, reiterated his country's commitment to support China's
"early and successful entry" into the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ministers Defeated in KANU Grass-roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Cabinet ministers and
assistant ministers were among the casualties in the grass-roots
nomination of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) for
December 29 General Election, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party paper said that ministers Protus Momanyi,
Jonathan Ng'eno and Philip Masinde were trounced by their rivals
in the nominations held on Thursday in their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi is the sole KANU candidate for the
Baringo Central parliamentary seat and received his KANU
nominations certificate for the seat given by the returning
officer Javan Kipnyekwei on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President George Saitoti, ministers Ndolo Ayah, Simon
Nyachae, Joseph Kamotho and Musalia Mudavadi had successfully
been endorsed for their constituency seats.
</P>
<P>
Assistant ministers Kassim Mwamzandi and Kiptarus Kirior lost
their constituency seats to their rivals in the on-going grass
roots nominations.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that a combination of bad weather, violence
and apparently poor planning marked the start of the nomination
process of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
By last night, 15 people had been arrested in Nairobi as the
party's national co-ordinator of elections, Njoroge Mungai, was
locked up in a heated exchange with angry party followers at KANU
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for both parliamentary and civic candidates
flopped in most of the voting centers in Nairobi after party
headquarters failed to send returning officers to oversee the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Mungai explained that the presiding officers were dispatched
by the Electoral Commission and he could not tell the time they
were dispatched.
</P>
<P>
There were uncountable cases where presiding officers arrived
late or never arrived at all, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Rare Earth Resouces Development in China Attract Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The development of rare earth
resources in Inner Mongolia, north China, has become an attraction
for investors from at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
By early October, 68 domestic and overseas companies had come
to the Baotou Rare Earth Development Zone in the region, an
increase of 77 percent on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of companies in the rare earth sector in
Baotou to 145,  16 of them being foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They had an output value of 850 million yuan in the first 10
months of this year, more than double the figure a year ago. And
they earned 16 million U.S. dollars by exporting rare earth
products in the same period.
</P>
<P>
China has 36 million tons of proven reserves of rare earth,
accounting for 80 percent of the world's total. Some 95 percent
of China's rare earth deposits are in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
To increase output, a development zone was built in 1990 in
Baotou.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Universities in Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A wave of turmoil has swept
several major universities in Sri Lanka in the past few days,
causing a couple of injuries and anxiety on the part of university
authorities.
</P>
<P>
At Kelaniya University in the eastern suburb of Colombo, about
600 students held Deputy Vice-Chancellor Prof. K. Thilakaratne
hostage for over two hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the university cancel its decision to
suspend five students charged with ragging.
</P>
<P>
The decision came at a time when universities in the country
were taking a serious look at ragging, following the death of a
freshman, Selvanayagam Varapragash, at Peradeniya University one
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Varapragash, 21, died of kidney failure two weeks after he was
admitted to hospital. The freshman sustained serious injuries when
he was inhumanely ragged by a group of seven senior students in
the same university in Kandy, Central Province.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the first ever of its kind in the history of
Sri Lanka's higher education and it touched off heated debate
across the country.
</P>
<P>
While the seven arrested suspects in this ragging case are
awaiting court sentences, universities across the nation are
discussing ways to completely eradicate on-campus harassment and
torture, which are common phenomena in Sri Lankan universities.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's incident, Kelaniya students surrounded the
administration building and had not released Thilakaratne until
police intervened.
</P>
<P>
The students were also protesting against the university's
decision to recommend that the government make ragging a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued Thursday by the Open University
of Sri Lanka condemned on-campus protests by its students, saying
such activities would lead neither to an adequate analysis of
their problems nor to sensible solutions.
</P>
<P>
There were a string of demonstrations against the suspension of
two students, high tuition, academic problems faced by students
and alleged irregularities in charging fees from students in the
university recently.
</P>
<P>
The Open University in the statement declared that it will make
efforts to overcome its own shortcomings and expressed willingness
to discuss those problems with the students' union.
</P>
<P>
In another higher education institution, Colombo University, a
group of students on Monday staged a demonstration outside the
administration building to protest against the removal of their
hostel sub-warden and canteen keeper.
</P>
<P>
They clashed with another rival group of students who were also
on the scene. As a result, some students were injured and
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Following that incident, sporadic clashes between rival student
groups have occurred during the past days.
</P>
<P>
Acting Vice-Chancellor Prof. Tilak Hettiarachchi said the
campus atmosphere was tense and students from both sides were
trying to attack each other.
</P>
<P>
The university authorities have taken necessary measures to
settle the dispute among the students and further investigations
are under way, according to Hettiarachchi.

<P>
ANKARA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations food and
medicine distribution is extremely inefficient in northern Iraq,
an Iraqi rebel official has complained.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Turkish Daily
News, which is published today, Sami Abdul-Rahman from Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), a major rebel group in northern
Iraq, urged the U.N. to pay attention to this situation.
</P>
<P>
"We received only 40 percent of the medicine and did not
get any of the rehabilitation of our infrastructure," Abdul-Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, we received no food and medicine from the
U.N, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Rahman is heading a high-level KDP delegation here for
talks with Turkish officials on the developments in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, allegely backed by Ankara and Baghdad, has been
fighting the pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for
the control of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As for peace talks, Abdul-Rahman said that the PUK should
realize that there is no alternative to the Ankara peace process
designed by Turkey, the United States and Britain to restore
peace in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He called on the PUK to return to the negotiating tables for
the benefits of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has been deprived of exercising
sovereignty in northern Iraq in the wake of its defeat by the
western allied forces in the 1990 Gulf War.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 wild
animals, mainly wildebeests and buffaloes, have got drowned in
recent floods in the Serengeti National Park, in northern
Tanzania, "The Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Serengeti District Administrative Officer, Edward Mulemwa,

villages.
</P>
<P>
Mulemwa said the villagers have been collecting the carcasses

<P>
However, the death of animals was not unusual particularly
during the rainy season, said Gerald Bigurube, Acting Director
General of the Tanzania National Parks.
</P>
<P>
"This is very normal," said Bigurube. "In Serengeti alone, for
example, there are millions of wildebeests and buffaloes."
</P>
<P>
Besides, their reproduction was very fast, he said, adding
that the animals would migrated westwards in the park.
</P>

NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling United Front
and the Congress party are heading for a showdown today as both
refuse to compromise their stands toward three ministers from a
party allegedly linked with the killing of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has been demanding that the United Front
government drop the three ministers from the Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham (DMK), a major constituent of the United Front, after the
regional party in Tamil Nadu was indicted in the assassination of
Gandhi by a judicial inquiry report released last week.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of its Core Committee last night, the 13-party
United Front gave a final rejection of the Congress party demand
for the ouster of DMK ministers from the government led by Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Working Committee, the apex decision-making body
of the Congress party, is meeting here this afternoon to take a
final decision on whether the party should withdraw support to the
United Front government.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government is a minority one which needs

<HEADLINE> Urban Elderly In China In Favor Of Remarriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey here has
showed that 60 percent of the elderly in China's urban areas
believe elderly re-marriage is okay.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Tianjin Academy of Social
Sciences' Population Research Institute and the Tianjin Research
Institute on Elderly Marriages, covered the city's 509 old people
who had lost husbands or wives.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed, however, that the rate of old people
personally willing to remarry came to 37.6 percent, a slight
drop from that 13 years ago. And, of those who support
remarriage, only a fifteenth have actually gotten married again.
</P>
<P>
Hao Maishou, head of the Tianjin Research Institute on Elderly
Marriage, pointed out that the attitudes of the elderly toward
remarriage depend heavily on their children's attitude, and the
survey also showed that it is now difficult for the elderly to
find new partners.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that among their children, the elder ones in
favor of their remarriage are more than the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
Hao said that China now has 120 million old people, 38 percent
of whom have lost husbands or wives, so remarriage is a new trend.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Market Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The wool market maintained
its new-found stability at auction sales this week to finish 2
Australian cents (1.36 U.S. cents) higher per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
"Market indicators are basically unchanged from their levels at
the end of October, due largely to the weaker Australian dollar,"
the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said in its weekly market
review.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose 2 Australian cents to close
at 712 Australian cents (484 U.S. cents) a clean kilogram while
the western market indicator lifted 4 Australian cents from the
last Fremantle sale a fortnight ago to finish at 653 Australian
cents (444 U.S. cents) a clean kilogram.
</P>
<P>
A total of 111,554 bales were offered at sales in Sydney,
Melbourne and Fremantle with a pass-in rate of 11.5 percent,
comprising 8.8 percent in the north, 7.9 percent in the south and
17.3 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
"It continues to be a source of frustration and unnecessary
expense to buyers in the west to value a high proportion of each
sale's offering in Fremantle when there does not appear to be a
genuine intention to sell on the part of certain brokers and
growers," the council said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the weaker Australian dollar and consequent
widespread competition helped the market hold up surprisingly
well, maintaining a trend over the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Sales will continue next week in Newcastle, Adelaide and
Launceston with about 95,000 bales rostered for sale.
</P>
<P>
Wool prices are expected to remain around this level until
Christmas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- As the Indian rupee is
weakening, the Nepali rupee fell today again by 50 paisa, the
third time in one week.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank today refixed the buying and selling
rates of the greenback at 61.25 rupees and 61.85 rupees
respectively from Thursday's 60.75 rupees and 61.35 rupees.
</P>
<P>
This is the 7th time for the Nepali currency to be devalued in

The latest series of devaluation took place after the Indian
rupee fell to a two-year low against the dollar Monday due to the
country's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis lingers and the Indian rupee is weakening, the
Nepali rupee, which is pegged to the Indian currency at a fixed
rate of 1.6:1, has no other choice but to follow suit.

<P>
YANGON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Population Information
Network (POPIN) will participate in the ESCAP translation grants
program to engage in translation of publications from English
into Myanmar language, said a senior Myanmar immigration and
population official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an in-country training workshop on information

and publish directories and databases on population, personnel,
institutions and research in Myanmar, official paper The New Light
of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of
Immigration and Population and the Economic and Social Commission

ESCAP and other United Nations organizations and Myanmar
ministries.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a seminar on feasibility of establishing a national

the collection, sharing and dissemination of population related
information and to create a better forum for coordinating and
harmonizing the dissemination of population data between

<HEADLINE> China Enjoying Both Stable Market Prices, Sound Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that retail
and consumer prices will grow 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent this
year, 4.7 and 4.8 percentage points less than 1996, according to
an article in the recent Outlook magazine.
</P>
<P>
The article said that China maintained stable market prices in
the first nine months of this year while enjoying sound economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It said that retail and consumer prices grew 1.3 and 3.4
percent respectively between January-September, compared with 6.6
and 8.8 percent for last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
An ample supply of agricultural products and manufactured goods
are mostly responsible for the remarkable drop of price growth,
the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Price increases in grain and non-staple food in the first nine
months were only 0.5 percent, down from last year's 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 25 percent of the drop in the retail price growth
rate was caused by price drops in raw materials, machinery
products, textile goods and consumption commodities, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
With a sufficient supply ensured, a moderately tight monetary
policy has made effective control over investment and consumption
swell, especially in industrial products and the means of
production, it said.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will lobby the U.S.
Congress to support President Bill Clinton's efforts to help Asian
nations out of the economic turmoil, according to Deputy Foreign
Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand was quoted today by local press as saying that the
legislative body needed to be persuaded to recognize the
importance of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai Foreign Ministry will use the diplomatic
channels and the personal contacts by him and Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pledged at the 18-antion Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Summit in Canada early this week to take a more active
role in helping tackle the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States did not take part in a 17.2 billion U.S.
dollar austerity package granted to Thailand in August by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed regret at the summit to Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai that Washington did not act more quickly to help
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The failure was in part due to the time it took the congress to
consider the granting of financial assistance to other nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here today to continue his state visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his wife Wang Yeping were greeted at the airport by
his Canadian host Governor General Romeo LeBlanc and his wife
Diana Fowler LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
Red carpets were rolled out, and Jiang received a 21-gun salute
at a welcome ceremony at the airport, during which time Jiang
reviewed the guard of honor.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the ceremony, the Canadian governor general
expressed welcome to Jiang on behalf of the 30 million Canadian
people.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, Canada and China have built a strong
relationship. And since 1994, every year has seen an exchange of
high level visits between our two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the strong commitment by the leaders of both
governments to our good relationship," LeBlanc said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the belief that Jiang's visit will further advance
Canada-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed thanks to LeBlanc for hosting
the grand ceremony and his warm remarks.
</P>
<P>
"China and Canada are two great nations and their peoples two
great peoples. The traditional relationship between us has a long
history," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
And in recent years, China-Canada relations have entered into a
new stage of all-around development thanks to the joint efforts by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
"In the new international situation, the common interests of
the two countries are increasing rather than decreasing; the
potential for cooperation is expanding rather than diminishing,"
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada "should establish a relationship of all-round
cooperation towards the 21st century, and set a model for the
countries of different social systems, at different development
level and with different cultural background to respect each
other, coexist in peace and seek common development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed the belief that as long as the
two countries view and handle their ties "from the height of the
times and with a strategic perspective, China-Canada relations
will surely make greater development."
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his entourage, including Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and Minister Wu Yi of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, arrived here from Calgary.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Suspend Negotiations with European Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Republic
suspended negotiations today with the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), accusing it of interfering
in the internal affairs of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Republic said that negotiations would not be resumed
until the EBRD recognized the legitimate current government of the
Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that the negotiations
were suspended because the EBRD postponed signing an agreement on
providing a five-million-dollar loan for the Bosnian Serb Republic
before the Bosnian Serb government was established.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which was part of a 15-million-dollar loan provided
by the EBRD for the two entities in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, was to be invested in the telecommunication sector of
the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb Republic and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat
Federation, the two entities in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, came into being in 1996, according to the Dayton
peace agreement signed by Bosnian Serb, muslim and Croat leaders
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD, inaugurated in London in 1991, decided to accept
Bosnia-Herzegovina as its 60th member at its 5th annual meeting
held in April of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ostersund Ruled Out to Bid 2006 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The central Sweden town of
Ostersund failed Thursday to seek support from Swedish sports
federations to bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) criticized lack of
improvements in the Ostersund bid as the main reason.
</P>
<P>
Bjorn Folin, spokesman of the SOC, said they would consider the
possibility of continuing campaign with an improved bid for 2010,
2014 or later Games.
</P>
<P>
Ostersund needed the backing of a majority of Swedish sports
federations to overturn last week's decision by the SOC executive
board not to back the town in its fourth consecutive Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
But the issue was not put to a vote at the SOC's joint annual
meeting in Stockholm with the sports federations after
presentation of arguments for and against the bid and an open
discussion of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ostersund squeezed out by Lillehammer, Norway, for the 1994
Winter Olympics, failing bids for the 1998 and 2002 Games while
Stockholm lost to Athens for the 2004 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains Same After Transfer of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Five months after the
reunification, life goes on in Hong Kong normally and the economy
is still in good health, Sir David Akers, the former acting
governor of Hong Kong in 1986, said today.
</P>
<P>
Akers, also a senior adviser to the Chinese government on Hong
Kong affairs until last July, made the remark in London while
giving a speech entitled "Hong Kong -- the Business and Economic
Perspective."
</P>
<P>
After the transfer of power of Hong Kong on June 30, he said
the city is run not by Beijing, but by Tung Chee-Hwa, the chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, who was
elected by the 400-member electoral college.
</P>
<P>
"To all appearances, life goes on as usual and yet there has
been this profound change -- we are now part of the People's
Republic of China, with a Chinese chief executive who can set
priorities for the government, which would not have been possible
until we knew what the future held and we were exercising the high
degree of autonomy promised in the Basic Law," Akers said.
</P>
<P>
Akers, currently a non-executive chairman and director of
several companies in Hong Kong, said that after June 30 Hong
Kong's economy remains stable and the growth rate is being
maintained.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is dropping slightly, and we have virtually full
employment. Our foreign exchange reserves in aggregate are more
than 100 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
Akers, who has lived in the Orient since 1954, said the growth
of China's economy will continue to have a direct impact on
Hong Kong region and indirectly, as China's economy grows, Hong
Kong will go on growing as an intermediary and service center for
investors in China.
</P>
<P>
With the continuity of China's economic reform and the policy
of opening to the outside world, Shanghai is booming and changing
greatly. But he believes that although Hong Kong has made a great
contribution to the development of Shanghai, these two cities are
partners rather than competitors.
</P>
<P>
"The real question is not whether Hong Kong is going to decline
or be overtaken by Shanghai or the rest of China, but rather
whether we can live up to the greatness being thrust upon us by
the developing economy of Guangdong and China as a whole," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Picture Album Published in China to Mark Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A picture album exposing the
atrocity of Japanese invaders in Nanjing in 1937 has been
published to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 800 pictures in the collection have never been
made public, and a considerable part of them were taken by
Japanese soldiers and military correspondents participating in the
massacre. Their pictures were taken to make a show of force, but now
offer conclusive evidence of their atrocity, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Also made public for the first time were photos preserved by
Jone Rabe, the Nanjing representative of the Germany-based Siemens
corporation. One picture clearly shows a car running on corpses
piled over one meter high.
</P>
<P>
The album has also contrasted the pictures of the city's major
roads, downtown areas, schools and scenic spots before and after
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The "Picture Album of Nanjing Massacre" with photos, survivors'
testimony, Japanese war criminals' confessions and some important
statistics, was jointly compiled by the China No. 2 Historical
Archive, which has the richest and most authoritative materials on
the massacre, the Nanjing Municipal Archive and the Memorial Hall
for Nanjing Massacre Victims.
</P>
<P>
The album has confirmed from many aspects that the massacre was
a premediated and well-organized act instigated and commanded by
the then Japanese government and the then highest Japanese
military commander in China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops savagely butchered more than 300,000 Chinese
civilians and unarmed soldiers in the first six weeks of their
invasion in Nanjing beginning on Dec. 13, 1937.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 rapes occurred during the period, over
one-third of the roads and buildings were turned into ruins, and
the loss of property was estimated at 230 billion yuan (28.75
billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in China Exceeds 200 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in China now
exceeds 200 billion U.S. dollars, in 300,000 projects and supports
the export-oriented economy and economic and technological
exchanges, according to Zhao Guanghua, deputy director of the
State Council's Special Economic Zones Office.
</P>
<P>
The information came from a recent seminar on development and
investment in central and western parts of China held in Wuhan,
the capital of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment from abroad accounts for 5.5 percent of
China's GDP, two percentage points higher than in 1993, and the
actual amount of foreign funds used in China over the past five
years was 114.2 billion U.S. dollars, more than double the
combined investment of the previous decade, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to double the amount of foreign funds it has
used to reach about 400 billion U.S. dollars by the end of this
century, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has moved from the traditional processing
and service businesses to the sectors of energy, communications,
agriculture, finance, insurance, property, tourism, and
technology, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's second largest user of foreign
investment, after the United States, since 1993, and direct
foreign investment in China accounts for 41.8 percent of the total
amount of investment in the world's developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On average, per-project investment rose from 900,000
U.S. dollars in 1991 to last year's three million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
J. C. Wild, of the UN Industrial Development Organization, said
that greater efficiency and lower production costs have been a
major factor in deciding where to invest in today's world, because
of intense competition and the integration of global financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
The fact that direct foreign investment in China rose to 36
billion U.S. dollars in 1995, is mainly because of China's
enormous market and its low wages, Wild says.
</P>
<P>
Since China shifted development emphasis from the
economically-developed east coast to the central and western parts
of the country, the latter have become a new place for investment
because of cheap manpower and abundant natural resources there.
</P>
<P>
By June of this year, 200 of the world's top 500 multinationals
had a foothold in central and western parts of China.

<HEADLINE> Ministry to Map out Rules on Motorcycle Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Machinery is mapping out five regulations to bring the country's
fledgling motorcycle manufacturing industry under legal control,
the China Machinery and Electronics Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes to halt the disorder in the industry by
encouraging mergers and product development, and enforcing
regulations on products, product catalogue and working situations.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 9.3 million motorcycles were produced in China with a
value of 59.9 billion yuan. For the third consecutive year, China
remained the world's largest manufacturer and consumer of
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
China's motorcycle industry has shown obvious advantages, such
as low prices and huge domestic market potential, but only 75,000
motorcycles were exported in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The gap between Chinese manufacturing level and the world's
overall level in motorcycle sector is reflected in design
problems, compatibility between parts, poor durability and high
energy consumption.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Its Auto Industry More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase the
viability of its automotive industry through combining its existing
small-scale car plants into three or four larger, more competitive
industrial groups by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The overall regrouping of the industry is a crucial strategy
for local automotive manufacturers to face challenges in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
The step was outlined recently in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province, by Lu Fuyuan, Deputy Minister of Machinery
Industry, who is in charge of the country's fledgling automotive
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, more than 120 car manufacturers were set
up in the country during the mid-and-late 1980s because of the
government's policy to introduce advanced foreign technology and
funds into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Among these 120 automotive plants, there are four groups
financed by the central government, namely, the First Automotive
Works, the Second Automotive Works, the Nanjing Automotive Group
and the Chongqing Automotive Group. There also are four locally
funded groups, respectively in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and
Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
China now can produce all types of vehicles ranging from
heavy trucks to mini-cars. The country is expected to turn
out 1.57 million vehicles in 1997, compared with 500,000 in 1990
and more than 1 million in 1992, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The automotive industry has become one of the industrial
pillars for the country, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that since the beginning of the 1990s, a series
of reform measures have been taken to tackle such problems as
scattered operation and overlapping construction.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990-95, 58.8 billion yuan has been invested in the
automotive sector, including 46.2 billion yuan to the top 13
manufacturers. Thirteen car makers produced 91 percent of the
country's vehicles in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
China ranks eleventh among the 12 countries with an annual
vehicle output of more than 1 million, Lu said.

<P>
TIANJIN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Half of the dilapidated
housing in Tianjin, China's biggest northern industrial city, has
been rebuilt, according to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the city has demolished 4.18 million
sq.m. of rundown housing and built 10 million sq.m. of new
housing, benefiting nearly 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin began reconstruction work on dilapidated housing in
1993, and planned to complete the project in five to seven years,
mainly with foreign funds, especially from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to municipal government officials, Hong Kong New
World Development Co. Ltd., which spent hundreds of million yuan
on rebuilding Tianjin's old town, has started the second-stage of
the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- UEFA is to investigate
accusations that Belgian police acted brutally at a European
Champions' League match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General secretary Gerhard Aigner said in a statement on
Thursday that UEFA "would ask all parties involved for full
reports".
</P>
<P>
German club Bayer Leverkusen accused police of brutality
following incidents at the match against Lierse.
</P>
<P>
"Women and old people were hit," said Leverkusen manager Rainer
Calmund, who witnessed the scenes inside the Ghent stadium.
</P>
<P>
"People who were lying on the floor where hit with batons.
It's the worst (incident) I've ever seen during a football match."
</P>
<P>
At least five Bayer Leverkusen fans and two policemen were
injured but none seriously, Belgian police said.
</P>
<P>
Aigner said: "We need to know what caused the police to take
action. Based on that and the report from the official UEFA
delegate we will deal with this case."
</P>
<P>
UEFA's statement said that according to Mathieu Sprenger, their
delegate in Ghent, all security arrangements were agreed and
checked before the match.
</P>
<P>
Ghent police spokesman Ronny Matthys said the problems started
when some 900 German fans were forced to stay inside the stadium
after the game for 30 minutes to allow Lierse supporters to
leave.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to crack
down on breaches of copyright and help to improve the legal
standing and quality of books and audio-video products next year.
</P>
<P>
"Copyright protection is a protracted task that requires
regular inspection and strengthened law enforcement", said a
Chinese official who requested anonymity, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the National Copyright Administration of China
said it is to train local copyright authorities to enforce the law
more effectively next year. Training of this nature has been
organized this year and has obtained good results, said the
official with the administration.
</P>
<P>
Officials confiscated 49 under-ground CD production lines
during last year's national action to crack down on Pornography
and illegal audio-video products.
</P>
<P>
Data from the administration suggest that the public's
awareness of copyright protection has been greatly enhanced by
crack-downs on copyright infringements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A healthy trade in audio-video products has been reported by
the four national wholesalers for audio-video products in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, in south China's Guangdong Province, and
Wuhan, in central China's Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> Blueprint Worked Out for Beijing Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has worked out a
detailed plan for the city's central area to ensure a healthy
development of the capital, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which covers more than 320 square kilometers of the
city's central area, designates various limits including building
heights, building volume-to-land ratio and greenery rates for
every piece of construction land. Also, it designates areas for
various necessary infrastructure facilities in the city, providing
detailed guidelines for the capital's design and management.
</P>
<P>
In the area around important heritage buildings, building
height will be kept under 12 meters.
</P>
<P>
The building height along Chang'an Avenue and some other main
streets will be kept to no more than 30 meters.
</P>
<P>
The plan will adjust the distribution of industrial
construction. With the development of the economy, the central
part of the capital has entered a new stage of commercial and
trade expansion, while industrial construction is being shifted
outward.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land designated for commercial and financial use
will increase from 5.28 percent in 1995 to 7.03 percent in
2010. And the proportion for industrial development will be
decreased from 14.79 percent to 5.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 industrial enterprises within the Third Ring Road
which produce pollution and disturb residents will be moved out to
the suburbs.

GUANGZHOU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The capital of southern
China's Guangdong Province is redoubling its efforts to help
laid-off workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 86,900 unemployed people,
including 45,600 laid-off workers in Guangzhou. Its towns and
state-owned enterprises have re-employed 36.4 percent of the
unemployed, bringing the unemployment rate to 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou stipulates that those enterprises that want to fire
more than 20 workers in a short period have to apply to the labor
department and give compensation to laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The city encourages profitable enterprises to employ more
workers laid-off by poorly managed companies. The government will
provide financial assistance to those employers.
</P>
<P>
The government takes compulsory measures to protect the rights
and interests of the aged, the weak, the handicapped and the sick.
</P>
<P>
The laid-off workers are mostly from traditional industries,
because their skill levels usually fall short of the demands of
newly emerging industries.

<P>
BONN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker
Volkswagen AG announced today that it is planning to invest a
total of 43 billion German marks (24.4 billion US dollars)

</P>
<P>
Under an investment plan approved today by the company's

By the year 2000, VW will be able to offer a total of 50 models
instead of the current 38 worldwide. All the models will be based
on four common chassis, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The investment announced today represented a 10-billion-mark

investment plan announced in 1996. It was also the largest
investment volume ever planned by the German company.

<HEADLINE> EU Decides to Step Up Health Protection for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
decided to enhance the safety of workers in relation to exposure
to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and other transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive body made the decision by
adopting a related directive on a proposal by Padraig Flynn,
European commissioner for employment and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The directive is aimed to strengthen the existing provisions
under another directive which concerns the protection of workers
from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work,
according to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that the decision to strengthen the
directive was motivated by the most recent scientific evidence
which linked the BSE agent to the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob
Disease (CJD) which affected humans.
</P>
<P>
It explained that these new findings had provided "persuasive"
evidence that the existing recommendations for the protection of
workers against possible occupational transmission of BSE should
be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The directive applies to all workers, including those
particularly at risk, such as farmers, abattoir workers and
laboratory pathologists, according to the Commission.

<HEADLINE> Researcher: Global Warming Could Disrupt Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The buildup of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere could change the ocean current
circulation, said a researcher in a report to be published Friday
in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
Currents flowing like rivers from pole to pole and from ocean
to ocean help keep the Earth's weather in a steady state, said
Wallace S. Broecher of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of
Columbia University in New York. The dependable pattern of ocean
circulation is a key factor in controlling the Earth's weather and
keeping it predictable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Broecher said studies of ice cores that date back 110,000 years
show that about once a millennium the Earth's climate abruptly
changes and within 10 to 20 years can cause such things as
increased glaciers, halting of rainfall or crippling declines in
temperature.
</P>
<P>
According to Broecher, ocean currents are controlled by the
temperature and salt content of the water. Cold, salty water is
heavy and drops to the ocean bottom, while warm, fresh water
rises. This creates a conveyor current that spans the globe. Cold,
salty water in the North Atlantic sinks, working like a plunger to
drive an ocean current from near North America to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Flowing past Europe, the conveyor current flows into the South
Atlantic and then around Antarctica. The waters cool and pick up
more salt, giving the current another boost. From the South Pole,
the currents fan out into the Indian and Pacific oceans and into
the Atlantic to complete the cycle.
</P>
<P>
Broecher said the currents help to bring rain, seasonal cycles
of moisture. If the currents are disrupted, agriculture would
suffer. With a changing climate, there would be many more crop
failures.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Calls for Equality in Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today called for equality in the EU's labor market in
order to make its member countries prosper.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner responsible for employment and
social affairs, made the remark at a conference held Wednesday in
Brussels on equal opportunities and collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we tackle the inequality issue in the labor market, the
European Union will not prosper. It's as simple as that," said the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Europe's working age population, which is now growing much more
slowly than it did over the last 20 years, has started to show
signs of decline, according to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the role of women in the EU's labor market
should be duly appreciated if the EU wanted to sustain its living
standards and social systems. "Europe's social and economic
profile is changing dramatically," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He said that new and effective ways to achieve equal
opportunities between women and men could be created through
negotiation and then embodied into collective agreements as
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the commissioner added, "Collective bargaining can,
in a very strong sense, be an instrument for gender equality in
the workforce."
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the fact that the jobs summit held in Luxembourg on
November 20 and 21 demanded that member states translate their
commitment to "promote equality of opportunity" into reality.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the commitment would show itself in
an increased presence of women at all levels of the labor market.
