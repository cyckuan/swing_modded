<HEADLINE> China Urges Ratification of Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China today appealed to the
United States and Russia to ratify "as early as possible" the
convention banning chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The two major declared possessors of chemical weapons are
"lacking progress in their ratification process," said Huang Yu,
head of the Chinese delegation, when addressing the 15th plenary
session of the Preparatory Commission for the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The early ratification by countries with the largest stock of
chemical weapons represents the key to the early realization of
the object and purpose of the Convention," he said, adding that
otherwise the Convention would be reduced to a chemical weapons
non-proliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the Chinese government is fully committed to the
object and purpose of the Convention, and attached great
importance to its ratification and implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said the implementation of the Convention is a very arduous
process for China since the country has a significant civilian
chemical industry and on its territories there are chemical
weapons abandoned by other country.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, he said, "significant progress" has been made in
the preparations for the implementation and ratification of the
Convention and that China is in the process of finalizing its
ratification procedures.
</P>
<P>
"We will...submit as early as possible the Convention to our
legislative body, i.e. the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, for its consideration and approval, so as to be
an original State Party of the Convention," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang called the issue of abandoned chemical weapons "one of
the major concerns of China," since the large quantities of
chemical weapons abandoned on China's territories at the end of
World War II are "still posing a grave threat to the lives and
properties of the Chinese people and to our environment."
</P>
<P>
He stated: "We strongly demand the country concerned to face up
to the reality of abandoned chemical weapons, undertake full
responsibility for destruction of these abandoned weapons."
</P>
<P>
The convention prohibiting the development, production,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons will enter into force on
April 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which has already been signed by 160 countries
and now ratified by 66 countries, is slated to enter into force
180 days after the 65th ratification.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will
be formally established in May next year at an international
conference in The Hague, to be attended by all original state
parties of the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Immigrant Workers' Role in Asia's Development (1) by Sun Baoyu, Zhang Fang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Immigrant workers in Asia
play an important role in the region's sustained and rapid
economic growth, but also give rise to a host of social problems.
</P>
<P>
The huge immigrant workforce, estimated at 5 million in East
and Southeast Asia, contributes to the advancement of both the
recipient economies with much-needed labor and the suppliers with
enormous sums of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The labor flow has been changing its course over the past few
years, shifting from the traditional destinations of Japan and
Singapore to new emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia now has the largest immigrant workforce in the region
due to an acute labor shortage under its booming economy that has
already engulfed almost all of its 8.7 million domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, the number of
foreign laborers in Malaysia has hit 2 million, mostly working in
plantations and factories and on construction sites.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Malaysian government launched legal
registration of all immigrant workers coming to the country before
July 10 to help meet the growing demands for manpower.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, formerly a major supplier of manpower, now finds
itself in severe want of labor. According to the Thai Employer
Association, the country is currently short of 1.36 million
workers, mainly in farming, fishing, building, mining,
transportation and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
To help ease the severe labor shortage, the Thai government has
agreed to allow a two-year employment term for some 700,000
illegal immigrants who entered the country before June 25 this
year.
</P>
<P>
In Asia's industrial giant of Japan, economic growth and an
aging population have led to an increasing reliance on immigrant
workers in such sectors as construction and shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the number of immigrant workers in Japan
at 1 million by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Asia's "four small tigers" also owe part of their economic
success to comparatively cheaper foreign labor, with 350,000
immigrant workers now working in Singapore, 240,000 in Taiwan,
175,000 in Hong Kong and over 100,000 in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The region's major labor suppliers are the Philippines,
Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which see labor exports as a
good way to increase employment, improve people's welfare and
boost foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Remittances by overseas workers have been a principal source of
foreign exchange for the Philippines ever since the 1970s when the
government started to encourage Filipinos to take up employment
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Filipino workers remitted a total of 4.9 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995 and the Philippine Central Bank expects the figure
to hit a record 7 billion U.S. dollar mark this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that some 4.2 million Filipinos are
now working in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and North
America. They are hailed as "national heroes" by President Fidel
Ramos and get red-carpet reception at the airport when returning
home for holidays.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, the Ministry of Labor and Manpower coordinates
matters relating to workers abroad and the state-run banks have
granted loans since 1993 to those who apply for overseas jobs but
cannot afford fees for legal papers and plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.25 billion U.S. dollars are remitted to Bangladesh
annually by some 200,000 overseas Bangladeshis working in the Gulf
countries, Malaysia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Labor exports are also growing steadily in Indonesia and Sri
Lanka, which fill a total of 770,000 jobs in the Middle East
alone.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Immigrant Workers' Role in Asia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian countries
received 75 billion U.S. dollars through recorded remittances by
overseas workers in 1995, compared with 54 billion U.S. dollars
through official foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people in Asia's under-developed
countries are attracted to better pays in foreign lands, and some
of them circumvent the legal route to avoid the long wait for work
permits and the heavy commission charged by agents.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Bangladeshis are believed to have crossed the
border illegally into the jungles in Thailand in the last two
years, waiting for opportunities to enter Malaysia and find jobs
there.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia have been
deporting thousands of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh annually
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times of Singapore reported that Singapore police
arrested 3,119 foreigners for entering or remaining in the country
illegally in the first half of this year, as against 2,492 in the
corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, over 4,600 illegal workers were prosecuted last
year.
</P>
<P>
More alarming figures have been reported from Malaysia and
Thailand. According to official sources, more than half of the 2
million immigrant workers now in Malaysia entered the country
illegally, while at least 700,000 are staying in Thailand without
valid papers.
</P>
<P>
Significant as their contribution is to local economies,
immigrant workers, especially the illegal ones, are often blamed
for rising social tensions and crimes.
</P>
<P>
Reports of immigrant-related violence, including murders,
robberies, and rapes, are frequently seen on newspapers in
Malaysia and Singapore. More than 900 foreign workers were
arrested on criminal charges in Singapore in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Friction over the handling of immigrant-related cases sometimes
escalates into state-to-state estrangement.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, Filipino housemaid Flor Contemplacion was hanged
in Singapore on charges of murdering another Filipino maid and a
four-year-old Singapore boy, which led to a suspension of
diplomatic relations between Manila and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Numerous studies have pointed out that immigrant workers, women
workers in particular, are the most vulnerable to abuse. They are
made to endure long work hours, insufficient sleep and food, no
holidays or days off, non-payment of wages, and verbal, physical
or sexual abuses.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Philippines' Overseas Workers
Welfare Administration, at least 700 overseas Filipino workers
have died in foreign countries this year.
</P>
<P>
The International Labor Organization has called for cooperation
among states to strictly abide by laws and regulations on
immigration and safeguard lawful rights of overseas workers. It
has also urged governments to take efficient steps to check
illegal immigration.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Urges End to Talks of War in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian senior official has
reaffirmed Egypt's determination to pursue the Mideast peace
process and urged an end to the talks of war in the Mideast
region.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture delivered Sunday night at the Cairo-based Judges
Club, President Hosni Mubarak's Political Adviser Osama al-Baz
pointed out that when Egypt initiated peace in 1977, it became
clear to all Arabs and Israel that peace is the best means to
achieve security and stability for all parties in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Any talk about war is nothing but a foiled attempt to extort
the Arabs," he was quoted as saying today by the Egyptian MENA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We will go ahead with the peace process because it is a
strategic objective opted for by all parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
No Arab country is thinking of waging war against Israel, he
said, stressing that the Arab leaders chose peace as a strategic
option during their Cairo Summit on June 23,
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue the peace process on the basis of right,
justice, the Madrid conference credibility and the land-for-peace
principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied claims that Syria and Israel have mustered forces in
preparation for military operations against each other. "Eruption
of a new war between Syria and Israel is not put in
account.... Such talks only cast doubt over the entire peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
What really happened is that each of these two parties held
its annual military drills to preserve its defense capability,
said the Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has been following the peace agreement with
Israel, is able to analyze the Israeli community, he said. "Not
all of it is made up of extremists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with the
Jewish state in 1979 but relationship has remained cool.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries strained after Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's hard-line government took power in
June and the Mideast peace process was stalemated.

<HEADLINE> French Central Bank Lowers Two Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The French central bank, Bank of
France, today lowered its two key interest rates, as the franc is
gaining ground against the German mark after the European Union
countries signed the budgetary stability pact last weekend.
</P>
<P>
For the next five to 10 days, the tender rate, or paying rate,
is lowered by 0.05 points down to 3.15 percent. And the ceiling
rate, or borrowing rate, is lowered by 0.15 points down to 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the French central bank is lowering its key
rates regardless of the decision made by the Deustch Bundesbank
(the German central bank) in August on freezing all key interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank announced today that it would keep its tender
rate at 3 percent for the next 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank will announce its 1997 policy later
today, which is expected to be extremely cautious about interest
rates as the French government has vowed to maintain the
franc-mark parity.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Germany are troubled by high unemployment rate,
while both of them are strictly controlling public spending to
prepare for the launching of the European single currency in
1999.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Strategy for Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Improved product quality will
play a vital role in the development of China's foreign trade, as
part of the ongoing effort to change the country's economic system
and growth mode, a senior Chinese government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on foreign trade and
economic cooperation, Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (Moftec), said that foreign trade companies
must pay closer attention to their economic returns and social
effects.
</P>
<P>
She noted that such enterprises must improve their efficiency
by promoting the joining of forces among them and enhancing their
competitiveness on the global market.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the foreign trade sector can work together when
exploring the world market, and can also line up with businesses
from other sectors, such as industry, construction, agriculture
and finance, she noted.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its strategy to seek a diversified market
for exporters. Great efforts will be made to explore new markets
for Chinese products in the coming years, while at the same time
consolidating and expanding the present market shares.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the products and services provided by Chinese
exporters is also critical for winning a good reputation among
customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will continue its efforts to bring order to
the foreign trade sector: anyone that has conducted illegal
business activities will be punished, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to those attending the meeting, Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing expressed his concerns about the sound development of
foreign trade, and also about the protection of rights and
interests of those Chinese who are providing labor services
abroad.

<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China will explore new ways to
enhance cooperation with South Korea so as to push the bilateral
economic and trade relations to a new height, visiting Chinese
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception hosted by Kim Sang-ha, president of the
Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Zou said that South Korea

will benefit from the further expansion of their economic and
trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Zou arrived here Monday for a week-long official visit at the
invitation of South Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Finance and
Economy Board Minister, Han Seung-soo.
</P>
<P>
Developing good-neighborly relations is not only in the
fundamental interests of the two countries but also benefits peace
and stability of the Asian region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Great progress has been made in Sino-South Korean relations,
particularly in the economic and trade fields, since they
established diplomatic ties in August 1992, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Zou expressed the hope that South Korean firms will increase
investment in China and promote economic and trade ties with
China's central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the South Korean economic community is encouraged by
the support of the Chinese government in developing the economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that such cooperation will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam also met with the visiting
Chinese vice-premier this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Likely to Return to Kremlin Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will remain in the Rus residence outside Moscow until the end of
this week and may return to the Kremlin next week, said his
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing in the Kremlin this afternoon,
Yastrzhembsky described the process of Yeltsin's recuperation
after his heart operation as "going with a swing."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin underwent a heart by-pass surgery on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Outlining Yeltsin's daily timetable, the spokesman said the
president gets up at six or seven o'clock in the morning and works
with mail twice a day, which takes four or more hours.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin spends four or six hours a day outdoors and frequents a
swimming-pool and "a moderate sauna," he said, adding that the
president also often watches TV programs.
</P>
<P>
A schedule for Yeltsin's trips across the country and abroad

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Not Held Responsible for Rocket Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese Foreign Ministry
statement issued this afternoon said that the five-nation
committee monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli
border "did not hold Lebanon responsible" for a Katyusha rocket
fired on northern Israel last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement commenting on the outcome of a Monday meeting of
the cease-fire monitoring committee, said that "the committee did
not adopt Israel's request to hold Lebanon responsible" for the
offensive.
</P>
<P>
It said that the decision and the press statement issued by
the committee after considering an Israeli complaint against
Lebanon "do not include any content of this kind, unlike what has
been reported by Israel's media."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this morning, the committee, grouping
France, the United States, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, confirmed
that at least one Katyusha rocket had been fired into the
Galilee panhandle in northern Israel last Friday.
</P>
<P>
It did affirm that the event "violated" an April cease-fire
understanding, which bars any crossing-frontier attack on Jewish
settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged all the parties concerned "to take
suitable measures" in order to avoid repetition of this kind of
operation.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued following the Monday meeting in the
headquarters of the U.N. peace-keeping force in the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura. The meeting lasted from 11:00
a.m. (09:00 GMT) to 10:00 p.m. (20:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At an Israeli request, the committee met to consider an
Israeli complaint that three Katyusha rockets were fired from
Qlaileh area in south Lebanon in violation of the cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Lebanese delegation said that the meeting in
the Lebanese Mediterranean town, 140 kilometers south of Beirut
and only two kilometers north of the Israeli border, witnessed a
heated debate between the Lebanese and Syrian delegates on the
one hand and the Israeli team on the other.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis showed the committee fragments of Katyusha
rockets that allegedly struck western Galilee in the offensive
and pictures of a goat and a wolf supposedly killed in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Arab group argued that even if the Katyusha rocket was
fired, Israel was not justified to lodge the complaint because
there were no civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee was established under the
April understanding in order to look into complaints in case
civilians on either side of the border were targeted in military
operations.
</P>
<P>
"The committee also noticed Lebanon's confirmation of its
commitment to the April understanding, and its promise to exert
efforts to respect the understanding's articles," the Lebanese
foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the committee "regarded this commitment as
sufficiently complied with by the (Lebanese) government, and did
not adopt the Israeli demand asking Lebanon to take additional
measures."
</P>
<P>
This was the seventh meeting of the committee since it was set
up in August under the cease-fire understanding, which, brokered
by the United States, ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in April in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the previous meeting last week, the committee deplored the
Jewish state's bombardment at south Lebanese villages, in which
six civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, as well as
Palestinian guerrilla groups, which have fighters operating in
south Lebanon, have denied any link with the Friday Katyusha
attack.

<HEADLINE> EU Accuses France of Infringing Upon Free Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
threatened Monday to take France to court for violating one of the
EU's basic principles -- the right of its citizens to choose to
settle in any of the 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
France has been accused by the European Commission (EC) of
imposing too much red tape on EU citizens seeking to live in
France and refusing visas to family members of EU citizens. The EU
executive agency has also accused Paris of expelling a Belgian
citizen without due cause.
</P>
<P>
Many local authorities in France force EU citizens to go
through a series of costly administrative steps, including
obtaining official translation of birth certificates into French,
to get a residency permit, said the EC.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that it would bring the case to the European Court
of Justice if it could not receive a "satisfactory" reply.
</P>
<P>
EC Commissioner Mario Monti said that "member states must not
impose excessive formalities" on people who "exercise their right
to free movement."
</P>
<P>
The EU law rules that residency should be granted on the
presentation of a valid passport or identity card.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Fathers Put Children at Risk of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Fathers who smoke before their
children are born may be putting them at risk of cancer as they
grow up, said a study published today in The British Journal of
Cancer.
</P>
<P>
It said smoking can cause genetic changes to men's sperm,
resulting in the development of cancer in children born from the
"faulty" sperm.
</P>
<P>
The study by Dr. Tom Sorahan of the Institute of Occupational
Health at Birmingham University said that nearly one childhood
cancer in six could have been caused by fathers-to-be damaging
their sperm by smoking.
</P>
<P>
The study compared the smoking habits of more than 1,500
parents whose children died of cancer with those of a similar
number of parents of healthy children.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sorahan said fathers who smoked fewer than 10
cigarettes a day had a three percent extra risk - above that of
non-smoking fathers - that their children would develop cancer.
The extra risk rose to 31 percent for those smoking more than 20
cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on 1950s data when cigarettes had a much
higher tar content than at present, which could affect its
accuracy.

MOGADISHU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Faction soldiers in North
Mogadishu, led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed, joined the clan fighting in
South Mogadishu for the first time this morning since August as
the clashes entered the fifth day today.
</P>
<P>
They fired artillery shells at the residence of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and his other key militia positions including the
former air base of Afisiyone in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi's involvement in the fighting in South Mogadishu was
aimed at assisting Osman Ali Atto and Muse Sudi Yalahow's defense
against attacks by Aidid's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We'll stop the shelling when Hussein Aidid halts his
aggression against the civilians in Medina," said Ali Mahdi's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In response, Aidid's men also launched a few mortar rounds
into North Mogadishu. Two rounds of mortar were landed at the
populated neighborhood of Manapolio, killing two people and
wounding seven others, according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no ground attacks between the
militiamen of Hussein Aidid and those of Atto and Yalahow in the
Medina region, South Mogadishu, even though the scale of the
fighting is broadening.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shooting would still be heard from Medina throughout
the day.

<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has appealed for more than 7.7
million U.S. dollars to fund the rehabilitation projects for up to
140,000 Somalian refugees, a UNHCR spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokeswoman Pam O'Toole told a press briefing that these
refugees "are expected to return to Somalia in the coming year."
</P>
<P>
She said UNHCR will be responsible for overseeing reintegration
projects, such as creating income-generating projects and other
facilities designed to reduce the vulnerabilities of refugees.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the United Nations made a joint inter-agency appeal
for Somalia, covering the period from October 1996 through
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The appeal contains two separate parts, one calling for 46.5
million U.S. dollars for U.N. agencies' joint actions, and the
other requesting 54 million U.S. dollars for a single
U.N. agency's separate actions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations urged the donors to provide generous support
for the vulnerable population and to protect the vital gains that
had been achieved through the efforts of U.N. agencies and their
international and national humanitarian partners in Somalia in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was jointly made by U.N. Development Program, the
UNHCR, the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Fund for

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Huge Potential in Boosting Overseas Labor Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade minister Wu Yi
today predicted there is huge potential for expanding China's
overseas labor service, despite the country's one percent share of
the world's total labor export.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has made great achievements in its foreign
economic cooperation, yet its companies' share in the
international market is quite small, and their business in
overseas engineering contracting is even behind some developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the opening of a national working conference
on foreign economic cooperation that in 1995, China shared only
1.4 percent of the world market of engineering contracting and
labor service, which, she said, does not reflect China's position
as the world's most populated nation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she said, the rapid growth of the overseas
engineering contracting and labor service over the past decade has
laid a solid foundation for its further development in the future.
</P>
<P>
China had only several companies involved in small-scale
overseas engineering contracting and labor service; now a total of
over 650 enterprises have been licensed to conduct overseas
engineering contracting and labor service. Four hundred of them
mainly deal with labor export.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign economic cooperation has grown to include the
fields of oil, chemical industry, railways, ports, airports, power
plants, agriculture and water conservation, Wu said. And in recent
years, it has been expanded to some high-tech areas such as design
and use of computer software, engineering design and consultation,
project supervision, peaceful use of nuclear power and satellite
launching.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of October, China had signed
contracts for overseas engineering and labor service totalling
57.2 billion US dollars, with a turnover of 37.5 billion US
dollars, and more than 1.27 million people have been sent to over
180 countries and regions in different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said in a congratulatory letter to the
conference that the companies involved in overseas engineering
contracting and labor service should bring their business to a new
high by strictly observing three strategies: comprehensively
developing foreign trade and economic cooperation, winning through
quality, and emphasizing market pluralism.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Li also said that the legal rights and interests
of the people sent abroad to conduct labor services should be
fully protected.

<HEADLINE> Famine Unleashes Big Human Exodus in Eastern Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A drought-caused famine has
triggered a mass exodus in eastern Niger, but the number of
famine-stricken people remains unclear, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted sources in Niger as
saying that people have been on the move to flee starvation from
the Zinder Department, 750 kilometers east of capital Niamey.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted officials in charge of farming as saying that some
villages in the northern part of Zinder had "a nil cereal
production" this year.
</P>
<P>
"The primary movements (of exodus) observed in these areas have
been going on for several weeks, as the primary sowings did not
survive the drought," an official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that famine is focused on the Tanout region which
has a population of 250,000 and where cereal production is 10,000
tons short of need this season.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Agriculture of Niger, Boukari Adji, last week
called on the international community to provide 118,000 tons of
emergency food to Niger, because two million people, nearly one
quarter of the country's 8.5 million population, are threatened by
famine.
</P>
<P>
The famine-stricken people are heading toward other parts of
the country, as well as neighboring Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire and
Ghana, said reports.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian mass
organization in Jerusalem warned today that the daily increasing
settlement activities are killing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement available here, the Islamic National Committee
to Protest against Settlements in Jerusalem said the Israeli
government's plan to build a new Jewish compound in the Arab East
Jerusalem is a further violation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The statement listed a series of major Israeli violations
regarding the agreement which include long delays in releasing
Palestinian detainees, continual closure of the Palestinian
autonomous areas, the refusal to implement issues regarding the
safe passage and the deadlock surrounding the redeployment of
troops from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the current Israeli government opened a tunnel
underneath Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem which resulted in a
circle of violence last September," added the document.
</P>
<P>
"This blatant disregard for the peace agreement, and all
involved with it, contribute to bringing the whole region to the
fringe of explosion," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's deeds will "annihilate the hope for a
just and comprehensive peace for all the peoples of this area,"
the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic organization announced that a sit-in will be held
in Ras El-Amoud Friday to protest against this most recent act of
provocation.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the Arab states, the European Union, Russia and
the United States to condemn settlement expansion and put
pressure on the Israeli government to withdraw from this latest plan.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged in conclusion the U.N. Security Council to
denounce this action and demanded that the Israeli government
stop its policy of building and expanding settlements in the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Australian Beef Exports Reported to Be Subdued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Australian beef
would remain subdued at 728,000 tons, worth 2 billion Australian
dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996-97 due to consumer
concerns about food safety, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural
and Resource Economics (ABARE) said today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier ABARE predictions put beef exports at 765,000 tons
worth 2.23 billion Australian dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars)
for the year.
</P>
<P>
Beef consumption in Japan has been dampened by the madcow
disease and "as a result, beef imports declined sharply between
July and September," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
But, it said, there are signs that consumer demand for beef is
beginning to recover with the start of winter. Demand for chilled
beef is rising gradually as wholesalers try to meet the shortfall
created by low imports in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also predicted a 1.7-percent increase in slaughtering to
almost 8 million head, despite a recent fall.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. beef production is also expected to go up by 2
percent in 1997, which would lead to a fall in Australia's beef
exports to the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has not asked any
third party to act as a mediator for the release of the Kuwaiti
prisoners of war detained in Iraq, said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "Assiassa" today quoted Deil el Anzi, chairman
of Kuwait's National Commission for the Prisoners of War (POW)
Affairs, as turning down the reports about a third party's
mediation as "mere baseless hearsay."
</P>
<P>
Some Arab newspapers have reported that a number of Arab
parliamentary personalities are planning to visit Iraq and Kuwait
to help solve the POW issue and redress ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a quick response, Kuwait called for the execution by Iraq of
relevant U.N. resolutions, which, among other issues, call for
release of POWs, as the first step before the bilateral
relationship is discussed.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 prisoners of war and hostages holding both the
Kuwaiti and other nationalities, have been detained by Iraq since
the Gulf war of 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Meets Liberian Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The current visit of the
vice-chairman of Liberia's Council of State, Alhaji Kromah, will
further Sino-Liberian ties, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Kromah here this afternoon, Qian said there
is a traditional friendship between the Chinese and Liberian
peoples, and that China views the bilateral friendship and
cooperation as highly important.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the diplomatic ties between China and
Liberia in 1993 was the common desire of the two peoples, and was
in the interests of both, he said. And the Chinese government
thanked the Liberian government for its persistence in the "one
China" position, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the positive development of bilateral
exchanges and cooperation has been evident, thanks to the joint
efforts of the two countries, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that Kromah's China trip -- the first by a
Liberian top leader after the restoration of diplomatic ties
between the two countries -- will "play an important role in
deepening their mutual understanding and enhancing the growth of
bilateral friendship."
</P>
<P>
In regard to Liberia's peace process, Qian said the Chinese
government and people show great sympathy to the Liberian people
for their suffering from the war.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has all along backed Liberia's peace
process, he pointed out, and will continue to make its due
contribution in this area.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see this process entering into an important
phase," the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the Chinese government sincerely hopes that all
parties concerned will give priority to national interests, and
try to achieve the country's peace and stability as soon as
possible with the help from the international community and within
the framework of the related peace pacts.
</P>
<P>
He said China also hopes the parties will work to develop the
national economy and rebuild the country.

As for the situation in Africa, Qian said, the African nations
are actively devoted to political stablization and economic
growth. "We hope they will realize the stability and development
of the continent by strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and
properly solving the problems before them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China emphasizes cultivating and strengthening ties
with African countries, and is willing to conduct friendly
cooperation in various fields on the basis of the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
Kromah said Liberia's Council of State in return stresses its
relations with China, and hopes to frankly exchange views on
consolidating bilateral friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian people appreciate China's sincere assistance to
their country, according to Kromah.
</P>

All the parties in Liberia are disarming, he said, when
briefing the Chinese foreign minister on Liberia's internal
situation. Liberia has entered an important transitional period
from conflict to peace, he said.

and assistance to Liberia's peace process.

<HEADLINE> Smooth Reform on Localizing Colleges, Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China is making progress in
localizing the management and operation of colleges and
universities affiliated to government ministries.
</P>
<P>
Over three-quarters of the 34 colleges and universities
affiliated with the State Education Commission (SEC) are now
jointly sponsored by the SEC and local governments.
</P>
<P>
A new framework has by and large been formed under which the
SEC, local governments, and other departments cooperate for the
management and operation of schools.
</P>
<P>
The reform underlines the guiding principle of encouraging
colleges and universities to serve local economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
By transferring part of the management over higher education
institutions from ministries to local governments, colleges and
universities have become more positively involved in local
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Fudan University, one of China's most prestigeous universities,
based in Shanghai, was formerly affiliated to the SEC. After being
jointly managed by the SEC and Shanghai Municipal Government, it
decided to serve Shanghai and promote self-development according
to the strategy of constructing Shanghai as a center of
international economy, finance and trade.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing University located in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, also decided to improve its cooperative relations with
local large enterprises and the Three Gorges economic zone along
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Since the SEC started the reform in 1993, 26 colleges and
universities have been transferred to co-management. Such
co-management has resulted in more professionals being trained for
local development and has also provided more funds for further
growth of the colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have invested some 439 million yuan (nearly
53 million U.S. dollars) supporting co-management reform from 1994
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 62.6 percent of all students enrolled by
co-managed colleges and universities this year are from the
colleges' local areas. Nearly half of all graduates from the
colleges and universities this summer chose to work in the places
where they received their higher education.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored colleges and universities received more funds
from local governments to undertake local scientific research
work. These colleges and universities had accepted 2,875 research
topics, with 210 million yuan (about 25.3 million U.S. dollars) of
research funding, by the end of this June.
</P>
<P>
Some of the colleges and universities devoted studies on major
issues related to the economy, politics, culture, environment,
population and society, in order to provide local governments with
more scientific advice.
</P>
<P>
SEC officials and heads of SEC-affiliated colleges and
universities who attended a recent consultative meeting agreed
that the reform of the management system of higher education
institutions, a key but tough task, has made positive progress
based on four-year experiment.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1,057 colleges and universities
nation-wide. About one third of them are under the direct
jurisdiction of various ministries. The trend is to let the
universities gradually be co-managed by local governments.

<HEADLINE> Tung: Provisional Legislature Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the
newly-elected Chief Executive designate of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said today that it is wrong for
Britain and the Hong Kong Government to ignore the reality of the
provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
"For the long-term interests of Hong Kong, I urge them to face
the reality and work together constructively," Tung said this
afternoon when addressing representatives from major chambers of
commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the current legislature which began its
operation in September 1995 will have to come to an end on June
30, 1997. As election for the first legislature of the HKSAR
cannot be held before June 30, 1997, in Hong Kong, and as Hong
Kong cannot operate in a legal vacuum on July 1, 1997, there is a
need for the provisional legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lingering doubt as to the legality of the
provisional legislature. I believe it is legal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes the members of the Selection Committee
will go about their responsibility in a dedicated, careful and
meticulous manner in choosing members of the provisional
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the members of the provisional legislature will have
a high degree of credibility," he stressed.

</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Chinese delegation held talks with

which will alleviate the sufferings of Iraqis living under more
than six years of U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit, which he described as successful, has
enhanced the mutual understanding between youth organizations of
China and Iraq and deepened the traditional friendship between
the youth of the two countries.
</P>
<P>

further exchange and cooperation in the fields of science and
technology, trade and medical care between the youth of the two

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Share Same Vision, Charette Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that France and the United States share "the
same vision of the future" despite their differences over some
minor issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have the same vision of the world. I am convinced that the
French government and the American government, that President Bill
Clinton and President Jacques Chirac share the same vision of the
future," said de Charette in an interview with the CNN.
</P>
<P>
The French minister paid a visit to Washington on Monday to
appease U.S. fury over his alleged slighting of U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher during the NATO foreign ministers'
meeting last week in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"There can be sometimes some different judgments over this or
that subject, but no more," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Franco-American dispute over the Naples-based NATO South
Command, de Charette reiterated that it is not France but Europe
that wants to take over the seat of the regional command.
</P>
<P>
The discord came to a head in Brussels when U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry said that an American will continue to
assume command of NATO's southern command.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be clear on this point. We think that if the two
strategic commands of NATO are in the hands of Americans, the two
European commands of the organization should be led by European
officers. European, not French," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other European regional command of NATO is the
Netherlands-based Central Command.
</P>
<P>
He again suggested that the U.S. Sixth Fleet, which is part of
the South Command, withdraw from NATO structure.
</P>
<P>
"We don't ask for the command of the Sixth Fleet. The Sixth
Fleet is American. It is very important in the system of NATO for
the forces of the alliances in Mediterranean, but equally
(important) for the American strategic interests in the
Mediterranean," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa today called
on Hong Kong people to work together to create a caring society
with a strong social fabric, a prosperous society with
opportunities for all and a proud society with a global outlook
that will play its part as China moves to the center stage in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Tung, newly-elected Chief Executive designate of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), made the remarks
in a speech to representatives of Hong Kong's major chambers of
commerce this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He urged Hong Kong people to be as confident as he is about
Hong Kong's future. "I do not underestimate the difficult tasks
and the many challenges ahead," but "I am very confident of Hong
Kong's future".
</P>
<P>
He said that July 1, 1997 symbolizes the beginning of a new
era for Hong Kong, from which day the destiny of Hong Kong people
will fall back onto themselves and they must create their own path.
For the HKSAR, the first year bears special importance.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure the smooth transition of the civil service. We
must uphold the principle of meritocracy. We must not let the
corruption creep into our dedicated and efficient civil service,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the freedoms all Hong Kong citizens have
enjoyed must be preserved. In the pursuit of this freedom, "We
must be mindful and sensitive to our sovereign's aspirations in
the international arena and be particularly sensitive to the
feeling of the Chinese people in areas of sovereignty and territorial
integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to maintain the current legal and
administrative structure by continuing the rule of law, the
independence of the judiciary and the underlying principles of
fair play.
</P>
<P>
"We must assure overseas businesses that the free, fair,
enabling and encouraging economic environment will be maintained;
that social, political, and economic stability will prevail; and
that Hong Kong sets its sights on becoming an even more dynamic
city.
</P>
<P>
"We must increase public confidence in Hong Kong by resolutely
upholding the principles of 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong' with a 'high degree of autonomy'
as provided for in the Basic Law," he said.
</P>
<P>
A keen sense of togetherness, common objectives and a sense of
belonging to Hong Kong must be promoted, he said, adding that
social and political stability during the transition period is
crucial to Hong Kong's success.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Hong Kong people to promote greater
communication between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland at all
levels in order to create a multi-layer relationship characterized
by mutual trust, shared economic benefits, close cultural ties,
respect for each other's way of life and a commitment to the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Tung will fly to Beijing this afternoon to accept his official
appointment by the central government as Hong Kong's
Chief Executive Designate.

<HEADLINE> China Interpol Chief Confident of HK's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The visiting China Interpol
chief today expressed confidence in Hong Kong's smooth transition
and its prosperity and stability, while assuring closer
cooperation between the inland and Hong Kong police after Hong
Kong returns to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Entao, head of China's National Central Bureau of the
International Police Organization (Interpol), made the remarks
after meeting with Eddie Hui Ki-on, Hong Kong's police
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The two officials reviewed the crimes situation in both the
inland and Hong Kong, cooperation between the two in combating
organized crimes, drug trafficking and economic or commercial crimes
and other questions at the 24th working meeting between the
inland and Hong Kong police within the framework of Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Public order throughout China's mainland, including Guangdong
Province which borders on Hong Kong, greatly improved in the first
10 months of this year thanks to the "Strike Hard" campaign, said
Zhu, who is also assistant minister of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of crimes went down by some two percent
over last year, the first decline in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong which is known as a secure city, crimes
also recorded a sharp decrease of 13 percent, according to Hui.
</P>
<P>
On organized crimes, Zhu reiterated that the Chinese mainland
will never allow criminal organizations to recruit members or
commit offenses on its territory, nor will it become a shelter for
those organizations based in either Hong Kong or Macao.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say the inland and Hong Kong will join hands
in combating narcotics offences and cross-border crimes in an
effort to create a good public order for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Twenty suspects wanted by Hong Kong police were returned to
Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hailed as effective by both sides, has been held
twice a year in Hong Kong and Beijing alternately since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong police, now a branch of Britain's National Central
Bureau of Interpol, will become a branch of China's National
Central Bureau of Interpol in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Both sides foresaw closer links in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover and
pledged enhanced exchanges in such fields as rapid reaction,
intelligence and staff training.

<HEADLINE> Acupuncture Works with Over 1,000-Year History Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have
discovered the earliest ever medical works on acupuncture and
moxibustion.
</P>
<P>
The rare volumes, compiled more than 1,000 years ago, detail
acupuncture points on the human body and outline treatment regimes
for various illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts made their discovery during detailed studies of
volumes from the Dunhuang collection. They have identified four
Chinese character and two Tibetan language ancient acupuncture and
moxibustion books among the Dunhuang works that are kept in
foreign museums.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered more than 70 ancient medical books
covering acupuncture and moxibustion therapy.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the books were written at least 1,000 years ago,
and are the earliest Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion books
ever found.
</P>

Province, dating from 366 A.D., was unearthed in 1990 and more
than 40,000 books of the total 50,000 books found there are now
kept abroad.
</P>
<P>
The latest discovery was made after research on microfilms of
some of the Dunhuang works preserved in British and French museums.
</P>
<P>
The "Charts of Jing Points" and anther moxibustion book were
written during Tang Dynasty (618 to 907 A.D.). The two books
described. with charts the acupoints, disease cases and treatment
methods.
</P>
<P>
The two Tibetan language books, written in mid-eighth century,
are China's earliest acupuncture and moxibustion prescription
books. They introduced 70 prescriptions to allow people to know
the acupoints and ways of treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to history records, acupuncture and moxibustion were
both popular early in China in the fifth and sixth century. The
Dunhuang acupuncture books mentioned more than 140 acupoints which
were used for treating some 70 different diseases.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts have successfully duplicated the Charts of Jing
points and are ready to use 10 acupoints chosen from the book in
clinical use.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Export Natural Gas to Turkey Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will start exporting
natural gas to Turkey next month under a 4 billion U.S. dollars
deal signed during the Cairo Economic Conference on November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be co-financed by Egypt and the United States,
was contracted by the Egyptian Petroleum Authority and two giant
Turkish and U.S. petroleum companies last month.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi el-Banbi told the United
Arab Emirates Al-Itihad newspaper that the project includes
program for developing natural gas fields in Egypt and
establishing two factories for refining and liquidifying natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
The first one will be Egyptian-Turkish and the other
Turkish-American, he said in the interview published by today's
Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The project will open international markets for the Egyptian
natural gas and will benefit the treasury by more than 500 million
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that Egypt received many proposals
for exporting natural gas to many countries, topped by Italy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Banbi ruled out any cooperation between Egypt and
Israel in the natural gas and petrochemicals fields, saying that
Israel has not yet developed its petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 11.6
trillion cubic feet, while its gas pipeline has covered about
2,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Young Drug Abusers Reported in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of young drug
abusers in Hong Kong decreased by 11 percent in the third quarter
of 1996 from a year earlier, as shown in government statistics
released here today.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,263 reported drug abusers under the age of 21 in
the third quarter this year, compared with 1,428 during the same
period of 1995, according to figures compiled by the Central
Registry of Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
Reported drug abusers under 21 accounted for less than 1.5 per
thousand of the young population in Hong Kong. The Action
Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) stressed that the government
should continue to campaign vigorously though drug abuse among the
 young people has shown a downward tendency since the beginning of
 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure for reported drug abusers of all ages edged up 0.3
percent to 7,409 in the third quarter this year over the same
period of 1995, while the number of newly reported cases fell by
almost four percent to 413.
</P>
<P>
About nine out of ten drug abusers in Hong Kong use heroin.
Cannabis, cough medicine and "ice" are also the major types of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1996, more than 4,100 persons were
admitted to the three government-funded treatment programs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Benefit Much From Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's rural women have
benefited greatly from the country's reform and opening to the
outside world, an American sociologist has claimed after an
eight-month stay here.
</P>
<P>
Nancy R. Leu from Bowdin College in the state of Miami came to
the conclusion after her visit in the Dalian Development
Zone. More than 1,500 foreign-funded enterprises have been
established in the zone, and 71 percent of the nearly 100,000
workers are women, most of whom are from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
She said that her findings erased the belief of some Americans
that Chinese women are exploited and are targets of prejudice in
the development zones.
</P>
<P>
Leu said that rural women in the Dalian zone receive more
income and enjoy a higher quality of life than their parents. She
said that from a global point of view, Chinese women enjoy a
relatively high social status in their society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set up a national women's
organization and has adopted a series of laws to protect women's
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
In China, she said, women in labor are granted three months'
vacation and can also obtain leaves of absence when their children
are sick.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese women have a long way to go to reach
social equality with men, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Leu said that she will return to the Dalian zone next year to
conduct a survey and travel to the villages where the women
workers live. She said she plans to write a book about Chinese
women who live in development zones.

<HEADLINE> Summit Calls for End to Cross-Border Incursions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Summit on the
Crisis in the Great Lakes Region today urged non-intervention and
an end to cross-border incursions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here after the conclusion of the two-day
meeting, the summit reiterated its commitment to the territorial
integrity of Zaire in accordance with the Charter of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the recent development in the region, the statement
noted that the security situation had deteriorated further since
the last Nairobi summit held on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire in eastern Zaire called for by the November
summit has not been realized, said the statement, adding that the
summit called upon the parties to the conflict to commit
themselves to a negotiated peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, the Banyamulenge Tutsis have
controlled most of eastern Zaire including the main towns of
Goma, Bukavu and Uvira.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government accused Rwanda of supporting the Tutsi
rebels by sending its troops across the border, terming it as
"aggressor". However, Kigali denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that President Mobutu Sese Seko had
assured that the Zairean government recognizes the inalienable
right to citizenship and nationality of all people within Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi considered this assurance as a "significant step in the
search for a lasting solution to the crisis".
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels in eastern Zaire whose ancestors
immigrated from Rwanda took up arms in October, initially to
defend their rights of citizenship, as local officials threatened
to drive them back to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Over 600,000 refugees out of 1.2 million have returned to
Rwanda from Zaire so far and it is said about half of the 500,000
Rwandan refugees have also returned from Tanzania in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
Noting the easing of the refugee problem in eastern Zaire, the
summit still called on the international community to provide
substantial assistance for those refugees who have returned to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Moi, Zimbabwean President Mugabe, South
African President Mandela and President Paul Biya of Cameroun who
is current OAU Chairman, are entrusted to take the necessary
initiatives and steps to end the conflict in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Eritrea, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia and
Ethiopia's Prime Minister, as well as the OAU Secretary General,
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and Cameroun's Foreign
Minister attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Zaire boycotted the summit as it did in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to continue its tourism
promotion campaign among nations and regions in Asia next year.
</P>
<P>
The main targets include Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
an official with the Tourism Office of the Macao Government told
a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
The promotion plan is based on the fact that all those regions
and nations now have regular air flights to Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most tourists to Macao currently are from those
areas.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Macao has established 23 tourism
promotion offices around the world, some of which were built in
cooperation with local agencies.
</P>
<P>
He said that as many overseas people still know little about
Macao, the promotion campaign will focus primarily on popular
tourist attractions, newly-established tourism facilities and new
tourism routes.
</P>
<P>
International events, including annual music festivals,
contests of fireworks and grand prix will remain attractive to
many travelers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to promote the so-called
"conference tourism," designed to attract international
conferences to Macao. Several such meetings were held here earlier
this year.

<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko left his private villa in southeast France this morning for
Kinshasa, reported the Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old president stayed abroad throughout the refugee
crisis in the Kivu region of eastern Zaire over the past two
months. The crisis was caused by a huge exodus of Rwandan Hutu
refugees driven from their camps by the fightings between the
Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairean government forces.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu took one of two DC-8 aircraft rented for his trip back
home after 44 days of sick leave in France following a prostate
cancer operation in Switzerland in August, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from the Cote-d'Azur airport in Nice at
08:50 a.m. local time (07:50 GMT),
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, facing a rebellion in the eastern Zaire and political
chaos in Kinshasa, is expected to broadcast an address to his
nation after he arrives home.
</P>
<P>
Zaire sent no representative to the regional summit on the
Great Lakes crisis in Nairobi today. The meeting charged President
Nelson Mandela of South Africa, President Paul Biya of Cameroon,

<HEADLINE> Macao to Start Large Pleasure Boat Trip on Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to start a large
pleasure boat trip on sea at the end of this month as the number
of tourists coming to Macao are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Dolphine Pleasure Boat Company Ltd. said that it is
scheduled to start the service later this month as the
Guangdong-built boat has arrived in Macao. The company has spent
more than 12 million patacas (about 1.52 million U.S. dollars) in
the boat and its facilities.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to start two services daily in the beginning,
to allow passengers to watch Macao from on sea. The service may
increase to three to four daily in the future.
</P>
<P>
The pleasure boat is 38.5 meters long, 12 meters wide, and 2.7
meters in depth. Its displacement reaches 460 tons. With the
largest passenger capacity of 250 people, it also has such
entertainment as dance and singing, restaurants and Karaoke bars.
</P>
<P>
It will take about two hours to finish the sightseeing trip on
sea, with narration done in three languages -- English, Portuguese
and Chinese, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
Although the service will be the first of its kind in Macao,
the company is optimistic about its business.
</P>
<P>
"If one percent of all the tourists coming to Macao take our
boat, we will be able to recoup the investment in three years'
time," said an executive of the company. "We expect to have nine
months of business a year, considering the time for bad weather
and for maintenance."
</P>
<P>
More than 7.7 million people visited Macao last year. During
the first nine months this year, the number of visitors to Macao
rose 4.6 percent from the same period last year to 6.13 million.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that his company has contacted many travel
agencies in both Hong Kong and Macao, and many have shown an
interest in cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Commodity Exports to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's commodity exports
for 1996-97 will be 800 million Australian dollars (640 million
U.S. dollars) less in value than predicted as world prices
continue to slump, the government's chief economic forecaster said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said the country's commodity exports would be worth 58.9
billion Australian dollars (47.12 billion U.S. dollars) in
1996-97, up 2.5 percent from last season but down from an earlier
prediction of 59.7 billion Australian dollars (47.7 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Compared to quarter forecasts in September, the value of
exports of mineral resources would be down by 662 million
Australian dollars (530 million U.S. dollars), while that of rural
exports would fall by 139 million Australian dollars (111.2
million U.S. dollars), according to ABARE.
</P>
<P>
But the expected value of minerals and energy exports would
remain relatively high at 36.3 billion Australian dollars (29
billion U.S. dollars), up 4.5 percent from last season.
</P>
<P>
Predictions of the value of rural exports were revised
downward, despite an expected bumper wheat harvest. The value of
wheat exports is forecast to fall by around 9 percent in 1996-97
as world prices come back from the high levels of 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Enjoy Strong Social Support: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An influential weekly in
Sierra Leone today claimed that the country's rebel movement, the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), is "the strongest political and
military organization in Sierra Leone today."
</P>
<P>
"RUF supporters are in all political parties. And the
strongest presence is found in the ruling SLPP (Sierra Leone
People's Party) government," said an article entitled "RUF
Supporters in Freetown" carried by the "Expo Times Gazette".
</P>
<P>
The paper said the conclusion was based on "intensive
investigations" carried out by its acting editor Gibril Koroma
who spent a week in Abidjan, neighboring Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the RUF enjoys its strongest support
in the university.
</P>
<P>
"Some lecturers and students formed the first ideological wing
of the RUF. Most of the RUF combatants and spies are former
secondary school pupils and university graduates," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that 24 students who disagreed with Foday Sankoh,
the RUF leader, at the height of the rebel atrocities, were
executed between 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
It added that many trade unionists are active supporters of
the RUF while many buiness people sympathize with it.
</P>
<P>
"The RUF is involved in the diamond business, making it one of
the richest rebel movements in the world," said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, there are "RUF elements" in the army
and "some were even ministers in the former military government."
</P>
<P>
So far there has not been any official reaction to the paper's
story but many Sierra Leoneans said privately that the paper's
account confirmed "a growing suspicion of RUF's contact with many
facets of the society in the country.

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese students
studying abroad have returned to the country's largest city,
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies issued in Shanghai have triggered the
"tide of return to the motherland" among Chinese students studying
abroad, according to the Press Digest.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that 15,000 people have returned to the city
after completing their overseas studies, with the figure seeing a
rapid growth in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who have returned are professional personnel,
according to the press digest.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS)
sent more than 1,000 people to study overseas, the digest reported,
and more than 400 among the total have returned to the motherland
for its social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Most of the returned scholars are aged between 30 and 45 years
old. The digest describes it as the "golden age" for scientific
researches.
</P>
<P>
A large number of them have served as the backbone in the
city's economic construction and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhu, the youngest academician in the CAS, returned to

<HEADLINE> Writers to Follow Deng Xiaoping's Literary Theory: Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping pointed out that to ensure that Marxism plays a
leading role in ideological circles, it is imperative to adhere to
Marxist theory, which is China's ideological motivation; It is
also necessary to seek truth from facts, which is the core of
Marxism, Deng was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The opposition to bourgeois liberalization must be carried out
in the whole process of socialist modernization, just as the
emancipation of the mind, reform and opening up must be adhered to
at the same time. Otherwise, Deng stressed, China would be led
astray to the capitalist path, and the stable political situation
would be disrupted, Deng had also said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also
stressed that socialist culture with Chinese characteristics must
be guided by Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and
multi-polarization in the respect of a guiding principle must be
banned, the work report stated.
</P>
<P>
Zhai stressed that it is most important for the broad masses of
writers and other literary workers to apply Marxism, Leninism, Mao
Zedong Thought and Deng's theory on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics to observing and analyzing the realities,
studying the law governing literary and artistic development,
rejecting influences of erroneous trends of literary and
artistic ideas, and guiding their creative practices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Literary circles in China must
hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of literature and
art for their artistic productions and research, a senior cultural
official said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Taifeng was presenting a report of the Executive Council
of the fourth CWA National Congress to the ongoing Fifth CWA
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics has been a combination of the basic
principles of Marxism and Leninism with Chinese realities and
characteristics of the times, as well as an inheritor and
development of Mao Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
Deng's serves as a guiding principle for the party in doing all
kinds of work, and a "powerful ideological pillar" for the
invigoration of the Chinese nation, he said. He added that Deng's
theory comprises rich ideas on promoting ethical and cultural
progress.
</P>
<P>
Deng's theory on literature and art is also rich in content,
has inherited and further developed Marxist aesthetic principles,
and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic theory which was well
illustrated in his famous speech in Yan'an in 1945, Zhai said.
</P>
<P>
Deng's theory of literature and art should thus serve as a
glamorous banner to unite the broad masses of writers for the
development and flourishing of socialist literature, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the banner of Deng's literary theory is essential
for the literary theoretical building, and the sound, upward and
vigorous development of socialist literature and art, it was
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Writers Stress Importance of People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cultural official
reiterated today that the country's literature and art belongs to
the people.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the Fourth Executive Council of the Chinese
Writers' Association (CWA), CWA Party secretary Zhai Taifeng made
the remarks in a work report to the ongoing CWA fifth national
congress, which opened in Beijing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhai told delegates that it has been stressed in Deng
Xiaoping's arts theories that literature and art should belong to
the people, and writers and artists must stick to the basic
principle of "serving the people and socialism".
</P>
<P>
"As Deng Xiaoping said, literary and art workers should regard
the people as their mother, and the career of all advanced writers
and artists is decided by how intimate are their relations with
the people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"People need art, but art needs the people more. The
fundamental way to prosperity for socialist literary and art
undertakings is to get deeply involved in the lives of people," he
quoted Deng as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that experience has proved that success and popularity
only go to writers who treat the people like a son to his parents,
and who have tried to get the essence of life in their time.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that literary creation is inseparable from the
personal experience and emotion of the writer, but only by linking
personal experience to the people's general feeling and the spirit
of the time can a piece of literary work become rich and full of
passion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see more and more writers today, with a strong
sense of mission, have walked into reality, and are trying to get
acquainted with, and learn from the people as a way to perceive and
grasp the spirit of the time and the soul of the nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that a new era of national prosperity, in
which the entire people are working hard to achieve the
magnificent goal set for the next 15 years, has arrived in China.
</P>
<P>
"What we writers can do for this historic period is to try our
best to support and spread patriotism, collectivism, and socialist
ideas, promote thinking that can benefit the reform, opening up,
and modernization drive, and advocate ideas that are conducive to
national unity, social progress, and people's happiness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our unshirkable responsibility, and will become our
special contribution to the country, to create a number of vivid
images of 'socialist new people', who can live long in the memory
of the people," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Coal Ash Used to Improve Farmland Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province has succeeded in improving large areas of medium and
low-yield farmland by using coal ash.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Biology Institute, under the provincial
Academy of Sciences, and the Guiyang Power Plant, 66 hectares of
farmland soil in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, have been
improved.
</P>
<P>
The per hectare rice yield of ash-treated farmland has risen
from almost 6,000 kg to 9,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
The province suffers from a shortage of sunshine and low
accumulated temperature, with most of farmland characterised as
acid soil which hardens easily, noted a specialist from the
institute.
</P>
<P>
The coal ash has been used as a physical and chemical
activator, loosening and improving the soil. The black color of
the coal ash can helps soil absorb heat energy, raising output.
</P>
<P>
After several years, and with more fertilizer applied, the
structure of the soil will be improved even more, experts say. One
big advantage is that the new technology is pollution-free, the
specialist said.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Growing in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the most popular
tourist destination in China, is expected to have 77 million
domestic tourists and 2.15 million overseas visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism will this year earn the Chinese capital nearly
36 billion yuan, up 7.6 percent from last year. And Beijing is
expected to earn 2.3 billion US dollars in foreign currency from
overseas tourists, the municipal tourism administration predicts.
</P>
<P>
The city's domestic tourism is growing at an annual rate of
five percent, far surpassing overseas tourism, tourism authorities
say. They added that this year overseas tourism falls well behind
domestic tourism, both in terms of the number of tourists and
tourism earnings.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of Beijing's domestic tourists are not
local people, with nearly half of the tourists coming from coastal
or neighbouring provinces, a survey by the tourism administration
shows. This means the development of domestic tourism is closely
connected with economic performance and transportation conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, urban residents account for almost 86
percent of tourists to Beijing, with farmers making up for the
rest. Young people aged between 25 to 44 make up 45 percent, and
the male tourists account for 55 percent of Beijing's tourists.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that famous cultural relics, such as the
Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the Forbidden City, remain the
most attractive tourist attractions in Beijing. Sightseeing is
still the major form of tourism in the capital.

Gao Zhanxiang suggested that in the coming five years, the
federation should do a good job in ten fields. It should build
literature and art contingents who have both high capabilities and
morals, produce more fine works to promote prosperity in
literature and art, manage exemplary literature and art
activities, and set up places where writers and artists can
understand more about life.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the federation should fully display the
guiding role of literary and artistic theory and criticism, make
awards to outstanding literary and artistic works, strengthen the
publication of newspapers and magazines, better protect
intellectual property rights, broaden cultural exchanges both at
home and abroad, and improve the federation's functions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the glorious process of revitalizing the
Chinese nation and promoting the socialist cultural and ethical
progress, literature and art have their unique functions and
charms.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, Chinese writers and artists should create great
works at these great times with more compassion, wisdom and
diligence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged literary and artistic workers to prosper literature
and art under the guidance of the CPC Central Committee's
resolutions to promote ethical and cultural progress, and the
speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the congress's
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this goal, China needs a number of leading writers
and artists who are outstanding politically, professionally and in
their work style," he said, adding that at the same time the
country needs the concerted efforts of large numbers of pioneering
and vigorous literary and artistic workers.
</P>
<P>
The federation, with more than 2.3 million members, is a mass
organization consisting of the country's writers and artists under
the guidance of the CPC, acting as a bridge between the Party,

<HEADLINE> China Shifts in Foreign Students Scholarship Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The rules for awarding
scholarships to foreign students in China are to undergo a
shake-up from January 1st, a Chinese education official announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at ensuring that foreign students are
diligent and abide by China's educational system.
</P>
<P>
It will mean that any foreign students who study in China can
not obtain their scholarship in one go from January 1, 1997, said
the official in charge of the affairs of foreign students here
today.
</P>
<P>
The new system being introduced will mean that the foreign
students' scholarship status would be reviewed on a year-by-year
basis, said Yan Meihua, deputy secretary-general of the China
Scholarship Council (CSC), an educational fund under the State
Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
"The system aims to encourage foreign students to be diligent,
hardworking and abide by the Chinese laws and school rules," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The CSC under the SEC administration will be in charge of the
enrollment and management of overseas students. It plans to
provide 3,000 scholarship opportunities for foreign students for
the 1997-1998 academic year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new method, foreign students who can enjoy
scholarships provided by the Chinese government automatically
receive the scholarship for their first academic year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of each academic year, foreign students enjoying
scholarships must fill out a form for the annual review of foreign
student scholarship status for the renewal of the scholarship for
the following academic year.
</P>
<P>
The school authorities will make evaluations based on foreign
students' study and behavior. The evaluation, once approved by the
CSC and the SEC, will be an essential reference to determine
whether the student can get a scholarship in the next academic
year.
</P>
<P>
"Those who fail to pass exams or violate Chinese laws or school
rules cannot continue to enjoy the scholarship," said Yan.
</P>
<P>
They would then be required to cover the study expenses
themselves. If they make progress in study or behavior during the
year of scholarship suspension, they can resume the application of
the scholarship for the next academic year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign students, if they can enjoy scholarships, used to
receive all their scholarships from the Chinese government at one
time, according to their duration of their complete studies in
China. A foreign student could get scholarships of eight years at
one time if he or she studied medical science in a Chinese college
or university. Those who study for master's or doctor's degrees
would receive scholarships of three or four years.
</P>
<P>
China has provided governmental scholarships for 34,087
students from over 160 countries and regions since 1950s, while
nearly 200,000 foreign students have come to China for further
training at their own expense.

<HEADLINE> Australia Condemns Racist Attack On Malaysian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia must send a message
overseas that racist acts against foreign students would not be
tolerated, the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee (AVCC) said
in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The AVCC condemned recent racist abuse against a Malaysian
student, Adrina Shazlin Shukor, outside a 24-hour shop in
Melbourne, which prompted Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad to warn that he may recall Malaysian students if their
safety is threatened.
</P>
<P>
Calling the incident intolerable, AVCC President Fay Gale said
urged the government to reassure other nations of Australia's
position against racism. "The government has an obligation to show
leadership in this matter," she declared.
</P>
<P>
Federal Education Minister Amanda Vanstone said today that
racist attacks are extremely rare but must be taken seriously and
people who commit racist attacks against foreign students are
criminals and should be condemned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Victoria's Premier Jeff Kennett told reporters in
Melbourne today that he would write to Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir and offer to investigate reports of a Malaysian student
being racially abused.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, a 22-year-old Malaysian student
at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology told reporters in her
home country that she had been racially abused by two Australians
outside a shop, who told her to get out of their country.
</P>
<P>
At least 80,000 Asian students are currently studying in
different universities and colleges in Australia and 11,000 of
them are from Malaysia. The students reportedly bring 2.3 billion
Australian dollars (1.84 billion U.S. dollars) to the country each
year.

<HEADLINE> Crowded Waiting List of Applicants for RMB Trial Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Ten overseas financial
institutions are on the waiting list at the People's Bank of
China's Shanghai branch to handle trial business in RMB yuan, the
Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
"Our bank is now working actively to draft specific rules for
foreign banks to follow, in accordance with the newly-issued
central bank regulations governing the management of trial
business in the RMB yuan," said a banking official at the local
branch of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the awaited rules will govern the reserves ratio that
the foreign banks must keep with the central bank's local branch,
how the banks should join the national inter-bank money market and
abide by local rules on money management and accounting.
</P>
<P>
"We have been redoubling efforts with the preparation work to
help qualified foreign banks win central bank approval up to the
end of this year," added the official.
</P>
<P>
The central bank unveiled a set of rules last Thursday, setting
out criteria for foreign financial institutions to meet in order
to deal with business in local currency, and declaring that
selection work has started with some foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Only foreign banks in the Pudong New Area have been permitted
to apply for trial renminbi business. Those in downtown Shanghai
can only file applications if they move to this emerging
development zone across the Huangpu river, and start another
branch in the downtown area.

<HEADLINE> China to Publish Book Series on Outstanding Overseas Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing the
publication of a major book series featuring the successful
stories of outstanding overseas Chinese, Wang Mengkui, director of
the Research Office of the State Council announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The series, initially planned as five books, will appear as
anecdotes, treatises and profiles, Wang said. The collection is
intended to give people some idea on how overseas Chinese have
contributed to the advances of mankind. It will also provide
material for studying trends in the development of the overseas
Chinese community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that to compile and publish the book series, Yanshi
Publishing House which is affiliated to the Research Office of the
State Council, has set up a special committee.
</P>
<P>
Yu Baozhu, chief of the committee, expressed a wish to get more
such stories from authors overseas, as scripts or as suggestions
about people who should be featured in the series.
</P>
<P>
There are about 50 million overseas Chinese living in different
parts of the world. The majority of overseas investment flowing
into China in the last couple of years has come from overseas
Chinese. They are considered as one of the three largest capital
sources alongside Jewish and Arabian people.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports China's Membership In WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank executive has
pointed to the significance of China's membership in the World
Trade Organization, saying that it is important for both China and
the international trade body.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, head of the World Bank's resident mission in
China, said at an international conference on the WTO and China's
economic and trade development in Beijing today that, "WTO
membership is substantively and symbolically very important for
China and for the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Because the WTO has to deal not only with trade barriers at
countries' borders, but also a broad array of domestic policies
and regulations that influence trade and investment, two important
challenges facing china in the WTO negotiations are how to achieve
more effective coordination inside China and greater transparency
in its protective measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is following China's WTO membership negotiation
process with great interest and is willing to support it with
independent analysis and advice, Bottelier noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the beginning of its economic reforms in
1978, China's share in global trade has increased extremely
rapidly, and China has moved from 33rd to 9th place in world trade
and now accounts for about three percent of total world trade
volume.
</P>
<P>
China has accounted for about six percent of incremental world
trade over the past five years and its foreign trade amounts to
about 40 percent of its gross domestic product, a figure that is
twice as high as India's, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing convertibility of Chinese currency and
further liberalization of external trade and investment, China's
share in world trade is likely to grow, he pointed out, noting
that it is therefore "not surprising that the position of China in
shaping future international economic relations in Asia and in the
world has moved to the center of everybody's attention."
</P>
<P>
China made its yuan (Renminbi) convertible for transactions
under the current account on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, told the Canadian Minister of International Trade
Arthur Eggleton on Monday that the opening of China's markets
"must take stability and prosperity in the Chinese economy as a
prerequisite".
</P>
<P>
"On the issue of China's joining the World Trade Organization,"
she said, "demanding the opening of China's markets too wide is
unrealistic, and a transition process is rather more practical."
As the Chinese economy grows and integrates with the rest of the
world, China's entrance into the WTO is inevitable, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China applied for restoration of its membership in GATT, the
WTO's predecessor, in 1986.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Disarms 4,733 Liberian Fighters in Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has disarmed 4,733 of the estimated 60,000 factional
fighters in war-ravaged Liberia since disarmament began on November
22, the local New Nigerian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned newspaper quoted ECONOMG Commander, Nigeria's
Major-General Victor Malu, as saying that several thousand weapons
have been recovered by the force. But no details are yet available.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the disarmament exercise, which is key to
restoring peace and establishing an elected government in Liberia after
more than six years of civil war, "must be encouraged to succeed at
all cost."
</P>
<P>
"If disarmament goes smoothly, every other aspect of the peace
process would fall in place," he added.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's factional fighters are
scheduled for completion on January 31, 1997 to pay the way for
general election in May.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, military sources have confirmed that
unidentified gunmen killed four persons at the weekend in an ambush on
a highway linking Monrovia, Liberia's capital, and Tubmanburg, a town
25 km west of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
They said two of the victims have been identified as fighters of
the Krahn faction in the United Liberation movement led by Roosevelt
Johnson, known as Ulimo-J, while the others are civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Ulimo-J commander in the area Monday accused the rival Mandingo
faction of Ulimo-K for committing the ambush.
</P>
<P>
However, Ulimo-K denied the charge, saying they are committed to
the peace process.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Unwanted Pregnancy Rate Stands at 35 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian health authorities
said that 35 percent of pregnancies in Iran are unwanted and all
of them pose a big problem to the mother and infants, according
to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health and Medical Care Ali Reza Marandi said
that the unwanted pregnancies are either the result of incorrect
use of contraceptive devices or the application of incorrect and
uncertain birth control methods.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister made the remarks Monday at the opening
ceremony of a three-day training and consultative workshop on
mothers and infants' safety.
</P>
<P>
He said infant mortality in Iran under one year of age is 26
per thousand and it stands at 33 per thousand under three years of
age in the country.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the largest number of deaths happens at
infancy and the time of birth. Thus, he called for renewed
attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 75 percent of mothers in the
country can take advantage of emergency facilities, special cares
and delivery at hospitals or maternities.
</P>
<P>
Iran boasts of a population of 65 million at present with
an official population growth rate of 1.8 percent. However, most
specialists said that the growth rate stands at 2 percent.

In a competitive environment, only those enterprises would
survive which are able to reduce their cost or increase their

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Herdsmen Now Have Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all Tibetan farmers and
herdsmen in the areas surrounding Lhasa have bought a form of
retirement insurance, an indication that their lives are much
better than they were in the past.
</P>
<P>
About 93 percent of the farmers and herdsmen's families who
have lived there for generations are now covered by pensions for
their later years.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that most farmers and herdsmen live a
comfortable life at present, the peace of their life can be easily
broken by the severe climate of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which
can produce a disaster whose effects they can't escape.
</P>
<P>
But, they no longer need to worry about their "golden years",
because of the policies they have, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has also provided instruction on how the
farmers and herdsmen can benefit from the pension insurance, and
has provided financial support to those insured families.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Plant at Daya Bay Passes State Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear power plant
at Daya Bay, which began commercial operation in 1994, today
passed a state appraisal, and has won approval to start formal
production.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the appraisal panel say that the nuclear power
plant met requirements set in the contract, and showed a high
quality and economic benefits, as well as proving to be
operationally safe.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng sent a message to congratulate the
success of the appraisal, saying that the Daya Bay nuclear power
plant has found a new way for China to use foreign funds in
building large basic industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay is located in South China's Guangdong
Province. Construction of the plant began in 1984 with help from
France. The Number One generating unit of 984,000 kilowatts was
put into commercial operation in February, 1994 and the Number Two
generating unit went on stream in May of 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far the plant has generated 33.5 billion kw/hours of
electricity and has sent 32 billion kw/hours of electricity into
the power grid, supplying Guangdong and Hong Kong with clean
energy, equivalent to that of a thermal power plant which consumes
six million tons of standard coal a year.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Protection Training Course Opens in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A five-day training course on
protection of tigers in Vietnam has been opened here by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The training course is attended by forestry workers and
officials working for natural reserves and forestry services in
tiger habitats in the northwestern provinces of Lai Chau and Son
La, central provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Quang Binh, and Quang
Nam-Da Nang, and central highlands provinces of Dac Lac and Kon
Tum.
</P>
<P>
The trainees are informed of the present situation of the
tigers in Vietnam as well as measures taken to make spot surveys,
legal documents relating to management, protection, and use of
wild animals in the country.
</P>
<P>
There were thousands of tigers in Vietnam before 1960, but the
number has declined considerably to the current 300 over the past
decades due to forest destruction by wars, practice of
slash-and-burn farming, and illegal hunting and trading of tigers
and tiger products.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has made efforts to protect forests
and wild animals including tigers in accordance with the
convention on international trading of endangered species signed
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international organizations including the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
resources, the World-Wide Fund for Nature, and the Global Tiger
Fund have provided Vietnam with financial assistance and
experience in organizing the training course on tiger protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cultural official
has urged Chinese writers to continuously carry forward national
cultural traditions while drawing experience from outstanding
foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the Fourth Executive Council of the Chinese
Writers' Association (CWA), Zhai Taifeng made the remarks in
a work report to the ongoing fifth national congress of the
association in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Let a hundred flowers blossom and weed through the old and
bring forth the new while making the past serve the present and
foreign things serve China, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation has a long-standing and splendid cultural
tradition," Zhai said.
</P>
<P>
"Continuous development of the cultural tradition has made a
great contribution to human civilization," he added.
</P>
<P>
To carry on and enhance outstanding national and revolutionary
cultural traditions has become a glorious mission for contemporary
writers, he said.
</P>
<P>
How to draw useful experience from the outstanding cultures of
foreign countries has become another task for writers since the
opening policy was introduced in 1978, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin has told us that we
should 'discard the dross and select the essence' from our
traditional culture, and carry it forward," Zhai said.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang has also urged us to 'make the past serve the present
and foreign things serve China'," he said. "Thus we should combine
excellent foreign culture with a socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"Only by being deeply rooted in China's vast land and the
masses, and facing modernization, the world and the future, can we
create a socialist culture of this great age," Zhai said.
</P>
<P>
He urged writers to insist on a combination of the spirit of
the socialist epoch and national characteristics in the process of
carrying on traditional cultures and learning from foreign

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines, Pilots Agree on Bargaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airlines (PAL)
and its pilots union today successfully negotiated the terms for
their new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
In their marathon negotiations, the PAL's management and the
Air Line Pilots Association of the Philippines agreed on the
terms, paving the way for a new collective bargaining accord.
</P>
<P>
The terms include an agreement on compensation, work rules
based on the concept of more pay for more work and an agreement on
the staffing of long-haul flights with second officers.
</P>
<P>
The PAL's 600-member pilots union is demanding a 10-percent pay
hike over a five-year period plus perks such as an executive car
and the staffing of two first officers on long-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
The PAL announced earlier that it will downsize by 50 percent
its refleeting program as it cannot cover the additional cost to
be incurred due to higher salary demands by its pilots.

<HEADLINE> Students Stranded in Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Eighty high school students found
them ''homeless'' suddenly before Chrismas vacation this year in the
city of Gulu, northern Uganda, the Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gulu high school closed last week for Chrismas holidays. But the
eighty students failed to join their parents because the latter have
left their home for protected villages all over the
distriict.
</P>
<P>
The students' situation was worsened by the fact that the school
has run out of food to feed them. Onyago Odongo, the Headteacher
of the school, said in a SOS communication to the district resident
commissioner that the school badly needs food to feed the stranded
students.
</P>
<P>
J.J. Odur, the chairman of Gulu Relief Committee, said his
office is going to assist the students.
</P>
<P>
The protected villages are established to help settle down
local people threatened by Kony rebels. enditem

<HEADLINE> Some Discordant Voices In China-US Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Sino-US relations have been on
a fairly even track since the summit meeting in Manila, and a
series of high-level contacts and talks have produced or are
expected to produce fruitful results, with men of insight from
both sides welcoming the developments.
</P>
<P>
"The Christian Science Monitor", which is known for its serious
point of view, recently published an article written by Sen. Sam
Nunn, (D) of Georgia, and Michael Oksenberg, of Stanford
University, which pointed out in an article titled "The US amd
China: a New Consensus" that the US has reached a new consensus in
its China policy, but that the policy is "still in the process of
formation", and is "fragile".
</P>
<P>
The article says that China's goals "frequently overlap with
American interests", that "China's growing role in world affairs
is one of the major developments of our era", that a strong and
secure China "can contribute to global economic growth and the
maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region",
and that "China has become a central concern of American foreign
policy."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the US has to recognize the differences between the
two countries, and "the US has no realistic choice but to persist
in its efforts to forge a constructive relationship with China."
In addition, "The task for the US and China is to broaden the
areas of co-operation while narrowing the differences."
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, these rational views are accepted not only by many
American scholars but also are widely recognized by American
politicians, academics, and members of the press.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, to our surprise, we have heard some discordant
voices from the American press in spite of the current amicable
state and remarkably improved atmosphere of Sino-US bilateral
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
These people cling stubbornly to their cold war viewpoints, and
jump to conclusions based on false assumptions. In "A Smile Alone
Is Not Enough", for example, which appeared in the "International
Herald Tribune" and criticized the US government for being "too
soft" on China, or in "Don't Embrace China", which appeared in the
"Washington Post", and also asked the US not to become "too
intimate" with China.
</P>
<P>
Even more surprisingly, the "New York Times" recently published
an article entitled "What Can I Do?", which forthrightly suggests
that the American people should boycott products made in China.
</P>
<P>
The author of the article is Representative Dan Burton (R) of
Indiana who was a sponsor of the notorious "Helms-Burton Bill",
calling for stronger economic sanctions against Cuba, even at the
expense of Western allies who have trade relations with Cuba,
merely because of his deep-seated hatred for Cuba, which is
persevered in socialism.
</P>
<P>
But the matter has back-fired, and the bill has been strongly
resisted and condemned by members of the Organization of American
States and the European Union, who have even filed a lawsuit
against the bill with the International Tribunal and the World
Trade Organization, which will lead ultimately to the bill's
failure.
</P>
<P>
But, the idea of boycotting products made in China is even more
absurd than the boycott proposed by that bill. If Mr. Burton were
not so forgetful, he would have remembered that it is only when
nations are fighting a war against each other, when the United
States was struggling with Japan during World War II for example,
that the idea of boycotting products made in another country
becomes reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Although Mr. Burton harbors a not very well-disguised hatred of
socialist China, does that allow him to push the two countries to
the brink of war? Mr. Burton is not a naive child, and surely even
he can't believe that such a "boycott" can have any impact on
China's economy. And what is more, the American people are
intelligent enough not to be fooled into thinking that it would be
wise to take part in the move, because such isolated efforts will
not only poison the friendly Sino-US atmosphere, but also bring
direct harms to the interests of American consumers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Upgrade Naval Defense: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today his government would continue to
upgrade the navy's capability and the country's naval defense in
the wake of problems such as border overlap, pollution, pirate
activity and entry of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of the naval defense capability is also important
to boost investors' confidence in the stability of the country and
region, he told reporters after opening the Malaysian Maritime
Conference in Malacca, about 150 km to the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
"Already we have added several new equipment and there are
others that we have ordered and being negotiated by the navy," he
was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the upgrading had been discussed with neighboring
countries, Anwar said it was not necessary as the steps taken were
moderate and Malaysia's defense capability was still small
compared to some neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading should not be viewed as a threat to any party
because it was being done at a minimal level to handle problems in
the country's waters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the conference, Anwar said the government
acknowledges that the defense strength is an important factor in
ensuring economic growth and national stability, but cannot focus
all its attention on that field alone.
</P>
<P>
He said if too much attention was given to the field, the
government feared that other equally important fields such as
education and health would be neglected and as a result the
country would be in a critical situation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government would never neglect the
importance of beefing up its security forces just because the
country was enjoying peace as a result of its friendly ties with
neighboring countries and major powers.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot put the country in a situation where it is exposed
to problems just because Malaysia is peaceful. We are confident
that we will continue to be peaceful because of our good ties with
our neighbors but we cannot sweep aside problems that arise," he
said.
</P>
<P>
What needs to be done is to balance the defense strength and
development because that would ensure the continuity of Malaysia's
strong economic system, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the balanced budget policy would be continued to ensure
that every field received the appropriate allocation according to
its priority.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, held for the first time, is organized
by the Royal Malaysian Navy to discuss maritime policies and
issues, with the theme being "Sub-Enhancing Regional Maritime
Cooperation and Development Through Effective Management of Assets
and Resources".
</P>
<P>
It is being attended by senior government officials,
academicians, police officers, customs officials, marine
department officials and navy personnel.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Former ANC Leader Luthuli Dies at 92 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nokukhanya Luthuli, the
widow of former African National Congress (ANC) president Chief
Albert Luthuli, has died at the age of 92, said sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
Nokukhanya died quietly in her sleep in the company of her
family at her daughter's home in Durban on Sunday, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Albert Luthuli, who died in 1967, was banned after becoming
head of the ANC in 1952, and was placed under house arrest for
having organised a campaign to publicly burn the passes after the
1960 Sharpeville massacre.
</P>
<P>
He became the first South African to receive a Nobel prize in
1961.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said President Nelson
Mandela, who was attending a summit of the Great Lakes region in
Nairobi on Monday, expressed great shock after having learned of
Luthuli's death.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "Her departure is a loss, not only to the ANC
and other democratic forces, but to the nation as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ANC expressed shock and sadness at the death of
Luthuli and conveyed its condolences to her family.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC will remain eternally grateful for the unflinching
sacrifices and tireless efforts to bring about the dawn of peace,
democracy and freedom in our country by the Luthuli family," said
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi also paid
tribute to Nokukhanya Luthuli, saying her death filled him with
great sadness.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal Province,
Buthelezi said her pass away "leaves a void which nothing else
can occupy" as he looked back to many years of his association
and friendship with the Luthuli family. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes New UN Secretary General-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran will cast its vote in
favor of Kofi Annan in the United Nations General Assembly, the
English-language daily Iran News today quoted a senior government
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's vote will go in favor of Annan in the 185-member
General Assembly," said Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I don't want to go into details at this
stage about the way Mr. Annan was elected by the 15-member
Security Council. As a whole, we view Mr. Annan as a positive
person."
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken 58-year-old Annan, U.N. undersecretary-general
for peace-keeping operations, won the support of all 15 Security
Council members Friday. The choice will go to the General
Assembly, which will appoint him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zarif mentioned the fact that "some countries in the Third
World" had raised their voices against the Ghana-born secretary
general-elect.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the "criticism was not made
against the secretary general-elect but against the United
States."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. vetoed the nomination of the current Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to remain in office for the second
term last week.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said: "We welcome that a person from the African
continent has been chosen for the post."
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Annan's attitude remained positive and we should not be
hostile against him," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Annan has rich experience in maintaining peace
and that all possible facilities should be provided to him to
continue his crucial task for the peace.

<HEADLINE> Hubei to Increase Chemical Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei province
scooped nearly 111 million US dollars in foreign exchange from
chemical exports during the first ten-months of this year. The
income was up 17.8 percent over the same period in 1995, today's
"China Chemical Industry News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The result means that exports over the ten months exceeded the
provincial planned export volume by nearly 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
And nearly 87 percent of the total foreign exchange from the
exports were handled by 15 local chemical enterprises which have
right to conduct exports directly.
</P>
<P>
During the January-October period this year, the 15 enterprises
won 52 percent more in foreign exchange over the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 15 enterprises netted more than three million US
dollars each during the period.
</P>
<P>
The province's booming chemical exports are following the
restructuring, reforming, and transforming of enterprises, as well
as a restructuring of export mix.
</P>
<P>
The province has drawn up plans for the sector's export for the
coming year, aiming to increase the volume by allowing more local
chemical enterprises to conduct exports themselves.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Discuss Development of Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 Chinese scholars
met at a three-day symposium, sponsored by the China Association
for Science and Technology, in Beijing today to discuss the
strategic significance of accelerating social and economic
development of west China.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are analyzing development potential and
difficulties in the region, setting goals and means of development
for the region by early next century, and put forward suggestions
on major issues.
</P>
<P>
China's economic development since the reform policy of the
late 1970s has been dramatic, scholars say, but the gap between
the eastern and western regions has been growing also, causing
great concern both in the central and local governments and among
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China emphasized that the region's economy must be
developed in a coordinated and balanced way, and that more support
should be given to the economy in central and western areas, that
the narrowing of the regional gap must be considered a long-term
goal, and that the widening of the gap must be limited.
</P>
<P>
The western part of China covers an area of 5.85 million
square kilometers, or 56 percent of the nation's territory, and
has a population of 273 million, or 23 percent of the national
total. It has over 50 percent of the nation's arable land,
grassland, and forests and over 50 percent of the nation's coal
resources and 71 percent of the hydro-electric energy resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's share of the national economy has been
decreasing in recent years. It accounted for 16.4 percent of the
nation's GDP in 1990, but dropped to 14.4 percent in 1994, and
14.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Full development of the region's resources has been halted by
historical, geographical and environmental factors, as well as
poor transportation, telecommunications, and energy facilities,
lack of funds, poor management, and lack of scientists and
technicians according to experts, who will put forward suggestions
on this at the symposium.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Intense Bank Mergers Expected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Less than a month after two
Philippine commercial banks announced their plans for a formal
union, another two local banks have reportedly started merger
talks now. This may herald the beginning of a string of mergers
and acquisitions in the Philippine banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the Philippine banking industry has intensified
since the government began the licensing and branch expansion
process for local banks in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the government took further steps to
liberalize the banking sector by allowing foreign banks to enter
the country for the first time since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization policies have promoted expansion of
commercial banks, and made the competition increasingly fierce in
the past few years. By November, there were already about 50
foreign banks operating branches, offshore banking units and
representative offices in the country. Pitted against them were 33
local commercial banks, some of which are hard-pressed to meet
higher capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
Driven mainly by the need to stay competitive due to the
presence of the foreign banks, mergers among local banks have
already started.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued on November 28, Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) Bank and AsianBank said that
their major shareholders agreed on the general principles that
will govern the merger and the steps necessary to complete the
process.
</P>
<P>
The merged bank would have a capital of 6.6 billion pesos (253
million U.S. dollars) and about 140 branches throughout the
country. Combined resources of the two banks would give the new
entity total assets of about 30 billion pesos (1.1 billion
dollars), bank sources said.
</P>
<P>
While the two banks are still in their merger process,
Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIBank) reportedly
plans to buy Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCOM).
</P>
<P>
The local press reports quoted an industry source as saying
that PCIBank will first buy 30 percent of PBCOM within the next
few months to strengthen its foothold in the financial banking
services prior to an eventual merger.
</P>
<P>
The reports have not been confirmed yet by the two banks, but
analysts here predicted more bank mergers and acquisitions in the
country in the next two years amid fierce competition in the
banking industry. Earlier this year, Bank of the Philippine Island
merged with City Trust Banking Corp while PDCP Bank acquired the
assets of First Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Other banks which are currently seeking partners are Security
Bank, Equitable Banking Corp and Union Bank of the Philippines,
industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the phenomenon, economists said that being bigger is
certainly in a better position to survive the growing competition
from both foreign and local banks.
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to the fiercer competition, what will
force more mergers and acquisitions is the order issued by the
Philippine Central Bank last month for a further increase in
banks' capital and a cut in banks' required reserves on deposits.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, the Philippine Central bank announced that it
will require universal banks, also known as expanded commercial
banks, to raise their minimum capital to 4.5 billion pesos (171.3
million dollars) from the present 2.5 billion pesos (95.2 million
dollars). Commercial banks will also be required to raise theirs
to two billion pesos (76 million dollars) from the present 1.25
billion pesos (48 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank order, existing banks have two
years to comply with the new minimum capital level while new banks
will have to comply immediately.
</P>
<P>
The reserve requirement, a tool used by monetary authorities to
control the amount of funds lent by banks, will be reduced to 13
percent from 15 percent, with one percentage point to be cut on
January 3, 1997, and a further point on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the higher capital requirement will help
bolster banks' financial capability amid growing competition and
increased demand for funds from a resurgent economy.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the reduction in bank's reserve requirement
is expected to pull down banks' fund raising costs which in turn
should lead to a lower domestic interest rate and higher lending
volumes.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that each percentage point reduction could send
10 billion pesos (380.5 million dollars) into the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
The twin moves, long anticipated by banks, are expected to
result in a flurry of mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Smaller banks are likely to seek partners in the next two years
to help fulfill the higher capital requirement and to make
themselves more competitive, analysts added.

<HEADLINE> 500 Young Women in Zambia Contract Hiv Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 500 young women in
Zambia are daily getting infected with Hiv virus that causes the
deadly disease Aids.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here on Monday by Youth and Child
Development Deputy Minister Mutale Chitika when she officially
closed a week long national youth conference with the theme:
''behavior change, an essential strategy to the fight against
Hiv/Aids''.
</P>
<P>
Other statistics made available to the delegates to the
conference indicate that in the age group of 15-39 there are
about 700,000 people in Zambia infected with the Hiv virus.
</P>
<P>
Chitika said that as the Zambian population has about 70
percent youths who are at great risk of contracting Hiv/Aids,
''it is therefore a matter of utmost importance and great urgency
that the young are protected from this deadly disease Aids. ''
</P>
<P>
She said, ''it is therefore imperative that the youth are
assisted to understand this disease and to develop healthy living
habits.''
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a youth delegate Brill Edwards urged the
youths to change behavior as it is the most essenssial strategy
to fight Hiv/Aids. enditem

NANNING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,300 families in
south China's Liuzhou Prefecture, made homeless by a freak flood
storm in July, are to move into new homes by the New Year.
</P>
<P>
In mid-July the largest flood this century ravaged the
prefecture in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, destroying more
than 10,000 houses and leaving tens of thousands of people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Following the flood, local governments devoted all efforts into
disaster relief work, and have provided each family with a
20-square-meter makeshift shelter and raised money to rebuild
houses.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has so far invested 20 million yuan (about 2.4
million US dollars) in relief, and reconstruction of 15 villages
is nearing completion.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Canada's Liberal Party Poised to Win Next Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- As Canadians move closer to the
federal election expected as early as next spring, experts and
opinion polls indicate no other party would be strong enough to
beat the ruling Liberals.
</P>
<P>
Entering the fourth year of its mandate, the Liberal Party
still enjoys an approving rate of 47 percent nationally. Its
leader Jean Chretien remains by far the most popular federal
leader, with 63 percent approving his performance as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the Southam News-Angus Reid poll done early this
month, the Liberal's nearest competitor, the Progressive
Conservative, is holding only 18 percent, which is a record high
for a party reduced to two parliamentary seats in the last
election.
</P>
<P>
Each of the other three parties, the Bloc Quebecois, Reform and
the New Democrats, is holding 11 percent of the decided vote
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberals are poised to win the next election partly
because they damn well deserve it but also partly because there's
nobody else out there that can touch them," said Peter McCormick,
a University of Lethbridge political scientist.
</P>
<P>
At the October party convention, the Liberals asserted that 75
percent of the promises in their 1993 platform bible, the Red
Book, have been kept, and efforts are being made to fulfill the
rest of them.
</P>
<P>
Of the Liberals' achievements, the most impressive seems to be
deficit cutting that had been brought down to 29 billion Canadian
dollars early this year, or about 3.5 percent of the gross
national product, from 40 billion, or 6 percent of the gross
national product when the party took power by a landslide three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lowered level of deficit has led to the lowest interest rates
in decades, which in turn saved the government billions in debt
service charges, and significantly improved the fundamentals for
the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Liberals are doing an honest job in the eyes
of the Canadians. A recent poll finds that up to 59 percent of the
surveyed gave the party positive marks for its performance in
terms of honesty and ethics.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Liberals do have their share of problems. In
his annual appearance on CBC Television's town hall program last
week, Prime Minister Chretien got earfuls of public anger over his
failures to create more jobs and kill the unpopular Goods and
Services Tax (GST).
</P>
<P>
Canada's unemployment rate, though dipping about 1.5 percent
over the past three years, remains in the range of 10 percent,
leaving about 1.5 million people without jobs.
</P>
<P>
On the GST issue, even Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps was
forced to resign last spring for her failure to honor her election
commitment on the matter, though months later she returned to the
cabinet by winning a by-election. Evidently, the trouble of GST
remains.
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Somalia inquiry, a Liberal-mandated
commission investigating an incident during the Somalia
peacekeeping mission several years ago, in which Canadian soldiers
allegedly tortured and killed several Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party went so far as to
demand Jean Coyle, chief of defense staff, and David Collenette,
defense minister, to resign so as to clean the "cover-up,"
apparently a heavy burden on the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
The Bloc Quebecois have had three leaders in 12 months and will
get another in March since Michel Gauthier has again announced his
resignation recently. As an opposition, the party, after all, is
seldom heard outside Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party, though the second largest opposition, is
confined to the western part of Canada. Its leader Preston Manning
has made no apparent success to erase the party's extremist image
while its moderate members in the parliament are already opting
out.
</P>
<P>
As for the New Democratic and Progressive Conservative parties,
it is unlikely they will make much impacts on the coming election
with just 11 seats combined in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosen, a Carleton University political scientist, said
that the popularity of the Liberals is the result of an
ineffective opposition as well as the fact that the public is
simply happy with them and their leader.
</P>
<P>
"Chretien is like an old shoe people feel comfortable with,"
Rosen noted. "People can relate to him because he appears to have
the frailties of an everyday type of guy," he said.
</P>
<P>
With chance of a sudden economic tailspin or major scandal
involving any key cabinet minister pretty close to zero, experts
predict that the Liberal Party is poised to win Canada's next
federal election.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Resume Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators to the Hebron talks met here Monday night to discuss
the resumption of the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli senior negotiator Yitzhak Molcho and Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat held a brief meeting amid the U.S. efforts
to bring the two sides together following the recent developments
that have created a tension.
</P>
<P>
No detail was released about the meeting, but Israeli Prime
Minister's Office said the two sides would meet soon to resume
formal negotiations on Israeli troop pullback from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting between the two sides in 10 days,
and it came only after Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had
a phone conversation a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat agreed to ease the current tension
generated by the shooting attack last Wednesday which killed a
Jewish mother and her son.
</P>
<P>
In the first warning shot after his re-election,
U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday criticized Israel's new policy
to grant priority to expanding Jewish settlements, terming it
an attempt to preempt a final status agreement and was not
helpful in making peace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the time has come for the Israelis and
Palestinians to reach the long-delayed agreement on Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem
Edward Abington met Monday night with Arafat in Gaza to discuss
ways of rescuing the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday night, Netanyahu made a phone call to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to brief him on his phone conversation
with Arafat. Earlier Monday, Netanyahu made a similar call to
Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will visit Jordan
Thursday to discuss bilateral relations and the peace process. He
was invited by Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher
during the latter's visit here last week.

<HEADLINE> Pictures of Brightest Comet Shot in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists in east
China's Jiangsu Province have shot pictures of Hale-Bopp, the
newly-discovered comet.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences recently succeeded in photographing
the comet by using a refracting telescope together with a CCD
detector.
</P>
<P>
The comet, one of the brightest comets this century, was first
spotted by Hale and Bopp, both astronomers in the United States,
on July 23, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The comet has since attracted great attention from astronomers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Since early this month the comet has appeared in the western
part of the sky after sunset, making it difficult for scientists
to conduct observatory work.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers say the best opportunity for observation will start
from early February to the middle of March 1997 when the comet can
be seen in the eastern sky.
</P>
<P>
A dim light and a big "tail" are likely to be observed by
skywatchers, according to scientists.

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical industry is
expected to fulfill this year's planned targets, today's "China
Chemical Industry News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The industry generated more than 22 billion yuan in output
value in November, an increase of more than 11 percent over the
same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This brings the sector's total output value during the first
11-month this year to nearly 232 billion yuan, up nearly 11
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Except for fine methanol and glacial acetic acid, output of all
the sector's 14 other major chemical products witnessed a rise
this year, with output growth rate of synthetic ammonia, thick
nitric acid, sodium carbonate, pesticides and paint each
surpassing 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In November China produced more than two million tons of
chemical fertilizers, falling two percent compared with October,
but rising 4.3 percent over the same period in 1995.

SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- With two more miners found dead
today in the collapsed pit of Tongbo Coal Mine in Taebaek City of
South Korea's Kangwon Province, the death toll from the incident
has increased to 13, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 miners trapped in the cave-in which occurred due to a
rush of underground water on December 11 at the mine, some 200

</P>
<P>
Chances are small for the remaining two to be found alive,
reports quoted rescue workers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Digging has been suspended since the eight-meter-long shaft to
the site of the cave-in, 335 meters below the surface, was
flooded, reports said.

<P>
The coal mine, with 950 employees, opened in 1982 and it

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Set Up Indigenisation Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government will be
setting up an indigenisation agency through an act of parliament to
monitor the economic progress of the country, including compliance to
a call to multinational companies to sell some shares to blacks, the
daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous people are currently economically marginalised and the
government is doing everything possible to correct the imbalance, and
bring the black indigenous people in the mainstream of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Harare yesterday, the Ruling ZANU (PF)
Secretary for Administration Didymus Mutasa confirmed previous
statements by President Rubert Mugabe that in implementing
commercialisation and privatisation of public enterprises, the
government will ensure that the indigenous people participate in the
process.
</P>
<P>
Mutasa said the just-ended ZANU (PF) National Conference in
Bulawayo paid a close look at some of the country's pressing
problems, and subsequently passed three resolutions to address
the pertinent issues of land redistribution, indigenisation of
the economy and hiv-aids.
</P>
<P>
Indigenisation is a key policy to black economic empowerment, and
in pursuance of that, ZANU (PF) agreed at the conference that all
multinational firms should sell a certain percentage of shares in
their companies to indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Some multinationals had already agreed to sell some significant
fractions of their shareholdings in local companies in support of the
government's thrust to indigenise the economy, said Mutasa.
</P>
<P>
On the land question, the conference resolved to pursue the
adoption of the findings of the ZANU (PF) Land Acquisition Committee,
and the Rukuni Land Tenure Commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Hiv-Aids pandemic, the conference resolved that the
prevention and control of the disease be put on the national agenda,
and that the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare should be allocated
enough resources to implement the agenda.
</P>
<P>
It was the party's view that these three issues needed urgent
attention as they directly affected the people, he stressed. enditem

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's

Tung Chee-hwa as the first Chief Executive designate of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). It said the event

unswerving determination to implement "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong", and "a high-degree of autonomy" in the region, the
editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
The process involves the establishment of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, the formation of the Selection
Committee composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong residents,
formulation of the method of choosing the Chief Executive,
application for the post, nomination of the candidates, and
election of the candidate for the post through secret ballots by
Selection Committee members, and the appointment by the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the enthusiastic participation in choosing the first
Chief Executive by the majority of Hong Kong people from an
extensive spectrum also laid a broad and deep foundation for Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity in the future, it added.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial to Hail First HK SAR Chief Executive (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial said it is obvious and universally acclaimed that
the whole process of choosing the first Chief Executive is just,
fair and open, thus ensuring that each Selection Committee member
cast their ballot in a sacred way according to his or her own will.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that only now, when Hong Kong will return to the
embrace of the motherland, can its people make the historic step
in the path of democracy, it emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a unique form of democracy that fits Hong Kong's
specific conditions has been created, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Questions and answers between the Selection Committee members
and the candidates were not only an examination of the candidates,
but also an exchange of opinions on the blueprint of administering
Hong Kong, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Now the preparatory work of establishing the Hong Kong SAR has
entered a new period, the editorial said. The first Chief
Executive Designate will be responsible for preparing for the
establishment of the first SAR government, according to the Basic
Law and the related resolutions of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that it is the arduous and urgent work as
well as a tremendous responsibility for the first Chief Executive
to put into practice the "one country, two systems" principle, and
implement in an all-round way the Basic Law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the support of people in the motherland, and the concerted
efforts of the majority of Hong Kong people, including the 180,000
Hong Kong civil servants, as well as on the basis of the effective
work of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, the first
Chief Executive will surely take the lead of the six million Hong
Kong residents, maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability, and create a still brighter future for the region, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Former S. Korean Defense Minister Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced former South Korean Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho to four
years in prison and fined him 187,000 U.S. dollars on charges of
bribery and leaking military secret, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lee was arrested on October 26 for accepting 187,000
U.S. dollars in bribes last year from Daewoo Heavy Industries
Company through Kwon-Byong-ho, an arms dealer, with a request that
Lee helped Daewoo with the light combat helicopter procurement
project.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 59, was also charged with leaking military information to
Kwon on Combat Direction System (CDS) which was under deliberation
by the Defense Ministry at the time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court also handed down a jail term of two years
stayed for three years to Sok Chin-chol, former president of
Daewoo heavy Industries Company, and a prison term of 10 months
suspended for one year to Chong Ho-shin, former vice president of
the Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
"It was a public official's blunder that defendant Lee, evading
his responsibility as a defense chief, leaked classified
information to an arms dealer and received bribes from a business
firm," a criminal panel of the court said. "It's tantamount to a
crime of history," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lee was the 11th South Korean defense minister since 1980 and
the sixth arrested on charges of corruption or involvement in
military rebellion.

WELLINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Westpac-Trust Bank today
lowered its mortgage rate to 9.95 percent shortly after the New
Zealand Reserve Bank gave its greenlight to easing the country's
monetary conditions.
</P>
<P>
The new lending rate matched the rate announced by another
bank, Countrywide, last week. More banks are expected to follow
the trend in cutting their lending rates.
</P>
<P>
In his monetary policy statement this morning, Reserve Bank
Governor Don Brash sanctioned recent reductions in wholesale
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Some easing in monetary conditions is indeed
appropriate."
</P>
<P>
The twice-yearly policy statement was made after the signing of
the coalition deal between the National Party and the New Zealand
First party last week. Under the deal, Reserve Bank's inflation
target is widened to zero to 3 percent from the zero to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters said in a
statement that the bank's policy to ease monetary conditions was
"pleasing for exporters and homeowners."

<HEADLINE> China's Policy on Securities Operation Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of making the
stock market develop steadily will remain unchanged, a spokesman
for the China Securities Regulatory Commission has reaffirmed in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He described doubts of a change in government policy governing
the development of the stock market, with the publication of a
"People's Daily" commentary, as a "misunderstanding".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated that steady development of the stock
market based on a codified operation is a consistent policy of the
Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
The basic policy of developing bonds and share raising in an
active, safe and reliable way will not be changed. The policy, set
by the Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic
and Social Development and the Long-range Objective to the Year
2010, conforms to the objective of reform, opening to the outside
world and the establishment of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
This policy was embodied in the announcement of the scale of
new shares issued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the foregone period, the supply of shares could not meet
the demand, resulting in the rate of lucky purchasers of new
shares being less than one percent of the number of people
applying, he said.
</P>
<P>
Increase in the issuance of new shares has not only satisfied
the demand of investors, but also enlarged the scale of China's
stock market. It also benefits the control of excessive
speculation on the stock market and maintenance of a steady
development at the bourse.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the commentary in the "People's
Daily" placed protection of investors' interests in an important
position. This is a fundamental link in maintaining a fair market
operation and promoting the healthy development of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Protection of the interests of investors is more important to
the embryonic stage of newly-developed stock market, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Industry Becoming Economic Development Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 17 (Xinhua)-- The end of the cold war left
China's defense industry stagnating because of a shortage of
orders, but the industry began a strategic shift to civilian
production in the late 1970's.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Qiwen, deputy director of the State Science
and Technology Commission Achievements Department, China's
military industry is becoming a major contributor to the country's
economic development, and the transition is nearly
complete. Eighty percent of sales now come from civilian products,
compared with eight percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
China's military industry of the 1990s is characterized by
large-scale, high-tech, and export-oriented production. A total of
1.31 billion yuan was invested in high-tech civilian products over
the past five years, with 239 key projects in eight military
industrial departments across China.
</P>
<P>
One example was Xi'an Aeronautical Engine Company's developing
a high-speed wire rod finisher that was badly needed in China's
metallurgical industry. The high-tech products are selling well
both in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Military businesses in southwest China's Sichuan Province, one
of the largest ordnance producers, had 61.4 billion yuan in
industrial output value over the past five years, 93 percent of
which came from civilian products.
</P>
<P>
Some defense enterprises have been formed into civilian
products groups which contribute greatly to the local economy, as
is the case in some industries in Sichuan's Mianyang city, one
third of whose total industrial output value was produced by
military businesses.
</P>
<P>
The defense industries are keeping a close watch on the
country's market demand to develop more civilian products.
</P>
<P>
One extreme example was the rocket, which was developed by a
space industrial institute to increase rainfall and prevent hail,
and which has been well received in agricultural areas, especially
dry ones.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Lower Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a lower
trade deficit in the first 10 months of this year compared with
the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to interim data released by the Statistics Department
today, the trade deficit for January-October stood at 954.346
billion ringgit (about 381.738 billion U.S. dollars) as against
9.955 billion ringgit (3.982 billion U.S. dollars) during the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
For October 1996, Malaysia chalked up a trade deficit of 773.4
million ringgit (about 309.36 million U.S. dollars) as against a
surplus of 650.7 million ringgit (about 260.28 million U.S.
dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
But the figure was much higher for October 1995 when Malaysia
registered a deficit of 1.621 billion ringgit (about 648.4 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Department said the smaller trade deficit in
January-October was a result of higher growth of exports which
grew by 8.4 percent to 163.1 billion ringgit (about 65.24 billion
U.S. dollars) as compared with 150 billion ringgit (about 60
billion U.S. dollars) during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first 10 months of this year rose by 2.3 percent
to 164.043 billion ringgit (about 65.617 billion U.S. dollars)
compared with 163.089 billion ringgit (about 65.236 billion U.S.
dollars) during January-October 1995.

NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living
below the poverty line in India has increased from 310 million in
1987-88 to 323 million in 1993-94, according to the latest
estimates of the Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The states of Bihar and Orissa in Eastern India top the list of
the poorest states, with the proportion of poor as high as 56.4
percent in Bihar and 48.4 percent in Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Punjab State in northwestern India, on the other hand,
maintained its lead in poverty alleviation with only 11.1 percent
of its population estimated as poor.
</P>
<P>
The latest estimates of the Planning Commission have been
prepared on the basis of the Expert Group methodology, which is
being favored in place of the official methodology as many experts
feel that the latter is "inadequate in giving a representative
picture of incidence of poverty in the country."
</P>
<P>
The states which registered impressive performance in poverty
reduction included Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka. In these states, the absolute number of poor as well as
the proportion of poor declined between 1987-88 and 1993-94.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partners Differ Over No-confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A ruling partner seems to
have split with the government over a no-confidence motion against
the three-party coalition led by Sher Bahadur Deuba as its MPs sat
on different benches when the lower house began a special session
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP)
Lokendra Bahadur Deuba and eight other RPP MPs sat on the
opposition side when the session was convened as requested by 102
MPs claiming no-confidence in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
However, the remaining MPs of the RPP, including party
president Surya Bahadur Thapa, still chose to sat together with
the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) although the party whip
ordered them to sit on the opposition bench.
</P>
<P>
The special house session, expected to discuss a no-confidence
motion against the Deuba government, was called by King Birendra
last week when the RPP declared its withdrawal from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion will be tabled jointly by the RPP and
main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Debates on the motion will last for three days from Saturday in
the House of Representatives, Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
With 19 MPs in the 205-seat house, the RPP holds the key to any
political equation as the main ruling NC and main opposition
CPN-UML have 86 and 88 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion against the government requires a
majority of 103 votes to pass in the lower house.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Training Course on Tiger Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has launched a five-day
training course on protection of tigers here, according to local
media today.
</P>
<P>
The course will focus on tigers in danger of extinction,
measures to make spot surveys, legislation relating to management,
protection of wild animals in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The course was sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development and the Center for Natural Resources and
Environment of the Hanoi National University, with the
participation of forestry workers and officials of natural
reserves and forestry services from seven provinces of the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tigers were reported to have existed in Vietnam's
forests before 1960, but the number has now reduced to some 300
over the decades due to forest destruction by wars, slash-and-burn
farming, and illegal hunting and trading of tigers and tiger
products.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the Convention on International Trading of
Endangered Species, Vietnam has since 1994 taken a number of
measures to protect forests and wild animals including endangered
tigers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international organizations, including the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources, the World Wild Fund, and the Global Tiger Fund, have
financed Vietnam in the protection of tigers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh Monday stepped in to allay worries over a duplication
of responsibilities among his top aides, stressing that the role
of Chatichai Choonhavan is strictly advisory.
</P>
<P>
Briefing some 300 top administers in his government on his
policy guidelines, Chavalit said the responsibility for economic
affairs remains with Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the role of Chatichai, leader of the Chart
Pattana (National Development) party, is to advise him on
international economic affairs and Chatichai's work is a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai will make recommendations to him directly or to the
relevant state agencies, Chavalit said, asking government
officials to cooperate when Chatichai requests state information.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that Chatichai held separate meetings
of his team when Chavalit was holding his meetings, which
triggered confusion among local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the appointment of Chatichai as Chavalit's special
advisor for economic and foreign affairs also had fueled
speculation about duplication or competition between the two
economic teams led by Chatichai and Amnuay.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Block of California's Controversial Proposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has
extended his temporary blockage of the enforcement of California's
controversial Civil Rights Initiative because he wants more time
to consider arguments about its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco
extended by at least a week his temporary restraining order
against Proposition 209 -- a constitutional amendment that would
eradicate affirmative action programs for minorities and women in
public employment, education and contracting.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209 was passed by Californians on November 5, with
a vote of 54.5 percent in favor.
</P>
<P>
Henderson issued a temporary restraining order November 27
delaying the implementation of the new law, and has said there is
a "strong probability" that it is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wants a preliminary
injunction blocking the law until a trial in federal court can
determine if it is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The ACLU argued the new law would discriminate against
minorities and women.

HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) - Vietnam and Cambodia are expected

</P>
<P>
A local press report said today that the agreement was for the
upgrading of an 80 kilometer link through the Moc Bai, a border

</P>
<P>
The project would receive assistance from Japan's Overseas
Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF) and the Asian Development Bank

</P>
<P>
The ADB had granted the two countries 50 million to 60 million
U.S. dollars, which would be sufficient for the contracts for road
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The project management unit was now seeking more funds from the
OECF to cover contracts for bridge building.

<P>
SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Private mines in Chile will
have produced 1.9 million metric tons of refined copper in 1996,
marking an increase of 41.7 percent over 1995, according to the
National Mining Society (SONAMI).
</P>
<P>
The SONAMI said the dynamic growth this year in the private
mining sector had consolidated Chile as the world's leading copper
producer. It said the increasing momentum would become more
accentuated in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Private mines were estimated to produce 3.2 million metric tons
of refined copper, with the total production for the country
reaching 4.7 million metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Output of state-run copper mines would rise to 1.2 million
metric tons in 1996, with new mining projects, including El Abra,
Refugio, Santa Barbara, Mantoverde, Andacollo-copper and
Anacollo-gold, going into operation, the Mining Society said.

VIENNA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Asia is playing an increasingly
important role in the world economy with its economic and trade
relations with the European Union (EU) developing rapidly, a
former senior EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the threshold of an Asian age," said Horst Gunter

Commission.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a forum entitled "Globalization and EU-Asia

He said the EU had developed comprehensive market strategies to
help European enterprises, in particular medium-sized and small
enterprises, to enter Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Asia accounted for 14 percent of the EU's imports, and
the figure rose to 26 percent in 1994. Meanwhile, EU's exports to
the region increased from 11 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Help Local Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Thai
Industries has urged the government to step in to help the
struggling local steel sector as it predicts a dim prospect for
steel products next year in the country.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting that world steel supply will continue to exceed
demand, the federation said the prices of steel products in
Thailand will decline or remain unchanged at best next year.
</P>
<P>
The government should cut import tariffs on those raw materials
necessary for steel production, lower interest on loans for the
sector and impose short-term measures to protect the sector, it
indicated.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said today that during the second half of this
year, prices for pipe, tube and section steel increased slightly,
but those for billet, reinforcing bar and wire rod fell.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish construction sector and steel dumping by countries
like Russia and Poland are the two main factors blamed for the
slump of the local industry.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment, which is directly under the authority
of the Prime Minister's Office, has already implemented some
measures to protect the local steel industry, including imposing
surcharges on imported low-carbon steel and shaped steel products.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry is also considering similar measures
for imports of hot-rolled steel.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Bosnian Peace Remains Fragile One Year After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The first year since the
signing of the Dayton peace accords which ended the Bosnian war
has been marked by a fragile peace, in which the guns have been
silenced, but hostilities remain close to the surface.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 60,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force, IFOR,
succeeded in separating Bosnia's three fighting ethnic factions --
Muslims, Croats and Serbs -- shepherding them from the trenches to
the barracks, disarming them, putting their heavy weapons under
close surveillance and finally extinguishing the flames of the
bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
With the war ended and construction aid trickling in, life has
gradually been returning to a semblance of normality in many parts
of Bosnia: cafes and restaurants are mushrooming in Sarajevo,
electricity lines are being repaired, roads have reopened and even
trains are running again in parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
On his departure as commander of NATO forces in Bosnia,
American Admiral Joseph Lopez noted that people who dodged the
sniper fire during the war were now having to dodge the heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
However, Rome wasn't built in a day, and much is still to be
done to make the peace a lasting one, particularly on the
political front, where progress has been slow and often
acrimonious.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accords, Bosnia was divided into two entities
-- the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb enclave Republika
Sprska. The Croats claimed their own statelet Herceg-Bosnia, and
although that legally ceased to exist, its functions, including a
militia and police force, remain.
</P>
<P>
General elections were held in September aimed at rebuilding
democracy, but were criticized for their irregularities and merely
confirmed the country's nationalist divisions.
</P>
<P>
A three-member presidency, with one representative from each
ethnic faction, was established and although it moved at a snail's
pace, managed to form a council of ministers to run the day-to-day
business of the country.
</P>
<P>
But in a further sign of the political difficulties facing
Bosnia, municipal elections, due to be held in September this
year, were delayed twice and are now scheduled for next spring.
</P>
<P>
The country has also remained physically divided, with
inter-boundary lines between the different ethnic strongholds
being hardened into "state borders."
</P>
<P>
Evictions of minorities and harassment of returnees are still
common in some regions, and the joint institutions of them are
almost in constant crisis because of participants' antagonistic
views about the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
The issue of refugees is also alarming. Up to now, only some
250,000 of the 2.1 million Bosnian refugees and displaced persons
have been able to return home, and even then they've been limited
to resettling in areas where they are in the ethnic majority.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral return of Muslim refugees has led to several
clashes with Serbs in the past few months and international
officials in Bosnia worry about another flare-up unless the issue
of refugees is properly handled.
</P>
<P>
The hard-won peace is also being threatened by the unresolved
status of Brcko, a key town along a narrow strip of land in
northern Bosnia that links the eastern and western halves of the
Serbs' Republika Sprska.
</P>
<P>
Although it is currently controlled by the Serbs, who claim the
town is vital to their interests, the terms of the Dayton peace
accord say Brcko's status is to be decided by December 20 by
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
However, the Serbs pulled out of the arbitration process on
December 1, creating a serious problem for the international
community. There are now reports that the deadline has been
extended into next year.
</P>
<P>
Re-building Bosnia's war-ravaged economy has been another
precarious task.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the promise of 1.9 billion U.S dollars in aid by
international donors this year, less than half that sum has
actually materialized.
</P>
<P>
Production has returned to only 10 to 30 percent of its pre-war
level and unemployment is now over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
A lasting peace is seen by many as impossible, unless the pace
of economic recovery is speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The lack of national reconciliation and lingering hatred among
the ethnic factions of the country are potential flashpoints for
renewed conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The international community has sensed the danger and has
decided to extend NATO's peace-keeping mission in Bosnia, due to
expire on December 21, for another 18 months to prevent fighting
and try to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
It is also taking a carrot and stick approach, making
international aid to Bosnia's factions conditional on their full
compliance with the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Whether this strategy works or not remains to be seen. But one
thing is clear -- there is still a long way to go before a real,
lasting peace can be guaranteed in Bosnia.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's security forces
have recaptured two main jungle bases of the Tamil rebels in the
eastern part of the country, security sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The two camps had been abandoned when the security forces
reached there on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One of them was a training camp capable of training 400
recruits at a time and able to accommodate 1,000 other cadres, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, the camp came under attack by the Air Force.
A part of the camp was destroyed during the attack.
</P>
<P>
The other camp, which was the base of senior Tamil rebel
Commander Vishnu, was used by leaders of the rebels to plan most
of the attacks in the Batticaloa-Ampara sector.
</P>
<P>
The government forces faced very little resistance in
recapturing the two bases and recovered rebel combat uniforms,
materials and food items inside the camp, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Drug Situation "Alarming" in Philippines: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National
Police-Narcotics Group warned Monday that the country's present
drug situation is "very alarming".
</P>
<P>
Despite the commendable efforts of the government and because
of its limited resources in addressing the drug menace, illicit
drug activities continue to remain as a major concern, the group,
the country's main anti-drug body, told local newspaper Journal.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the group showed that in 1993, there were
about 600,000 drug users in the country. But within three years,
the number has risen to 800,000, 60 percent of whom are in Metro
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Rex Piad, director of the National
Police-Narcotics Group, was quoted as saying the Philippines plays
three roles in the illegal drug scene -- a producer, exporter and
consumer of cannabis products, an importer and consumer of
methamphetamine hydrochloride and other regulated drugs, and a
transit point for heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Piad explained that the country's "penetrable" seaports and
airports and long irregular coastlines provide ideal entry and
exit points for drug smuggling and an alternate transshipment area
of international drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Piad's group has seized about 2 billion pesos
(76 million US dollars) worth of illegal drugs or a 17 percent
increase from 1.7 billion pesos (65 million dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Officials in Connection With Disco Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Justice (DOJ) Monday indicted 15 former and current Quezon City
officials in connection with the March 19 Ozone Disco fire.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who were involved in the inspection of
compliance of Ozone to the fire and building codes and the
issuance of its business permits, were sued for allowing the disco
to operate in spite of serious flaws in the design.
</P>
<P>
Investigation conducted by the Central Police District revealed
Ozone had no fire exit, no fire safety devices and its only door
was a swing-in one.
</P>
<P>
These factors contributed to the difficulty of some 300 patrons
who went to the disco in leaving the premises when the fire
struck. At least 161 revelers died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
The Ozone panel of the department led by Senior State
Prosecutor Ferdinand Abesamis said in a resolution that the fire
could have been avoided if the officials had denied the issuance
of the building's permit.
</P>
<P>
Similar charges had earlier been filed against the disco's
operators. Former Quezon city mayor Jun Simon was spared of the
charges due to lack of evidence linking him to the issuance of
permits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens will spend
more on housing, education, communications and telecommunications
in 1997, the overseas edition of the "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the increase in expenses for housing is
mainly due to the expansion of living space, rent increases and
interior decoration. Education expenses will mainly go to school
programs for children and adult professional trainings.
</P>
<P>
The increasing amount of travel by bus and the improvement of
traffic facilities, and the urgent need of telecommunications are
the major causes of higher costs in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
As for durable goods, TV sets, refrigerators, washing machines
and tape recorders will be favored by rural residents, while urban
people will most likely buy telephones, air conditioners, hi-fi
sets and computers.
</P>
<P>
Though there are more people buying commercial houses and cars,
most Chinese residents will invest in affordable housing, the
paper said.

VIENNA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' (OPEC) average price for a basket of seven
crude oils has dropped to 23.02 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC Secretariat announced the 54 cents fall today, from
the previous week's 23.56 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The announcement added that the average basket price in
November was 22.24 dollars per barrel and the annual average so
far was 20.09 dollars. Last year, it was 16.86 dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has called on all its 11 members to commit themselves
strictly to the quotas so as to control the oil price.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began to export oil on December 9 in accordance with the
United Nations resolution of "oil for food." It was the first
time since the Gulf War in 1990, and it was considered to be a
main reason for the present drop in the oil price.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC oil ministers held a meeting last month to discuss the
market situation following the U.N.'s decision to allow Iraq to
export oil worth two billion U.S. dollars over six months to buy
food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payments Surplus Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) surplus jumped to an estimated 3.9 billion US
dollars from January to November, 10 times higher than the 344
million dollars recorded during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The higher balance of payments surplus was the result of higher
foreign investment inflows and strong foreign exchange
remittances, Diwa Guinigundo, economic research director of the
Philippine Central Bank, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure was estimated based on the increase in the
country's net international reserves level, Guinigundo said.
</P>
<P>
The country's net international reserves went up to about 10
billion dollars as of the end of November from about 6 billion
dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The BOP is the balance of the inflow and outflow of foreign
exchange in the country. A BOP surplus means the country has more
funds and investments coming in than the amount it pays out.
</P>
<P>
Guinigundo said net direct foreign investments in the country
had exceeded net portfolio investments, which reached 910 million
dollars and 500 million dollars respectively during the last three
quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank earlier projected immigrant workers' remittances to
reach 7 billion dollars by the end of 1996, a 42 percent increase
from last year. During the first half of this year, some 3.5
billion dollars have already been channeled through banks while
more than 2 billion dollars is expected during the last quarter.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. to Settle Textile Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The disagreement between Manila
and Washington over the new country-of-origin rule for local
garments and other related products will be settled before the
year ends.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said
here on Monday that the two trading partners have reached a
compromise agreement which includes a compensation package to
offset Manila's estimated annual export losses of 30 million US
dollars on textile and apparel.
</P>
<P>
The country-of-origin rule stipulated that home furnishings and
made-up textile commodities would not be considered Philippine
made unless their raw materials were locally sourced.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said that after the U.S. government began to implement
the new rule last July, 50 local export-oriented companies and
some 5,000 workers had been adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rule also raised widespread protest from Hong Kong,
Macao and other regions or countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Manila Junked a compensation package offered by
Washington as "it will not make up for the losses brought about by
the latter's new ruling on the country-of-origin."
</P>
<P>
Washington, who offered to increase the Philippine garments
quota in lieu of an exemption from the ruling requested by the
Philippines, took the initiative to negotiate with the Philippine
government after the latter threatened to file a case against the
U.S. before the World Trade Organization.

MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Director General of the
Philippine National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)
Dante Canlas Monday maintained that the government's full-year
inflation target of 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent is still
attainable.
</P>
<P>
Canlas said in an interview with the Manila-based Business
Daily that inflation would not reach the reported 9 percent
average considering the sterling growth rate the country achieved
in the past months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp. reported that the
Philippines' national inflation rate would likely reach an average
of 9 percent as stronger consumer demand boosts prices before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Canlas said even the huge personal consumption spending in the
fourth quarter would not push inflation rate beyond the target.
December inflation is expected to settle at 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil price, power rates and transportation fare hikes have
already been incorporated in inflation forecasts, he said. "The
point is that we have already targeted an 8.5 percent to 8.7
percent average and we have no reason to deviate from that," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Leaders Expects Transatlantic Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and leaders of the European Union said today that they
have made progress toward agreement on common U.S. and European
products standards that should help promote about 40 billion U.S.
dollars in trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met privately in the White House with Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton, who holds the European Union's rotating
presidency, and Jacques Santer, the EU's chief executive. Later
they were joined by aides for more detailed discussions.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Clinton told a jointly held news conference
that negotiators will finish work on a set of mutual recognition
agreements which will abolish requirements that broad range of
products, including telecommunications and medical equipment, be
reinspected and recertified for each other's markets.
</P>
<P>
"This will remove barriers on 40 billion dollars worth of trade
between the Unites States and the European Union, cutting red tape
for our businesses and prices after our consumers," Clinton said.
"One standard, one test, one time."
</P>
<P>
Expecting the agreement to be reached before the end of
January, John Bruton said, it will save a lot of business costs.
"If it's safe enough for the United States, it will be safe
enough for Europe, and vice-versa."
</P>
<P>
Today's summit also discussed a broad range of political issues,
including EU expansion, World Trade Organization, Bosnian economic
reconstruction, Middle East peace process, establishment of
African Crisis Force, combating illegal drugs and their ties with
Cuba.

<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its
regret over the disbanding of the multinational peacekeeping force
for Zaire's Kivu region, established at a French proposal in
November.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that all necessary support be brought to
humanitarian organizations for them to continue the missions that
they have begun inside the Kivu region," said French Foreign
Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats of 14 participant countries to the force announced

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Increases in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Industrial output in the
U.S. shot up by 0.9 percent in November, the biggest gain in nine
months, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The huge increase in production at the U.S. factories, mines
and utilities followed a 0.5 percent drop in production in
October.
</P>
<P>
The Fed attributed half of the 0.9 percent increase in
industrial production to the rebound in auto output both at
assembly plants and at related parts' manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said that another 0.2 percent of
November's gain occurred because of increased utility output in
response to unusually cold weather during November.
</P>
<P>
For November, U.S. industrial output at factories making
durable goods rose by 1.2 percent while output at factories making
nondurable goods was up 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Production at the mines edged up 0.1 percent in November
following a decline of 0.6 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Utility output shot up by 2.5 percent, compared to an increase
of 0.3 percent in October, as power demand surged because of the
colder-than-normal weather in November.
</P>
<P>
The rise in output led to an increase in capacity utilization.
U.S. factories operated at 83.3 percent of capacity in November,
up from 82.9 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production report was the last major piece of
economic news before the U.S. Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), meets Tuesday to decide whether to change
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe there is enough evidence of an economic
slowdown to keep the FOMC to leave the short-term interest rates
as they are now.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the overall U.S. economy slowed to an annual rate of
2 percent in the third quarter of this year following a 4.7
percent growth rate in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Britain Likely to Restart Selective Cattle Slaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
expected to announce new plans of restarting the selective cattle
slaughtering program later today in a bid to achieve an early
lifting of the European Union's (EU) global ban on British beef
products exports.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg, who is expected to
propose the cattle cull in parliament this afternoon, said that it
was impossible to get any part of the ban lifted without
slaughtering more cattle, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new plans of slaughtering more cattle, which are most
at risk from BSE or mad cow disease, could help end the embargo on
herds with no links to mad cow disease, Hogg added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a swift end to the worldwide ban on British beef has
been firmly ruled out by the EU Commission, according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fishchler reportedly said in
Brussels today that all the procedures, including scientific
analysis, would have to be followed before a decision was taken.
</P>
<P>
A decision on easing the trade embargo, imposed by the EU in
March, would not be made until all evidence had been analyzed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major and his EU colleagues struck
a compromise deal in June with the EU agreeing to a step-by-step
approach on ending the embargo on the condition that Britain
should slaughter 147,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, the British government unilaterally decided
to suspend the slaughtering program after fresh evidence suggested
that BSE could disappear naturally by the year 2001 without
further selective culling.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Find New Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce (ZNCC) today urged local businesses look at
alternative markets other than South Africa in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC Chief Executive Wonder Maisiri said there is a lot of
potential of entering into joint ventures with other countries in
the region besides South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"ZNCC does not see trade with South Africa being the exclusive
market for trade and investment in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said currently there are many transactions taking place
between Zimbabwe and Zambia's business centers like Livingstone
while other business opportunities are being offered in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian business delegation is expected to visit Zimbabwe
from March 16 to 19 next year. Another business trip has been
planned for local people to Namibia from February 16 to 23, and
similar trips to Mozambique and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see why we should cry foul about the trade pact with
South Africa when we have these practical ways of creating
alternative markets for Zimbabwean exports in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been accused of deliberately delaying the
renewal of the 1964 trade pact with Zimbabwe, which expired in
1992, to protect its industries.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has threatened
retaliatory measures if South Africa continues to delay the
signing of the agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
expressed its determination not to bow to the pressure of the
protesting farmers who demand tax breaks and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The government would not budge from its position of not giving
in to the protesting farmers who have blockaded the country's road
rail links for the past 19 days, acting government spokesman
Yiannis Nikolaou declared.
</P>
<P>
"The government has exhausted all the margins of possibility
in satisfying the demands of farmers," Nikolaou told reporters
after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis to
discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
The position of the government is steadfast: dialogue between
farmers and the prime minister could only be held when all blocks
are cleared.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' blockades at Larissa, central Greece, were being
strengthened Sunday, but trains were allowed through and more roads
were freed across northern Greece and the Peloponnese.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' 19-day highway blockaded has despaired
industrialists in central and northern Greece, who see orders
being canceled and market being lost and who have to pay for some
basic necessities in the black market to keep business going.

<HEADLINE> PAC Seeks Cooperation With Former Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pan
Africanist Congress will try to have better cooperation with
former allies to promote democratic process in the country, newly
elected PAC President Stanley Mogoba said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his first media briefing as PAC president in
Thohoyandou, Mogoba described the fifth PAC congress held at
the weekend as "a milestone" in the party's history.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest PAC Congress had emphasized unity, saying
internal division was a thing of the past. Referring to relations
with other South African parties, Mogoba said the PAC had made
an urgent calls that it will be open to all South Africans.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the ruling African National Congress(ANC), the
Azanian People's Organization and other former political allies
to work together with the PAC, predicting there will be a
"political realignment" in South Africa within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Only when political parties in the country refocused will
South Africans' newly-won independence be assured, Mogoba said.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, the third biggest black political party in South
Africa after the ANC and Inkatha Freedom Party, has hardly for
years had any cooperation with the ANC because of political
differences between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba defended the PAC from the alleged reports that it is "a
racist body", saying his party had been "deliberately
misunderstood in the past". He stressed the PAC is the first to
coin the term "non-racialism".

<HEADLINE> 90,000 Refugees in Tanzania Returned to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 90,000 Rwandan
refugees have returned home from Tanzania since December 1, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the 90,000 returnees went back to Rwanda
over the last three days after Tanzania announced on December 5
its plan to send all the 535,000 Rwandan refugees on its soil back
to their home country by the end of the year, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has said that conditions in Rwanda are now conducive
for people to return in safety. Rwandan officials at the border
have assured the returning refugees of their safety at home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNHCR is trying to locate substantial numbers of
refugees missing in eastern Zaire. A UNHCR team arrived in the
Zairian capital of Kinshasa over the weekend to look into reports
by an earlier UN mission that 100,000 to 150,000 refugees had
converged in Shabunda, about 175 kilometers west of the eastern
border town of Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Jiddo van Drunen, head of operations of the
special unit for Rwanda and Burundi in Geneva, will also look into
reports by a non-governmental organization that more than 100,000
refugees and displaced Zairians are sheltering in Lubutu, 300
kilometers west of the Zaire-Rwanda border, according to the
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The team will investigate practical possibilities for moving
these refugees toward Rwanda and bringing them emergency
assistance from UNHCR stockpiles in eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
As of December 11, the UNHCR has registered 474,333 returnees
who had returned to their home communities in Rwanda. That
comprises approximately 80-85 percent of those who have returned
from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR statistics, before fighting broke out in
eastern Zaire in October, the UNHCR had cared for 1.2 million
refugees in eastern Zaire, including 719,000 in Goma, 307,000 in
Bukavu and 219,000 in Uvira. The Uvira figure includes 143,000
Burundi refugees, of whom 60,000 have returned to Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Israel Waiting for PA Response to Resuming Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today Israel is still waiting for a
response from the Palestinian Authority (PA) to solve the impasse
on Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Netanyahu said even after his phone
conversation with PA President Yasser Arafat Sunday night, the PA
has not given indications if the remaining issues stalling the
Hebron talks could be solved.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the phone call to Netanyahu after two Israeli
officials met with him in Gaza. Arafat discussed with Netanyahu
ways of calming the recent tension and the prospects of moving
forward the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Netanyahu listed four outstanding issues
blocking a deal on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron: the
right of Israeli troop's entry into Palestinian areas in
Hebron after the redeployment, Palestinians' access of a central
street in the city, the opening of a market in the city
center and the type of arms the Palestinian police will
carry.
</P>
<P>
Israel's insistence on retaining its troop's right of
conducting hot pursuits of "suspected terrorists" has been the
leading obstacle blocking a deal after two months of marathon
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, PA minister in charge of Jerusalem affairs,
said today during a tour in Haifa that the Hebron talks
would not make further progress if Israel failed to take
concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied that the PA was inciting violence
against Israel after Israeli government announced measures to
expand Jewish settlements following a Palestinian attack which
killed a Jewish mother and her 12-year-old son Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a strong reaction to Israel's new moves on settlement
expansion, the PA called on all Palestinian people to confront
such activities in order to defend their own land.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron today, tension flared up again when thousands of
Palestinian students marched to protest the continued closure of
the Islamic University in the city. Israeli troops blocked the
students from entering the campus, but no clashes occurred.
</P>
<P>
Israel has shut down the university after a spate of
suicide bombings by Islamic militant groups of Hamas and Jihad
killed 58 people in February and March. The university was
regarded by Israel as a hotbed for the anti-Israeli Islamic
fundmentalists.

<HEADLINE> China Commodity Fair to Open in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A fair of Chinese
commodities will be held from December 17-23 in the Kenyan
capital, aimed to promote economic cooperation between China and
Kenya, said a news release issued here today by the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The China Commodity Fair, participated by eight national
import and export corporations and many companies from 13
provinces and municipalities from China, will be the largest one
ever organized by the Chinese government in the eastern and
central African region.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of commodities will be displayed at the fair,
including garments, footwears, textile, small hardwares, manual
tools, small farm machinery, ceramics, household electrical
appliances, tractors, automobiles, the release reported.
</P>
<P>
"Special attention was paid in choosing these commodities for
the fair to suit the Kenyan market," said a spokesman for the
fair at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Yu Tianbao, a senior official from China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation which sponsored the fair, told
local reporters that the aim of holding such a large scale fair
in Kenya is to "introduce Chinese commodities to the Kenyan
people and promote trade and cooperation between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
" This is a very welcome move because business is the only
reliable means of uniting nations," said National Chairman of
Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kassim Owango.
He urged Chinese investors to make Kenya their African investment
center.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also promised to enhance cooperation between the
medium and small-sized enterprises of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Top US Officer Rules Out NATO's Role in Catching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- General John Shalikashvili,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today that NATO
will not play any part in apprehending Bosnia's indicted war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili told a press briefing here that the mission of
the NATO-led Stablization force (SFOR), which is the successor
force to the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), will be very
narrow.
</P>
<P>
The essential of the SFOR is to protect the successes the IFOR
has achieved, namely to monitor the separation of military forces
of Bosnia's foes, to ensure their heavy weapons locked up, and to
assist local elections and construction in a smaller scale than
the IFOR did, the general said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to napping the war criminals, Shalikashvili said
that it should be a two-part effort, which will put pressure on
the Bosnian sides to comply with the Dayton agreement on the issue
and to set up a police force outside the NATO structure to
apprehend the war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that NATO is the right institution to take
ownership of such a police force," Shalikashvili said. "NATO
should confine itself to the military aspects.... Some other way
must be found to constitute and control such a police force."
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-strong SFOR, which includes 8,000 American soldiers,
will serve as the follow-up peacekeeping forces in Bosnia for 18
months after the mandate of the IFOR, its forces standing at
60,000 at the beginning, expires on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the SFOR will be what has been left of the IFOR and
American general William Crouch, who is the commander of the IFOR,
will command the SFOR.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili said that it is too early to tell whether war
will resume in Bosnia after one and half a year because NATO could
not force peace upon Bosnians and it is up to people here to
decide whether they want peace.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Facilitate People's Movement to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
will introduce a regional visa to facilitate people's movement to
boost regional tourism, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mark Harvey, chairman of the Tour and Travel Operators of
Zambia (TOAZ), said here at the weekend that member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have decided to
introduce a common visa to be transferrable from one member state
to another.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of tourists has decreased drastically since
1991 largely due to the cumbersome procedures in immigration
formalities and the lack of regional marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted him as saying that "the introduction of a
single visa for overseas visitors could considerably boost
tourist flows within the SADC region. In addition, attention
needs to be placed on standardizing immigration forms at points
of entry as well as improving attitudes of officers."
</P>
<P>
Harvey also said a regional body will be formed to market the
region to woo tourists.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the dwindled tourists inflows on low foreign
investment, growing crime and over-exploitation of few
attractions.

<HEADLINE> 6 Million People Living Below Poverty Line in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- There are nearly 6 million
people in Britain who are now claiming income support, an increase
of almost 900,000 since the last general election, according to a
report by the opposition Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Who Benefits?" which was published today
and based on an analysis of Department of Social Security
statistics, said that for every day since John Major was returned
to office in 1992, there have been 865 people falling into
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Every area of the country has seen an increase of at least 10
percent, and the greatest number of claimants of income support
are in the South East and south London where there is an increase
of 21.9 percent, the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
It said that its measure of poverty was based on Major's
definition of poverty in 1992 when he said, "Poverty is measured
by the income support level. This is the only way people measure
poverty, the number of people above and below the income support
level."
</P>
<P>
However, government officials deny that there is any absolute
poverty in Britain, but rather an imbalance of income.

JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Namibia welcomed the
appointment of Kofi Annan as the next Secretary-General of the
United Nations, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Windhoek, capital of Namibia, the

him personally," reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"Namibia congratulates him and offers full support for his
vision for the future as he is about to assume the high office,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a 58-year-old Ghanaian who is currently Under
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations of the UN, takes

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Calls for Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind today called on leaders of the two communities
on the island to make compromise if solutions to the
protracted Cyprus problem are to be found.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a press conference here this afternoon at
the end of his two-day visit to the island, during which he had a
working breakfast with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides in
Presidential Palace and a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind pledged that Britain will do its utmost to assist the
U.N. and the two communities to seek a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
He put forward 10 elements concerning the Cyprus issue, which
he hopes President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash
will turn into the provisions of a detailed settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said "the aim should be a comprehensive settlement
covering all aspects of the Cyprus problem which will be based
on a bizonal, bicommunal federation, in conformity with the high
level agreements and Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"The federation and its constitution will reflect the
principle of political equality of the two communities as
defined by the U.N. Secretary-General," Rifkind noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the security of each of the two communities,
Rifkind pointed out that it should be "achieved by means of
international guarantees and by such measures of international
collective security as may be agreed by the parties."
</P>
<P>
The British official suggested that before the end of the
first half of 1997, "there should be an open-ended session of
face-to-face negotiations between the two sides under the aegis
of the U.N. aimed at securing a comprehensive settlement to
the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind emphasized that the success of these
negotiations will depend on the creation of genuine mutual
confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"It will therefore be important for both sides to encourage
steps designed to achieve that and to avoid any such actions
which will increase tension over the coming months," he added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU),
Rifkind said that "EU membership should be of benefit to all
the people of the island and the terms of accession will
need to take into account of the basic interest of each of the
two communities."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the negotiation of the terms of
accession of Cyprus to the EU will, if a political settlement can
be reached in 1997, be conducted on behalf of the bizonal,
bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
He said that gaps remain, which he does not wish to
underestimate, and that his 10 elements "offer the best basis for
making progress."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind expressed the hope that "both leaders will work
whole-heartedly and energetically for a settlement in 1997."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who arrived here Sunday, came under heavy fire on
the island last week for his comment in the British House
of Commons that the entry of a divided Cyprus to the EU
would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
He has also been criticized by Cypriot politicians for his
meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's visit is the first by a British Foreign Secretary
since 1960 when the island, a former British colony, became an
independent Republic.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty on the establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
occupied 37 percent of the island following an short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece.

ABU DHABI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Tournament favorite Saudi
Arabia overcame a slow start to defeat China 4-3 en route to fill
the last semi-finals post at the 11st Asian Cup soccer tournament
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi's victory has completed an all-West-Asian semifinals in
the 12-team continental tournament.
</P>
<P>
China took an early lead of 2-0 with Zhang Enhua's header in
the fifth minute and Peng Weiguo's goal on a sliding shot at the
boxline some 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
But the Saudi Arabians soon fought back after their veteran
playmaker Youssif Al Thunaian was substituted in.
</P>
<P>
Thunaian rushed into the box and slotted in a losing ball
half-blocked by Chinese goalkeeper Ou Chuliang at the 31st minute
and Sami Jaber made the equalizer at the same spot in the 33rd
minute.
</P>
<P>
Fahad Mahalel's goal put Saudi Arabia 3-2 ahead in the 43rd
minute when Sami Jaber dribbled along the left flank and passed
the ball to Mahalel who beat the Ou Chuliang and easily sent the
it into an open goal.
</P>
<P>
Thunaian added his second goal in the 65th minute to give Saudi
Arabia a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
China pushed the fighting into Saudi's half and created some
golden chances. Zhang Enhua cut the gap to 4-3 at the 90th minute
just before the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
In a World Cup qualifier in 1981, China beat Saudi Arabia 4-2

Earlier on Monday night, Iran rallied from a 2-1 first half
deficit for surprising win of 6-2 over South Korea in Dubai.

ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki said Eritrea has achieved an average GDP growth rate
of over 5 percent annum during 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of weekly English newspaper
"Eritrea Profile" made available here today, the remarks were
contained in a speech made by the president during his recent
visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Isaias said, the rate would have been higher if it
had not been in inadequate or erratic rainfall patterns which
resulted in poor harvests in three of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
He said, the average inflation rate during the same period has
been consistently below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Eritrea's reconstruction, the president said his
country is still on the mend from "decades of war and economic
suppression" that have shattered the young nation's
infrastructure, scattered its people, and left government and
economic institutions "very run down".
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Eritrea has emerged as a "politically stable and
economically promising nation in sub-Saharan Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Isaias appealed to investors to invest in
agriculture, fishing and general manufacturing in the country and
said Eritrea's "investment rules are among the most liberal in
Africa".
</P>
<P>
President Isaias paid a working visit to the U. S. from
December 8 to 15.

ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) today appealed to
the international donor community for 103,369 tons of food aid
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Commissioner of the DPPC Simon Michale at
a meeting here attended by the donor community.
</P>
<P>
Simon said 1.93 million people will need food assistance in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced last year that 3.2 million people
would need 253,118 tons of food aid in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Simon told donor community that the net requirement for 1997
are only 79,369 tons because of existing stocks and undelivered
pledges that would be carried to 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said, in addition to the people that actually need
assistance, there are 706,138 people in vulnerable areas, who are
expected to be in the margin, and therefore need close
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
He urged the donor community to make purchases locally as this
will encourage farmers to produce more by supporting farm-gate
prices in the surplus producing areas.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for non-food emergency assistance amounting
to 15,674,908 US Dollars for the reduction of susceptibility to
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production in Yugoslavia Goes Up 7.3 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production in
Yugoslavia rose 7.3 percent in the first 11 months of this year
over the same period of last year, the Yugoslav Statistics Bureau
said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase for the month of November alone stood at 14.4
percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector recorded an increase of 1.7 percent and
metallurgy 44.4 percent, while the production of non-metals and
construction materials rose 26.3 percent, the official Tanjug news
agency quoted a statement by the bureau as said.
</P>
<P>
The metal-processing and power industries recorded an increase
of 4.2 percent, chemical and paper industries 21.8 percent,
textile, leather and rubber industries 9 percent, and food and
tobacco industries 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the wood processing industry was the
only one to record a drop in production, with a fall of 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The increased production, following the lifting of the U.N.
sanctions against Yugoslavia, effected a rise in exports,
especially to Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Serbian labor market office said today that the
unemployment figure for Yugoslavia dropped by 290,000 in 1996
thanks to measures taken by the labor market office.
</P>
<P>
Office director Nikola Ristivojevic said that more than 76,000
redundancy employees got jobs, while another 40,000 had been
covered by various vocational and retraining programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that next year, when Yugoslavia was fully to
reintegrate into international financial organizations and renew
bilateral and multilateral relations, the country's significantly
enhanced economic development was to help further reduce the
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Due to the four-year-long sanctions which were lifted last
October, Yugoslavia's unemployment rate was as high as 50 percent.
But with the economic situation improved and many factories
starting production, the unemployment figures began to drop over
the past few months.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies opposes the involuntary
repatriation of refugees to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
The federation's Secretary General George Weber made the
statement here today at a United Nations meeting of the
Humanitarian Issues Working Group.
</P>
<P>
Weber said that the federation advocates voluntary repatriation
based on sound information, readily available to those concerned.
He underscored the federation's opposition to repatriation to any
region "where the individual cannot return in safety and dignity
without fear of persecution or intimidation."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the immediate and longer-term needs of more than
560,000 refugees in the FRY and the general transfer of external
support from Croatia and the FRY to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Weber
noted, "While fully supporting the need for rehabilitation and
reconstruction efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we feel this
must not be at the expense of refugees in other republics whose
short- and long-term futures are still dependent upon
international relief support."
</P>
<P>
The federation now assists more than 800,000 people in former
Yugoslavia, through 570 local Red Cross branches and 40,000
volunteers.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 16 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian President

injunctions, saying the technicality only served to delay and
deny justice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar for judges and magistrates here, The

wantonly, especially in commercial and trade disputes.
</P>

cases," he said, adding that some do not even keep records of
court proceedings and judgements.

<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides announced here today that the Cyprus
government will ask for a meeting with the next
U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides noted Annan, 58, is a "personality with a wider
respect within the U.N."
</P>
<P>
He added that the new U.N. chief, currently
U.N. Undersecretary-General for peacekeeping operations, is an
experienced diplomat in dealing with conflicts and crises because
of his involvement in peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Career diplomat Kofi Annan from Ghana was chosen by the
Security Council Friday to succeed U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali. The U.N. General Assembly is expected to
officially approve Annan's appointment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has a 1,200-strong peace-keeping force in Cyprus to
patrol along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup, with the Turkish Cypriots in the north and
the Greek Cypriots in the south.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held on
and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Hunger and homelessness in
the United States' cities increased in 1996 for the 12th straight
year, and mayors predict cuts in some welfare benefits in 1997
will make the problem even worse.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 29 cities to be released today by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors is expected to show overall demand for
emergency food and shelter rose again, The USA Today reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, for the second consecutive year, there is a decline in
emergency food and shelter requests in some cities and a slower
growth rate in others, reflecting the effect of a strong economy
and government programs to aid the homeless and hungry.
</P>
<P>
Mayors say they fear that federal cuts in food stamps and aid
for legal immigrants, combined with the end of a federal guarantee
of aid for the poor, will put more people on city streets.
</P>
<P>
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros says the
mayors have "legitimate fears" but the administration will work on
linking housing programs with welfare reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed
U.S. President Bill Clinton's report on Cyprus, which blamed the
Greek Cypriots for "creating tension on the island."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters
that the U.S. presidential report had pointed out that it was
the Greek Cypriots who created events in August and September on
the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Akbel quoted the report as saying that Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash had called for bilateral talks between the leaders
of the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities on the
island, adding that it was the Greek Cypriots who did not want to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
demonstrator as he tried to bring down a Turkish flag on the edge
of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the buffer zone of the island.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire on anyone
crossing the Green Line dividing Cyprus into Turkish Cypriot
north and Greek Cypriot south.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkish troops
landed on the island and took control of its northern third in
1974 following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.

ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas today rejected British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's
proposal to "reinterpret the guarantorship" with respect to the
Cyprus issue, reports reaching here from Nicosia said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Rifkind's proposal to extend the guarantorship
in a way that meets the demands of both communities, Denktas
said that the agreement of guarantorship did not lead to any
problems on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot give up on the guarantorship of Turkey because
we cannot give up on the basic rights granted to us in the
1960 agreements," Denktas said.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary urged leaders of the Greek
and Turkish Cypriots at separate meetings today to bury their
decades-old hostility and start peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, the first British foreign secretary to visit the
island for more than 30 years, argued that the world wants to see
an end to conflict in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktas warned the European Union (EU) that if it
continues to act with ignorance, only southern Cyprus, not Cyprus
as a whole, would join the EU, according to the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said last week

non-smokers in public places, the European Commission (EC) notes

<P>
It shows a clear undertaking by the EU member states to apply
the resolution. All the member nations now have national
legislation on implementing the resolution with the exception of
the United Kingdom, where a voluntary code of practice is in
place.
</P>
<P>
However, as EC Commissioner Padraig Flynn said, the public
across the EU are "increasingly demanding" a smoke free living and

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Reaffirms US Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today reaffirmed his belief that the United States is the
basic partner in the Middle East peace process and the key to
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statement at the end of his tour to the 6th
October City, about 50 kilometers west of Cairo, amid widespread
fear in the Arab world about U.S. President Bill Clinton's
appointment of Madeleine Albright as the new secretary of state
ten days ago. Albright is believed to be a strong advocate of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the U.S. has always been a key player
in the process of regional peace-making even before the start of
the peace process at the hands of late Egyptian President Anwar
el-Sadat in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak deplored the "saddening" stalemate plaguing the
Mideast peace process and sounded the alarm against
"uncomfortable" results in the whole region because of peace
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he expressed optimism that the present stagnation
would not continue,
</P>
<P>
By urging the Israelis to embrace flexibility in dealing with
its Arab peace partners, he said he is not defending the
Palestinians but rather defending stability of the whole region,
including Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Palestine and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egypt has rejected Israel's accusation that it is
lining up with the Palestinians and biased against the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt became the first Arab country to make peace with Israel
in 1979 when it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state, but
relationship has since remained cool.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries strained after Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's hard-line government took power in
June and the Mideast peace process was stalemated.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Israeli expansion of settlements a very serious
question, Mubarak renewed his warning that it would complicate
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Arab League's recent reports of radioactive
leakage from Israel's nuclear reactor, the president said Egypt
has no confirmation yet. "But if there were leakage it would be a
serious issue and Egypt would then have another stance."
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's return to the Arab fold, he said Arab reconciliation
needs time, especially when some Gulf states are still
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
He said when Iraq implements all the relevant Security Council
resolutions and accomplishes the return of captives and other
steps, "only then could one talk of Arab reconciliation with
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraq, after accepting all U.N. terms for inspection of its
nuclear facilities, was allowed Tuesday to pump oil to the world
market for the first time since the U.N. imposed sanctions on
Iraq following its invasion of neighboring Kuwait in 1990.

At a press conference on the Angolan peace process, Puna said
that with the UNITA's senior military officers joining into the
unified army and appointed to high posts, more and more UNITA
soldiers will follow their steps into the national army.
</P>
<P>
This will facilitate the solution to the outstanding problems
in the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he is pessimistic over the deadline for
the forming of a new government of national unity and
reconciliation before December 31, because the UNITA leaders
designated to serve in the government and the National Assembly
have not arrived in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Seeing that the Angolan peace process is more complicated for
its long civil war, Puna urged the UN Verification Mission based
in Angola to extend its service till final peace is realized in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Party of Democratic Renovation
Luis dos Passos called on Angolans to discard their distrust to
each other for peace, democracy and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at a news conference marking the sixth
birthday of his party, stressing that national reconciliation
will be realized if Angola's military personnel and politicians
have not the spirit of tolerance and goodwill.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Mubarak Discuss Mideast Peace Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this evening held a
phone conversation on the deteriorating situation in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak accentuated that the implementation of agreements
signed by the Israelis and Palestinians is enough to contain
tension and put an end to the deteriorating situation, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the second telephone conversation between the two leaders
within a week. They discussed the long-delayed Israeli pullout
from the West Bank city of Hebron last week.
</P>
<P>
The phone call from Netanyahu, which came amid growing tension
between the two countries, is believed to be an effort to ease up
the strained ties and affirm the Israeli government's commitment
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with the
Jewish state in 1979, but relationship has remained cool.
</P>
<P>
Ties strained after Netanyahu's hard-line government took over
power in June as the peace process began to be bogged down in
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has rejected Israel's accusation that Arab countries are
interfering "at every stage of the negotiations" and pressure on
Israel was "damaging" and slowing peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will visit Egypt
Wednesday to expound the Israeli government's decision to expand
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio said today Adviser to the Israeli Prime
Minister Dore Gold will also come here in the next few days to
discuss Egypt's role in pushing forward peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza today, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announced
resumption of the peace talks with Israel after his phone call
Sunday night with Netanyahu. The two leaders exchanged views on
defusing tension between the two sides and accelerating talks on
the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged condolences over the killing of
an Israeli woman and her daughter as well as a Palestinian worker
last week.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Build First Nuclear Plant Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The construction of Turkey's
first nuclear power plant will start soon, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Turkish official sources as saying that
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Recai Kutan will give
necessary information on the plant in Akkuyu, a coastal village
near the city of Mersin, southern Turkey, in a press conference
scheduled to be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tender advertisement for the nuclear power plant will be
published in the Official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The planned power plant, which is estimated to cost a total of
1.5 billion U.S. dollars, will be built either as a single unit
with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts or two equal units each with a
capacity of 600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had the idea of building its own nuclear power plant as
early as in the mid 1960s. Unfortunately, all these projected
programs came to abortion due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources again
put the construction of such a power plant on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
The tender for consultancy services at the plant was given to
the South Korean Atomic Agency, which prepared the technical
specifications of the tender for the construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmental protection organizations have
reportedly vowed to take action to block the building of the
plant because of concerns about pollution.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Israel on Expansion of Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The White House raised the
level of its criticism of Israel, calling its assistance for
settlements in the West Bank and in Gaza "troubling" and a
"complicating factor" in Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In answering reporters' questions about the U.S. reaction to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's effort to help
settlers, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: "They are a
complicating factor in the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"While we have always said that we believe settlements are a
complicating factor in the negotiations, we also believe that it
is troubling to see sides preempt issues that are under discussion
by taking positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said if Clinton had been asked at his news conference
last Friday, he "would have echoed sentiments expressed by the
State Department spokesman on Friday..."
</P>
<P>
At last Friday's briefing, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns offered harsher than normal criticism of Israel's decision
to grant tax breaks for Jewish settlers so they can expand housing
in areas claimed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it's troubling. When one side does something that
seems to preempt the outcome of negotiations, it makes it more
difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has reacted angrily to
Israel's decision to grant financial benefits, such as tax breaks,
to West Bank settlers, describing the move as a time-bomb.
</P>
<P>
McCurry's remarks were prompted by a letter prepared by a group
of former U.S. secretaries of state and national security advisers
urging the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to refrain from
expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"We... urge you as prime minister of the state of Israel, just
as we also urge all on the Arab side, not to take unilateral
actions that would preclude a meaningful negotiated settlement and
a comprehensive and lasting peace," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burns told a State Department briefing on Monday
that the Clinton administration has called for a meeting between
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"There's not going to be a Hebron agreement until they meet. We
would encourage meetings between the two leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said no agreement can be reached on the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank city of Hebron
unless such consultations take place.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Demands Faster Return of Refugees to Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees Mrs. Sadako Ogata said here today that
the number of refugees who have returned to former Yugoslavia is
much less than expected and called for a preliminary solution by
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations in terms of return raised by the end of the
war were not fully met in this first year of peace", said Mrs.
Ogata at a United Nations meeting of the Humanitarian Issues
Working Group of the Peace Implementation Council. She pointed out:
"Political obstacles and the extent of physical destruction meant
that of the 2.1 million uprooted only 250,000 could go back home."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ogata said that UNHCR "has one clear objective for the
consolidation period: to ensure that all refugees and displaced
persons from former Yugoslavia will have found a solution by the
end of 1998 or, at least, be firmly engaged in reaching a
satisfactory solution".
</P>
<P>
Asked to clarify UNHCR's stand on involuntary repatriation from
next spring to fasten the return of refugees, Mrs. Ogata told
reporters: "Principle of voluntary repatriation is the principle
that everybody prefers. However, when the conditions on the ground
have improved in a way that, for certain categories of people,
return is possible, then involuntary return is not excluded."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ogata outlined key factors needed to find durable
solutions: political support, respect for human rights, security
and economic assistance. "In the next two years we must ensure
that all these key elements are better integrated through
increased coordination," she said.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Group, Police Clash in Cape Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, 16 (Xinhua) -- The police and supporters of a
Muslim organization, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD),
clashed outside Cape Town International Airport today.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 PAGAD supporters were arrested on charges of
violation of public order while two policemen and two journalists
were injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The serious confrontation was erupted as about 200 people,
some of them masked, gathered beside the approach road to the
airport demonstrating against drug smuggling in the city, the
South Afrian Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
PAGAD spokesman was quoted as saying that they wanted to
present a memorandum to airport management calling for tougher
measures to stop drug smuggling, but policemen, backed by troops
and armoured vehicles prevented them from entering the grounds of
the airport.
</P>
<P>
SAPA reported that the demonstrators threw stones and bottles
at police while policemen and troops retaliated by firing teargas
and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
The PAGAD, a national organization established early this
year, has vowed to rid society of gansters and druglords. It
suggested the police authorities to install drug scanners for
domestic flights at Cape Town Airport and boats in the harbour
should also be searched for drugs.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the clashes today, the South African government and
Cape Town Authorities have warned time and again to PAGAD leaders
not to hold demonstrations at airports and tourist venues.
However, the PAGAD turned the deaf ear to the warnings.
</P>
<P>
The PAGAD claims that it has no intention of becoming a
political party in the country. It also has expressed to support
the ruling African National Congress-led government.

<HEADLINE> EC Trys Best to Fight BSE: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has done all it can to ensure the protection of human health
against any threat from BSE, an EC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, EC commissioner responsible for agriculture,
Monday made the remark as the hearings by the European
Parliament's Commission of Enquiry on BSE are drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that all of the evidence pointed to the fact that
the EC has done all in its power to protect human health from any
BSE threat.
</P>
<P>
It has been said recently that the EC took too little action on
tackling the BSE issue or gave too much priority to beef market
interests.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said that the EC was only one player in the
decision-making process and that it was impossible for the EC to
introduce or implement any legislation without a legal or
scientific basis or the support of the member states.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Committee of Enquiry to draw its conclusions in an
open and constructive manner on the basis of evidence and facts,
instead of unsubstantiated suggestions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
surged sharply and all ended in positive ground Monday,
underpinned by strong bond markets and a firmer Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
In London, Europe's biggest market, an encouraging start to
Wall Street trading helped pull the FTSE 100 index up towards the
day's highs by the end of the session, with the index closing 21.4
points higher at 3,993.8 points.
</P>
<P>
However, hopes that the Boeing-McDonnell merger would lift Wall
Street appeared to have little early effect on British shares
which rallied only in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt made the most gains today, with the
DAX-30 index ending two percent, or 56.08 points higher at
2,855.79, boosted by the dollar's strength in the wake of the
European Union stability pact reached in Dublin last weekend for
ensuring monetary discipline after the launch of a single currency
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse benefited from firmer government bonds and
dollar's gains following agreement on the EU stability pact, with
the CAC-40 index 19.16 points up at 2,222.57 at the close of the
session.
</P>
<P>
Although shares on the three major European markets all rallied
today, trading volumes were low as most investors were kept
cautious after recent falls triggered by New York and ahead of the
US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed up
21.4 points at 3,993.8. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index ended 56.08

PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today expressed his wish for a "new take-off" of relations with
the Southeast Asian nation Brunei, during a meeting in the Elysee
palace with the Bruneian head of state, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that Chirac
thanked Bolkiah for helping France and Britain to be admitted as
observer countries by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed his wish for further developing relations

Bolkiah will visit the Aerospatiale and Airbus Industrie
airspace corporations in Toulouse during his first state visit to
France, which is described by the Agence France Presse (AFP) as
having "an economic character."
</P>
<P>
France now only takes a share of 3.5 percent of the internal

<HEADLINE> France Wastes No Time to Buy Iraqi Oil in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France has wasted no time to buy
crude oil from Iraq after Baghdad was allowed for the first time
in six years to sell some of its oil to buy food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Total oil group will buy 30,000 barrels of crude oil per
day for three months from Iraq, while the Elf-Aquitaine oil group
has also signed a three-month oil buying contract with Iraq with
an unspecified purchase volume.
</P>
<P>
Both contracts of Total and Elf have been submitted to the
United Nations for approval.
</P>
<P>
Total and Elf have been negotiating for years with Iraq on the
exploration of two giant oil fields of Nahr Omar and Majnoun in the
south of the country.
</P>
<P>
But even if they sign the contracts on developing the oil fields
with Baghdad, they have to wait for the lifting of U.N. embargo
imposed on Iraq six years ago before they can carry them out.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq Sunday
resumed exporting oil through the Mina al-Bakr terminal on the
Gulf after reopening an oil pipeline linking its Kirkuk oil-field
with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
France was among the first advocates for the application of the
United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq, under which Iraq was
allowed by the U.N. to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil per
week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed between Baghdad and the United Nations is
the first easing of the international trade embargo imposed on
Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first cargo of 500,000 barrels Iraqi oil, transported on
the Star of Africa oil tanker, was sold to two American companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said on Monday that the United States would step up
aid to Lebanon, including increased training of Lebanese military
and law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the announcement at the opening of a one-day
conference at the State Department of potential donors to Lebanon.
Delegates from some 30 countries and eight international financial
institutions attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher, the United States would increase its
assistance for basic infrastructure, agricultural development,
education and training and social services; work to expand the
flow of goods, services and capital between the U.S. and lebanese
private sectors; and bolster training of Lebanese military and law
enforcement officers and continue to provide non-lethal military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Christopher gave no figures but Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri has said he would ask the delegates, known as the
"friends of Lebanon," for contributions of up to $5 billion in the
next five years in reconstruction of the country devastated by a
16-year civil war that ended in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made no mention in his address of lifting a
long-standing U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon by U.S. citizens. But
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing that
the United States could decide whether to lift the ban in 20 to 30
days.
</P>
<P>
"We have a serious commitment to make sure we give the best
advice we can to the American public which would travel to
Lebanon," he told reporters. "I think you'll probably hear more

WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore were constitutionally re-elected to a
second term by electors' votes cast across the country on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under a system considered archaic, electors cast their states'
electoral votes at ceremonious meetings in state capitals for the
presidential candidate who won the most votes in their states.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were entitled to 379
electoral votes to 159 for Republicans Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
There were no reports of deviations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton-Gore carried 31 states and the District of Columbia in
November.
</P>
<P>
Gore, in his role as the presiding officer of the Senate, will
open the states' electoral ballots before a joint session of
Congress on January 9 and declare Clinton and himself elected.
They will be inaugurated on January 20.
</P>
<P>
There were complaints against the multilayered system, ordained
by the Constitution, under which voters cast ballots not for a
candidate but for slates of electors.
</P>
<P>
The number of each state's electors equals that of its senators
and house representatives. They are pledged to vote for whoever
won their state or, in Maine and Nebraska, their congressional
district. The District of Columbia, which is not represented in
Congress, has three electoral votes.

Today's summit also discussed a broad range of other political
issues. On the cooperation against illegal drugs, Clinton said
that their law enforcement officials are now working on a new
joint counter-narcotics offensive in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said at the news conference, "We have taken major steps
at this summit in regard to the fight against drugs, which feeds
organized crime."
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on a program of action to support the
governments of the Caribbean area to be sure that that area is no
longer used as a transit area for drugs. We have reached
agreements to cooperate on money laundering."
</P>
<P>
He said the leaders agreed that technology should be fully used
to combat the use of technology for crime.
</P>
<P>
On the Cuba issue, Clinton said he had not made a final
decision on implementing part of the anti-Cuba Helms-Burton law
that had angered America's European allies that have business ties
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed by Congress last winter, infuriated some U.S.
allies by threatening actions against foreign firms that do
certain kinds of business on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Santer said his talks with Clinton had helped to "clear the
air" on Cuba and that they agreed on the end goal of democracy
there. But he added: "Europe will remain firmly opposed to all
extra-territorial legislation, whatever its source."
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU was sticking with its decision to pursue
the issue at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Bruton also stressed at the news conference that "there are
differences between us in regard to what we consider to be an
attempt to apply U.S. law outside U.S. territory to the detriment
of European companies."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed U.S.-EU trade relations, the growth
of EU and the expansion of World Trade Organization, as well as
the Middle East peace process and the establishment of an African
Crisis Force.

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces New Selective Cattle Cull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced here this evening that it would slaughter some 100,000
more cattle in a bid to achieve an early lifting of the European
Union's (EU) global ban on British beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg told parliament that
"we have decided that now is the time to bring forward our
proposals for a selective cull in accordance with the terms of the
Florence agreement."
</P>
<P>
"We regard this as only the first step towards the complete
lifting of the ban on the export cattle, beef and beef products
from the UK, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's new plans of slaughtering more cattle, which are most
at risk from BSE or mad cow disease, could help end the embargo on
herds with no links to mad cow disease, Hogg added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a swift end to the world-wide ban on British beef
has been firmly ruled out the EU Commission, according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fishchler is reported as
saying in Brussels today that all the procedures, including
scientific analysis, would have to be followed before a decision
was taken.
</P>
<P>
A decision on easing the trade embargo, imposed by the EU in
March, would not be made until all evidence had been analyzed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major and his EU colleagues struk
a compromise deal in June with the EU agreeing to a step-by-step
approach on ending the embargo on the condition that Britain
should slaughter 147,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, the British government unilaterally decided
to suspend the slaughtering program after fresh evidence suggested
that BSE could disappear naturally by the year 2001 without
further selective culling.

<HEADLINE> Tory Wins Vital EU Fish Quota Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tory Party won tonight a
crucial parliamentary vote of EU fishing right -- the first test
the Party faced since losing its overall majority in the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party bid to defeat the Tory government in
the vote was rejected by 316 votes to 305.
</P>
<P>
Labor MPs had already been put on alert by party whips who
believe that a Government defeat could precipitate a general
election.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party had said earlier it was considering putting
down a confidence motion if the Tory lost.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Tory failed to prevent a defeat in the same vote
after 13 Tories voted with the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Nine Ulster Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland swung behind the
government on the vote tonight after receiving assurances of
help for the fishermen of the province from Fisheries Minister
Tory Baldry.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Turn Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A big lift from Boeing and
McDonnell Doublas failed to prevent the Dow Jones industrials from
a continuous fall Monday as earlier gains were wiped out by
yearend profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 36.52 at 6,268.35,
after giving up an early gain of 50 points. The blue-chip index is
now down 279.44 points, or 4.3 percent, from its November 25
record of 6,547.79.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Dow's early gain was built on Boeing, whose shares
rose sharply after the company's Sunday announcement that it would
acquire McDonnell Douglas in a stock swap valued at 13.3 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the rest of the market lacked support. Declining
issues led advancers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Volume on the Big Board was moderately heavy at 447.58 million
shares, but a little below Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.65 to 720.99, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 3.22 to 380.85.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index plunged 23.93 to 1,260.98, the
biggest one-day point drop since the 32.32-point loss of July 23.
The American Stock Exchange's market's market value system
declined 3.49 to 572.57.
</P>
<P>
Investors's mood was affected by the Federal Reserve's reports
that America's industrial output shot up 0.9 percent in November,
the biggest gain in nine months.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also still disturbed by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's suggestion December 5 that stocks might be
overvalued, and fear the central bank may raise interest rates at
its policy meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bonds gave ground following the reports. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds rose to 6.63 percent from 6.57 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new data raised worries that the economy is a bit
over-heated, which might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
short-term interest rates in a bid to cool inflation, traders and
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Computer stocks were hit hard while major companies suffered
market losses. Oil stocks helped buoy the market as oil prices
rose.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge in Mostar Opens for Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A new 4-million-dollar bridge
over the river Neretva was opened in Mostar in southern Bosnia
Monday, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is 112 meters long, 20 meters wide, and bears the
name of Hasan Brkic, a partisan hero of the World War II, and
constructed with financial support from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth bridge that has been opened for traffic in
Mostar since the European Union took over the administration of
the divided city in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The opening was attended by the first European Administrator of
Mostar, Hans Koschnick, his successor Martin Garrod, official
Croat and Muslim representatives and about one thousand citizens
of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
"We build bridges not only over rivers, but also between
people," Koschnick said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Due to dispute between Bosnian Muslims and Croats who lives in
the city, Mostar is still a divided city although ethnic leaders
in the city were urged by international community to get it
reunited.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Gets Support from Local Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic received on Monday many telegrams from domestic
institutions to support his position in solving the political
crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said the telegrams expressed support to
Milosevic for his stance which was stated in his letter to U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Friday in reply to
Christopher's letter on December 9.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Milosevic said the Serbian government would not
use force to crack down peaceful demonstration in Belgrade and
would invite European Union delegation to find out truth about the
election dispute that sparked off large-scale rallies in Serbia in
the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia's district board in the
northern town of Kikinda said Milosevic's attitude towards the
settlement of the crisis was an "act guarding the sovereignty of
Serbia and of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the
implementation of laws."
</P>
<P>
The Fighters of the National Independence War considers that
Milosevic's answer represented the safeguarding of historical
values and interests of the Serbian people in the defense of its
freedom, independence and integrity for which hundreds of
thousands have died, fighting within the antifascist coalition for
their own and allied cause, along with the American people, the
organization's telegram said.
</P>
<P>
The organization also condemned foreign interference in the
internal affairs of Yugoslavia and the behavior of the coalition
Zajedno that is attempting, under the flags of Germany and of some
other countries, to win support for their unprincipled and illegal
positions.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party of Serbia district board in Subotica said
that the answer to Christpher was understood as a potent truth and
the most significant assumption for democracy in our country.
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, respected president, socialists from the
northern most part of Yugoslavia are expressing to you their firm
support in the belief that truth will prevail untruth repeated
against us and that you have wisely proved that ours is not a
subservient mentality," Tanjug quoted the telegram as saying.
</P>
<P>
The board of Young Socialists of Kosovska in southern Serbian
province of Kosovo expressed their support to Milosevic and
condemned in the strongest terms the subservient behavior of
coalition Zajedno leaders, according to Tanjug report.
</P>
<P>
Many other institutions, organizations, associations and
factories in Serbia have expressed their support to Milosevic,
saying the letter had protected the integrity and dignity of the
country, Tanjug said.
