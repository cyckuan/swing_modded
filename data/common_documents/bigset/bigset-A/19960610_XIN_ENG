<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Troops Launch Guerrilla War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government troops have
unleashed guerrilla war against Taliban Militia in the strategic
Herat province, said a report coming from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a military spokesman as saying that forces
loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani had carried out 18
guerrilla attacks in Taliban-held Herat province in the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a Taliban police commander and an
armored division commander in Herat had been killed in these
raids.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla actions were aimed at keeping the Taliban forces
tied up in the western region of Afghanistan, which Taliban
captured in last September, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the pro-Rabbani forces, led by general Allauddin
Khan, were well entrenched in some districts east of the Herat
city and launched the sneak attacks against Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Herat city, the biggest city in western Afghanistan, lies on a
strategic supply route to the Afghan capital of Kabul which has
been under Taliban's attacks for eight months.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Fix Maize Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The government will not fix the
prices of maize, staple food for Zambians, this year, but farmers
themselves can do so, a government deputy minister said in Choma,
southern Zambia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian News Agency today quoted Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries Deputy Minister Matthias Mpande as saying it is not the
responsibility of the government to fix the maize prices but the
farmers are better placed to decide on the price of their produce
because they are in business.
</P>
<P>
He urged the farmers to unite and speak with one voice on the
price of their produce.
</P>
<P>
Mpande noted that for some time now the farmers have been down
trodden and it is now important that the farmers be given the
opportunity to make decisions on the issue.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Sixth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov
became the first Russian to win a Grand Slam singles crown at the
French Open here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Russian beat Germany's Michael Stich 7-6 (7-4),
7-5, 7-6 (7-4) in the men's singles final after two hours and 30
minutes on a sun-baked center-court.
</P>
<P>
At one stage Kafelnikov won six games in a row after trailing
2-5 in the second set.He also trailed the 27-year-old German 1-3
in the third set.
</P>
<P>
The only other Russian player to reach a Grand Slam tournament
final was Alex Metreveli (now of Georgia) who was beaten by Czech
Jan Kodes in the 1973 Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's triumph means that Kafelnikov won both the singles and
men's doubles events. The last player to achieve that feat was
Australian Ken Rosewall back in 1968.
</P>
<P>
"I will always remember this day. I'm very very happy,"
Kafelnikov said, after ending the match with a forehand passing
shot that the 15th-seeded Stich couldn't handle.

<P>
HARARE, June 9 (xinhua) -- Winter wheat output in Southern
Africa is forecast to grow by 22 percent to 2.86 million tons
this year, compared to 2.35 million tons in 1995 due to increased
availability of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
In its latest food security bulletin, the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) early warning unit said prospects
could have been higher had it not been for several major threats
including red locusts, poor quality seeds used and flooding
experienced in some of the countries.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production is forecast to more than double to 325,000
tons in Zimbabwe, rise by 12 percent to 2.4 million tons in South
Africa and by 66 percent in Namibia to 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
It is feared, however, that Zimbabwe may lose some of the crop
due to an attack of swarms of red locusts which have already
invaded the country.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho expects to harvest 18,000 tons of wheat, Tanzania
66,000 tons and Zambia 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed concern that the regional food security
position remained unsatisfactory due to low import delivery rates
in most countries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Call for Release of POWs in Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today announced it will
hold an international festival in the coming October in Italy to
call for the release of the Kuwaiti Prisoners of War (POWs) who
it said are still locked up in Iraqi detentions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's National Committee for Missing and Prisoners of War
affairs said in a press release that an agreement to this
effect was reached during a meeting between the committee's
chairman Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah and head of the Kuwaiti-Italian
Friendship Society Pierre-Andrea Fanni, who is currently visiting
the country.
</P>
<P>
The festival is apparently aimed at winning support
and sympathy from the European peoples and attracting the world
attention on Kuwait's will and determination to solve the POWs
issue.
</P>
<P>
The festival, to be held in the Italian city of Florence, will
see a gathering of representatives from the Vatican, Senior
Italian officials, representatives of human rights organizations
in Europe and other human rights activists, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The committee had convened an international conference in
London in March to publicize the plight of the POWs. The
conference was addressed by former U.S. President George Bush and
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait says Iraq still holds 625 prisoners taken from the
emirate during the seven-month occupation, 562 of them are
Kuwaitis and eight of them women.
</P>
<P>
So far Baghdad has given accounts for the files of
130 prisoners but denies it holds the remaining ones as
Kuwait alleged.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Estonia Lead Baltic Countries in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Poland and the Republic of
Estonia have led the Baltic countries this year in economic growth
rate at 5 and 4 percent respectively, according to a report of the
Sparbankernas Bank of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report indicated that Polish economy grows
at 5 percent, the highest rate of the area.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by Norway (4.5 percent), Estonia (4 percent),
Finland (2.5 percent), Republic of Lithuania (2 percent), Republic
of Latvia (1.5 percent), Denmark (1 percent), Sweden (0.9 percent)
and Germany (0.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
Among Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which previously belonged
to the former Soviet bloc, Estonia has the most prosperous economy
now.
</P>
<P>
Though its gross national product (GNP) in 1993 was 7-8 percent
lower than that of 1992, it began to show signs of growth in 1995
and leaps at 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Estonia is one of the five countries in the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance which have privatized more than half of their
state-run enterprises and presently has a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
However, soaring prices have accompanied some of the countries'
economic booms. Though much lower than that of 1994 when both
Estonia and Latvia had an inflation rate over 45 percent, the
inflation rate in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will stay
between 18 and 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, none of the other Baltic countries has an
inflation rate higher than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the unemployment rate in the area is
spearheaded by Finland (17 percent), followed by Poland (14.5
percent), Germany (10 percent), Denmark (9.4 percent), Lithuania
(8 percent), Sweden (7.4 percent), Latvia (7 percent), Estonia
(5.5 percent) and Norway (4.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The problem with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the report also
pointed out, was that they all had a falling industry and that
their economic growth was mainly achieved through growth in
service industries, transportation in particular.

<HEADLINE> Dhlakama Unsatisfactory Toward Portugal, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique National Resistance
(MNR) leader Afronso Dhlakama is unsatisfactory with Portugal,
saying "I shall go to visit Portugal only after that European
state changes its foreign policy toward Mozambique."
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition party leader made the remarks to
Mozambican newsmen after he paid recent visits to France and
Belgium, the Mozambique News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama said, "I feel indignant that Portugal treats
Mozambique as belonging to the Mozambique Liberation Front
(Frelimo), and not as a nation in its foreign relations."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Frelimo continues to rule Mozambique after it won
the general elections in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The MNR leader expressed the indignation to Jose Lamego,
Secretary of State for Cooperation of Portugal during his visit
to France when Lamego met and invited him to visit his country,
and Lamego promised to acquire more information and would go to
Mozambique soon.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama accused the United Nations of neglecting his MNR,
"turning its back on it".
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement on MNR's debts stipulates that those
which used to back the MNR should pay through the U.N. the
expenditures after the MNR turned from an armed group into a
political party, and during elections.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama said the U.N. has not carried out its promises on the
general accord on peace in Mozambique, saying, "we would write to
the U.N. this week, to remind it to change its stand and fulfill
its promises."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Wounded in Hezbollah Guerrillas' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was wounded
today in attacks by guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, at the Israeli forces in the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters carried out an ambush
targeting an Israeli patrol on the road between the Israeli
positions of Rihan and Aishiyeh in Jezzine area around 9:30
a.m. (06:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that when the patrol comprising three
M113 armored vehicles fell in the ambush, the guerrillas fired
machine guns and anti-tank rockets, "hitting two vehicles and
killing and wounding a number of their crews."
</P>
<P>
One hour later, another group of its fighters detonated a mine
targeting a patrol of the Israeli client South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia on the road between the villages of Beit Yahoun and
Konin, "killing and wounding a number of the militiamen," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed the guerrilla attack on the Israeli
patrol on the Rihan-Aishiyeh road, noting that one Israeli soldier
was injured.
</P>
<P>
SLA sources said that one militiaman was wounded in the second
attack.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces retaliated the attacks by firing
artilleries at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a mountain
area which is often used by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch
attacks at the Israeli self-carved buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area reported that the Israeli forces
fired 155mm and 120mm artilleries at Jebal Rafih, Nabaa At-Tassa,
the vicinities of Sejoud and Rihan.
</P>
<P>
They said that more than 40 shells hit the hills in the
area during one hour and a half without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flew at medium altitute over Beqaa Valley in
eastern Lebanon this afternoon, breaking sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israeli gunships cruising in the water
opposite the south Lebanese coast released three Lebanese
fishermen at dawn today.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, identified as Hossam, Saeb Kahwa and Said Abu
Juma, were abducted by the Israeli gunships on Saturday morning
when they were fishing near the southern Lebanese port city of
Sour, 85 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Today's attacks brought the number of Israelis killed and
wounded in south Lebanon to four and 15 respectively, since a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire understanding was reached between Lebanon
and the Jewish state on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire understanding, which ended the 16-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon, bans both Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas from attacking at or from civilian areas, but it does
not prevent Hezbollah's militants from attacking the military
targets in the 850-square-kilometer buffer enclave in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Hold Tough Stance in "Mad Cow" Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany is holding its tough stance in
the "mad cow" dispute and will continue to ban beef imports from
Britain, according to a published report today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the European Union's (EU) recent move to ease its ban
on British beef, the German government won't drop its opposition,
Health Minister Horst Seehofer told Bild-Zeitung am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
The decision, he said, is based on research results that "mad
cow" disease, formally known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE), could have potentials to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
A change in the German position is possible only if measures
currently adopted by the British government proved to be effective
in curbing the disease's spread, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Before any scientific evidence that could defy the disease's
threat comes in, Seehofer asserted, it's necessary to "give
priorities to human health and consumer interest."
</P>
<P>
As the first step to lift an overall ban, the EU Commission
agreed on June 5 in Brussels to allow the exports of three British
beef by-products -- gelatine, tallow and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
However, five of the EU's 15 member nations, including Germany,
which was the main force against lifting the ban, voted against
the decision and refused to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found BSE, which reached epidemic proportions in the
late 1980s, was caused by feeding cattle the remains of sheep that
had been infected with scrapie, their own version of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease reportedly continues to infect British herds
despite a government ban on using feed containing animal protein.
</P>
<P>
It was the fear of its possible human infection that prompted
the EU to ban Britain's beef exports on March 27 -- a measure that
has caused tensions in Britain's relations with other EU nations.

<HEADLINE> UN Experts Destroy Iraqi Biological Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here today
that U.N. experts are now supervising the destruction of
machinery and equipment at the Iraqi biggest biological arms
production site in al-Hakam.
</P>
<P>
Goran Wallen, director of Baghdad's ongoing monitoring and
verification center of the U.N. Special Commission on Disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM), told reporters that the U.N. experts are currently
destroying the al-Hakam production site, some 80 kilometers west
of Baghdad, in the same manner as in Muthanna, a chemical weapons
production site which was destroyed by Iraqis under strict the
U.N. supervision in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM official said that the destruction of al-Hakam
biological warfare arms production site started in mid-May and is
expected to conclude by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. destruction mission in al-Hakam includes the
destruction of what is termed as dual-purpose machinery which can
also be used in the civilian fields.
</P>
<P>
The al-Hakam site covers an area of 18 square kilometers which
is under U.N. supervision by 16 sophisticated video cameras
installed there. A dozens-meter-high tower there is connected with
the supervision center in the capital, sending back the
information obtained through the cameras.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information organized in
April last year a trip there by foreign reporters to visit the site
which the Iraqi side said is producing pesticides, fertilizers and
animal feeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 20-member team of U.N. experts arrived here this
afternoon on a mission related to Iraq's missiles program. An
additional 30 experts headed by Russian ballistic expert Nikita
Smidovitich will be here to join them on Monday, a UNSCOM spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council set up the weapons monitoring program
in April 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war which
liberated Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Receive UN Environment Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one distinguished
environmentalists from all over the world were honored here today
by the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) for their outstanding
efforts to protect and improve the world's environment.
</P>
<P>
The laureates include Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen from the
Netherlands for his significant contributions to environmental
research, and a high school group of junior journalists for
environment from China for raising students' sense of
responsibility to the world around them.
</P>
<P>
They have been elected to the prestigious ranks this year of
UNEP Global 500 Roll of Honor, which was launched in 1987 to
inspire and guide people to protect and promote the concept of
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director of the UNEP, addressed
the award ceremony on the occasion of World Environment Day
celebrations, coincidental with the ongoing Second U.N. Conference
on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
She said it is appropriate that in this year of the HABITAT II
conference, the theme "Our Earth, Our HABITAT, Our Home" is the
focus for this year's World Environment Day on June 5.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to us that environment must be a central feature
of the global message of the HABITAT II conference," said
Dowdeswell. "And the message is that the challenge must and can
be met by ordinary citizens of a highly interdependent global
community."
</P>
<P>
Paul Crutzen, a Nobel laureate and a world leader in the
investigations of the state of the ozone layer, has opened up an
entirely new frontier in atmospheric sciences, said Dowdeswell.
</P>
<P>
A group of junior environmental journalists from a high school
in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province in east China are among the winners of
this year's Global 500 Youth Environment Award.
</P>
<P>
They have in the past years written articles, taken pictures
and held story-telling contests to inform their fellow students
about the subjects ranging from the harm of killing frogs and the
illegal sale of its meat to protecting local rivers and lakes from
wastes.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the award ceremony, Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and the General Secretary of HABITAT II, Wally
N'Dow, also underlined the importance of protecting environment
while making process in prosperity and development.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on Arab leaders to exclude the prejudgement on the
new Israeli government until it has had chance to form its Mideast
policy.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that Clinton
made the appeal during a "very constructive" telephone call with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak when flying to the West Coast on
a political swing.
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged Arab nations to reserve judgement on
the new government in Israel," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton and Mubarak discussed the
latest developments in the Middle East, particularly the election
results in Israel and the meeting among Mubarak, Syrian President
Hafez Assad and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz al-Sau
in Damascus last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Clinton feels that there is a general satisfaction in the Arab
world with the statement of Israel's Prime Minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu after he won the elections late last month, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has pledged to continue to pursue the U.S.-backed
peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the scheduled summit of Arab nations in Cairo on
June 21-23, Clinton told Mubarak that he believed the gathering
would be a very important forum to forge regional support for
continuation of the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Continues Contacts with Arab Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today continued his contacts with Arab leaders to invite them to
attend an Arab summit to be held in Cairo from June 21-23,
according to Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's top aide.
</P>
<P>
The countries whose leaders have been contacted by Mubarak
include the members states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates, the five members of the Arab Maghreb Union, which are
Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunis, as well as Jordan,
Lebanon, Yemen, Djibouti and the Comoros, Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Baz, first foreign undersecretary and director of the
Presidential Bureau for Political Affairs, said that Mubarak also
held consultations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak telephoned a number of Arab heads of state and sent
messages through Egyptian envoys to some other leaders, said Baz.
</P>
<P>
Baz said that Mubarak held consultations with Arab leaders in
order to get to know their views on some issues to be discussed at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
There would be coordination among Arab foreign ministers prior
to the summit, Baz said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed Egypt's satisfaction with the reaction of
Arab leaders to Mubarak's invitation.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries are looking forward to such an enlarged summit
and have welcomed Mubarak's invitation, Baz said, adding that Arab
leaders believe that it is necessary to hold the summit under the
current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
that the summit will mainly discuss means to close Arab ranks and
restore Arab solidarity in order to maintain the Middle East peace
process with the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab leaders had held a series of bilateral and
tripartite summits this month as apprehensions gripped the Arab
world following the victory of right-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu in the Israeli elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has promised to take a tougher line than that of his
predecessor Shimon Peres in Israel's peace negotiations with the
Palestinians and Syria, thus jeopardizing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Saudi
Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah issued the call for a Cairo summit
after a two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria.

SARAJEVO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A French soldier was wounded on
Saturday evening by a deliberately laid mine on a road north to
the Bosnian town of Gorazde, the Nato-led implementation force
(IFOR) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The French soldier suffered from leg injury when his motorcyle
hit an anti-personnel mine which was "deliberately and recently
laid" on the road surface, said Major Simon Haselock, an IFOR
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He did not say who might have laid the mine on the road which
links the Muslim enclave of Gorazde with the Serb-held territory.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been such incidents, this latest occurrence
involving IFOR personnel casualty was "in itself worrying", said
Haselock.
</P>
<P>
Since IFOR came to Bosnia on the peace-keeping mission, it has
suffered dozens of mine injuries and deaths. But this seems to be
the first one involving a deliberately laid mine.

<HEADLINE> Sultan Qaboos of Oman Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said
arrived here today for a five-day visit to Egypt, during which he
will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on bilateral
relations and an Arab summit to be held in Cairo later this month.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Qaboos, who was greeted at the airport by Mubarak, came
here from Saudi Arabia, where he paid a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa today hailed the
Egyptian-Omani relations, saying Egypt always remembers that Oman
was the only Arab country that did not suspend relations with
Egypt when it signed the Camp David accords with Israel in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and Sultan Qaboos scheduled to be
held later today will be the latest of a series of bilateral and
tripartite Arab summits this month following the victory of
right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli
elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit, scheduled for June 21-23, will be the largest
gathering of Arab leaders since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The summit aims to close Arab ranks and save the Middle East
peace process, according to Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa said that Egypt have invited 20 Arab leaders
to attend the summit, adding that all of them are expected to
participate in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait split the Arab world, will be
excluded from the summit.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Caretaker Government Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Jatiya (national) Party (JP),
one of major political parties in Bangladesh, today accused the
caretaker government for not allowing JP chairman and ex-president
H. M. Ershad to make poll speech.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who took power in 1982 and was forced to step down at
the end of 1990, has been serving terms of imprisonment for
corruption since 1991. According to constitutional rules, he has
been allowed to contest in five of the 300 constituencies during
the upcoming June 12 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The High Court Sunday ruled that Ershad, as the leader of a
major political party, should be allowed to make poll speech over
radio and television. Immediately after the order, the caretaker
government moved a petition for a stay of the order which the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court granted till 11:30 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The full bench of the Appellate Division today extended the
stay.
</P>
<P>
At a press function here today, JP presidium member and
chairman of the party's election steering committee Syed Tarek
said that "this government is not at all neutral and we clearly
apprehend that the June 12 elections will not be impartial, free
and fair."
</P>
<P>
Accusing the caretaker government of treating the JP in a
"step-motherly manner," Tarek said it was this government which
invited the JP to take part in the poll address to the nation, but
later created impediments so that it did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
The whole affair is a "conspiracy" to deprive the JP of the
rights and facilities, he said, adding that all parties are
entitled to take part in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Urges to Produce More Appealing Films (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
chief Jiang Zemin today urged the country's film industry to
produce more refined and appealing films.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the Chinese President and Chairman of the
Central Military Commission, made the remarks today when visiting
the well-known August First Film Studio. He was accompanied by
Ding Guangen, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, and several leading army officers.
</P>
<P>
The studio is the sole film producer of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, and is famous for producing epic military films.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met with a number of noted artists and watched many
historic pictures of the studio. He later made a speech in which
he said that more refined films will help promote China's film
industry, and are in the best interests of the country's socialist
culture.
</P>
<P>
The president said that since the studio was founded, it has
greatly contributed to Chinese film production, and has made many
good films which have educated and invigorated the Chinese people
through several generations.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the studio for its achievements in the
production of epic war films, which combine intellectual appeal
with artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
He said films are a comprehensive art form that is loved by the
people and therefore should play an important role in the
construction of socialist culture and ideology, and that
filmmakers are vital to the promotion of such construction.
</P>
<P>
"We should give a big push to our socialist culture and
ideology while doing a good job of our material civilization. This
is our resolute policy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is now building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and this is a time when new initiatives and ideas
are appearing.
</P>
<P>
He added that artists should devote all of their capabilities
and potential to their work, and that the army studio should have
higher goals for itself and achieve even more.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Attacks Israeli Forces in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they launched an attack
on an Israeli patrol in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This was the Hezbollah's second attack against the Israeli
occupation forces following a previous assault earlier this morning
in which five Israeli soldiers were killed and six others
wounded, causing an escalated tension in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, said that one group of its fighters mounted the attack
near the Israeli position of Barashit, Bint Jebeil, which is well
inside the buffer zone at 2:10 p.m. local time (11:10 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"The Mujahedeen (holy fighters) opened fire with machine guns
and rocket propelled grenades at the patrol, comprising an
armored personal carrier and a number of foot soldiers," the
statement added, noting that the Israeli troops suffered
casualties and damages.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli forces fired heavy artilleries at the
village of Majdel Salim, Marjayoun, at 2:30 p.m. local time (11:30
GMT), without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes hovered at low altitute over towns and
villages in southern Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The previous bloody ambush drew immediate Israeli retaliatory
bombardment, in which a Lebanese army sergeant was killed and
another civilian wounded when the van, which they were
driving on the road between the villages of Haboush and Arab
Salim, was hit and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces in the buffer enclave fired
more than 100 artillery shells at the areas of Nabatiyeh and
Iglim Al-Toffah this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that five Israeli
soldiers were killed and six others wounded in the dawn ambush,
which targeted an Israeli patrol near the Israeli position of
Dabsheh overlooking the southern Lebanese market town of
Nabatiyeh.

<HEADLINE> New Venue, More Entries for HK Dragon Boat Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As the Hong Kong international
dragon boat festival goes into the 20th anniversary, the races
scheduled for June 22-23 will be shifted to a new venue, with a
large field of participants.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the annual races are to be held on the
waters of the Shing Mun River, Sha Tin, which organizers claimed
to be calmer and flatter.
</P>
<P>
The races had been held within the Victoria Harbor between the
Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula. But the on-going
land-reclamation projects in the area pose difficulties and danger
to the races, which forced the venue shift.
</P>
<P>
The two-day, 15-event tournament has attracted 154 teams from
14 countries and regions, including 128 crews from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong races are to be followed by the Second Asian
championships, slated for June 24-25 at the same venue.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is to host the Second World Dragon Boat Racing
Championships next year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Africa for Multilateral Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin said today trade negotiations with Zimbabwe
should eventually lead to a wider multilateral accord for the
entire Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency in the
northern resort town of Victoria Falls where negotiations between
the two countries began today, Erwin said, "we have come here
with the intention of trying to get a solution that benefits both
countries. We are aware of the trade imbalances but we are also
looking for a wider SADC trade accord."
</P>
<P>
Erwin is leading a delegation of labor and employer
representatives who began negotiations under closed doors with
their Zimbabwean counterparts, led by Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Zimbabwe, Botswana and Zambia have also expressed
reservations about South Africa's punitive tariffs which, coupled
with its big market considered three times more than that of the
rest of the 12 SADC countries, have made it the dominant force.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is now being accused of dumping its cheap
products in the region. South Africa also dominates trading terms
within the South African Customs Union (SACU), which groups
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
It was for this reason that South Africa was now pushing for a
multilateral agreement rather than bilateral pacts, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said his government would discuss the first draft of a
multilateral trade agreement with other SADC ministers of trade
in South Africa this week.
</P>
<P>
"But we are keen to reach an agreement with Zimbabwe, which
is our biggest trading partner," he said.

<HEADLINE> US to Extend GSP to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines was assured by the
United States Congress favorable action on the extension of the
generalized system of preferences (GSP), a preferential or zero
duty privilege to exports from developing countries including the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista made these
remarks today following his recent meetings in Washington with
chairmen of both US Senate and Lower House committees on ways and
means.
</P>
<P>
"We got an assurance from the US Congress for the GSP
extension," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said that tax experts have already identify a clause
in the budgetary bill wherein the GSP provision can be attached.
</P>
<P>
The US Congress has been extending the GSP annually as a rider
in the federal budget following its failure to enact a separate
GSP law.
</P>
<P>
The US has extended for a year when the GSP expired in June
1994 and was granted another extension in July 1995, which
extension will lapse again this July.
</P>
<P>
"The US government is supportive of the extension of the GSP,"
Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the inclusion of the rider GSP provision
in the budget bill would largely depend on the political agenda of
the competing political parties positioning for the November
elections.

He asked the studio to make more good military films in an
effort to uphold patriotism and revolutionary heroism -- the great

</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged producers to make more films about the Chinese
revolution, the army's modernization, and the morale of army
officers and soldiers.

He called on the artists to study Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theories on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and to combine their art with everyday

their minds and have a wide range of knowledge, and absorb the
excellent culture of the Chinese nation and excellent culture of
the world.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Defense Reported Eating Up Demobilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Spiraling expenditure on defense
and public administration has virtually eaten up about 29 million
US Dollars the Ugandan government has saved from the army
demobilization exercise, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report was quoted by "The Monitor" as saying that
compared with the three years prior to the demobilization
(1989-92), the budgetary defense expenditure was 28.9 million
Dollars lower after demobilization (1992-95).
</P>
<P>
This amounted to an average of yearly savings of 9.6 million
Dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiary of the savings, however, was public
administration which increased by 53.1 percent and ironically
defense spending -- two areas which the country's structural
adjustment programs starting in 1987 were designed to trim,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In real terms, defense spending rose by 11.9 percent of
recurrent expenditure to about 41 million Dollars over the same
period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in military spending was largly attributed to wage
increase for the remaining soldiers as well as some limited
hiring of local defense units in northern Uganda to contain the
recurrent insurgency by the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA).
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently criticized
Uganda over its increased military expenditure during 1995/96
financial year, showing concern of the donor community.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increased expenditure on defense, expenditure
on priority have in recent years dropped about 10 percent in
Uganda.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian minister today called on
the young Zambians to adopt safer sexual practices to prevent
HIV/AIDS from further spreading.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Youth, Sport and Child Development Samuel Miyanda

</P>
<P>
Opening a five-day youth anti-AIDS seminar, Miyanda warned
that HIV/AIDS is spreading swiftly in Zambia especially among
young women and now about 500 young women are infected with

SHANTOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two counterfeit money smugglers
from Taiwan were sentenced to death and executed in Shantou in
south China's Guangdong Province today, while an accomplice was
sentenced to the death penalty, but received a two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhengde, Shi Yi and Chen Anjing, all from Penghu County in

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Leaves for Four-Nation Tour (by Huang Jianming) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for a four-nation tour that will take
him to Switzerland, the United States, Britain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking prior to his departure at the Larnaca airport,
Clerides said he would make contacts with the leaders of the four
countries for solving the Cyprus problem, but he did not expect
rapid developments concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the political situation and government
instability in Turkey, it is very difficult to expect that
there could be any rapid developments concerning the Cyprus
problem in the near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Turkey is such," the President noted,
"that does not allow room for optimism that the Turkish side
will take the necessary decisions to open the road towards a
solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that he did not expect the situation either
in Cyprus or in the Aegean area to deteriorate within 1996.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his scheduled June 18 meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Clerides said they will discuss the Cyprus problem
and regional problems, including Turkey and regional security
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. did not put forward the issue of
Greco-Turkish relations, even though, "dangerous tension between
Greece and Turkey would definitely influence the situation in
Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot President will meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali Tuesday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief had a similar meeting on Thursday in
Istanbul, Turkey, with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
After the Ghali-Denktash meeting, a U.N. spokesman said the
Secretary-General expressed the hope that it would be possible
to create the basis for the two community leaders to resume
direct talks and called on them to cooperate with his aides
"in order to create a new momentum in favor of a peaceful
solution to the Cyprus problem".
</P>
<P>
After a trip to Geneva, Clerides will fly to New York for
meetings with the representatives of the permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council and U.S. presidential emissary on Cyprus
Richard Beattie.

On June 18, he will hold talks in Washington with President
Clinton. He will also meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Ben Gillman, Chairman of the House Committee on
International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the president will hold talks in London
with British Prime Minister John Major and attend a dinner
with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
</P>
<P>
Then, he will proceed to Florence, Italy, to hold a
working meeting with the European Union Council.
</P>
<P>
In view of President Clerides' support-seeking mission abroad,
the island's National Council, the top advisory body to the
president on handling the Cyprus problem, convened a two-day
meeting at the weekend to discuss the latest developments in the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said after the
meeting that President Clerides would take into account the
views set out by the island's party leaders, during his
contacts in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is no change in President Clerides'
stance that a common ground should be found between the two
sides in Cyprus to allow a successful direct dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot official said President Clerides would explain,
during his talks in Europe and the U.S., the positions of
the Greek Cypriot side and its readiness to enter a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the thorny issue of the unmanning of areas where
Greek Cypriot National Guard positions are very close to the
positions of the Turkish troops, Cassoulides repeated President
Clerides' proposal for a broader unmanning agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' idea provides for the withdrawal of the Turkish
troops behind the occupied Mountain of Pentadaktylos, in the
northern part, and the National Guard forces behind the Troodos
Mountain, in the southern part of this East Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control of 37 percent of the island following
and Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
There have been no face-to-face meetings between the two
communities' leaders since a series of informal talks between
Clerides and Denktash in Nicosia in October, 1994, under the
U.N. auspices.

Agricultural experts argued that as the hail was short and the

<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's demobilization program
which started in 1992 to demobilize the country's national army
was a success, reported the local newspaper "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
A report of the World Bank was quoted as saying that the
program (1992-95) has resulted in the reduction of national army
by half from 90,000 soldiers in 1992 to 45,000 at the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The program implemented through the Uganda Veteran Assistance
Board cost about 49 million US Dollars and each veteran received
an average 1,000 Dollars in two phases for demobilization and
re-integration, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Only 159 veterans have been found guilty of some criminal act
which is 0.5 percent of all veterans," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Veterans are also seen by communities as deterrence to crime
and have been hired as security guards", especially following
their reinterpreting into the local defense units which were
formed last year by the central government in a bid to maintain
local security, the report said.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace talks,
codenamed "Mwanza 11", have been postponed for two weeks, "The
Guardian" newspaper of Tanzania reported today.
</P>
<P>
Retired Tanzanian president and facilitator of the talks
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere said on Sunday that the postponement
followed the refusal by Burundi's main opposition UPRONA to sign
a joint communique, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
UPRONA wanted the communique to declare the exiled National
Committee for Defense of Democracy (CNDD) and its military wing,
the FDB, to be responsible for the killings in Burundi, "The
Guardian" said.
</P>
<P>
UPRONA's demand was rejected by its rival FRODEBU.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also differ on the status of the conventional
government established after the killing of Melchior Ndadaye, a
Hutu who was the first democratically elected president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were killed in the tribal massacres that
followed his killing.
</P>
<P>
However, Nyerere said that he would not give up his mediation
efforts and was optimistic that dialogue would sooner or later
bring about a solution leading to a lasting peace in Burundi.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The seventh International
Congress for Infectious Diseases opened here tonight, pushing the
ongoing worldwide program -- the Year of the Vaccine to a climax.
</P>
<P>
The yearlong event, launched at the beginning of 1996, is to
mark the 200 anniversary of the discovery of vaccination by Edward
Jenner (1749-1823), a British physician who administered the first
vaccine in 1976 by using cowpox against smallpox.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the three-day Congress, a Jenner Symposium was
organized here this morning to retrospect the remarkable progress
that has been made in vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), smallpox,
being eradicated in 1979, become the first major disease that was
conquered by vaccine. "It is a major success of world public
health," said the WHO consultant Dr. Walter Dowdle, who attended
the pre-Congress seminar.
</P>
<P>
Polio is expected to disappear from the globe by the year of
2000. Since Jenner's time, vaccination has controlled nine
diseases -- small pox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever,
pertussis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella, said Dr. Walter.
</P>
<P>
Each year nine million lives are saved by vaccination,
according to sources from the United Nations' Children Foundation
(UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
As the highlight of the Year of the Vaccine event, the Congress
features world-known infectious disease authorities, who will
deliver keynote speeches at the five plenary sessions.
</P>
<P>
Presentations will address such topics as resistance to HIV,
traditional Chinese medicine for infectious diseases, as well as
rabies, cholera and sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, hosted by the International Society for
Infectious Diseases and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, has
drawn 5000 participants around the world.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Environment Improved Along Jinshajiang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The ecological environment along
the Jinshajiang river in southwest China's Yunnan Province has
improved steadily in recent years, thanks to the local
government's efforts in tree-planting and protection of vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Jinshajiang river, one of the mainstreams of the Yangtze river,
has a drainage area of 110,000 sq km, accounting for 28 percent of
the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
In the past the area's ecological environment deteriorated
because of long-term development and exploitation. With more than
40 percent of the area's soil eroded, more than two million local
people lived a life of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The province launched a large-scale ecological environment
treatment project in early 1980s, laying stress to the work of
controlling soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Special funds were allocated by the government for tree
planting, and a series of technological achievements used.
</P>
<P>
The shelter forest project for the Yangtze river, which was
launched in 1989, has put new vigor into the tree-planting
efforts. The province is injecting 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) into the project each year. It has afforested 304,666 ha
of land in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Attention has also been paid to protecting forest resources,
reducing the ill-effects made by the production activities of
people. By the end of last year 18 natural reserves had been set
up in the area.
</P>
<P>
The local forestry departments have also reduced the lumbering
quota steadily, bringing relief to forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable improvement has been achieved in the ecological
environment of the Jinshajiang river valley, where a group of
green industries have been developed.

BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A kiln for making tea-grinding
bowls, dating from the Sui Dynasty (581-618), has been found in

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funded Mining Industry Booms in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded mining industries
have witnessed rapid growth in Southwest China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has already registered 68 foreign funded mining
ventures, with 300 million U.S. dollars of contracted investments.
</P>
<P>
The development of granite of various varieties, natural
mineral waters for drinking, and large-scale limestone mines have
become a focus of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The granite and limestone materials produced by foreign-funded
ventures are usually supplied as raw materials to other ventures
for refined processing in China, and most of the processed
products are then sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
The foreign funded ventures also pay compensation fees to the
province for development of mineral resources.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Rejects Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has flatly refused to take in
a batch of over 450 Liberian and other west African refugees who
have been at sea for more than 10 days after failing to find any
country willing to accept them.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Ghanaian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas as saying that there was "no way it
can allow the Russian-registered vessel with refugees from
Liberia to dock at any port in Ghana".
</P>
<P>
Chamas denied international media reports that officials of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were
negotiating with Ghana about accepting the passengers of the
Zolotitsa, which set out from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, on
May 26.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been approached," he said, concluding: "They must
be imaging things."
</P>
<P>
Chambas warned that any vessel which docked at any Ghanaian
port without permission "would be seized and the captain of the
vessel arrested and prosecuted".
</P>
<P>
The ship was turned away from the Ghanaian port of Tema
four days after leaving Monrovia because the authorities
thought most of the refugees were Liberians and feared that
militia fighters were among them.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the vessel docked in Lome, capital of Togo, but was
towed out to sea two days later after taking on 10 tons of fuel
and 25 tons of food and water, according to the UNHCR.

<HEADLINE> Italian, French Leaders to Hold Talks on European Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new Prime Minister Romano
Prodi is scheduled to meet French President Jacques Chirac in
Paris today for talks on European issues, reports said here.
</P>
<P>
Top of the agenda in Prodi's first meeting with Chirac since
coming to power in May, will be how to get the single European
currency on track amid Europe-wide economic pessimism.
</P>
<P>
Overall economic confidence in Europe, hurt by worries over
jobs and slower production growth, slipped to 98.5 in May from
98.8 in the previous month, the European Commission's monthly
barometer showed last week.
</P>
<P>
Low growth and the impact of unemployment on government budgets
is making it difficult for some countries to get ready for the
launch of the single currency in January 1999. To qualify for
membership, European Union (EU) nations have to cut their budget
deficits and borrowing to 3 percent and 60 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss France's rapprochement with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after a 30-year
boycott of the U.S.-led trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
France has been bargaining its return to NATO's integrated
military command structure in exchange for NATO reform toward a
greater and more independent role for Europe within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Last week NATO agreed to set up a European wing of NATO with
the ability, under the command of the Western European Union, to
launch its own operations with American military assets but
without involving U.S. ground forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As the deadline for the blocking
of the Yangtze River by the Three Gorges Dam draws near, the State
Education Commission has provided 42 million yuan to aid
compulsory educational development in Wanxian City in Sichuan
province.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian City, which shoulders the heaviest resettlement task,
is busy rebuilding schools. The SEC has allocated 1.5 million yuan
for the housing of teachers and teachers' education in the city.
</P>
<P>
When the new reservoir is built, over 600 schools, with nearly
200,000 schoolchildren, in Sichuan and Hubei provinces will be
submerged.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the SEC one college has been set up in the
Wanxian City to meet the demands of students in the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
And the World Bank will grant a loan totaling 1.06 million US
dollars to Kaixian County in Sichuan province to develop
compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has launched an aid plan, which encourages 22
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across the
country and 45 departments, to help the Three Gorges area improve
basic education, teacher training, vocational and adult education
and technological training for evacuees by providing funds,
materials, teaching equipment and books.
</P>
<P>
The aid work will also involve training educational,
scientific, technological and economic workers, who are badly
needed in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of economic, technological and educational
development projects to the area is also being encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project involved building a 175-m-high dam
across the Yangtze, the longest river in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Tackle Urban Water Supply Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Water leaks in China's urban water
networks account for 20-30 percent of the total supplies,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The Jindi Water Leak Research Company, the first in the
country, has adopted advanced sound wave probe technology to
conduct the first survey of urban water leakage across the country.
</P>
<P>
The technology can detect more than 80 percent of the leakage
points in urban water supply networks, and it can position the
leakage points as precisely as within a square meter.
</P>
<P>
It can detect leakages immediately and find the reason and
volume of water loss, to effectively control the leaking of water.
</P>
<P>
It has become an urgent task for relevant departments to put an
end to water-leakages. For example if Wuhan city, the capital of
central China's Hubei province, reduced the volume of leaking
water by five percent, it will save water that it is an equivalent
of the production of a water supply factory with a capacity of
150,000 tons of water per day.
</P>
<P>
Training courses will be held to organize a large special
service force, and the technology used in the survey will be
widely spread, to gradually solve the problem across the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan,
China's largest special economic zone, is taking a series of
measures aimed at cementing its status as the country's most
opened area in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The measures include expanding investment areas, gradually
opening up sectors of finance, insurance, commerce and foreign
trade, adopting an internationally-recognized practice of free
trade zone, and making a breakthrough in giving national treatment
to overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The south China province will also open further its tropical
agriculture, tourism and marine industry to overseas investors,
while strengthening economic cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A frontier in China's opening up drive, Hainan became a special
economic zone in 1988 and the island's Yangpu area was the first
economic development zone where foreign investors contracted large
tracts of land for development.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the island utilized 1.46 billion US dollars of
overseas investment and clinched deals involving dozens of
projects ranging from airport, automobile and paper pulp
developments to oil refining. Its flag-carrier, Hainan Airlines,
became the first joint-venture airway in China.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period, Hainan plans to attract up to 10
billion US dollars in overseas investment to beef up its
infrastructural building.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hainan was designated as an experimental
base for farming cooperation across the Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> National Meet of Combine Harvesters in Summer Harvest (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten major wheat producing areas in
north China are sharing their combined harvesters, taking
advantage of time differences in harvests to make the fullest
possible use of limited expensive farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
The move, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, involves
Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi and Hebei provinces, Inner
Mongolia and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions as well as Beijing and
Tianjin Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20,000 combine harvesters will travel half of
China to gather summer crops on 1.7 million ha of land this
year. This will bring the acreage of wheat harvested by machine
tools in China to 14.6 million ha, making up half of the national
wheat growing area.
</P>
<P>
Inter-province harvesting was initiated in Henan and Hebei
provinces in 1993 and then spread to the entire north and
northeast China as a new form of service in mechanizing China's
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo praised
inter-regional cooperation in summer harvest as "a pioneering act
which can push forward China's farm mechanization."
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province, a wheat producing giant, is arranging 3,800
harvesters to participate in inter-regional harvest this year. A
stream of combine harvesters is marching from western Shaanxi to
the province's eastern side where wheat ripens first. Hebei
Province will mobilize 1.8 million farm machines for the summer
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Well over 10,000 harvesters from Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi and
Shaanxi provinces have arrived in central China's Henan Province,
where the summer harvest has began.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- All ministers in the last
civilian government "will in under a month from now be given an
opportunity to apply for redress" from a new commission of
inquiry to be set up in July, Justice Minister Solomon Berewa
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The civilian government was toppled in 1992 and the military
government immediately set up three commissions of inquiry to
probe all ministers and selected top civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Berewa said in an interview that the new commission will be
headed by a judge, whose name was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We would like an impartial judge to look at the evidence from
an independent standpoint, totally free of prejudices and
affections," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will also be extended to others affected by
white papers of commissions of inquiry held during the first
military regime of Brigadier Andrew Juxon Smith in 1967 and 1968
and who lost jobs and property to the state," according to the
justice minister.
</P>
<P>
When the white papers of the commissions of inquiry set up
under the military government were published some two years ago,
there were widespread allegations of "selective justice" and high
incidence of extra judicial decisions made against some former
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Toppled president Momoh and scores of his ministers had their
houses confiscated and stripped of all national awards with some
barred for life from holding public offices.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Developing New Powerful Astronomical Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are developing
a new astronomical telescope with a capability of observing
celestial spectrums raised to ten times over existing telescopes.
</P>
<P>
The spectrum of celestial bodies contain the most amount of
information on the cosmos, so spectral observation serves as a key
method in astrophysical studies, astronomical optics specialist Su
Dingqiang said.
</P>
<P>
Su, a scientist at Nanjing Astronomical Instrument Development
Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is working on the
new telescope together with Wang Shouguan, another astronomer with
CAS.
</P>
<P>
The new optical astronomical telescope will have large aperture
and large field of view, and as a result, it will be able to
observe a lot more celestial bodies, they said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, American and European scientists have invested
billions of dollars to develop large-aperture telescopes, but the
field of view is small and the number of celestial bodies which
can be observed is limited.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand existing telescopes with large fields of view
poorly observe dim celestial objects, the Chinese scientists
said.

<HEADLINE> National Meet of Combine Harvesters in Summer Harvest (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma Yuangui, a villager in Xingyang County, Henan, said,
"combine harvesters can cut short the time of harvesting, save
labor and reduce grain losses."
</P>
<P>
Ma, 50, has two sons who used to return home to help gathering
grain crops though they were busy at township-run factories.
</P>
<P>
"There was no need to call them back this year as a reaper
gathered in 0.4 ha. of wheat within half a day. I paid 210 yuan
for the reaper charge, much less than the cost in previous years,"
Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Inter-province cooperation in summer harvesting has provided
harvester owners a golden opportunity to make a fortune.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xibao has driven his combine all the way to central
China's Henan to help with harvesting this year from his native
town in northernmost Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"I have travelled seven or eight provinces over the past two
years. It's very likely I will earn 40,000 yuan this summer as
government departments supply us low-price diesel oil and demand
no charge for road and bridge tolls," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that departments of agriculture,
communications, price control and public security in all wheat
growing areas will provide every possible help to harvester
drivers.
</P>
<P>
Agro-economists agree that inter-province harvesting can save
labor, reduce grain loss, accelerate the process of mechanization
and pave way for the development of rural industry and service
trade.
</P>
<P>
However, the supply of harvesters is still far behind the
growing demand. Henan needs 60,000 combine harvesters to reap its
4.8 million ha of wheat. But only 10,000 harvesters are on hand so
far this year. This offers an ample scope for the development of
farm mechanization in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ancient tombs and the site of tile
kilns have been found along a highway under construction in south
China's Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> HK to Close a VM Detention Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Government
announced today that the Tai A Chau Detention Center for
Vietnamese migrants (VM) will be closed in September.
</P>
<P>
"As the VM population decreases, it is a logical step to
consolidate the population into fewer camps under unified
management of the Correctional Services Department," a government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current total number of Vietnamese migrants is
16,000, which does not justify maintaining three camps. The annual
 management contract and related costs for maintaining Tai A Chau,
 now holding 5,600 VMs, amount to over 55 million HK dollars (7.05
 million US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged all the VMs to join the voluntary
repatriation program as soon as possible, certainly by June 30,
the deadline for application for the US "Resettlement Opportunity
for Vietnamese Returnees Scheme."
</P>
<P>
"Their only future lies in returning to Vietnam," he said.
</P>
<P>
All the VMs in Tai A Chau Detention Center will be transferred
to Whitehead Detention Center in September.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Orderly Repatriation Program is now conducted
at a monthly rate of at least 600 and more VMs have volunteered to
 return, the spokesman said the camp population was expected to be
 reduced at a faster pace over the coming months.

<HEADLINE> Non-Throat Man Utters Thanks to Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A doctor at Shanghai Central
Railway Hospital has helped over 500 people without throats to
escape a world of silence.
</P>
<P>
"Doctor Hu Jiyun made my life bright again," boomed a
66-year-old man, Lu Jialiang, who was among the first of patients,
trained by Doctor Hu in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Lu learned in Dr. Hu's training class how to use his esophagus
instead of his throat to speak, and returned to his work, healthy
and happy.
</P>
<P>
Throat cancer patients suffer from always being listeners but
never speakers after they have had their throats removed, said
Doctor Hu.
</P>
<P>
She had been trying to find a way for non-throat patients to
speak since she happened to hear a throatless patient hiccup and
hit upon the idea that they may be able to produce sounds through
the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
She opened the first training class in October of 1978 and
began to teach patients to speak with the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
First, the patients have to learn to inhale the air into their
esophagus and hiccup, then they can learn to pronounce some simple
words, and then phrases and sentences, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
She said 78 percent of the patients in her classes can use the
new method to speak within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Her "esophagus speaking method", which brings less trouble and
no pain to the patients, compared with using artificial throats,
was recognized as the best way to enable the non-throat people to
speak at an international throat cancer symposium last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the success of the method depends on the patient's
psychological and physical condition, and the quality of the
removal operation.
</P>
<P>
She usually begins to train the patients to hiccup before the
operation. This will make it easier for them to speak with their
esophagus after they lose their throats, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hu has trained a group of young doctors to expand the use of
"esophagus speaking method". She is planning to establish a
non-throat people's association in Shanghai to help more
non-throat people.

<TEXT>
<P>
The president's office in a statement issued here today,
described recent statements and speeches of some political leaders
as "most unfortunate, false, irresponsible and motivated."
</P>
<P>
The said political leaders alleged recently on some newspapers
that the president had been conspiring to rig the elections in
favor of a party by using different organizations sitting at the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Since May 20 when ex-chief of army staff A. S. M. Nasim was
sacked and put under house arrest for allegedly attempted mutiny
against the caretaker government, the former largest opposition
party -- the Awami (people's) League has accused the president of
keeping the defense portfolio in hands to serve BNP's conspiracy
to foil or rig the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
The president's office has drawn attention to the allegations,
the statement said, adding that the office of the head of state is
absolutely neutral and the president himself becomes totally
impartial in a democratic system as soon as he is elected as the
president.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian man killed his wife and
four children by pouring gasoline over them and setting them
ablaze with an aim to facilitate his third marriage, a local
daily reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Iran" reported that the man, identified as
Mirzaqoli Naderi, ran away after the incident which occurred
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the man killed his wife and children
because his 30-year-old wife refused to permit him to marry another
woman.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Mehrnoosh Moti'e, was suffocated to death in the
incident. She had been the man's second wife with four children in
ages ranging from six to 14.
</P>
<P>
A fire department official said that fire-fighters rushed to
the scene and found the five victims had already died of
suffocation and burns.
</P>
<P>
According to sources familiar with the family, the man used
to subject his wife to physical abuse and beatings. In another
incident, he even tried to bury her alive, however, she had
managed to escape in a miraculous way.

<HEADLINE> Ershad Barred from Making Poll Speech Through Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's appellate division of
the Supreme Court today ruled that the jailed ex-president H. M.
Ershad is not allowed to make speech over radio and television for
contesting the coming June 12 general elections.
</P>
<P>
No details are available at the moment, but a reliable source
said that the Supreme Court made the decision after careful
examination of a order of the High Court Sunday, which allowed for
Ershad's radio-TV speech by tonight.
</P>
<P>
The High Court Sunday directed the Ministry of Home, the
Ministry of  Information and the Election Commission to record
Ershad's speech and air it on TV and radio along with the speeches
of other political party leaders within the scheduled time after
hearing a writ petition filed by a presidium member of Ershad's
Jatiya (national) Party (JP).
</P>
<P>
But the appellate division of the Supreme Court afterwards
passed a stay order till 11:30 a.m. today for further examination.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who took power in 1982 and was forced to step down at
the end of 1990, has been serving terms in the Dhaka Central Jail
for corruption since 1990.
</P>
<P>
As the chairman of the JP, Ershad has been allowed to contest
in five of the 300 constituencies during the upcoming elections,
according to the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Abandoned Siberian Tigers Adopted By Wolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Siberian Tiger cubs, abandoned
by their mother, are thriving after being adopted by a pair of
wolves.
</P>
<P>
The young tigers are happily spending the remaining few days
of their lactation period with the help of the two wolves in
China's Dalian Forest Zoo in northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Eight-year old Siberian tiger, Baobao, gave birth to the two
male Siberian tigers in Dalian Forest Zoo on May 2.
</P>
<P>
At that time the zoo was being moved to a new home, and the
habitat for tigers was not completed. Baobao had to give birth to
the cubs in a simple shelter. The births happened on a rainy day
and the sensitive and suspicious Baobao left her two cubs.
</P>
<P>
To protect the two baby tigers, workers at the zoo found two
wolf dogs to breast feed the cubs. The two wolves themselves bore
four cubs on the day the baby tigers were born.
</P>
<P>
The two baby Siberian tigers now each have eight teeth. Their
mother Baobao has become pregnant again and is living happily at
her new home.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Forest Zoo now has 12 Siberian tigers, five males and
seven females.

<HEADLINE> 12th Trial Session of 2 Former S. Korean Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The 12th trial session on mutiny and
treason charges involving former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo was held at the Seoul District Court here
today.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
nine close aides.
</P>
<P>
During today's trial, Chun admitted that he and his close aides
formulated the crisis management plan in May 1980, but again
rejected the prosecution's charges that the aim of their move was
to usurp the power.
</P>
<P>
Chun said that the plan was prepared on the basis of an idea
proposed by Kwon Jong-dal, then chief intelligence officer of the
Defense Security Command.
</P>
<P>
Kwon recommended that the National Assembly be dissolved and
the then martial law rule be extended throughout the country to
quell the political crisis stemming from student demonstrations,
Chun said, adding that acting President Choi Kyu-hah approved the
plan so that Kwon's recommendation could be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Special Committee for National Committee
Measures was a crisis-management team intended to perform
administrative functions of the government under a martial law.
"During the days of President Park Chung-hee, I personally got his
approval to form just such a group for emergencies," Chun added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their roles in
the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the military
crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the
country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo who
stepped down in February 1993.

<P>
YINCHUAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have agreed
that the capital city of the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) lay
in the present-day old city area of Yinchuan, capital of northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, in 1038, headed by Li Yuanhao,
people of Dangxiang ethnic group living in the present-day
northwest China founded the Western Xia Dynasty and chose Xingqing
city as the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Western Xia State covered parts of the present-day Ningxia,
Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Shaanxi Province and Inner
Mongolia. It was ruled by ten emperors for 189 years.
</P>
<P>
It was in Xingqing that the written language and rituals of the
Western Xia Dynasty were created, archaeologists noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chengtian Temple Tower in southwestern Yinchuan is the only
historical place that can prove that Yinchuan served as the
capital of the Western Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
But archaeologists have not determined the exact size and
layout of Xingqing City.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cave Families Say It's Home, Sweet Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China has found a novel way to
cure its drastic shortage of house building land. It is developing
space-age caves for thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40 million cave dwellers still exist in China,
mainly centered on the Loess Plateau in the country's northwestern
parts.
</P>
<P>
A team of Chinese architects have joined forces to bring a
breath of fresh air to the traditional caves, used by generations
of families. They are bringing the centuries old caves into the
late 20th century - with a host of "mod cons".
</P>
<P>
Traditional cave dwellings were relatively cheap and damp, and
stifling - not the usual image of "home, sweet home".
</P>
<P>
As cave dwellers made their fortunes on new ventures they
started to vacate their caves in droves, opting for traditional
brick-built homes, a trend that worried many architects.
</P>
<P>
The exodus has put a tremendous strain on limited arable land,
being eaten up by housing developments.
</P>
<P>
The old caves, dug out of the loess, are one of the traditional
types in China, mostly favored by northwesterners for low costs
and the amicable temperature inside. There are now some 40 million
Chinese living in various kinds of cave buildings.
</P>
<P>
To adapt caves to the present-day needs, Ren Zhenying, joined
hands with a number of other Chinese architects and improved
traditional caves with modern conveniences and craftsmanships.
</P>
<P>
They successfully solved problems related to ventilation,
lighting, dampness and shock absorption, and built a number of
"modernized caves" in Gansu, Henan and Shanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Their caves neither occupy arable land nor do harm to
hillsides, and can make full use of solar energy. In addition,
they cost only half that of the brick buildings with equal areas.
</P>
<P>
The new types of cave buildings have attracted the attention
from the international architectural circles. Inspired by the
new-type caves, architects from the United States and France have
invented "solar energy-heated mud-brick villas".
</P>
<P>
"Modernization does not necessarily mean high-rises or
skyscrapers," said Ren Zhenying, a noted expert in urban
construction planning in his 80s.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that population explosion, shrinking energy
resources and environmental pollution have become international
concerns, and many developed nations are "returning to the
underground" for space.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese caves, being an efficient way to develop
and make use of shallow underground space, is of significance in
saving arable land, energy resources and protecting the
environment.
</P>
<P>
But traditional cave dwellings, relatively damp and stifling,
are not perfect, and that is why cave dwellers are seeking to
improve their living conditions, experts pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Better Packaging Project to Be Launched in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million Kwacha packaging
project aimed at helping local industries improve their packaging
system, particularly for their exports, is to be launched in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) in conjunction
with the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) is to embark on the
project, the "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted ZAM Chairman Mark O'Donnel as saying in
an interview, "this project will help Zambian manufacturers have
high quality package for their goods especially those in the food
processing industry to favorably compete at international
level."
</P>
<P>
O'Donnel noted that Zambian goods, especially food, were of
high quality but Zambian food stuffs could not compete favorably
on the international market because they were poorly packed.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Zambian goods are properly packed, they will
continue performing poorly on the international export market,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The project would be funded by the European Union and that all
consultations and implementation of this project were being done
by the export development program of EBZ, according to O'Donnel.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 19 Arab Countries Agree to Attend Cairo Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen Arab countries including
the Palestinian Authority have agreed to attend the Arab summit
due to be held in Cairo on June 21-23, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will continue to hold
consultations today with Arab leaders on the agenda of the summit,
which is aimed at restoring Arab solidarity and saving the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world,
will not be invited to participate in the summit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Egypt's English-language newspaper
The Egyptian Gazette today, Mubarak said that the tripartite
summit held in Damascus, Syria, on June 7-8 decided to exclude
Baghdad from the summit to avoid any snags that could impede the
convocation of the long-awaited summit.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, the situation is extremely sensitive and the
wounds of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait haven't been healed yet,"
Mubarak was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia issued the call for the Cairo
summit after their two-day meeting in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said Egypt would invite Sudan to attend the
summit. Relations between the two countries have been strained
since an assassination attempt on Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa in
June, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accuses Sudan of masterminding the attack, while Sudan
has rejected the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in the interview that Egypt always transcends
disagreements when Arab interests are at stake, adding that the
Arab countries are facing dramatic developments which require them
to cooperate more closely to evolve a comprehensive Arab strategy
to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab leaders had held a series of bilateral and
tripartite summits this month as apprehensions gripped the Arab
world following the victory of right-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu in the Israeli elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
Omani Sultan Qaboos bin Said was due in Cairo today for talks
with Mubarak on the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has promised to take a tougher line than that of his
predecessor Shimon Peres in Israel's peace negotiations with the
Palestinians and Syria, thus jeopardizing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Mubarak played down the hardline statements
by Netanyahu, emphasizing that Israel will never be allowed to
mould Middle East affairs to suit its desires.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said Netanyahu, who has expressed
willingness to resume the peace process, will visit Cairo after he
ends his visit to Washington scheduled for the end of
July. Mubarak, during his U.S. visit, will hold talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, as a co-sponsor of the Arab-Israeli
peace process, welcomed the convocation of the Cairo summit.

<HEADLINE> Tea Workers Call Off Strike in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 workers of the Toro
Mityana Tea Cooperation (TAMTECO) in Kabarole District, western
Uganda, called off a sit-down strike last Friday, a report
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The workers demanded about 100 percent pay-rise and an
increase in their annual leave, the report said, adding they were
striking for a daily wage of one US Dollar. The management
offered them only 0.58 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted their leave increased from 22 days to 38,
including weekends. Another demand was that weekly man hours
should be reduced from 48 to 40.
</P>
<P>
The one-week strike starting in June this year paralyzed tea
processing at the company's factories, forcing management to hire
manual labour on Sunday and Matyrs's Day, June 3, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of striking workers had come back to work but
their demands had not yet been met, the reported added.
</P>
<P>
The company is now waiting for a ruling from the industrial
court before it can increase the workers' pay, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Maize Stockpile Set to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is estimated to keep
600,000 tonnes of maize as strategic reserve stocks to allow for
its export commitments, according to a regional food security
report.
</P>
<P>
A bumper maize harvest of 2.63 million tonnes is expected in
the country but the nation, recovering from the 1995 drought, has
to rebuild its strategic stocks which should be kept between
500,000 and 936,000 tonnes every year.
</P>
<P>
The Harare-based Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
Early Warning Unit said in its latest bulletin, Zimbabwe would
have a maize surplus of 210,000 tonnes after consumption needs
and the strategic stocks are considered.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1.53 million tonnes of the staple maize
crop would be delivered mainly through the Grain Marketing Board
while the rest will be retained by the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"It is assumed that the eventual size of the strategic
reserves will stand at 600,000 tonnes to allow for exports," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is likely to be exporting grain to other countries in
the region which have maize shortfalls ranging from 21,000 tonnes
in Swaziland to 383,000 tonnes in Angola.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Large Hotel Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 1,000 hotels
to cater for overseas tourists in the coming five years, the China
National Tourism Administration announced today.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the country having more than 4,500 tourist hotels
by the year 2000, including 2,800 star-rated hotels, with a total
of 650,000 rooms.
</P>
<P>
The effort is to cater for the demands of a growing number of
overseas visitors and tourists, according to Li Renzhi, deputy
director of the Planning and Statistics Department of CNTA.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism industry picked up in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country had more than 46 million overseas
tourists putting China in the sixth place in world as a holiday
destination. Foreign currency earnings of 8.7 billion US dollars
from tourism ranked ninth in the world.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the number
of overseas visitors in the country is expected to increase by
three to four percent annually, and that of domestic tourists,
eight to ten percent, CNTA predicts.
</P>
<P>
Business travellers will contribute a major share of the
increase, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the year 2000 will see more than 54 million
overseas tourists visiting China. The number of domestic tourists
will reach one billion in the country.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the current number of Chinese hotels cannot meet
the demands of such a great number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reforms and opening up to the outside
world over the five-year period, hotel building will be speeded
up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangrui, a tourism expert with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, noted that another 1,000 hotels is not a large
number, on the basis that the number of cities in China is large
and increasing, so each city will just add a few hotels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Tap Riches Through Laboring Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Young farmers in Lujiazhuang
Village of north China's Hebei Province have become prosperous by
laboring abroad, earning the village six million US dollars over
the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 farmers from the village in Dingzhou City of the
province have already had the experience of offering their labor
services in Singapore, Japan, Russia, Mauritius and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Lujiazhuang, located some 100 km south of Beijing with average
per capita farmland acreage of merely 0.13 ha, was once a poor
village.
</P>
<P>
But things changed some 10 years ago when farmer Li Zhenying
organized a construction team in his village which later extended
its business from home to abroad.
</P>
<P>
Their first adventure abroad was in 1984 with only nine
volunteers. But one year later, they returned home with the
fortunes they gained, including motorcycles, color TVs and an
income of 20,000 yuan for each laborer. This encouraged more
villagers to labor abroad.
</P>
<P>
So far half of the total households in the village have had the
experiences of working abroad. They have enriched not only
themselves but the whole village, handing over a total of six
million US dollars for the benefit of the village over the past
ten years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the laborers are now running their own factories or
transportation businesses with the money they earned abroad.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Says It Supports Collective Arab Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, the
regent, has said that Jordan supports the proposed collective
Arab action while taking into consideration the particularities
and priorities of all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince, in comments carried by the Jordan News
Agency, Petra, said Sunday that Jordan sees the Arab summit which
will be held in Cairo on June 21-23 as a move to support the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom believes that all countries of the region,
including Iran and Turkey, must contribute to that process, said
Hassan, the English-language daily, Jordan Times, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call for the summit was issued Saturday by Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Syria after a mini-summit in Damascus attended by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who hosted one of last week's three preliminary
meetings of Arab leaders, was the first to announce he would
attend the Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
The regent expressed hope that the summit would tackle the
issue of "comprehensive security" in the region, including the
security of the Arab Gulf states, through a "comprehensive,
complementary policy that will steer us away from the policy of
"closed axes and limited alliances."
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan had always rejected the "policies of
alliances and axes."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the future of the peace process in light of
Israel's right-wing Likud Party's return to power, Crown Prince Hassan
said that positions "should be based on the stands of countries
and not on the basis of election campaigns."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu's call for a new Madrid conference, the crown prince
said that "Everybody in this area should work toward consolidating
the process of building the peace that has been achieved and not
toward going back to the starting point."

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Three major Israeli religious
parties are meeting today to discuss a list of coalition
guidelines which they will present to the talks with Likud on
forming the new government.
</P>
<P>
The Shas, National Religious Party (NRP) and United Torah
Judaism (UTJ) are to hold a joint meeting to discuss a wish list
of coalition guidelines drawn up by NRP's Hanan Porat.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 days, the three orthodox parties have been
struggling to form a united front ahead of holding serious talks
with the Likud party on forming a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Top on Porat's wish list is the demand that neither a
Palestinian state nor any foreign sovereignty will be established
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The list also includes clauses of opposing negotiations over
the status of Jerusalem, making no concession on Golan Heights
and rejecting any attempt to uproot Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
It urges the new government to close all Palestinian
institutions in east Jerusalem, where the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the Arab neighborhoods will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the list calls for strengthening the Jewish
settlements in Hebron, the flashpoint town of Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts, and discussing the Israeli troops' redeployment only
in the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords, the
redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron should have been
completed in late March, but it has been delayed due to the
earlier Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this wish list, the NRP already drew up another
document dealing with religion-state issues, which demanded
reversal of the religious status quo to that before 1992.
The Likud has signalled to reject such a demand which has
raised grave concern among the secular and non-orthodox
communities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the political demands put up by the religious
bloc seem to be in line with the draft policy guidelines
drwan up last week by the Likud party, which oppose
establishment of a Palestinian state, concession of sovereignty
over the Golan Heights and division of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Likud also decided to expand Jewish settlements on
Golan Heights and other places in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has rejected these guidelines as
"declaration of war", warning the implementation of them would
lead to the revival of Intifada, or Arab uprising.
</P>
<P>
Syria has also warned that any shift of policies from the
outgoing Labor government, which had held peace talks over
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, could plunge the
Middle East into "tension and violence."

<HEADLINE> China Maps Large Hotel Plan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time the construction of high-grade hotels has been
under strict state control. But now it is the appropriate time to
slightly relax the restrictions, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Last year the aggregate revenues of catering-foreign-tourists
hotels in China reached 63.61 billion yuan, up 16 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
China, with the fastest economic growth in the world, will
remain a hot spot for investors and tourists in the future, said
Michael V. Paulin, chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association.
</P>
<P>
"There are still not enough hotels in China", the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts about 3,700 tourist hotels.
</P>
<P>
According to CNTA, the newly added hotels will be located in
some center cities, newly-opened areas, and new scenic areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to cater to CNTA's idea of shifting the focus of
expanding tourism from east to west, the bulk of the new hotels
will be built in the central and western parts of the country,
especially on such well-known tourist routes as the "Silk Road",
CNTA revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the amount of overseas and domestic funding
for hotel construction remained balanced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He notes that China will continue to welcome overseas
enterprises and business people to invest in hotels in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
While developing its own hotel management groups, the country
will also introduce experience and personnel from foreign hotel
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's hotel industry is one of the earliest
industries that have neared international standards, thanks to
help from international hotel groups.

LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- German soccer team, one of the
favourites to win the European Soccer Championships trophy,
trashed the Czech national team 2-0 in the opeing match of the
Group C at the Old Trafford Stadium in Manchester.

<P>
The Germans, who dominated the match, opened the scoring at

20-yard shot past the Czech goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, the German team launched another wave of
counterattacks and German international star Andy Moeller scored
an almost identical goal.

injured in his right ankle.

<P>
Hohler limped off in the 14th minute after a challenge on
Czech striker Pavel Kuka and he is expected to fly back to Germany
for an operation tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
German coach Berti Vogts told reporters that Kohler's injurry
is a heavy blow to the German team, saying "It has hurt Juergen
and it has hurt us even more".

"What makes it worse is that he had prepared really hard for
Euro '96 and he is one the best man-to-man makers in the world,"
the German coach added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kohler, who has said Euro '96 would be his last
major tournament, did not blamed the Czech striker, "unfortunately
stepped on my knee in the tackle, but it was completely
uninternational."

<HEADLINE> Power Struggle Looms Up in Israel's Labor Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak has launched a campaign to advance the election of the Labor
Party's leader and candidate for next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Party leader and Prime Minister Shimon Peres has asked for
some time to reorganize and consider his next moves since
election defeat.
</P>
<P>
Barak has on several occasions made it clear that he is
determined to run for the party leadership. Interior Minister
Haim Ramon is also known to have an eye on the post.
</P>
<P>
Barak has called for a meeting of Labor's members of Knesset
(parliament) this afternoon to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, Housing Minister Ben-Eliezer
and Justice Minister David Liba'i are expected to attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Peres, Minister at Prime minister's Office Yossi Beilin,
Tourism Minister Uzi Baram, Health Minister Ephraim Sneh and
Public Security Minister Moshe Shahak are not likely to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Barak wants to hold Labor's leadership showdown in about six
months, instead of waiting until next summer, as was earlier
suggested by Labor Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, the Israeli finance minister rejected the
notion that the meeting would in any way undermine Peres'
leadership, and denied any intention of "pushing Peres out of the
leadership or crowding him to a timetable he is not interested in."
</P>
<P>
Shohat revealed that he, Barak, Ben-Eliezer and Liba'i have
been holding consultations for several weeks. "We need to set a
political agenda based on the situation we are now in. As a party
in opposition we need to get organized for the long term and elect
our candidate for prime minister within a year, according to
Labor's constitution," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "We are not setting up a camp. We are a group of
political people and we need to discuss things. Most of the
party's Knesset members will be at the meeting, and we are not
closing the door to others' joining us."
</P>
<P>
Shohat said that he himself will not contest the party
leadership and sees his new role as rehabilitating and
reorganizing the party.
</P>
<P>
As for the internal fighting in Labor over the electoral
defeat, Shohat said he opposes any kind of inquiry or
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can analyze things for himself," he said.

Iran of interfering in that country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with today's Persian daily Iran, he said that
Bahrain's problems are internal, expressing hope that officials in
that country would correct their blunder by not attributing their
own domestic problems to foreign elements.
</P>
<P>
Maleki, who recently visited the four Persian Gulf states of
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, said that Tehran officially
recognized Bahrain immediately after it gained its independence
from Iran, adding that Iran has always respected Manama's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the root causes of the popular protests in
Bahrain relate to the political structure of the state, the
people's non-participation in the decision-making process and
economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
To link their domestic problems with foreign elements, he
added, Bahraini officials last week forced some persons, who were
said to be from the opposition, to claim on television that they
had connections with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his recent visit to Manama, he was
given two files by Bahrain officials, the first containing
reports of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (Iranian
Radio and Television) concerning developments in this tiny Persian
Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Maleki said he explained to Bahraini authorities that the
reports were from western sources and news agencies.
</P>
<P>
The second file consisted of interviews conducted by the Voice
of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iranian Radio) with some members
of Bahrain's opposition.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he stressed to Bahrain officials that
the interviews were with persons who lived in Britain and who
have been interviewed by other world media, including those in
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Manama openly accused Tehran of being behind a
plot to topple the government amid a wave of unrest in the
Persian Gulf archipelago since December 1994 in which 22 people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Bahrain have been degraded from
ambassador level to the level of charge d'affaires after the two
governments withdrew their ambassadors from each other's country
recently.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Set High Target for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese tourism department
has set out a specific goal to receive 3 to 4 million tourists
from abroad and 11 million in the country by the year 2000,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) quoted a tourism official as announcing
today.
</P>
<P>
Bui Xuan Nhat, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam National
Administration of Tourism, said that the number of foreign
tourists to Vietnam had increased on an annual average of
approximately 40 percent during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
During 1995, there were 1.3 million foreign visitors to
Vietnam, mainly from Taiwan, Japan, France, the United States and
Britain. This was five times greater than that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As the people's living standards have greatly improved, the
number of domestic tourists is therefore rising fast as well. In
1995, there were 5.5 million Vietnamese travelling within the
country.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the growing demand of tourists, Nhat said,
the tourism industry in Vietnam has mobilized foreign and local
resources, concentrating on quantity as well as quality, to
develop tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the number of hotel rooms increased on an
annual average of 30 percent. By the end of 1995, 160 projects
have been granted investment licences capitalizing at over 4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To date, Vietnam has signed 12 agreements on tourism
cooperation with all southeast Asian countries, China, France,
Uzbekistan and Israel, and it is prepared to enter into agreement
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam attributed those "initial but encouraging achievements"
to peace and stability within the country and in the region,
favourable international conditions which all act as premises for
the development of tourism in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Most Tibetan People Content with State Policies (6) Eds: This is the last of the six stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A sample survey in the Tibet
Autonomous Region has shown that most Tibetans support state
policies, saying they have benefitted from them a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Outlook magazine reports the survey in its
latest issue published here today.
</P>
<P>
Their report is based on the survey of 100 Tibetan families in
pastoral, agricultural and urban areas conducted by the China
Tibetology Research Center between May and November last year.
</P>
<P>
After 1984 Tibetan herdsmen and farmers have been allowed to
keep domestic animals and farmland for themselves for a long
period of time, but this used to be regarded as capitalism.
</P>
<P>
During the survey in a farming village in Gyangze County and a
pastoral village in Amdo County, 100 percent of the respondents in
the former village and 88.9 percent of the respondents in the
latter village hold the view that Tibet has witnessed a fast
growth after 1984 and this is the best period of development in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that old Tibetan people, who experienced the
periods of slavery and feudalism, peaceful liberation of Tibet and
democratic reform in their early days, are most content with
current policies of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lhago, a 57-year-old herdsmen in Amdo County recalled that
before Tibet's democratic reform in 1959, his parents labored for
a rich family and but could not make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays he and his family members are leading a wealthy life
by raising livestock. In 1994 per capita income of the household
stood at as high as 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"In the past I could never imagine a happy life like this. I
thank very much the Communist Party," Lhago said.
</P>
<P>
Soinam Cering is a 64-year-old resident in the Lugu Community
of Lhasa. He became a slave of a bureaucratic family when he was
only three, and was sold to another bureaucrat when he was 11.
</P>
<P>
"My life has changed considerably over the past dozen years,"
Lhago said. He has bought a three-room apartment, a
black-and-white and a color TV, a tape recorder, a camera, as well
as religious items.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the Communist Party that brought about his
present happy life with abundant food and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that 93.2 percent of the Tibetans know
about the state's policy of free religious belief and and 82.2
percent of the Tibetans know about the policy of quality among the
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
And 79.8 percent of the respondents know that there are schools
and classes in the country's inland areas which recruit Tibetan
students, 66.7 percent know the national program to aid Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of respondents believe such policies are good.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that officials at various governments
enjoy high respect from the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, 62.3 percent of respondents are willing to ask
officials to help cope with difficulties and disputes, and few
people go to lamas for help.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed in a
drive-by shooting late Sunday night just outside Moshav Zecharya
in central Israel, while a baby in the car was uninjured, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred Sunday night at about 11:15 p.m. local
time (20:10 GMT) when some twenty bullets were fired from a
passing-by vehicle at the car driven by Yaron and Efrat Engar, a
couple from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 bullets hit the front windscreen of the car, in
which the couple were later found dead, while their baby, less
than one year's old sitting at the backseat of the car, was
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefez said that the police
assumed the shooting was a terror attack, and they believed that
the terrorists' vehicle fled to the direction of Hebron, some 20
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Police have been searching for a white Mitsubishi car that was
reportedly fled towards Hebron, and roadblocks were set up with
widespread search carrying out in the area.
</P>
<P>
This was the first attack on Israelis since the country's
general elections on May 29, during which right-wing Likud Party
chairman Benjamin Netanyahu defeated Prime Minister Shimon Peres
by a narrow lead.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had promised to bring security to the
Israeli public during his campaign, will form a new coalition
government in the next few days with himself as the first
directly elected prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Five Israeli Soliders Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched an ambush at an
Israeli patrol in the so-called "security zone" in southern
Lebanon this morning, killing five Israeli soliders.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in southern Lebanon said that five Israeli
soldiers were killed and six others were wounded in the dawn
attack near the Israeli position of Dabsheh overlooking the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The attack drew immediate Israeli retaliatory bombardment, in
which a van with a civilian plate was destroyed on the road
between the southern Lebanese villages of Haboush and Arab
Salim. A Lebanese army sergeant inside the van was killed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces in the buffer enclave have fired
more than 70 artillery shells at the areas of Nabatiyeh and Iglim
Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
claimed responsibility for the operation, stressing that more
than 10 Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the guerrilla organization said that its
fighters carried out the ambush at 5:00 a.m. (02:00 GMT) on the
road between Dabsheh and Khardali.
</P>
<P>
Fighters of the Islamic Resistance carried out an attack at an
Israeli patrol and another at a patrol of the Israeli client South
Lebanon Army militia in the 850-square-kilometer buffer zone on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed that a Israeli soldier and a SLA
militiamen were wounded in the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
Today's attack added the Israeli casualties in southern
Lebanon since a cease-fire understanding was reached between
Lebanon and the Jewish state on April 26 to nine killed and 21
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-broked understanding, which ended a 16-day Israeli
blitz in southern Lebanon, bans both Israeli forces and Hezbollah
guerrillas from attacking at or from civilian areas, but it does
not prevent Hezbollah's militants from attacking the military
targets in the bordering buffer enclave in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli soldiers were killed and seven others were
wounded by Hezbollah guerrillas in an attack at Israeli
occupation forces in southern Lebanon on May 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The moderation of India's
current account deficit and the increase in inflows of non-debt
creating flows contained the growth of the country's external debt

<HEADLINE> Australian Swimmer Fails Finishing Florida Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimmer Susie Maroney
Sunday failed in her bid to become the first person to swim the
Florida Strait with just 20 kilometers to be finished, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Don Chase said Maroney and her
crew "had to reevaluate their goals" after exhaustion set in more
than 24 hours after she left from Havana on the 180-kilometer trek.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people are believed to have attempted to swim
from Cuba to Florida and have failed.
</P>
<P>
While Key West is 144 kilometers from Cuba, Maroney had to swim
in an arc to compensate for the Gulf Stream in the Florida
Straits, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that Maroney -- who has set a world record for
swimming across the English channel -- did make it into US
territorial waters. She swam part of the way in a metal cage in
order to avoid sharks.
</P>
<P>
Maroney, who was accompanied by four boats on her trip, stopped
swimming just south of Boca Chica at about 5:30 p.m. (2130 GMT)
Chase said. The Coast Guard arranged for an ambulance to take her
to a hospital in Key West.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Have Free Religious Belief (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A new survey shows that people in
the Tibet Autonomous Region enjoy great freedom in their religious
beliefs, the Beijing-based Outlook magazine reports in its latest
issue published here today.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey on 100 Tibetan families in urban, pastoral
and agricultural areas of Tibet was conducted by the China
Tibetology Research Center between May and November last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 93.2 percent of the respondents said
they know about the state policy on free religion, and 98 percent
are in favor of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism is an important part in the daily life of
Tibetan people, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Old people at the Banjorlhunbo Village of Gyangze County said
there were few religious activities for ordinary people before the
liberation of Tibet because the slaves and servants used to do
arduous labors for the local bureaucratic families.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people had neither time nor money to pursue religious
activities at that time, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays 28 families out of 44 in the village hold religious
activities in their homes. One family holds religious activities
twice a year, 19 families hold a religious activity once a year,
and six families once in two years.
</P>
<P>
A whole family would go on a pilgrimage to temples on religious
occasions or auspicious days which normally fall on the eighth,
15th, 25th and 30th of the Tibetan calendar.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that half of the families investigated has
been to Lhasa to worship Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that Tibetan households spend much on
religion. Religious believers in urban areas spend more because
they have more access to temples and maintain daily religious
activities at home.
</P>
<P>
Believers in pastoral areas normally spend money on religious
activities related to diseases, deaths and pilgrimage to sacred
religious places like Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The surveyors found out that the amount spent on religion by
families in agricultural areas is smaller than the other two
areas.
</P>
<P>
Before liberation pottery religious lamps used to be the only
kind of religious items in the homes of slaves and servants, and
few of them had shrines.
</P>
<P>
In the 44 households surveyed, there are 23 shrines, 10 Buddha
statues, 31 Tangkas which are scroll religious paintings, as well
as large numbers of paper Buddha images, bronze bowls, silver and
copper lamps and scriptures.
</P>
<P>
The way that religious believers staunchly worship the gods
they believe in does not change much, but believers in different
areas tend to choose different gods for worship, according to the
surveyors.
</P>
<P>
The survey discovered that like the old days, people hold
religious activities during religious festivals, weddings,
funerals and the completion of new houses.
</P>
<P>
Those who were surveyed said they are free to hold activities
on any occasion, and they can decide the scale of activities and
how much money they spend.

<HEADLINE> Rao Expected to Be Criticized at India's CWC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress President P.V.
Narasimha Rao is expected to come under severe criticism during
the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting to be held here on
June 13 to analyze the recent debacle of the party in the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Congress Party sources here today, hawks in the
party, particularly in the CWC, the highest policy-making body of
the Congress, have already started sharpening their knives for the
kill.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Disciplinary Action Committee of the All-India
Congress Committee (AICC) V.B. Reddy and former industry minister
K. Karunakaran had once again raked up the demand for one-man-
one-post issue and wanted Rao to quit one of the two posts he is
holding.
</P>
<P>
Majority of the CWC members have serious doubts about the
understanding that Rao has reached with Prime Minister Deve Gowda
on the implementation of the common minimum program.
</P>
<P>
V.B. Reddy has made its clear that Rao should make it
transparent as to what actually transpired between him and Deve
Gowda during the three meetings they had prior to the announcement
of the program.
</P>
<P>
Rao has so far stood firm and decided to extend support to the
United Front government only from outside. This has led to a
simmering discontent in the party.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi EC Examining Allegation Against President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
(EC) is examining an allegation against President Abdur Rahman
Biswas of violating the election code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The president last Thursday made a commitment for upgrading a
college to a full-fledged university when a delegation of the
college teachers called on him.
</P>
<P>
The Awami (People's) League (AL), the former largest opposition
party in the country, lodged a written complaint with the Election
Commission, accusing the president of violating the code of
conduct by making promise as his son is contesting the
parliamentary election as a candidate of the ex-ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) from the area where the college is
located.
</P>
<P>
In a speech here Sunday, Chief election commissioner Abu Hena
said that "We are examining the petition," but the president
enjoys certain immunities under the constitution from civil and
criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was morally right for the president to make promise
just ahead of the election fixed on June 12, the election chief
said: "that is a different matter. Ask your conscience for the
answer."
</P>
<P>
Since May 20 when ex-chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim and some
other senior army officers were sacked from their posts and put
under military custody by the Defense Ministry under the
president, the AL has accused the president of keeping the defense
and armed forces portfolio under his hands to serve the BNP's
conspiracy to foil the June 12 election since the president has
been a BNP member.

OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Canadians gathered
on the Parliament Hill here today, demanding the federal
government to take actions on the unity issue of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Hill became a sea of waving Maple Leaf and
Fleur-de-lis flags today, and a plane carrying the slogan
"Separation: It's Over" flew above.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the prime minister to lay out the terms for
Quebec separation," said one participant.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was also called on to pass an act of
parliament declaring that Canada is indivisible.
</P>
<P>
Today's unity rally was organized by grass-root federalist
organizations -- some of them from Quebec -- who were worried that
after eight months of Quebec referendum, no major actions have
been taken to deal with the separation issue.
</P>
<P>
"We come here demanding the government of Canada assert not
only its right, but also its duty to uphold the Canadian
constitution," one organizer said.

<HEADLINE> India's New Government Sets to Win Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Front (UF) government
of India headed by Deve Gowda is to seek a vote of confidence
during the brief Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) session
beginning here today and is expected to win the confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Gowda assumed office of the prime minister on June 1 and
president S.D. Sharma asked him to pass the vote of confidence in
the Lok Sabha by June 12.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in India's parliamentary history
that the Lok Sabha meets twice within a span of 15 days for the
same purpose. It met from May 22 to 28 to enable the Bharatiya
Janata party (BJP) government to seek the confidence of the house.
</P>
<P>
The BJP government headed by A.B. Vajpayee was forced to resign
before the confidence motion was taken up in the house due to its
failure to muster enough support from the MPs.
</P>
<P>
The one line motion seeking the confidence of the house to be
moved by Gowda cannot be taken up on the first day as the house
will pay homage to former president Neelam Sanjiva Reddy who died
on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that
the UF government would request the speaker for a seven-hour
debate before the vote of confidence is taken up on June 11.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies are set to take on the UF government in
the house on the issues like corruption and "contradictions" in
the UF government's common minimum program published on June 5.
</P>
<P>
However, with its own 190 MPs and the help of 140 Congress MPs
in the house, the UF government is expected to win the confidence
of the 545-member house.

<HEADLINE> Thai Listed Firms to Face 2.5 Billion Baht Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) is introducing a requirement that each listed company would
have a market capital of at least 2.5 billion baht (100 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Listed companies valued below this figure would have to seek
listing on the Bangkok Stock Dealing Center, an official
over-the-counter exchange.
</P>
<P>
Currently-listed firms worth less than 2.5 billion baht would
have to raise their value to this level when the new requirement
is applied, or they will switch to the over-the-counter market,
said Vice-President of the SET Patareeya Benjapholchai.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on the change is under way, she said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 267 of the 439 listed firms on the SET are below the
requirement, many of them deal in electronic products, food and
beverages, household goods, insurance, jewelry and ornaments,
packaging, textiles, unit trust, estate assets, hotel and travel
services.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move would keep healthy firms on the SET.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Romania has made painstaking
efforts to ensure an improved environment since 1993 despite the
lack of fund, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the Romanian government has earmarked 625 billion
leus (210 million U.S. dollars) to fund environment protection
efforts, including the elimination of pollution sources in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of water conservancy, forestry and
environmental protection told Xinhua that the Romanian government
has hammered out a national anti-pollution program last year,
under which 102 measures will be taken to check industrial
pollution nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian parliament adopted an environmental protection law
in December last year, which provides that any economic entities
will risk closure if they fail to properly handle industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Romania also uncovered several cases involving
the imports of foreign wastes by private companies. The government
has taken a tough hand in these cases: the wastes were immediately
sealed up and returned to the source countries.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Different Life of Herdsmen and Farmers in Tibet (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Herdsmen in Tibet who used to roam
the pastures have settled down and more exchanges with the outside
have altered their way of life, the Beijing-based Outlook magazine
reports in its latest issue published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on a sample survey on 100 Tibetan families
conducted by the China Tibetology Research Center between May and
November last year.
</P>
<P>
A survey on pastoral households in Amdo County showed that
before Tibet's democratic reforms in 1959, only the tribe chiefs
lived in houses, and ordinary people just lived in tents.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from the early 1980s, when the government implemented
a contract system to let herdsmen take charge of pastures, each
household had independent grassland areas and did not have to move
around.
</P>
<P>
The settlements have brought more conveniences to herdsmen, who
are able to store more grain, and as a result their life style is
undergoing changes.
</P>
<P>
Banjorlhunbo Village in Gyangze County used to be secluded with
no highways leading to the outside world. Since the 1950s highways
connecting Gyangze with other places such as Lhasa and Xigaze
cities have been constructed. Now all households in the
Banjorlhunbo Village have horse-driven carts.
</P>
<P>
Convenient transport facilities have broadened the views of
local farmers, who are now able to step outside their once
secluded villages for business journeys, pilgrimages and to visit
friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Before the democratic reforms, broadcasts and newspapers were
the major sources of information. Even such media was rarely seen
in remote rural areas.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of people's living standards and
technological progress over the past dozen years, radios, tape
recorders and TV sets have entered the homes of ordinary Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Better access to the media has enriched people's lives and has
exerted great impact on changing people's traditional views and
their lifestyles.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Enjoy Better Education (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans today enjoy much better
education than some four decades ago, according to an article in
the latest issue of Beijing-based Outlook magazine published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The article was written on the basis of a sample survey on 100
Tibetan families in the urban, pastoral and agricultural
areas. The survey was conducted by the China Tibetology Research
Center between May and November last year.
</P>
<P>
In the old days most slaves and servants in Tibet could not
receive an education, and only a small number of them were able to
learn simple reading, writing and calculating, an old man in the
Banjorlhunbo Village of Gyangze County said during the survey.
</P>
<P>
Following Tibet's liberation, especially after the local
governments led by the Chinese Communist Party established public
schools, the children of farmers and herdsmen were given the
opportunity to receive regular schooling.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that by 1995 students at school and those who
had shrugged off illiteracy accounted for 58.33 percent of the
village's total population, a significant progress considering the
poor conditions in the village.
</P>
<P>
According to the 70-year-old Zhaxi living in the Lugu Community
of Lhasa, capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region, only the
children of bureaucrats and the then officials were able to attend
schools at that time, and only a few children from poor families
could only go to lamaseries to learn.
</P>
<P>
Since 1959 when democratic reforms were carried out in Tibet,
especially beginning from late 1970s, the city has made great
strides forward in its educational undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city had 536 schools in 1991, which
accommodated nearly 50,000 students.
</P>
<P>
The survey on 45 families in the city's Lugu Community showed
that in 1995 all children in the community had attended schools,
and the surveyors said the figure represented the overall
conditions in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetan families came to know the importance of education,
and they invested more and more in education.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that in 1994 the families surveyed spent
more than 11,000 yuan on education, which accounts for 1.78
percent of overall household expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The investment in education was nearly 4.5 times over that in
1993, and the growth rate was much greater than other daily
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
In 1950s and 1960s, by contrast, Tibetans were reluctant to
sent their children to school even with state support.

<HEADLINE> Talks Over Chechnya Reopened in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian representatives and Chechen
rebels today reopened talks on withdrawing Russian troops from the
breakaway republic, consolidating a ceasefire and demilitarizing
Chechnya, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, which were held in Nazran, capital of the Russian
autonomous republic of Ingush, Russian officials and Chechen
separatists agreed to settle their disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will observe the agreements and relative clauses
that have been concluded, and all issues, no matter how
complicated, should be settled peacefully, said Vyacheslav
Mikhailov, minister of nationalities and regional policy and head
of the Russian delegation.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations discussed the fragile nine-day-old
ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops, decommissioning of
rebel forces, and exchange of hundreds of prisoners held on both
sides, the Itar-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen rebels were still opposed to a parliament
election on June 16 in the republic, insisting on the pullout of
Russian troops before the election.
</P>
<P>
On May 27, Russian President Boris Yeltsin launched the peace
process by holding an unprecedented meeting with separatist leader
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
A truce was reached at the meeting, which provided for a
ceasefire in the region beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
However, fighting was still going on in the region. Fifteen
Russian soldiers were killed and 34 wounded between May 27 and
June 8, Mikhailov was quoted by the Interfax as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels declared Chechen independence from Russia in 1991
and have been fighting the Russian armed forces since December
1994, when Yeltsin ordered the army to enter the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people have been killed in the 18-month
bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Much Better Life of Tibetans  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Over the past four decades Tibet
has scored tremendous progress in its economic and social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans enjoy free religious relief and in particular the
status of women has greatly improved, according to an extensive
report in the latest issue of Outlook magazine published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report, consisting of four articles, was written on the
basis of a sample survey conducted by the China Tibetology
Research Center between May and November last year.
</P>
<P>
Through questionnaires and household interviews, 15
sociological researchers made investigations in 150 Tibetan
families in urban, pastoral and agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
With regard to each family, the researchers raised detailed
questions concerning 17 major categories to collect the family's
changes over the past 40-odd years since the region was freed from
slavery and feudal suppression.
</P>
<P>
The questions covered basic family conditions, family members,
family relations, family structures, lifestyles, income and
expenditure, and religion.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest and most a thorough investigation on
Tibetan society in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that the average per capita income of
Tibetans has grown above the national level, Tibetan herdsmen have
bid farewell to nomadic living and settled down, and Tibetan
culture has undergone profound changes due to the better education
of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Most of the respondents believed that the past dozen years was
the best time for Tibet's development.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found out that officials at various levels are
well respected by local Tibetan residents, most of whom would just
go to government departments to solve their difficulties and
problems.
</P>
<P>
As for religious affairs, 93.2 percent of those surveyed said
they know about the state policies of free religious beliefs, with
98 percent of whom are in favor of the policies.
</P>
<P>
The surveyors also discovered that with better living
standards, Tibetan people are having more and better religious
items in their homes, and they are free to hold religious
activities anywhere at any time.

<HEADLINE> Youth Leagues Bolster Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Just about an hour's drive from
bustling downtown Beijing, the young villagers of Beichengzhuang,
in suburban Daxing County, have found an evening activity more
meaningful than those of many young urban dwellers, it is
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday night, 23 members of the
village's Youth Science and Technology Association come to the
village's reading room, working out solutions to problems that
arise in raising vegetables and learning tips to aid in planting
various crops, today's "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
They've been following this routine for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
All association members are required to master techniques of
planting and anti-pest protection for at least three or four
kinds of vegetables, and must be knowledgeable enough to help other
villagers with such problems.
</P>
<P>
The village's Communist Youth League organized the association
and helped it establish connections with the league of the state
Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission league donates books and video tapes, gives
lectures, and provides the latest seeds and pesticides to help
improve the villagers' economy and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The Beichengzhuang youth league model is one of the most
successful models developed by the Chinese Communist Youth League
in its effort to facilitate modernization in rural China.
</P>
<P>
Based on the successful Daxing model, the committee is urging
governmental leagues, universities and big enterprises to help
villages develop their economy, either with technology or
investment. So far, leagues at all levels have established all
kinds of relationships with more than 20,000 villages across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans' Living Standards Above National Level (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
achieved tremendous economic and social development over the past
several decades, and the per capita income of Tibetans has grown
higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by an article carried in the latest issue of
Beijing-based Outlook magazine published here today.
</P>
<P>
The article was written on the basis of a sample survey on 100
Tibetan families conducted by the China Tibetology Research Center
between May and November last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the income of Tibetans has been growing
steadily since the democratic reforms in Tibet in 1959. Even
during the "Great Cultural Revolution" period (1966-1976), their
living standards also improved.
</P>
<P>
But it was the period after 1984, when economic reforms began
to be implemented, people's living standards improved sharply.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey conducted in Tibet's pastoral, agricultural
and urban areas shows that the average per capita income of
Tibetans during the period were higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Old Tibet was dominated by a feudal slavery system. Most lands
and animals were possessed by monks, bureaucrats and local
government officials who accounted for just five percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The survey on 46 pastoral households in Amdo County, to the
north of the Nyainqen Tanggula Mountain, shows that before
democratic reforms, 56.6 percent of the households were mired in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
In terms of local living standards, households with less than
40 domestic animals were deemed as poor.
</P>
<P>
Between 1959 and 1967, the figure of poor households decreased
to 40 percent. By 1995, all the households stepped out of poverty,
and 60 percent of households had more than 80 domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the per capita income of the households reached 1,490
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ganjorlhubo Village, in Gyangze County along the upper reaches
of the Nayang River, used to be a poor village consisting of
slaves.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 per capita agricultural and pastoral output of 67.4
percent of the village's households exceeded 4,000 yuan, well
above the national level.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, now capital city of Tibet, the Lugu Community had
been one of the three major slums which accommodated one-third of
Lhasa's beggars. According to the survey on the community's 45
households, the average income for each head reached 4,024 yuan in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Import More Technologies in Coming Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the country's largest
industrial and financial center, has planned to import more high
technologies in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the municipality has signed
459 agreements on importing technology and equipment, involving a
contractual sum of 156 million US dollars, up 61 percent and 65
percent respectively from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two hi-tech industrial development zones
in Shanghai, which put emphasis on automobiles, household electric
appliances and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has maintained a good momentum in the import of
technology, local officials said. Many contracts signed here this

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Labor Party Beset with Leadership Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Labor Party,
the second largest group in the parliament, is now beset with an
internal struggle over its leadership, with the October general
elections only four months away.
</P>
<P>
The strife came to the open last week when the local press
reports disclosed that five Labor frontbench MPs approached Labor
leader Helen Clark, trying to persuade her to step down.
</P>
<P>
The MPs supported former party leader Mike Moore to replace
Clark, who was ousted by Clark in a coup in 1993. But Clark
rejected their request.
</P>
<P>
The MPs were worried about the poor showing of the party in
recent opinion polls, which indicated the Labor now enjoys only 15
percent support from those polled. The Labor has fallen into the
third place, behind the ruling National Party and the New Zealand
First.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Clark's lack of appeal was responsible for
the dismal poll results, which also showed her popularity as the
preferred prime minister stood at only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The MPs hoped that Moore's personal appeal could win back
Labor's voters who had turned to back the New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
The latest leadership crisis is not the first since Clark
became the leader, and the doubt over her credibility as leader
has remained since she replaced Moore. The opinion polls have
never been favorable to her, with her popularity as the preferred
prime minister never topping 4 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will have to be settled at the Labor caucus meeting
tomorrow. Clark has expressed "absolutely" confident that she has
enough support to survive the contest over her leadership.
</P>
<P>
She might hang on the position as the leader, but it is widely
believed the challenge dealt a fresh body-blow to her credibility
as leader.
</P>
<P>
Although Clark has said she will do nothing to punish the MPs
who asked her to resign, she is under pressure within the party to
sack one of them.
</P>
<P>
A local press report today said Phil Goff, Labor's justice
spokesman and the sixth-ranked Labor MPs, is likely to be demoted
because of his roll in the latest coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
The risk for the Labor party at the moment is not who will lead
it, but whether unity of the party could be maintained. Observers
here are of the view that the leadership crisis has revealed the
discord among the party. The Labor must try to heal the wound as
quickly as possible, otherwise it will not have much time to
prepare for the election.

PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Miguel Indurain claimed the victory
at the Criterium du Dauphine cycling race which finished at
Grenoble on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The five times Tour de France winner reached the top of the
Bastille hill that overlooks the city to complete the seventh

<P>
It is the 31-year old's second successive victory in the

Former Swiss world champion Tony Rominger, who has claimed his
Tour de France preparation is behind that of his rivals, was
pipped in the final sprint, scoring the same time as Leblanc to
finish seventh overall.
</P>
<P>
French world champion Laurent Jalabert, who held the yellow
jersey until the completion of Saturday's gruelling sixth stage
through the Alps, was forced to retire suffering from exhaustion
40 kilometers from the end of the final stage.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wins First Match at Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany defeated Czech Republic 2-0
in their opening match with high cost at the European Soccer
Championships in Manchester on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
First half goals from Andreas Moeller and Christian Ziege
earned Germany victory, but the injured Jurgen Kohler will play no
more part in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Germany also had six players booked, including Stefan Reuter
and Ziege, in the group C match, which could cause them suspension
problems later in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Four Czech players were also booked.
</P>
<P>
It was a bitter blow for coach Bertie Vogts when experienced
Borussia Dortmund defender Kohler, skipper in place of injured
Jurgen Klinsmann, left the pitch in the 10th minute.
</P>
<P>
His left knee was immediately strapped up and defender Markus
Babbel replaced him. German delegation spokesman Wolfgang
Niersbach said during the second half that Kohler was flying back
to Germany on Monday for treatment.
</P>
<P>
From the moment Kohler left the field, Germany began to step up
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
Fredi Bobic, forming a strike partnership with Turkey-based
Stefan Kuntz, had the first real chance for either side in the
17th minute.
</P>
<P>
Fed by Matthias Sammer, Bobic hit a spectacular volley from 10
yards, forcing keeper Petr Kouba to make an impressive reflex
save.
</P>
<P>
Moller had a chance from the ensuing corner and later Thomas
Hassler had time to tee himself up from the edge of the box, but
shot just wide.
</P>
<P>
Then Germany's left-wing back Ziege swung in from the left,
swept past defender Miroslav Kadlec to fire into the bottom
left-hand corner from the edge of the box in the 25th minute.
</P>
<P>
Moments later Ziege was lucky not to be sent off for a foul on
Karel Poborsky. In the end Elleray only produced a yellow card
from his pocket.
</P>
<P>
In the 32nd minute, midfielder Andreas Moller converted an
almost exact copy of Ziege's goal as if to see if Kouba would
fall for it again.
</P>
<P>
He cut in from the left, swerved away from defenders, before
hitting the ball home right-footed from the edge of the box into
the bottom left-hand corner.

<HEADLINE> NZ Banks Record Highest Growth in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand banks achieved its
highest growth in five years in 1995 with total assets rising 12.3
percent to over 103 billion NZ dollars (70 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the Reserve Bank in an article in
its June quarter bulletin. The article reviewed the banks
performance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 growth rate was a big jump from the 7.4 percent growth
in 1994 and less than 3.5 percent growth in the preceding three
years.
</P>
<P>
Retail banks were the growth leaders, largely due to the rapid
expansion of residential mortgage lending during the last year.
But their non-residential lending was also up by 33.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This growth reflects a strategic move into the commercial
lending market by a number of retail banks, which have focused on
building relationships with small to medium size businesses," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that slower economic growth is likely to influence the
bank's asset portfolios, with the high level of mortgage growth
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
The banks also experienced an excellent year in 1995 for
earnings, with aggregate profitability up 21.6 percent after tax.

LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Triple jumper Jonathan Edwards was
allowed by the British Athletic Federation to miss the Olympic
trials in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
The world champion says he needs to rest after a poor
performance in the Rome Grand Prix, where he won with his last

</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take advantage of the situation," said
Edwards. "But I've felt awful.
</P>
<P>
"I have a bruised heel, my knee is sore and it's already
feeling like the end of the season."
</P>
<P>
BAF selectors had ordered all athletes seeking to go to Atlanta
to compete in the three-day trials in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be looking sympathetically at Jonathan's problems,"
said spokesman Tony Ward. "We want to send the strongest team to
Atlanta and he is obviously one of our best chances for gold."

<HEADLINE> Child Laborers Might Number Hundreds of Millions: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of child workers
worldwide has been estimated at hundreds of millions by the
International Labour Organization (ILO) in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said that the number of child laborers between the age
of 10 and 14 stands at about 73 million. But as the number of
working children below 10-years-old is not available, the total
child labor force worldwide might well be in the hundreds of
millions, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The 73 million child laborers between the age of 10 and 14
account for more than 13 percent of the children in this age
group, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 million, 32.5 million, or 44.5 percent, are girls.
However, the report noted, the number of working girls must be
larger as many girls involved in full-time housework are usually
not taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The number of child workers is the highest in Asia, with 44.6
million, or 13 percent in the 10-14 age group, followed by Africa
with 23.6 million, or 26.3 percent of children aged 10 to 14 on
the continent. In Latin America, 5.1 million, or 9.8 percent of
children in this age bracket, are employed.
</P>
<P>
In the African nations of Mali and Burkina Faso, over half of
the children in the 10 to 14 age group work. The rate in Niger
and Uganda is 45 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The ILO also noted that child labor is especially prevalent in
Central and Eastern Europe due to economic difficulties resulting
from the transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"The same is true of the United States, where the growth of the
service sector, the rapid increase in the supply of part-time jobs
and the search for a more flexible workforce have contributed to
the expansion of the child labor market," said the ILO report.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, 90 percent of child workers are involved in
agriculture, the report said. Others work mainly in trade and
services as well as the manufacturing sector, with some involved
in forced labor, child prostitution or working with toxic
substances.
</P>
<P>
Children work in order to increase family income or to cover
the high cost of education. Generally speaking, the ILO said, the
determining factors leading to child labor are related to poverty,
lack of schooling and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The ILO appealed strongly for global efforts to address the
worldwide problem.
</P>
<P>
"Today's child worker will be tomorrow's uneducated and
untrained adult, forever trapped in grinding poverty. No effort
should be spared to break that vicious circle," said ILO
Director-General Michel Hansenne.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leader Promises Commitment to Dayton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
said today the Serbs would continue to consistently abide by the
spirit and letter of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Kragujevac in central Yugoslavia,
Biljana Plavsic, acting president of Republika Srpska, said last
week's Geneva agreement had given a fresh impact to the Dayton
peace accord, and the implementation of the agreement should not
be jeopardized from any side in the country.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman and Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic met in Geneva
on June 2 with representatives of the five-state Contact Group and
of the international community. At the meeting, they reaffirmed
their determination that elections in Bosnia should be held in
mid-September in line with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The peace accord is binding on and is being consistently
implemented by Republika Srpska, and problems in its
implementation should be sought on the other side," said Plavsic,
who assumed most of the presidential duties last month from Serb
President Radovan Karadzic under international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the upcoming elections in Bosnia and in its two
entities -- Republika Srpska and ther Muslim-Croat federation,
Plavsic said that the authorities in the Serb part were quite
ready for the vote.
</P>
<P>
"Difficulties about the elections could emerge only in the
federation, because the federal partners -- Muslims and Croats --
have not settled their mutual relations," Plavsic said.

<HEADLINE> Pastors Meet Judicial Officials on Church Fires Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 pastors from burned-out
churches today met with Attorney General Janet Reno and other
officials to voice their dissatisfaction with the investigations
which they say have focused more on the church members and clergy
than on outside suspects.
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is to solve these crimes, and we are
determined to do that. That includes whatever investigative tools
are at our disposal and then some," Deval Patrick, assistant
attorney general for civil rights, said on CNN's "Late Edition"
today.
</P>
<P>
But Rev. Mac Charles Jones of the National Council of Churches
said investigators had made church members targets by requiring
lie-detector tests, issuing subpoenas for church records and
telling congregations that everyone is a suspect.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Churches has worked to draw attention
to the more than 30 fires at predominantly black Southern churches
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Patrick said he hoped this afternoon's meeting with the pastors
would lead to a better understanding about the fires and the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has begun
investigating 30 church fires throughout the South, including two
last week.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the pastors presented evidence of racist
motivation for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Jones said the church fires are just a symptom of the racial
tension in the country, which he said is as great as it was in the
1950s and '60s.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Arrests War Crimes Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian police have arrested
one Croat accused by an international court of war crimes during
the Bosnia war, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Croatian Justice Ministry said
that Zlatko Aleksovski was arrested Saturday in the Croatian
coastal town of Split.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Aleksovski was one of the seven Croats wanted
by the International War Crimes Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia for
atrocities against Bosnian Muslims in fightings between the two
ethnic groups from 1993 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Of the 57 war crime suspects, mostly Serbs, only five are in
the custody of the international tribunal. A Croat suspect,

<HEADLINE> UK Power Station Tries to Burn Mad Cow Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- National Power, the British power
generating company, is examining whether the remains of cows that
have been slaughtered to control the mad cow disease can be used
to produce electricity, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
An expert of the company is working on a feasibility study to
see whether carcasses can be ground down and burned in power
stations to produce energy.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it was looking at substituting coal,
which is usually used in its power stations, for pellets made from
tallow and other cattle remains.
</P>
<P>
A full-size model could be operating within a month, National
Power said.
</P>
<P>
It will check to see whether emissions are safe and ensure that
burning eliminated the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
National Power said that it had been asked for help by the
government which has been faced with a huge problem in disposing
of cattle carcasses since it introduced a slaughter policy to
control the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at present carcasses are burned in
incinerators but they have been overwhelmed by the number of
cattle being culled, which has already exceeded 100,000.
