SHIJIAZHUANG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo today urged the country's state-owned enterprises to set
up an interior scientific and standard management system to
promote their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Such a system is a necessity to realize the shift of the
economic growth mode, Wu explained.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo, also member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Part of China, made the remark at a
national conference on enterprise management held today in this
capital of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
An operation mechanism should be established to meet the needs
of socialist market economics so as to make state-owned
enterprises able to face the fierce market competition and improve
their economic performance, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
To cut production cost is also a key to increase economic
returns of the enterprises in addition to putting more money into
science and technology work so as to technically upgrade them, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to increase the productivity
through relying whole-heartedly on the workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Measures should be taken to establish a leadership
responsibility system and good experience should be summed up and
spread in time, Wu added.

BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Continued stability and
development in China is important for both the country and the
world as a whole, Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej said here today.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng, the king said
he hoped China will further revitalize its economy while at the
same time maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed with the king and thanked him for his involvement and
interest in the expansion of Sino-Thai relations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the two countries have enjoyed smooth
exchanges and cooperation in all areas since diplomatic ties were
established in 1975.

China will concentrate on economic development and adhere to
its policies of reform and opening-up to the outside world, Li

<HEADLINE> Iran's Parliament Election Campaign in Full Swing (by Chen Ming) (Part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's camp was defied once again today as the country's
conservative Guardians Council (GC) ordered police to remove the
omnipresent election campaign banners erected by the liberals.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian daily Jomhuri Eslami reported that the GC said
in an emergency meeting that banners sprouting around the capital
city on the eve of the 5th parliamentary elections were against
the law.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the emergency meeting held
Friday, the GC warned that police would confiscate the banners
and arrest those responsible for setting them up.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the operation by the police to
remove liberals' banners might lead to clashes between their
supporters and police.
</P>
<P>
They noted that police might not dare to do so because
President Rafsanjani not only backs but also head the liberal camp.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati ordered police
to remove liberals' banners before the official outset of
the crucial Parliament election last month, but no single banner
was removed from the streets.
</P>
<P>
The election laws authorize the GC to oversee the elections,
slated for March 8, to screen the candidates applications and to
intervene to cancel votes of any area where election fraud takes
place. Over 2,000 people, about two fifth of the candidates, were
rejected by the GC last week.
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups have consistently charged that the GC is
under influence of the Society of the Combatant Clergy (SCC)
controlled by hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri. The leftist group, the Islamic Revolution Mojahedin
of Iran (IRMOI), attacked the GC for trying to eliminate all
opposition to the SCC.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts have pointed out that this is the most
important parliamentary elections since the death of the architect
of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary elections are important because whatever group
wins in these elections, it will have a better chance in the
presidential elections of 1997," a political science professor at
Tehran University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Rafsanjani cannot run for a third
consecutive term in 1997. His rival, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, is said to be the SCC's candidate for the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the politicians in Iran has admitted that he is
a presidential hopeful. But observers here say that Nateq-Nouri
may run against Rafsanjani's first-deputy Hassan Habibi.

BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan firmly supports China's

existing between the two countries, Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda said here today.

Japan will continue to abide by the principles laid down in the
Sino-Japanese declaration signed in 1972 when diplomatic ties

Another possible presidential candidate is Tehran's Mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who is a member of the so-called G-6.
Other G-6 members are the four deputy presidents and the governor
of the Central Bank. All of the six have had modern Western
education.
</P>
<P>
The SCC, on the other hand, is run by the clergies. Its
leadership consists of 17 high-ranking clergymen.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that even though both groups belong to the
rightist camp, there are many points of divergence, including a
difference on the issue of elections campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
While the SCC appeals mainly to people's religious sentiments in
their posters, the G-6 appeals to the nationalistic sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Observers also noted that Rafsanjani's liberal supporters have
so far won the advertising war against their arch rival led by
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
"So far Rafsanjani's camp has won the advertising blitz. What
remains to be seen is whether they would win the elections on
March 8," said an editor at Bahman, a liberal weekly here.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's highways and streets are inundated with red, blue and
white banners of the G-6 to promote the ideals of development
championed by President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The SCC's yellow banners, however, are not as prominent. They
carry pictures of late religious leader Khomeini and Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to show their allegiance to the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
With roots in the guilds and religious societies of Iran's
traditional market (Bazaar), the SCC has chosen a more populist
slogan for its banners, "promoting social justice."
</P>
<P>
However, the SCC's banners do not evoke any nationalistic
sentiments. Instead, it only attracts the eyes of the readers.
</P>
<P>
But, The G-6's red, white and blue banners, the colors of the
Iranian national flag, evoke nationalistic sentiments, said one
graphic artist who heads a graphic design firm in downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The G-6 banner has the motto "A Prosperous Iran" on it, while
the SCC banner does not have any reference to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The G-6 supports the development plans of Iran under
Rafsanjani, whom they have praised as "The Commander of
Reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
One of the the G-6 mottos, "Continuation of
Reconstruction," stresses the importance that the group attaches
to Rafsanjani's Second Development Plan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Punish Undisciplined Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military in Medan
has promised to punish the soldiers who took part in violent
attacks on civilians in the Kwala Berkala subdistrict earlier this
week, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were injured and scores of houses and cars
were damaged in the attacks by members of the Cavalry Six Assault
Battalion of the Indonesian military forces.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were believed to be in revenge for the death of
Chief Private Sukadi, who was stabbed by a hoodlum last Saturday.
 The attacks went on for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
Bukit Barisan Military Command Maj. Gen. Sedariyanto Thursday
promised to punish the soldiers when he visited the subdistrict
and apologized to the residents for the acts of his men.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to repair the houses and compensate for the
financial losses caused in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
His intervention came just as residents of the subdistrict were
regrouping and planning to march towards the cavalry's barracks to
revenge for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Military Command spokesman Lt. Col. Jumiran Friday told Jakarta
Post by telephone that the case has been settled and the residents
have accepted his apology and offer of compensation.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Hartono was quoted by the Ankara news
agency as saying that while the military will punish the soldiers,
it will not let hoodlums prevail.
</P>
<P>
He urged the army to continue the crackdown on hoodlums, who
are making the people their victims.

PARIS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
pledged on Friday to continue promoting the Middle East peace
process in spite of his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin's assassination
and the recent terrorist attacks in Israel which claimed heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the paper La Liberation,
Peres said he yearns for peace and firmly opposes terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He called on Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian
National Authority, to assume responsibility for security in
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat should permit the presence of parties or groups other
than his Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Peres said. But
these groups, as well as individuals, must not be granted the
right to possess weapons.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the situation in the Middle East has
changed greatly, with Israel having set up relations with seven
Arab nations and seen the development of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There are hopes of success in the ongoing peace talks between
Israel and Syria, he said, and the talks will speed up if he wins
the Israeli parliamentary elections in three months time.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Establish Juvenile Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Ministry of Justice
has submitted to the House of Representatives a bill on the
establishment of juvenile courts in the country, Justice Minister
Oetojo Oesman told the local press here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is a long-awaited move as juvenile criminals are now being
tried in district courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said many Indonesian youths behave wrongly and
sometimes break the law as a result of negligence from the
society, the school and the family.
</P>
<P>
The bill grants special status to juveniles on the ground that
they cannot account for their criminal actions.
</P>
<P>
The whole judicial process -- arrest, questioning, trial and
subsequent guidance in the detention houses -- will be handled by
special personnel as stipulated in the bill.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of juvenile courts and juvenile law, the
Indonesian police often decide not to prosecute young people who
break the law, especially if they are first-time offenders. Most
of them are simply returned to their parents with a warning.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- John Howard, leader of
Australia's Liberal-National coalition that won the federal
election today, has been a major player in the country's politics
in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
A member of parliament since 1974, Howard was Minister for
Business and Consumer Affairs and Minister for Special Trade
Negotiations before serving as Treasurer for five years during the

As Treasurer, he was responsible for many initiatives,
including the establishment of the Campbell Committee that

</P>
<P>
Howard was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in April
1982 and became its leader in September 1985. He held the chair
until May 1989 and was re-elected in January 1995.

</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader wished a "most broad-based" government for

implement the Libreville agreement.

The Development of culture and socialist ethics is one of the
major topics in the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPPCC National
Committee, Liang said. The CPPCC National Committee has worked
hard on the issue and participated in political and state affairs
and in cultural development, in particular, by taking advantages of
its numerous talented personnel.
</P>
<P>
Both the Subcommittee of Society and Law and the Subcommittee
of Education, Science and Public Health have organized experts and
scholars to conduct special investigations on the cultural and
social development. These, he said, have helped draft the
suggestions on formulating the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000)
on National Economy and Social Development and the Long-Term
Target for the Year 2010 and a number of proposals on intensifying
development of socialist spiritual civilization.
</P>
<P>
"These suggestions will surely play a positive role in
perfecting the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the outline for the
Long-Term Target for the Year 2010 as well as the development of
culture and socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee made fresh progress in advancing
political consultations, democratic supervision and involvement
in government and political affairs last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the CPPCC National Committee will perform the chief
functions of the people's consultative conference to make their
contributions with the focus on formulating and implementation of
the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the Long-Term Target for the Year
2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another important issue for the CPPCC, he added, is to promote
the standardization, systemization of the political consultation,
supervision and participation in political affairs by the CPPCC to
the eve of the opening of the annual session of the Eighth CPPCC
National Committee, which will open tomorrow, the roles of the
democratic parties and people's organizations in CPPCC as well as
the agenda in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kowloon Guangzhou Railway
(KCR) is banning metallic balloons at all its stations.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in the wake of a recent KCR and the Mass
 Transit Railway (MTR) hold-up of large numbers of commuters after
 an abandoned balloon short-circuited overhead wiring.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the KCR dissuaded passengers from bringing
helium-filled balloons into stations by posting advertisements and
issuing bags for passengers to carry the balloons in.
</P>
<P>
A KCR spokesman said: "For the sake of safety and to avoid the
extensive disruption that can be caused when these balloons float
up to the overhead line, we've decided not to allow these balloons
into our stations."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Huge Fines for Holiday-denying HK Bosses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong contractor working
on a fixed crossing project was given the biggest fine for a labor
offense in Hong Kong's history Friday, for delaying payments and
refusing time off to imported workers.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Zosen Corporation was ordered to pay 496,000 HK dollars
(64,000 US dollars) in two weeks, after pleading guilty in Western
Court of violating the Employment Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The court learned that 28 Thai workers, employed by the firm,
complained to their consulate-general in Hong Kong, which passed
on details to the Labor Department on October 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that investigations revealed that none of
the imported workers had been paid in full in July, August or
September.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that the fines on Hitachi Zosen were
the highest for a labor offense in Hong Kong's legal history.
</P>
<P>
On January 20 this year, French contractor Dragages et Travaux
Publics was fined 200,000 HK dollars (25,800 US dollars) for late
payment to three Thai workers on a reclamation project.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army has eased the
closure, imposed following the recent suicide attacks against
Israeli civilians, on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for
humanity reasons, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli army said that sick and critically
ill persons, as well as medical personnel, will be allowed to
leave the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to travel to hospitals in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the restriction on the movement of Palestinian
VIPs, diplomats and employees of international organizations will
also be removed.
</P>
<P>
In unusual circumstances, said the spokesman, Palestinians will
 be granted permission to travel abroad by Israel's Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that all the approvals will be subjected
to individual clearance by the Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following
two suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon Sunday,
which left 25 dead and 84 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and its military
wing Izzedine Qassam had claimed responsibility for the attacks,
saying that they were to mark the second anniversary of the
Machpela massacre, when a Jewish extremist shot and killed more
than 30 Palestinian worshipers.
</P>
<P>
Following the attacks, Israeli official repeatedly said that
they were in favor of imposing a "prolonged closure" on the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, barring Palestinian worker from entering
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres demanded PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat to crack down on Islamic militants in the
Palestinian autonomous areas, saying otherwise it might jeopardize
 the implementation of the peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials expressed concern that the
open-ended closure would create a dangerous atmosphere, saying
the Palestinians would lose daily at least four to six millions
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Palestinians' request, the Israeli army
Thursday eased the closure on the Gaza Strip, allowing in goods
from the strip.
</P>
<P>
However, the Army said it was letting goods in "back-to-back,"
taking them off Palestinian trucks on one side of the border and
loading them on Israeli trucks on the other side.

<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Election Directorate
has urged officers manning polling stations during the
forthcoming presidential elections to be impartial to ensure a
free and fair result.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Election Directorate Mariyawanda Nzuwa told a
meeting attended by the members of the directorate in Harare
yesterday that officers should desist from showing their
political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
The presiding officers are appointed through a force of law,
hence have a legal responsibility of ensuring that the voters
have exercised their right, said Nzuwa.
</P>
<P>
The Election Directorate is set up under the constitution to
assist the registrar-general with any statutory requirements and
give directions to those appointed by the registrar-general to
run elections. It is accounted to the president through the
Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-general Tobaiwa Mudede said staff running the
elections, which are pitting President Mugabe of ZANU (pf)
against ZANU (ndonga)'s Ndabaningi Sithole and Abel Muzorewa of
the United Parties, should not just be impartial, but also
efficient, sober, fit and tidy.

<P>
TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International
Skiing Federation (FIS) demanded on Saturday a change in the venue
of the combined slalom and a longer downhill course from the 1998
Nagano Winter Olympics Organising Committee (NAOC).
</P>
<P>
Race organisers for this year's World Cup Alpine skiing
tournament at Hakuba were forced to call off the downhill event
for the second day in a row on Saturday due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Hakuba, is the venue for the downhill and super-giant slalom
events, including the combined downhill, in the 1998 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But the combined slalom event will be held at Shika Kogen, the
venue for the single slalom and giant slalom events.
</P>
<P>
Hakuba is 50 kilometers west of Nagano city, while Shiga Kogen
is 50 kilometers east of Nagano, which makes it impossible for
organisers to switch from one combined event to the other in case
of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
FIS said it was possible to stage the combined slalom at
Hakuba, a popular ski resort with many slopes.
</P>
<P>
The official also repeated FIS demands to increase the length
of the current downhill course at Hakuba, which is only 2,800
meters long.

In an interview with Egypt's Arabic-language weekly Akhbar

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) has forged a new comprehensive Asia-Europe Partnership for
Greater Growth, aimed at strengthening links between the two
continents, "thereby contributing to peace, global stability and
prosperity," the ASEM Chairman's statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman's statement was issued this afternoon at the end
of the two-day ASEM on March 1-2, attended by leaders of 10 Asian
and 15 European leaders and the president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The meeting recognized that an important goal of this
partnership is for both Asia and Europe to share the
responsibilities in building greater understanding between the
peoples of both regions, said the statement, which resulted from
the two-day meeting, chaired by Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
The statement believed that "strengthened dialogue on an equal
basis between Asia and Europe in a spirit of cooperation and
through the sharing of perceptions on a wide range of issues would
enhance mutual understanding and benefit both regions."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants emphasized their common desire to
strengthen political dialogues between Asia and Europe. These
dialogues should "highlight and expand common ground, enhance
understanding and friendship, and promote and deepen cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed, "The dialogue among the participating
countries should be conducted on the basis of mutual respects,
equality, promotion of fundamental rights and, in accordance with
the rules of international law and obligations, non-intervention,
whether direct or indirect, in each other's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also voiced support for international initiatives
to solve outstanding problems in both regions.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the meeting agreed to cooperate
"in promoting the effective reform and greater democratization of
the UN System, including the issues concerning the Security
Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and
UN finances, with a view to reinforcing its pre-eminent role in
maintaining and promoting international peace and security and
sustainable development."

<P>
On arms control and other related issues, the meeting "attached
particular importance to the early conclusion of the Comprehensive
(Nuclear) Test Ban Treaty in 1996."

The leaders reiterated "their determination to pursue
systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons
globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons and
of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective
international controls."

<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
stressed here today that great potential and opportunities exist
in cooperation between Asia and Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman's statement adopted at the end of the
two-day historic gathering of Asian and European leaders, the
economies of Asia and Europe are highly complementary on account
of the economic dynamism and diversity of the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Asia is emerging as a huge market for consumer goods, capital
equipment, financing and infrastructure, while Europe is a major
market for goods, investments and services, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two continents could expect a promising prospect for
expanding the market for goods, capital equipment and
infrastructure development projects and technology transfer, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM also vowed to generate greater two-way trade and
investment flows between Asia and Europe to reinforce a
partnership between Asia and Europe, stressing such a partnership
should be based on the common commitment to market economy, open
multilateral trade system, non-discriminatory liberalization and
open regionalism.
</P>
<P>
To further promote trade and investment between Asia and
Europe, the leaders from Asian and European countries attending
the meeting also agreed to take measures to simplify their
countries' customs procedures, reduce trade barriers and create
better market access.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to encourage the business and private sectors
of the two continents to strengthen their cooperation and create
an Asia-Europe Business Forum for this target.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Parties Contribute for China's Ninth Five-Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's eight non-communist
parties are fully prepared with a number of motions and proposals
for the annual sessions of the and Chinese People's Political
Consulative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and National
People's Congress (NPC) which will open on March 3 and 5.
</P>
<P>
The eight democratic parties, in which the majority of the
members are experts in different fields, have mobilized their
members from various walks of life to suggest ways and means for
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and the Long-term Target for the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
These non-communist parties are Jiu San Society
(September 3), Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League,
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, China
Association for Promoting Democracy, China Democratic
National Construction Association, China Democratic League,
Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and China Zhi Gong
Party (Party Interest Party).
</P>
<P>
The leaders from the democratic parties have attended symposia
sponsored by the Communist Party of China (CPC) on two separate
occasions airing their views on reforms in state-owned
enterprises, agriculture, the protection of arable land and
enhanced awareness of science and education. Many of these
proposals have been adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
After the Proposal of the CPC Central Committee for
Formulating the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996--2000) for National
Economy and Social Development and the Long-term Target for the
Year 2010 was adopted in the Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th
CPC Central Committee which opened on September 28, 1995, the
democratic parties have organized their members to study and
promote the proposal among their members.
</P>
<P>
Since then, members from these parties have also been sent to
conduct investigations and surveys on such issues as the shift
from the traditional planned economy to socialist market economy
and shift of economic growth mode from being extensive to
intensive and on issues of common concern by the common people.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean President Chun Returns to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indicted former South Korean
President Chun Doo-hwan was sent back to Anyang Prison on the
southern outskirts of Seoul today after 74 days of medical
treatment at the National Police Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
Chun returned to the same 11.5-square-meter cell which he had
been in before he was transferred to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Since Chun is still in good shape after a long court hearing on
February 26, he sould be able to withstand prison life, a Justice
Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The former president has been hospitalized since December 20
last year due to symptoms of dehydration and malnutrition
resulting from his three-week-long hunger strike as a protest to
his December 3 arrest.
</P>
<P>
The first trial on the bribery scandal involving Chun was held
at the Seoul District Court here on February 26.
</P>
<P>
Chun was indicted on January 12 on charges that he raised 900
million U.S. dollars during his 1980-1988 presidency from 42 major
business leaders. Of that amount, 270 million dollars was
confirmed to be from bribes.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the ex-president admitted accepting 900
million dollars in "secret funds" while in office, but denied the
allegation that he received bribes from business leaders, claiming
that he received the money as a matter of custom on such special
occasions as year-end, without intimidation or special favors.
</P>
<P>
Chun was the second former head of state of South Korea to
stand trial. Former President Roh Tae-woo, who was taken into
custody on November 16 last year after being arrested, has stood
trial three times already as he also faces charges of receiving
370 million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen while in
office from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, both Chun and Roh have also
been indicted for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on May 18, 1980 in
Kwangju, Capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Supports Health Minister In Aids Play Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela yesterday expressed confidence in Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma in the wake of a row about the 14 million rand
(about 3.83 million US dollars) aids awareness play Sarafina II.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "Saturday Star" today quoted Mandela as saying
that "she has fully explained to me and I fully support her."
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at a press conference in Pretoria on
his return from a one-day visit to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Earlier yesterday, the Democratic Party (DP) of South Africa
called on Mandela to fire Zuma for "deliberately misleading" the
national assembly's health committee by claiming that the European
Union (EU) knew its donor funding would be spent on the musical play
Sarafina II.
</P>
<P>
The DP said in Cape Town it would ask the public protector to
investigate the involvement of Zuma and her department in the aids
musical. DP health spokesman Mike Ellis said: "We are anxious to
achieve a very real and through investigation into the matter."
</P>
<P>
The call for a public protector investigation has also been
supported by the Pan Africanist Congress and the National Party.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ellis urged Mandela to fire Zuma, after the EU again
confirmed it had not approved its donated money being used to fund
the musical.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely clear that Zuma deliberately misled the
committee on health on Wednesday," Ellis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"For a minister to deliberately mislead a parliamentary body is
unacceptable. She must be fired," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, health ministry spokesman Vincent Hlongwane said
there appeared to be a misunderstanding with the EU and that Zuma
stood by what she had told the committee.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the African National Congress used its majority in
the national assembly to pass a vote of confidence in Zuma, defeating
a motion by the DP calling for Zuma's immediate suspension.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, the EU said in a statement that it had given
the health department about 100 million rand (about 27.4 million
us dollars), of which 48.73 million rand (about 13.35 million US
dollars) would be provided over two years for a national aids
programme.
</P>
<P>
The controversial aids play Sarafina II was not included in a
contract between the department of health and the EU, the
statement said.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party lagged
behind the coalition by 46.3 percent to 53.7 percent on two-party
preferred basis after over one third of the votes were counted in
the election.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predicted a landslide victory for the
Liberal-National coalition. They said that unless Labor made a
late comeback in Queensland, it would surely lose more than nine
seats in the Parliament, which means a change of government.
</P>
<P>
Labor is doing poorly in Queensland. It lost 8.3 percent of
votes when only 2.3 percent of the total votes in the state were
counted.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even predict a 40-seat majority of the coalition
over Labor in the House of Representatives.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal election
entered its decisive phase as polling ended in the eastern states
at 6:00 p.m. local time today.
</P>
<P>
Counting of votes began immediately after the polling booths
closed in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales,
Victoria and Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lag of time, voting process in other states and
territory is still going on and will complete in three hours.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), which
conducts the election, the first results of vote counting will
come out at 6:40 p.m. Initial outcome of the election may be
available as early as 9:00 p.m. local time if there is a landslide
victory for any side of the contest.
</P>
<P>
However, if there is a close contest between the two major
political groups, the final result may not be known until all the
ballots are counted in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of voters attending the national polls is not
available until all ballots are counted.
</P>
<P>
There are 11.5 million Australians who are eligible for vote.
AEC officers in charge of polling places all over the country
reported a steady inflow of voters during the day.
</P>
<P>
Vote is compulsory in Australia. Voter turnout was above 90
percent in the past elections.
</P>
<P>
It is a sunny weekend in most parts of the continent. The
voting process went on smoothly with the assistance of 60,000
casual staffers employed by the AEC.
</P>
<P>
Just as public opinion polls indicated, a large number of
voters had not decided whom they would vote for until the last
minute when they came to polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Older people appeared to be more inclined to vote for the
Liberal-National coalition, while young people favored the
incumbent Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating and the opposition leader John
Howard will watch live TV broadcast of the release of vote
counting this evening. Keating and Howard voted in their own
electorates in Sydney respectively.
</P>
<P>
Keating expressed confidence in Labor's re-election.
</P>
<P>
"I've got a good feeling about it," he told supporters.
</P>
<P>
Voters in Keating's electorate of Blaxland in Sydney's West

Former prime minister Bob Hawk will comment on the results of
the election on television at the National Tally Room in Canberra.

<HEADLINE> Good Maize Harvest Expected In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is expected to harvest up
to 2.3 million tonnes of maize, enough to feed the country and
restore the strategic stockpile, thanks to the expansion of
planting acreage and good rains.
</P>
<P>
According to the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), both communal and commercial farmers of Zimbabwe may have
an above average maize harvest this year, with the acreage
increased to this season's 1.6 million hectares from last year's
1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly bulletin, SADC's Regional Early
Warning Unit said the improved production outlook is also a
result of the government's Drought Recovery Program, under which,
free seeds and fertilizer have been provided to some 1.8 million
communal farmers.
</P>
<P>
Should rainfall remain favorable during the remainder of this
season, a maize harvest of up to 2.3 million tonnes could be
brought in, as compared with 840,000 tonnes yielded in the last
season, the SADC bullitin indicated.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government introduced the Grain Loan Scheme
last year and many people have benefited from it. Almost six
million people or 74 percent of the population applied for
assistance under the scheme between July last year to February
this year.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said the rest of SADC was also poised to harvest
above average yields owing to the good rains.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 2 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Vice-president Godfrey
Miyanda has held several rounds of talks with leaders of the
striking civil servants in order to resolve the industrial
conflict, the "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman of Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ)
Lenard Hikaumba was quoted as saying that his union had held some
meetings with the vice-president and the talks continued
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
However, Hikaumba did not disclose the details of the
discussions, saying the union could only do so at this stage of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
As the nation-wide strike enters its fifth day, some heads of
government departments have been directed to submit names of
their striking subordinates for disciplinary action because the
government insists that the strike is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Junior civil servants in various parts of the country began
the strike on Tuesday, protesting the alleged government's
failure to pay them 45 percent pay increment ruled by the
Industrial Relations Court last month.
</P>
<P>
But the government has explained that the 45 percent increase
includes the 30 percent awarded to the civil servants last year and
now it can only effect 15 percent increment.

NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao Friday sought to dispel the impression, created by
his political opponents, that he had manipulated the hawala
investigation to keep away from the dragnet of the law, the Times
of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of members of parliament of the ruling
Congress Party, Rao said the government had in no way interfered
in the course of law in the Hawala case, an 18-million-US-dollar
bribery scandal rocking the country's political arena.
</P>
<P>
Congress spokesman V.N. Gadgil quoted Rao as saying that the
government would not "tamper with the powers of any constitutional
authority."
</P>
<P>
Rao made the clarification in the wake of mounting speculations
that the prime minister, who is the direct administrative
controller of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been
manipulating the Hawala case in the run-up to the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Supreme Court issued a directive ordering
the CBI to refrain from reporting the progress of investigations
in the scandal to higher administrative authorities including the
prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nissan Moto company, the second
largest Japanese automaker, has announced a dramatic growth of 35
percent in its market share among Japanese auto manufactures in
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Based on auto shipments during 1995, Nissan's market share
has gone up from 14 points in 1994 to over 19 points among
Japanese automakers in 1995," Nissan Middle East FZE Director
Khosuke Miyoshi was quoted as saying by today's Emirates News.
</P>
<P>
"Nissan has been able to hold its prices despite the
appreciation of the yen against the dollar-linked currencies of
the GCC," he added.
</P>
<P>
Japanese automakers shipped 137,077 passenger cars and
commercial vehicles to the GCC during 1995. Of these Nissan
shipped 26,281 units during the year.
</P>
<P>
To further consolidate its position, Nissan Middle East FZE
plans to start marketing cars in the Gulf countries from its
assembly plans in Spain and the UK, said Miyoshi.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Nissan's exports in 1995 totaled 598,072 units, down 1.8
percent from the previous year. While exports of commercial vehicles
decreased, those of passenger cars increased.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Antique Auction Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China will exercise central
control over the antique auction market since this year and allows
only six auctioneers to try antique auction.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics say that the
bureau will directly examine and approve antique auction
qualification and the number of auction sessions, organize experts
to appraise the antiques to be auctioned, supervise and manage
antique auction market, and collect a proportion of the profits
gained by antique auction for the purpose of protecting cultural
relics.
</P>
<P>
"Only approved auctioneers can auction approved antiques in
approved auction sessions to designated buyers, " the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
The six auctioneers approved are the Beijing Hanhai Art Auction
Corp.; China Guardian Auctions Co., Ltd; Sichuan Hanya Art Auction
Corp.; Rongbao Art Auction Co. Ltd; Shanghai Duoyunxuan Art
Auction Corp.; and the Sungari International Auction Company, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Rongbao and Duoyunxuan are only allowed to auction such kinds
of antiques as Chinese paintings and calligraphy and four
treasures of the study (writing brush, inkstick, inkslab and
paper), while Sungari can only auction antiques collected from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Li Ji, director of the Third Department of the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics, says that the new measure was taken in accordance
with the principle put forward at the National Working Conference
on Cultural Relics last September, "to exercise central control
over antique auction market and make the profits gained by the
auction be mainly used for cultural relics protection."
</P>
<P>
"In view of the fact that too many auctioneers try to sell
antiques, the new policy aims to avoid disorder in antique auction
market, thus effectively preventing precious cultural relics from
being taken overseas," he says.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, a dozen of auctioneers have tried antique
auctions with art works at auction worthing 500 million yuan.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the three main
opposition parties in Kenya have held a joint meeting with
President Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi, the Presidential Press
Service (PPS) bulletin says.
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting focused on the country's economy and
especially social dimensions of transition between President Moi
and Kijana Wamalwa, Chairman of FORD-Kenya, Martin Shikuku,
Secretary-General of FORD-Asili and Mwai Kibaki, Chairman of
Democratic Party of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the meeting, the three opposition leaders said "the
meeting was a most welcome development because we ourselves have
been seeking such a meeting for quite some time now."
</P>
<P>
Kenya decided to adopte multi-partism in 1991 under the
pressure of western donors and the first multi-party general
election was held in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
During the election, the main opposition parties which vowed
to remove President Moi from power failed partly due to their
disunity.
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting between President Moi and the opposition
leaders was held one year before the next general election and at
a time when each opposition party is weakening with the split.

<HEADLINE> Strug Shines at American Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kerri Strug took the advantage
of the absence of top two injured American women gymnasts to
shine, topping in all-around preliminaries at the American Cup
gymnastics tournament in Fort Worth, Texas on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of injured top two American women gymnasts of
Shannon Miller and up-and-comer Dominique Moceanu, Strug, 18,
tallied at 38.925 points to finish first overall.
</P>
<P>
Apart from being tied in the floor routine and on the balance
beam, the Amrican also was second on the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
Sharing most of the night's glory with Strug was Belarus'
23-year-old Svetlana Boguinskaya, who tied Strug in the balance
beam, and was the outright winner on the uneven bars and vault.
</P>
<P>
The only event she didn't win was the floor routine, which she
bungled by sprawling off the mat on her last pass. It cost her
first in the overall standings. She wound up third with 38.362.
</P>
<P>
Oksana Chousovitina of Uzbeskistan, who tied Strug for the
first in the uneven bars, was second at 38.7.
</P>
<P>
Kristy Powell of River Forest, Ill., tied Strug in the floor
routine and was fifth overall. She will advance to Saturday's
all-around finals to defend her American Cup title.
</P>
<P>
Other finalists are Joanna Juarez of Spain, Sang Lan of China,
Alexandra Dobrescu of Romania and Yvonne Tousek of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Allows Boat People to Emigrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam agrees to let its boat
people emigrate as long as they are eligible and want to resettle
in other countries, the official English Vietnam News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Deputy Foreign Minister Bui
Hong Phuc said returned boat people should be accommodated if they
have met Vietnam's criteria for departure and have been accepted
by host countries.
</P>
<P>
Responding to foreign and domestic reporters who requested to
interview returned refugees, Phuc said U.S. journalists have
interviewed several thousand returned refugees in the the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 500 people have been allowed to resettle
in the U.S., Phuc added.
</P>
<P>
He observed that those coming back from other Southeast Asian
countries and Hong Kong and qualified for departure again could be
interviewed by journalists, who would get full cooperation from
the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
He promised that refugees having allowed to stay by their host
countries could get visas to leave Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On those who are not classified as Indochinese refugees, the
deputy foreign minister said Vietnam would perform its obligations
according to international law.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Tin, Rubber Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Prices on the Kuala Lumpur
Tin Market (KLTM) closed sharply lower this week to 15.57
Malaysian Ringgit (about 6.23 US dollars) per kg from 15.72
Ringgit (about 6.29 dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
The market re-opened Monday at 15.77 Ringgit (about 6.3
dollars) per kg and continued its downtrend across the board until
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the market was weak due to heavy liquidation
following weaker overseas sentiment. They said the market was
also affected by heavy offerings as players liquidated their
positions to avoid further losses.
</P>
<P>
The week's turnover narrowed to 504 tons from 584 tons
previously with interest mainly from European and local buyers.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and the London Metal Exchange
(LME) Friday also narrowed to 120 dollars per ton from 165 dollars
per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
Crude palm oil physicals closed sharply lower this week after
the recent week-long festive holidays. The market was volatile
and speculative as players entered the market based on technical
selling and buying.
</P>
<P>
February South closed the week at 1,210 Malaysian Ringgit
(about 484 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaysia's rubber prices finished the week higher
after the week-long holidays.
</P>
<P>
Prices surged Monday to 414.5 sen (about 1.66 dollars) per kg
from 407 sen (about 1.63 dollars) previously, but returned to
412.5 sen (about 1.65 dollars) per kg Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market went up due to strong sentiment in the
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
The price for RSS1 was up 5.5 sen to 412.5 sen (about 1.65
dollars) while the SMR20 increased 2.5 sen to 398.5 sen (about
1.59 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock Market
ended the week on a higher note with interest mainly focused in
the second board counters.
</P>
<P>
The market reopened Monday after a week-long holidays. The
Composite Index gained 3.51 points to 1,093.56 this week, the all
share Emas Index rose 0.59 points to 309.82, while the Industrial
Index added 5.5 points to 1,976.2.
</P>
<P>
Although the market was expected to have a strong rally after
the holidays, players said the market would not go up at present
due to high interest rates which were expected to increase
further.
</P>
<P>
Due to this factor, many foreign fund managers as well as
locals are focusing their attention on the money market by taking
the advantage of the country's high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The main board volume totaled 740.552 million shares worth 4.13
billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 1.65 billion US dollars) from
870.093 million shares valued at 4.724 billion Ringgit (about 1.89
billion dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
The second board's turnover stood at 362.633 million shares
valued at 2.793 billion Ringgit (about 1.12 billion dollars) from
199.734 million shares valued at 1.821 billion Ringgit (about 728
million dollars) previously.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Australians Go Voting  (by Liu Zhongkai) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- "Have Liberal Party?" a young
female smiles sweetly and hands out information sheets of her
party outside the Belconnen polling place in Canberra, the
national capital of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Not every passing voter accepted the paper, but the welcoming
Liberal member in her white dress surely caught more attention
than her counterpart from the Labor Party -- a middle-aged woman
standing a few meters away.
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that Liberal volunteers at most
polling stations in the city are attractive young people, while
Labor volunteers are generally older.
</P>
<P>
Bill and Nancy Simington, a couple in their 70s, said that they
have voted for Liberal in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"We don't vote for the other major party (Labor) because we
don't like the candidate," they said after casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
"He (Keating) is too arrogant. He has too much of his own
visions and doesn't care about people's welfare," they added.
</P>
<P>
But university students Belinda Barnard and Aaron Barclay have
different views, saying that Liberal has not outlined adequate
measures to help the unemployed. They said they voted for Labor
because the government has done a lot to help young people find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Liberal's policies are aimed to help the richer, older people,
not us," they said.
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged Australians do not seem to be impressed by the
policies of either side.
</P>
<P>
Allan Mckinnon, a businessman in his 40s, said that he decided
which candidate he would vote for while driving to the polling
station. He appeared to be in a hurry and wanted to get out of
the polling hall as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"It's no enjoyment for me at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brimson Strachey, a small business employee, went to the
polling place with his wife Elses and two children. He voted for
Liberal as he had done in the last election.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the Labor government's economic management
in the past three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Labor tried to show off its achievements in
economic growth in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
"But three months do not make much difference as long as you
did badly in three years," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, a government worker who immigrated from the
Philippines 17 years ago is a determined supporter of Labor. She
said that immigration policies were the top concern for her in the
election. She prefers Labor to Liberal, because "Labor's
immigration policy is much better than Liberal's."
</P>
<P>
About 11.5 million eligible Australians are expected to cast
their votes today. The flow of voters is steady at almost every
polling station across the country. With the count of ballots
starting at 6 p.m. local time, the final results might be made
public before midnight.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 1,163 candidates from 31 parties are contesting the
148 seats of the House of Representatives and half of the 80 seats
of the Senate.

Investigation (CBI) to refrain from reporting the progress of
investigations in the hawala scandal to higher administrative
authorities including the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Likely to Accept Opposition Demand  for Caretaker Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia is likely to accept the opposition's idea of forming a
caretaker government to oversee the next general elections,
according to concerned sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources disclosed that the prime minister will call upon
the agitating opposition to come to the negotiating table for an
understanding on the issue in her address to the nation over radio
and television tomorrow or the day after.
</P>
<P>
She may also explain that the February 15 sixth parliamentary
election, which was held by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) and some other small parties and boycotted by all
opposition parties, was a constitutional compulsion which had now
created an opportunity to resolve the country's political crisis
over the caretaker issue within the purview of the Constitution,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some BNP leaders confirmed that the ruling party would take a
"flexible" stand on the form of a caretaker government and move a
bill in the newly-elected sixth parliament to provide for such an
arrangement if the opposition extended cooperation to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would not need to agitate further because the
BNP would resolve the political impasse through discussion and in
a couple of days the BNP would communicate to the opposition the
party's offer for resuming dialogue to end the political crisis, a
BNP leader added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an authoritative source indicated that the
government is contemplating releasing the arrested opposition
leaders provided the opposition comes to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi opposition and the BNP and its government have
long been locked in a political impasse over caretaker government
to oversee national elections. Although the BNP went through the
election, the opposition refused to accept the election and has
continued its agitation programs to press the demand for holding
fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Even if the BNP government accepts the caretaker government
idea, it may not be easy to resolve the political crisis since the
opposition has set pre-conditions for the dialogue with the BNP,
that is, cancellation of the February 15 polls, resignation of the
present BNP government and release of all arrested opposition
leaders and workers, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> India Willing to Facilitate Nepal's Export: Rao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao said that his government is willing to extend all
possible facilities to help Nepali exports to India.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been asking India to remove its raw material and
labor content requirement for Nepali goods' entry into the Indian
market with a view to reducing the over 300 million-US-dollar
trade deficit every year with India.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Nepal's official news agency RSS
published today here, Rao also said India would sort out some
restrictive regulations discouraging Indian businessmen from
investing in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent bilateral treaty on the integrated
development of a border river, Rao said that water resources have
been one of the most potent areas for cooperation between India
and Nepal and the new agreement is a great development.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on the Mahakali river on Nepal's western border
signed last month was believed to settle several controversial
issues on the development of the border river between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Indian prime minister said that India is
concerned about the undesirable anti-social activities and trade
deflection caused by the more than 1,000-km open border with
Nepal and would maintain tightened surveillance and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
He urged frequent interaction and liaison between concerned
officers of border districts from both sides.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Protests U.S. Drug "Certification" Denial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Pardo Garcia-Pena today called "unacceptable and
unilateral" the United States decision not to certify Colombia's
efforts to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"We consider unacceptable the interference in the internal
affairs of Colombia and deplore the change of policy that had been
officially stated previously by the United States on the matter,"
Pardo told a group of journalists.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced today its decision to drop Colombia from a
list of nations that cooperate in the international struggle
against drugs. The denial of certification makes Colombia
ineligible for most U.S. aid and U.S. government-backed loans.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers said the impact of decertification
would be more political than economic.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the U.S. decision showed that the evaluation was
politically motivated and not based on objective standards.
</P>
<P>
Colombia will continue its efforts to combat drug trafficking
despite the U.S. decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. move would not only weaken joint efforts
against drug trafficking, but would help the drug cartels.

YANGON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State Law

today urged the peasants to try their utmost to grow more paddy
and other crops by engaging in double and multiple cropping.

Agriculture is the backbone of Myanmar's economy, accounting

Paddy, the main crop in Myanmar's agricultural sector, yielded
900 million baskets (18 million tons) in 1994-95 fiscal year with
rice export exceeding 1 million tons. The paddy output is expected
to rise to 1 billion baskets (20 million tons) in the present
1995-96 fiscal year ending March.

said today in an apparent attempt to placate Moscow.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
in Prague that Moscow is strongly opposed to NATO's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski made the remarks at a meeting with Slovak President
Michal Kovac. It was the Polish president's first working visit to
Slovakia since he took office last December.
</P>
<P>
Kovac suggested that Central and East European nations should
show Russia that their membership of the European Union and NATO
would contribute to global stability.
</P>
<P>
The presidents agreed that the two countries could cooperate in
their bid to join the EU and the Atlantic alliance, saying that
entry is of strategic significance.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski added that he would be glad to see the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland enter both the EU and
NATO.

<HEADLINE> Assassin Still at Large Ten Years After Palme Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Many Swedes took to the freezing
streets of Stockholm these days to pay tribute to the late prime
minister Olof Palme, who was gunned down 10 years ago as he and
his wife were walking home from a cinema.
</P>
<P>
The spot in downtown Stockholm where Palme was killed and his
grave in a nearby church were covered with red roses by the early
hours on Wednesday morning as people were gathering in silence to
honor the late prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Many are disappointed ten years after the killing, believing
that government efforts to bring the murderer to justice may
result in nothing.
</P>
<P>
Palme, chairman of the Social Democratic Party and prime
minister from 1969 to 1976 and from 1982 to 1986, was shot dead on
Sveavaegen street on February 28, 1986, as he and his wife Lisbet
were walking towards a subway station from a cinema.
</P>
<P>
A killer quietly came from shadows and shot him in the back at
point blank range with a gun containing armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
The murder stunned Sweden and the international community
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Swedes generally agree that their traditionally peaceful and
somewhat isolated society was dragged brutally into modern,
violent times by the killing.
</P>
<P>
The government assigned Hans Holmer, police director of the
Stockholm Police of the day, to lead an investigation task-force
to probe into the killing in 1986.
</P>
<P>
After newspapers carried a sketch portrait of the murderer on
March 6, 1986, police detained some suspects, of whom a
33-year-old man was most suspicious. They tried him and found he
was not at the scene of the murder that night.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government also established a jurist committee,
which threw bitter criticism on the police authorities and the
prosecution organ for the slow progress in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, some Kurds were arrested under the suspicion that they
killed Palme in retaliation of Sweden's rejection to allow leader
of the Kurdish Workers' Party to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
They were all released for lack of evidence later.
</P>
<P>
Holmer and a chief prosecutor were sacked due to their
incompetence to find the assassin. Two justice ministers also
resigned later.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, 1988, police arrested Christer Pettersson, 42,
a notorious criminal who had committed many crimes and been
sentenced 18 times for prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Pettersson went on trial in a local court in Stockholm on June
5, 1989. Lisbet, Palme's wife, testified at the court that he was
the right man that appeared at the scene of the killing.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced Pettersson to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed to a higher court, which ruled in December,
1989 that Pettersson was innocent. The year-long trial drew heavy
attention both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Although the investigation still goes on, many doubt the killer
will ever be found 10 years after the killing.
</P>
<P>
Despite bold words, it appears that Swedish authorities are no
closer to solving the case than they were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into Palme's killing is winding down and
from the next year on only a handful of detectives will remain
assigned to the job, checking out the last of tens of thousands of
clues and tip-offs.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Must Respond to EU Demand by March 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's ruling body
UEFA have to respond to EU demand by Tuesday that have changed the
transfer fee system and nationality restrictions, a Commission
spokeswoman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said in January that UEFA must respond within
six weeks or face possible fines but did not mention a specific
date.
</P>
<P>
The European Union executive says the transfer fee rules and
restrictions on non-national players a team can field, declared
illegal in the European Court of Justice's so-called Bosman
ruling, break EU competition laws.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has not yet formally responded to the Commission's
warning, spokeswoman Barbara Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
It announced last month that it would scrap restrictions on
foreign players in its club competitions but expected clubs to
stick to voluntary restrictions until the end of the current
season.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it was only "partly satisfied" with that
response, asking soccer clubs and associations to fall in line
immediately with UEFA's commitment.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Citizens of this largest port city
in north China have been lining up to buy houses during the Spring
Festival, the Chinese lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The buying spree came at a time when the municipal government
has begun to embark on a housing reform in order to encourage
people to buy their own houses.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin branch of the People's Construction Bank of China
has provided 50 million yuan (about six million US dollars) in
loans to support the reform.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 real estate developers have signed agreements with
the branch to sell houses.
</P>
<P>
The houses will be mainly sold to average citizens who have
stable incomes and are capable of repaying the loans on time. The
loans are to be repaid over one to ten years.
</P>
<P>
"Payment in instalments has made the housing dream a reality
this Spring Festival," said a citizen who has purchased an
apartment with two living rooms and a drawing room for 100,000
yuan (about 12,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that the reform has given a shot in the arm to
Tianjin's sluggish housing market.

Tourism provides almost 35 percent of Caribbean countries

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- FINA, swimming's world
governing body, has requested transcripts and exhibits from the US
Swimming hearing on Jessica Foschi's positive steroids test in
order to review the case.
</P>
<P>
The review is not expected to be completed until after the US
Olympic trials are completed. Foschi, a distance swimmer
considered an Atlanta Games contender at 800 meters, begins
competing next Thursday at the trials in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Foschi was given two years probation, then banned for two years
and then had her punishment reduced back to probation by US
Swimming, the domestic ruling body.
</P>
<P>
FINA could re-impose the two-year competition ban, even if
Foschi qualifies for the Atlanta Olympics, but Foschi could appeal
through FINA and the US court system.
</P>
<P>
The fact the Olympics are on US soil might give any legal fight
by Foschi to compete at Atlanta an extra chance of success.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Foreign Military Exchanges Help Mutual Understanding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Frequent and increasing
sino-foreign military exchanges in the past year have enhanced
mutual understanding and confidence and have played a positive
role in promoting China's relations with foreign countries,
especially its military relations of cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Luo Bin, director of the Foreign Affairs
Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Luo described 1995 as a year characterized by "active and
frequent" exchanges between Chinese and foreign armed forces, and
a year which witnessed important progress in consolidating,
strengthening and developing friendly exchanges and co-operation
between Chinese and foreign armies.
</P>
<P>
In the year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) hosted
125 military delegations from 55 countries, of which 47
delegations were led by either defence ministers, chiefs of staff
or commanders of various services of the armies.
</P>
<P>
The PLA sent 87 delegations to 30 countries, 15 of which were
led by leaders of the Central Military Commission or chiefs of the
General Staff and Logistics Department or director of the PLA
General Political Department, according to the Foreign Affairs
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening exchanges and co-operation with the armies of
China's neighboring countries was the focus of the military
contacts, Luo said. In that year Zhang Wannian and Chi haotian,
both vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission, Chief of
General Staff Fu Quanyou and other senior officers led PLA
delegations to almost a dozen countries, including Vietnam, Laos,
Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Their
visits played important roles in enhancing mutual understanding
and confidence between the PLA and the armed forces of those
countries.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Foreign Military Exchanges Enhance Mutual Understanding (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The successful official visit to Russia by Liu Huaqing,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, contributed to
the co-operation between the Chinese and Russian armies in the new
international situation, while Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev's China trip reached the goal of increasing mutual
understanding, making relations closer and strengthening
co-operation between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation and strengthening of the traditional
friendship and co-operation between the PLA and armies in the
Eastern European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent
States were marked by the China tour by the defense ministers of
Ukraine, Belarus, Kirghizstan and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's high-level exchanges and contacts with the armed
forces of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America
became more active and frequent last year. The year saw China's
increasing contacts with them, including Egypt, Turkey, Israel,
Chile, Peru, Syria, Kuwait, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Ethiopia and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The military exchanges between China and the United States last
year were affected by the ups and downs in the relations between
the two countries. In the first four months the bilateral
relations between the two countries developed smoothly, while the
military exchanges were conducted accordingly at various levels.
</P>
<P>
However, in May the US government's allowing Lee Teng-hui to
visit that country put an obstacle in the way of Sino-US relations
and negatively affected the military exchanges between the two
armed forces. With the improvement of bilateral relations
following the meeting between the top leaders of the two countries
in New York last October, the political atmosphere for Sino-US
military relations improved.
</P>
<P>
Last year could be termed a year in which the military
relations between the PLA and the armed forces of the West went
through a process of "full restoration", Luo said, adding this was
marked by visits to China by senior officers from France, Austria,
Germany, Finland, Holland, Canada, Switzerland, Portugal, Britain
and Australia. Many of the visitors stated their belief after
their trips that China is not and will not be a threat to the
region or the world. They added that they thought that China's
economic growth would be a contribution to the peace of the world
and global economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its "multi-faceted" military contacts with
foreign countries this year so as to make such exchanges serve the
PLA's modernization drive and the country's diplomacy as a whole,
Luo said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Soccer Player May Play in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old soccer player may well
be the first ever Egyptian to play for one of the top Italian
teams next season, a local newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hazem Tmam, who played at the African Nations Cup Championship
which ended in Johannesburg early last month, has reportedly been
offered a 350,000-U.S. dollar contract by Juventus, one of the
leading Italian soccer clubs, according to Egypt's only English
language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
But Zamalek, the Cairo-based Egyptian soccer club which the
player is now playing for, has threatened to block the deal,
arguing that Imam should play for the club for another season
before signing up with any foreign team.
</P>
<P>
The club, one of the most famous in the north African country,
has also warned that it would not allow Imam to sign with any
foreign club for less than three million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imam's father, Hamada, strongly protested against the club's
attitude, saying that his son is too young to claim such a large
sum of money from a foreign team.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the newspaper said, the top Egyptian sports
official has pledged to mediate and help the young player sign for
Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Monem Umara, Chairman of the Higher Council for Youth and
Sports, explained that the experience Imam would gain by playing
for the world famous team would greatly benefit the Egyptian
national squad in the future.
</P>
<P>
Imam's father was quoted by the newspaper as saying that a
brilliant performance by Imam at the Nations Cup attracted the
attention of a number of foreign clubs, which said that they want
Imam to join them.

<P>
ROME, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian television journalists at
state-owned broadcaster RAI are set for a 24-hour strike on Monday
in protest at the football rights to Italian football being given
to the Cecchi-Gori Group.
</P>
<P>
The private group, which bears the name of Fiorentina club
president Vittorio Cecchi-Gori, won the exclusive rights to show
Europe's most glamorous league for the next three years at a price
of 130 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Politicians from all sides denounced the decision to award the
contract to a private company. Some said it would be the death of
the public service broadcaster, while others said that televised
football should be available to all.
</P>
<P>
Cecchi-Gori issued a statemant saying it would serve the public
interest by meeting with RAI to enable football to be shown on
other channels.
</P>
<P>
Letizia Moratti, president of RAI, rejected their offer
saying: "I am sorry for Italians living here and abroad who will
not be able to watch the Italian League for three years. However,
RAI's policy is not to deal with Cecchi-Gori's sports events
marketing men."

<HEADLINE> FA Backs Advantage Rule Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association is backing
a suggestion to allow referees who play the advantage rule to
change their mind and award a free-kick if no advantage
materialises.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's rule-making body, the International Football Association
Board, is to vote on the idea at its annual meeting in Rio de
Janeiro on March 9.
</P>
<P>
The FA, one of four permanent members of the board, wants to
give referees the chance to go back and award a free-kick if the
team benefiting from the advantage rule subsequently lose
possession.
</P>
<P>
English football's governing body believe that would allow more
flexibility to the rule -- and it could be implemented next season.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA official said the main problem would be to decide how
long referees could wait before deciding whether the team had, in
fact, gained an advantage.
</P>
<P>
The board will also vote on a move to allow three substitutions
and a total of seven players on the substitutes bench during all
official competition matches.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals include one to give formal recognition that it
is the linesman's role to signal offside and off-the-ball
incidents. Any proposals passed by the board will be introduced
on July 1.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEW YORK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrials at the
New York Stock Exchange ended Friday's session higher after
swinging widely, but the broader market was hit hard by a drop in
computer shares.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrial average added 50.94 points to 5,536.56,
ending in the positive column for the first time this week. The
blue-chip index lost 93.93 points for the whole week.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by about 8 to 5. Big Board
volume was heavy at 471.36 million shares, above Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Broad indexes were mixed.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.38 to 345.18. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.94 to 644.37. The American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 1.44 to 563.44.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.37 to 1,085.68, pushed
lower by a drop in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
Computer issues dropped broadly after Compaq Computer said its
first-quarter profit margin likely will fall below that of the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Compaq's shares fell about nearly percent. That drove
computer-related stocks lower, including IBM, which had made
strong gains earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
But consumer stocks, which usually perform well during economic
downturns, led the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also helped higher by bonds, according to market
analysts.

<HEADLINE> Perry: NATO to Take Up Expansion Issue Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry said here today that NATO will take up the controversial
question of which eastern or central European nations will be
first brought into the Western military alliance and set a time
table for the eastward expansion sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a signing ceremony in the Pentagon, Perry told
reporters that leaders of the 16-nation alliance are to meet in
December to lay groundwork for taking new members. The next step
to decide "who should be admitted and when" will follow in 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this process is on track," Perry said. "It should
be neither accelerated nor delayed."
</P>
<P>
Washington has been aggressively advocating NATO's eastward
expansion while Moscow has been strongly opposing the move, saying
that the NATO expansion policy would create a potential security
threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Some Central and East European nations have expressed their
strong desire to become members of the western military alliance.
The Czech Republic is widely regarded as a leading candidate for
the new NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Perry and visiting Czech Defense Minister Vilem Holan today
signed an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief called the agreement an example of closer
U.S.-Czech ties "drawing the Czech Republic closer to the NATO
alliance."

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. defense Secretary William
Perry said today he did not expect any military conflict to break
out on Saturday when Cuban exiles hold demonstration near Cuba to
protest the shooting of two U.S. planes by Cuban fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked to representatives of both sides (the Cuban
government and Cuban refugees in Florida) and we believe that both
sides are interested in this being a peaceful demonstration,"
Perry told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that U.S. warships and fighter jets would be
on routine alert in case they were called on by the U.S. Coast
Guard.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect a military conflict to break out," Perry
stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered yesterday the Coast Guard
to escort Cuban-American protesters who plan to send boats and
small airplanes into the Caribbean on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said the escort was intended to make
sure the demonstration would be confined to international waters
and airspace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton warned Cuba not to interfere with the
memorial ceremony for four pilots killed when their planes were
shot down.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo got
additional guarantees from the International Police Force today for
them to leave safely the Serb part of Sarajevo which are now under the
control of the Muslim-Croat federation police.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting between Republika Srpska Interior Minister Dragan
Kijac and assistant commander of the International Police Force Robert
Lasserman, the two sides agreed that the International Police Force
secure the arrival of convoys to evacuate the Serbs who want to
leave the Sarajevo suburbs that are or will be under the Bosnian
government control by March 19.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after an incident happened at Ilijas Thursday,
when the suburb was handed over to the Muslim-Croat federation in
keeping with the Dayton peace agreement, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said Muslim civilians stormed the suburb and stoned Serb
families which were about to leave and refused to live in the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Muslim-Croat police have entered two of the five suburbs formerly
controlled by the Serbs, thus officially ending the three and half year
siege of Sarajevo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were only about 3,000 residents, most were Serbs, in Ilijas
on Wednesday, and all the others had moved out to other Serb
territories in fear of possible retaliation by the Muslims, reports
from Sarajevo said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel Rejects Calls for Scrapping CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A bipartisan U.S. panel today
officially rejected repeated calls by some Congressmen for
scrapping the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) because of its
failure since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
In a study sparked largely by the Aldrich Ames spy fiasco, the
17-member panel insisted that the the United States needs to
preserve a "strong" spy apparatus in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
The commission was chartered eight months after Ames, a 31-year
veteran counterintelligence officer was arrested as spy for Moscow
within the CIA in early 1994. The failure to spot Ames shook
confidence in the CIA and many Congressmen have since been calling
for scrapping of the agency.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by former U.S. Defense Secretary Harold
Brown, dismissed the lawmakers' critics.
</P>
<P>
But it called for streamlining the U.S. spy network while
allowing the CIA to keep its controversial covert action
capability abroad.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that covert action--the practice of trying
to influence events abroad with a measure of "plausible
deniability"--should be maintained to give the U.S. President "an
option short of military action when diplomacy alone cannot do the
job."
</P>
<P>
The study also called for expanded authority and control of the
U.S. intelligence community which spends some 28 billion U.S.
dollars a year in its operations.

<HEADLINE> Tight Control Of Government Spending Boosts Tanzania Shilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tight control of government
spending has led to the appreciation of the Tanzania Shilling.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Tanzania currency appreciated from 610.33
Shillings for one US dollar in November, last year, to 541.5
Shilling for one US dollar as of February 28, according to daily
rates published by the Bank of Tanzania (BOT).
</P>
<P>
The latest BOT monthly Economic Bulletin was made available to
Xinhua here today, said, "the strengthening of the Shilling
against the US dollar has been attributed to an export earning,
tight monetary policy stance and the implementation of government
cash budgeting system -- which indirectly reduce import demand."
</P>
<P>
Under the cash budget system, adopted by the government in the
last seven months, expenditure was being matched by available
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The BOT bulletin said that the government's budgetary
performance for the first seven months of the 1995/96 fiscal year
(July - January), showed that a revenue of 299.4 billion
Shillings (about 544 million US dollars) was collected, equal to
50.3 percent of the annual estimates or 12.8 percent of the
country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It said that there was substantial improvement in revenue
collection in December and January, following the announcement of
additional tax measures introduced in the January, 1966,
mini-budget.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure reached 271.4 billion Shillings (about 493
million US dollars), which is 43.2 percent of the budgeted level,
the bulletin said, adding that the government expenditure was
dominated by recurrent votes where 268.1 billion Shillings (about
487 milliion US dollars) were spent, while 3.4 billion Shillings
(about 6 million US dollars) went to development projects.
</P>
<P>
The BOT bulletin said that the overall deficit of 49.4 billion
Shillings (about 89 million US dollars) - including floats of 21.4
billion Shillings (about 39 million US dollars), was financed by
external loans, grants, sale of Treasury Bills and Bank Borrowing.

LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- British MPs investigating the
sacking of Michael Lawrence as chief executive of the London Stock
Exchange (LSE) will ask the Treasury as well as the Office of Fair
Trading to give their view on the row.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that MPs also plans to summon John

questioning on the way the exchange is run and the circumstances
surrounding the sacking in January of Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
The Commons Treasury committee completed a first round of
hearings into the exchange Thursday, but MPs heard such
conflicting accounts of the events leading to Lawrence's dismissal
that they want to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the committee Thomas Arnold said that he was
increasingly puzzled by conflicting versions of the exchange's
boardroom revolt.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, who became the LSE's chief executive in February
1994, was forced to resign on January 4 after "a loss of
confidence in him".

<HEADLINE> US Cuts Off Most Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today decided to suspend most U.S. aid to Colombia after
concluding that Colombian authorities failure to cooperate with
the U.S. war on drugs, U.S. officials said here.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision was announced following release of a State
Department report saying Colombia remained the "world's leading
producer and distributor of cocaine and a major supplier of heroin
and marijuana."
</P>
<P>
Although Colombia made some progress in cracking down on
illicit drugs last year, "there was a lack of commitment by the
(Ernesto) Samper administration to support the efforts," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
By the U.S. law, countries failing to cooperate lose most U.S.
foreign assistance and all U.S. Export-Import Bank financing.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Secretary of State Warren Christopher
recommended last night that Mexico be kept on a favoured list of
countries that cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking,
but Colombia should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1988 Foreign Assistance Act, the secretary of state
is required to provide the president annually with a
recommendation on which country is cooperating with U.S.
counter-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton accepted Christopher's recommendation to determine that
Mexico is cooperating fully with the U.S. on drug issues.
</P>
<P>
"The international drug trade had little to cheer about in
1995," the State Department report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that "despite our collective effort in 1995,
trafficking organizations managed to produce and move tons of
cocaine and heroin to nearly every country in the world."

<TEXT>
<P>
LIBREVILLE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government today
reached an agreement with the opposition UNITA to form a Unity
Government and a new National Army by July this year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a joint communique issued after today's
talks between President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi in Libreville, capital of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of a Angolan National Army will be completed by
June 1996. And between June and July 1996 we will have completed
the formation of a Government of National Unity and
Reconciliation," said the joint communique.
</P>
<P>
"President Dos Santos has invited UNITA to take up the
vice-presidency and the response will be sent to him in a
letter," Savimbi told a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi said he had given dos Santos a list of four UNITA
officials to head four ministries in the Unity Government.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, UNITA agreed to disarm all its troops by
June, Savimbi said.
</P>
<P>
So far it has disarmed more than 16,000 of its estimated
60,000 troops since a peace accord signed in Zambia in November,
1994, to end two decades of civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos and Savimbi held a closed-door meeting for several
hours at the Palace of Gabonese President Omar Bongo who brokered
the Angolan summit peace talks, the fourth since November, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, were killed and
millions were displaced in Angola's civil war that erupted after
independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Denies Minister For Women Being Considered In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki tonight denied that a minister for women's
affairs was being considered, saying he had been misquoted
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report quoted Mbeki as saying that a women's office
would soon be set up in the President's Office, and the
possibility of a minister for women's affairs was being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the report, Mbeki's communication director Thami
Ntenteni told reporters that Mbeki had told an African National
Congress (ANC) Women's League meeting in Cape Town that an office
of the status of women would be established in the office of the
chief executive (President Nelson Mandela).
</P>
<P>
Ntenteni said Mbeki had motivated this by saying a minister
for women's affairs would not be able to issue directives to
other ministers, and this was unacceptable as women's affairs
impacted on all ministers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it was felt an office under the chief executive was
desirable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mbeki told the ANC Women's League meeting
that the emancipation of women was not an isolated issue, but
impacted on society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also assured the women that the government was looking
forward to the establishment of a gender commission, which would
also be linked to the new office.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that emancipation did not mean how many
female ministers or directors-general there were, but would be
measured in the context of the upliftment of women, and rural
women in particular.

in the relationship between families and the mass media."

<HEADLINE> Australian Federal Election Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The 38th federal election of
Australia began on 8:00 a.m. local time today.
</P>
<P>
About 11.5 million eligible Australians are expected to turn up
at polling stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 11,000 places where voters can cast

places on the continent to collect pre-election votes.
</P>
<P>
The first vote of this election was cast by a cook in central
Australia a week ago.
</P>
<P>
There are also 500 pre-poll and postal voting centers that
enable people to send their ballots through mail before today's
election.
</P>
<P>
Vote is compulsory for all Australians aged 18 and over. They

Labor now holds a 79-seat majority in the House of
Representatives, while the coalition holds 66.

</P>
<P>
Imports of intermediate goods rose substantially, especially

year.
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin said that traditional exports recorded a total of
51 million US dollars, an increase of up to 50 percent from
January last year, due to higher export volumes for coffee,
cotton, sisal and cashewnuts, increasing by 147.8 percent, 10.1
percent, 336.4 percent and 109 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Manufacturing Weakens For Seventh Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. manufacturing weakened for
the seventh straight month in February but the rate of decline
slowed, a survey of U.S. purchasing executives reported today.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index,
compiled by surveying the managers who buy supplies for the
nation's manufacturers, was up by one percentage point in February
to 45.2 percent from 44.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
A index below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing economy is
contracting, while a figure above that shows expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturing sector contracted for the seventh month in
February, with production, new orders, order backlogs and
employment all indicating decreased activity," Ralph G. Kauffman,
chairman of the group's business survey committee, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is the ninth time in 10 months it has indicated a
softness in manufacturing," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in a sign of reduced inflationary pressure, the survey
showed prices that factories pay for raw materials weakened in
February.
</P>
<P>
Of 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, three reported an
improvement in February. Those industries were petroleum, primary
metals and a miscellaneous category including sporting goods,
jewelry, toys and musical instruments.

<HEADLINE> UK to Build High-speed Rail Link to Channel Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- British Transport Secretary George
Young announced Thursday that the government is to give 1.4
billion pounds (2.1 billion US dollars) to a private consortium to
build a high-speed rail link from London to the Channel tunnel.
</P>
<P>
London &AMP; Continental Railways, a consortium including Virgin
Group and National Express, has been awarded the three billion
pounds (4.6 billion US dollars) contract to build the Channel
tunnel rail link.
</P>
<P>
The consortium is expected to begin work on the 68-mile link
through east London and Kent next year, with completion by 2003, a
decade after the French completed their high-speed line from the
tunnel to Paris.
</P>
<P>
The link, the biggest rail project in Britain this century,
will allow Eurostar trains to speed at 186 miles per hour from
London to the entrance of the Channel Tunnel, slashing half an
hour off journey times between the British and French capitals.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve building international passenger
stations at London St Pancras, Stradford and Ebbsfleet in north
Kent, 68 miles of track and over 10 miles of tunnel under north
London.
