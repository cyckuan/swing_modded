<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat arrived here Wednesday on his way to Gaza from the United
States, where he made a speech to the United Nations General
Assembly and met with U.S. and Israeli leaders on peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival, Arafat said that U.S.
President Bill Clinton is exerting strenuous efforts to advance
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have a program of action in the coming phase," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Arafat will brief Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on his recent talks with Clinton and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the overdue Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held a three-way summit with Clinton and Netanyahu
Monday and met with Clinton again Tuesday in an bid to nail down
an agreement on Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
He and Netanyahu agreed to meet again next month to wrap up a
deal on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called on Israel to hand over a further 13 percent
of the West Bank in return for beefed-up Palestinian crackdown on
terrorism. The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel
refused it, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that major progress has been made in narrow the
gaps between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu said the two
sides were near a deal, indicating Israel would accept the 13
percent pullback, although with certain conditions.

HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Powered by Brazil's World
Cup captain Carlos Dunga, Japanese League champions Jubilo Iwata
defeated senior division champions Instant-Dict of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in a first-round first-leg
match of the 18th Asian Football Club Championship here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visitors led the first half 1-0.
</P>

Instant-Dict's hopes suffered a heavy blow as its central
defender Tim O'Shea could not play against the Japanese team due
to a bad knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The first goal came at the 32nd minute, when Dunga scored
through a free-kick outside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Jubilo Iwata's playing captain Fujita Toshiya added a goal at
the 58th minute of the game in a goal mouth melee.
</P>
<P>
And Hattori Toshihiro sealed the visitors' triumph when he
scored at the 62nd minute.

<HEADLINE> UK's Gas to Swell and Swing European Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) - British natural gas will begin
flowing into Europe on Thursday, marking the beginning of a new era
of competition in European gas markets.
</P>
<P>
The gas will arrive through a 235 kilometer Interconnector
pipeline running under the North Sea from Bacton in eastern
England to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will bridge the divide between what is called
"clashing gas cultures", as Britain's industrial gas market is
liberalized and highly competitive while in Europe giant
monopolies hold sway with buyers tied to traditional long-term
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Interconnector is likely to act as a catalyst and concepts
like short-term trading, well-established in Britain, will soon
start to seep into continental markets, say U.K. analysts.
</P>
<P>
"The pipeline will fundamentally alter the gas market in
Europe. The question is how long will it take," Jonathan Stern of
analysts Gas Strategies was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Interconnector comes over a year before a
new European Union gas directive is implemented. The directive
requires member states to start opening their gas markets and
allow large industrial users to choose their supplier from 2000.
</P>
<P>
Gas consumption is growing rapidly in Europe, fuelled by an
increase in demand from power generators. Demand is expected to
rise by between 30 and 35 percent over the next 10-15 years.
However, competition is heating up with extra supplies set to flow
from Norway, Algeria and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Around half of the 20 billion cubic meters a year capacity of
the Interconnector, built by a consortium of nine companies led by
Britain's BG plc, has already been filled by long-term supply
deals.
</P>
<P>
The debate now is how much of the rest of the capacity will be
used for spot trading and whether continental European prices will
drop as a result of the new competition.
</P>
<P>
European giants like Germany's Ruhrgas, Gaz de France and Dutch
supplier Gasunie are keeping a wary eye on the Interconnector,
according to Reuters. Some, like Gasunie, doubt it will have much
impact. Gasunie points out the gas flow is only a fraction of
European demand and continental prices, which are oil indexed, are
similar to those in the U.K. as a result of the slump in crude
prices this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, they say European buyers prefer the security of long-term
deals rather than the risk involved in spot trading.
</P>
<P>
"We see a little bit of pressure on price levels. But most
people are still looking for long-term contracts and we believe
the character of the market will stay the same," said a spokesman
for Gasunie, adding that spot trading could account for between
five and 10 percent of the market at most.
</P>
<P>
Monopolies may be able to drag their feet about competition as
the gas directive allows countries to opt for "negotiated" third
party access to the pipeline network rather than "regulated"
access.
</P>
<P>
Many suppliers and traders say they see government regulated
third party access to the network as a prerequisite for fair
competition. They fear the directive could give pipeline operators
an ideal opportunity for protracted and inconclusive
"negotiations."
</P>
<P>
If large industrial buyers put pressure on governments then
this should force some of the more reluctant giants to open their
markets, Reuters quoted independent analyst Rowland Sheard as
predicting.
</P>
<P>
"European companies will have to give way as the disease of
spot trading will spread across the channel," said Stern. "It
will take time...but companies will find themselves forced to
compete and this will drive prices down in the end."

JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Two grenades were thrown at
an Israeli border police jeep in Hebron Wednesday, injuring three
policemen, a reporter with the Israeli army radio said.
</P>
<P>
Among the three injured, one was in serious condition, the
reporter added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jewish settler threw a bomb into a Palestinian
car in Hebron Wednesday, forcing the Palestinian driver to jump
out for safety, the Palestinian press service JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
This incident occurred near the entrance of a Jewish settlement
on Shuhada Street in the center of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The car, a Peugeot 504, exploded and set a van carrying
passengers nearby on fire.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Palestinians and three Israelis were injured in the
explosion, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Israeli troops rushed to the scene
and opened fire at the Palestinians and into the sky, apparently
for fear of the situation out of control.
</P>
<P>
the Israeli troops sealed off the area and no body was allowed
to enter it.
</P>
<P>
During this incident, a reporter was reportedly arrested by
the Israeli troops, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
About 450 Jewish settlers live in Hebron with the protection of
Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Firm on Economic, N.Irish Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday asserted that the government would not bow to
calls to soften its tough economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Also, Blair delivered a firm reminder to Irish republican
leader Gerry Adams, attending the Labor Party's annual conference
for the first time, that IRA guerrillas must disarm under Northern
Ireland's landmark peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"On interest rates, I do give people a very tough message. We
must not go back to the days of boom and bust economics," Blair
told British television a day after his keynote speech to the
conference in which he warned of tough times ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Part of my job as leader of the country is to spell out the
tough choices," Reuters quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blair was expected to hold talks with Northern Irish leaders
later on Wednesday to try to defuse a row over stockpiles of
guerrilla arms that has cast an ominous shadow over the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said he would tell Adams, leader of the Irish Republican
Army's political arm, Sinn Fein, that scrapping arms was a part
of the peace agreement approved in a referendum on both sides of
the Irish border in May.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's first minister, Protestant David Trimble,
wanted the IRA to disarm before Sinn Fein members can take up
seats in the new cabinet. But Adams said the agreement allows the
IRA two years before it has to give up its arms.
</P>
<P>
"I will be saying what I've always said that the agreement is
the agreement, all of it's got to be implemented, not simply any
part of it -- decommissioning is part of the agreement," said
Blair, who would also hold talks with Trimble and his deputy
Seamus Mallon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Adams had insisted that if the immediate scrapping of arms
had been a precondition of the Good Friday agreement he would not
have signed it because he would not have been able to deliver on
such a promise.
</P>
<P>
"If Mr Trimble does not keep to the agreement then there is no
agreement," he told BBC television, saying that Sinn Fein had won
its right to sit in the new cabinet in a referendum vote on both
sides of the Irish border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British newspapers styled Blair, after his
hard-hitting speech, the inheritor to 1980s' Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, who kept an iron grip over her Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
Just as Thatcher intoned "There is No Alternative," newspapers
seized on Blair's insistence there would be "No backing down".

<HEADLINE> UK Dismisses Talk of Shift on Gibraltar Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government
Wednesday flatly denied a British newspaper report that Britain
was willing to entertain Spanish claims to joint sovereignty over
the disputed colony of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman was quoted by Reuters as
saying Wednesday's Daily Telegraph report on Gibraltar was wrong
to suggest Britain was shifting its position over Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that British Foreign Office minister Joyce Quin
had told Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana, that Britain
remained committed to the Rock's 1969 constitution.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no change in the sovereignty of Gibraltar
against the wishes of the people," she said, adding that the
impetus for change was coming from Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
It was reported Britain opened exploratory talks Monday at
expert level with the government of Gibraltar, which would like to
modernize its constitution and end its status as a colony.
</P>
<P>
Spain wants Gibraltar, which was ceded to Britain in 1713 under
the Treaty of Utrecht, to be returned to Spanish rule, but Britain
and Gibraltar have rejected the claim.

<HEADLINE> UK's New Rule Benefits Workers but Costs Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- For the first time there will
be clear regulations on the limit as to how long Britain's 26
million workers are expected to work every week, how many breaks
they are entitled to, and how much holiday they get.
</P>
<P>
After a two-year delay, the European Union's Working Time
Directive has finally arrived and will become effective on October
1, according to a BBC report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Advocates hail it as one of the most significant pieces of
employment legislation in this century, while its detractors slam
it for being too costly, too confused and too vague, even opening
up the flood gates to potentially thousands of industrial
tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the regulation is that most workers will be
legally protected from having to work more than a 48 hour-week,
which will be averaged out over a 17-week period by a complex
formula.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a long list of exemptions from the rule,
which has created huge confusion, and there are grey areas. For
example, it's not clear whether time spent traveling on duty
trips, working away from the office and a working lunch will be
counted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, junior doctors, senior managers, fire service workers,
transport workers, police and the tens of thousands of
self-employed, are all exempt. There are also special exemption
cases which cover security and surveillance employees, media
workers, lecturers, hospital and prison workers.
</P>
<P>
But it is annual leave which will prove to be one of the most
dramatic changes to employment law. Three weeks paid annual leave,
at an estimated cost of nearly half a billion pounds to industry,
will be a major benefit to the two million people who currently
get less than that. But the cost will shoot up next year when
annual leave increases to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Employees will be allowed 20 minutes rest every 6 hours, and 11
hours over a 24 hour consecutive period.
</P>
<P>
If all workers take up their new rights, the generally accepted
cost to industry is 2 billion pounds (about 3.4 billion U.S.
dollars). The government also estimates that policing the new laws
may require the Health and Safety Executive to boost its staff by
a quarter, while industrial tribunals could be swamped by 6,000
new cases each year.

<HEADLINE> UK's Housing Market Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- House price rises have slowed
down in Britain for the second month running, according to a
survey by the country's biggest building society.
</P>
<P>
The Nationwide said house prices fell by 0.2 percent in
September, slightly less than the 0.5 percent drop that was seen
in August. However, even with this downturn, property prices are
still 7.5 percent higher than this time last year.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in prices recorded in September was slight, but after
August's decline this should be seen as further evidence of
changing market conditions," Paul Sanderson, Nationwide's head of
research, was quoted by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Buyer demand has clearly weakened over recent months, although
a softer trend in prices may have been reinforced by a modest
increase in properties coming on to the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other house price surveys also indicate that property inflation
is slowing down, and in some cases house prices are declining on a
monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
But most commentators agree that this does not signal a housing
recession. House prices should continue to grow, but at a more
modest rate, they say.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be immune to the inevitable slowing in the wider
economy already under way. House price inflation is likely to
continue to ease, with sales levels remaining at best flat, well
into next year," Sanderson said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Defends Libyan, Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed Wednesday dismissed the warning against the
representatives of Libya and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The warning and threat were forwarded by faction leaders
opposing the recently announced administration in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Six break-away faction leaders including Hussein Hajji Bod,
the former deputy chairman of Ali Mahdi's faction, issued an ultimatum
Tuesday against the representatives of Egypt and Libya to leave
Somalia within 48 hours after accusing them of deliberately
siding with what they called the alliance of Ali Mahdi Mohamed
and Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon held Wednesday in south Mogadishu to
commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Libyan revolution,
Ali Mahdi said Mogadishu has now the strong enough
police force to defend the diplomats of Egypt and Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We can guarantee the security of the diplomats," said Ali
Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has characterized the group that issued the
ultimatum against the Egyptian and Libyan diplomats as
individuals who do not represent the wishes of the Somalis as he
put it. Ali Mahdi said the diplomats of Libya and Egypt are here
for the sole interest of the Somalis in fostering reconciliation
among the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed also declared his support for the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) resolution calling for the
lift of the air embargo against the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
He regarded Libyan leader Muammar Ghadaffi as a hero and a
very dear friend and brother for the Arab world and urged
regional and international organizations to work on lifting the
air embargo against Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Sabir, the acting ambassador of Libya to Somalia, who has
offered the luncheon attended by hundreds of Somalis, thanked
the people for their participation of the historic day for his
country.
</P>
<P>
He also congratulated and welcome the Benadir administration
and its Supreme Council, saying he will support it.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Sabir told some reporters that he is not leaving
Somalia. He also said that Libya, Egypt and Sudan were the only
three diplomatic missions that never abandoned Somalia even
during the very difficult period of the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Britain Appalled by Reported Massacres in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- British government Wednesday
expressed its grave concern over the two recent massacres of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and called for an independent
investigation.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
early Wednesday: "I am appalled by these reports of massacres of
civilians, including women and children, at Gornje Obrinje and
near Vucitern."
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for any violence against the
civilian population in Kosovo. The U.N. Security Council last week
adopted a resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire and
an end to repression. This must be implemented immediately," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding that the (Yugoslav) authorities to allow
independent forensic investigation of both massacres. I am sure
that International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) will
want to extend their investigations to include these massacres,"
he added.

<P>
Cook said that he had called a meeting of senior officials of
the Contact Group, including Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
United States and Russia, Friday in London to discuss the
worsening situation in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> UK' Borrowing Rising Fast to Diminish Rate Cut Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's consumers are
borrowing more than ever, raising fears that the Bank of England
will postpone any cut in interest rates to curb demand.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit was 17 percent higher on the year, and up 1.5
percent in the month of August alone, according to newly released
official figures.
</P>
<P>
Consumers borrowed a record 11.1 billion pounds (over 18
billion U.S. dollars) last month, an increase of 1.4 billion
pounds on the previous month. That was well above expectations of
an increase of 1 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing sectors were credit cards and bank loans,
which were boosted by borrowing to buy new cars during the August
registration period.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage lending grew at a slightly slower rate, with 5,000
fewer new mortgages approved than in the previous month. But at
7.75 billion pounds, it is still the largest component of
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The higher-than-expected borrowing has dampened hopes that the
Bank of England will soon cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With rate cut of the US central bank today, hopes were rising
that the UK would soon follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England has been concerned that wages and spending
have been growing too fast, thus spurring inflation. But signals
have been contradictory, with consumer confidence slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Dharshini David, of HSBC markets, said that the figures were
consistent with retail sales, which are growing at 2.9 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate that the recent turmoil in equity
markets and the talk of a hard landing for the economy have failed
to have dampened consumers' appetite for credit," she said.
</P>
<P>
But with all attention focusing on interest rate cuts in the
US, the figures had little immediate impact on UK financial
markets.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Cooperation Useless as Sanctions Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Wednesday
that it no longer cooperates with the Special Commission (UNSCOM)
as the sanctions remains intact, which has caused great burdens
and losses to Iraqi people over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd General Assembly session, Mohammed Said
Al-Sahaf, Iraqi foreign minister, said, "the blockade has not so
far been lifted, thus rendering the continuation of cooperation
both meaningless and useless."
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the past seven and a half years, Iraq has
cooperated with the Security Council, the Special Commission and
the International Atomic Energy Agency and met all the conditions
and obligations imposed on it as an expression of its good faith
and in order to ensure the lifting of the blockade imposed on its
people," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"All prohibited weapons have been destroyed, together with
hundreds of plants, installations and equipment related to those
weapons, with all the operations having been carried out with so
much vengefulness that they included even cooling and lighting
equipment, as well furnishings and other items that had nothing to
do with the prohibited weapons or with their production," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For political reasons, the Special Commission and its chairman
refrain from reporting to the Security Council that Iraq is
totally free of all prohibited weapons under Security Council
resolution 687 (1991) in all the three areas (comprising missiles,
and chemical and biological weapons) although the Special
Commission has no concrete evidence to prove the reverse of this
fact," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq was therefore obliged to suspend cooperation with the
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
because keeping to a course with nothing but dead ends and vicious
circles in sight can have no other outcome than the continuation
of the blockade on the people of Iraq, which is unacceptable and
even contrary to Security Council resolution 687 (1991)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The comprehensive, inhuman blockade imposed on Iraq has
entered its ninth year," he said, "This blockade has caused and
continues to cause the death of thousands of Iraqi citizens every
month for lack of medicine and food and the grave deterioration in
the infrastructures of the industrial, agricultural, health,
education and services sectors and other areas of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister delivered his speech simply two days
after a Monday meeting between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and visiting Iraqi deputy prime minister Tareq Aziz, who came to
the U.N. headquarters at the invitation of Annan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed a "comprehensive
review" of Iraq's relation with the United Nations proposed by the
U.N. chief and accepted by 15 Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Aziz is in the process of meetings with
representatives from Security Council members, he is expected to
meet with Annan once again at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Special Commission, headed by Chairman Richard
Butler, began a three-day meeting with its board of directors from
20 countries before Butler finishes his major half-year report
next week.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to meet with Butler on Wednesday evening, a
U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended cooperation with the UNSCOM on August 5,
prompting the Security Council in its September 9 resolution to
stop its periodic reviews of the sanctions until Baghdad reversed
its decision.
</P>
<P>
Compliance with U.N. arms inspectors is a key requirement
before the sanctions, imposed in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990, can be eased or lifted.

<HEADLINE> SADC Military Chiefs' Meeting Ends With No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The special meeting of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) military chiefs
ended here Wednesday, with little achievements except for some
"suggestions".
</P>
<P>
Chitalo Sampa, Zambian Defense Minister and Chairman of SADC
Security and Defense Committee, declined to reveal the details of
the suggestions.
</P>
<P>
He only said the military officials of the SADC states held
"deep discussions" over the tension in Angola, the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Salomom Muamba, representative of Zambian defense minister,
said, "We will do our best to restore peace and stability in
these countries."
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the meeting decided to hold a SADC security
and defense organ meeting in Swaziland in the coming November.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting of SADC military chiefs started here
Tuesday, with the participation of defense ministers or chiefs of
general staff from Angola, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho,
Mauritius, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, the DRC, Seychelles,
Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Angolan Defense minister Pedro
Sebastiao said the political and military situation in southern
Africa is "extremely worrying" due to the appearance of multi-war
spots in the region.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for enhanced cooperation among armies of SADC
members to safeguard national territorial integrity and law and
order so as to provide a stable environment for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The armed rebellion against the DRC President Laurent Kabila
which started on August 2 has drawn in many countries in the
region with Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola on one side, and Rwanda,
Uganda on the other.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Angolan peace process ran into a stalemate due
to the failure of the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) in disarming and handing over the
areas it occupied to the government.
</P>
<P>
In September, the mountain kingdom of Lesotho was caught in
chaos as a result of opposition's dissatisfaction with the
general election results in May. South Africa and Botswana sent
in troops to stablize the situation at the request of the
Lesotho government.

<HEADLINE> More Injuries Reported in Hebron Car Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were
injured in a car explosion in downtown Hebron, West Bank
Wednesday, a Palestinian press service said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center said the explosion
occurred after a Jewish settler threw a bomb into a Palestinian
car.
</P>
<P>
The driver jumped out of the car for safety, but the ensuing
explosion set a van carrying passengers nearby on fire, with nine
Israeli soldiers and 11 Palestinians injured.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place near the entrance of a Jewish
settlement on Shuhada Street in the center of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
One of the nine injured Israeli soldiers was in serious
condition, and four of them have been taken to Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Four of the 11 Palestinians were hurt seriously and all of them
were rushed to Alia and other local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Israeli troops rushed to the scene
and opened fire at Palestinians and into the air, apparently
for fear of the situation running out of control.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops then sealed off the area and no body was
allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, a reporter was reportedly arrested by the
Israeli troops, the communication center said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 450 Jewish settlers live, with Israeli troop
protection, among 130,000 Palestinians in the
Palestinian-controlled Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Test Electronic Toll Collection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UTRECHT, Netherlands, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's most
comprehensive electronic toll collection system upon completion
has started test runs, the chief engineer of the project said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dik van Wijk told the press that the try-out, that got underway
on Monday, would last till October 10 at one spot along the
country's A12 highway.
</P>
<P>
The electronic toll collection system has been designed to help
change the driving habit of motorists on the country's highways
that have been prone to congestion, the engineer said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will install 40 toll gates and
the follow-up phase will add 70 more within three to four years
around the country's large cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the
Hague and Utrecht, van Wijk said.
</P>
<P>
Cars driving toward these cities will be charged five Dutch
guilders (two U.S. dollars) for each trip via the On Board Units
(OBUs) that work in the way of a credit card cashier.
</P>
<P>
Transactions are made through radio signals between the OBUs
and the receivers on the toll gates.
</P>
<P>
The OBUs are not obligatory, according to the chief engineer,
and cars that do not have OBUs are charged by invoices that are
sent to the road users. The invoices are prescribed by an
auxiliary video recording system at the toll gates that tracks the
plate information of cars.
</P>
<P>
But city-bound cars that do not have OBUs have to pay 7
guilders for each trip.
</P>
<P>
The differential of payment is designed to encourage motorists
to use OBUs.
</P>
<P>
Charging big city-bound cars may help persuade motorists, who
do not necessarily have to enter a city and therefore add burden
on city roads, to avoid entering the city and choose pass-by roads
instead.
</P>
<P>
The OBUs are scheduled to be distributed to motorists next
January in the Netherlands and a final test will be conducted in
the following two months before the system enters into full
operation.
</P>
<P>
Since the system is a multi-city one, the chief engineer said,
it will become the most substantive electronic toll collection
network in the world upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have already started using electronic toll
collection systems but mostly around single cities, like
Singapore, Melbourne in Australia, Toronto in Canada and Bonn in
Germany.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Debt Relief for Poorest Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- It was time to act
decisively to achieve a durable solution to the debt crisis of the
world's poorest countries, and the results of continued inaction
would be catastrophic for millions of children and women, the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF, made the remark on
the eve of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
fall meetings, which start Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The perpetuation of a crippling debt burden in the poor
nations is not only international negligence. It is a morally
indefensible act," said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said recent years had brought a painful reminder that
key development goals, established by the World Summit for
Children, would not be met in the absence of effective debt relief
and additional resource allocations.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that these global goals and targets are certain to be
compromised, by a frightening increase in poverty levels and
deepening income inequities, underscores the need for urgent and
visionary action now," she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF's leader proposed that the tragedy of the debt
crisis be decisively ended through dramatic debt reduction or
outright debt cancellation, particularly in Africa.

<HEADLINE> IMF Lowers World Economic Growth Outlook for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The financial chaos that
started in East Asia and spread to Russia one month earlier will
slow world economic growth more than previously projected, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its advanced report for the World Economic Outlook released
here today, the IMF lowered its forecast of the world growth to 2
percent for this year and 2.5 percent for 1999, cutting more than
1 percentage point for both years, as compared to a forecast made
just five months ago.
</P>
<P>
"International economic and financial conditions have
deteriorated considerably in recent months as recessions have
deepened in many Asian Emerging market economic and Japan, and as
Russia's financial crisis has raied the specter of default," the
IMF noted in the report.
</P>
<P>
"Chances of any significant improvement in 1999 have also
diminished and the risks of a deeper, wider and more prolonged
downturn have escalated," the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also predicted that the world's output of goods and
services would grow by just 2 percent this year, down 1.1
percentage points from its May assessment. It forecast growth of
just 2.5 percent in 1999, down 1.2 percentage points from the May
prediction.
</P>
<P>
That would compare to actual growth of 4.1 percent in 1997 and
would represent the slowest expansion since output grew 2.5
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Even these reduced growth forecasts may not be reached, the IMF
said, warning that "the risks appear predominantly on the
downside," especially since the collapse of the Russian economy in
August, which has also put pressure on emerging markets in Latin
America such as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Negative spillovers have been felt in world stock markets,
emerging market interest spreads, acute pressures on several
currencies and further drops in already weak commodity prices,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the IMF forecast growth this year of 3.5
percent, down only slightly from last year's 3.9 percent pace. The
forecast is a 0.6 percentage point upward revision from May,
although the IMF expects a marked slowdown for 1999 with the U.S.
economy expanding by just 2 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower
than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
For Japan, the world's second-largest economy, the IMF
predicted output would contract by 2.5 percent this year, as that
country struggles with its worst recession in 50 years. The IMF
projected only a modest recovery in 1999, with Japanese output
expanding by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For Russia, the IMF predicted the output of goods and services
would shrink by 6 percent this year and in 1999 as that country
struggles with a botched devaluation of the ruble and the default
on a portion of its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's revised economic forecasts were released prior to its
annual meetings in Washington this week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Decline in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide sales
of new homes fell 4.4 percent in August, largely attributed to the
worst drop in the South in three years, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
838,000, the lowest monthly level so far this year, according to
the department.
</P>
<P>
The figure was down from a rate of 877,000 in July and 922,000
in June, the highest on record since the department began tracking
sales in 1963.
</P>
<P>
New home sales plunged 13.6 percent in the South, the sharpest
drop since August 1995, to a rate of 363,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, sales rose 5.8 percent to a rate of 73,000 in
the Northeast, 4.9 percent to a rate of 151,000 in the Midwest and
3.3 percent to a rate of 252,000 in the West. The Northeast and
Midwest had recorded steep drops the month before, while sales had
risen modestly in the West.
</P>
<P>
Despite some of the regional drops, sales overall still are
strong, driven by the lowest mortgage rates in three decades and
plentiful jobs and rising incomes.
</P>
<P>
The August drop in new-home sales left 289,000 new homes for
sale at the end of the month, the most in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home in August was 151,000 U.S.
dollars, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Confirms 1998 Budget Surplus at $70 Bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government this
year will gain a budget surplus of some 70 billion U.S. dollars,
the first surplus in a generation, President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On this final day of the 1998 fiscal year, Clinton said this
year's surplus, first since 1969, signaled an important shift that
opens the door to sustained growth of the American economy into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight at midnight, America puts an end to three decades of
deficits and launches an era of balances and surpluses," he stated
at a White House ceremony attended by many congressional
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
A key priority, he said, is to resist the temptation to spend
the surplus on tax cuts until reforms are made to save the Social
Security system.
</P>
<P>
The surplus announced today is based on an estimate; data on
1998 revenue collections and spending won't be final until
mid-October. Whatever the final figure, it will be the
government's first black ink since a 3 billion dollar surplus in
1969. However, the budget deficit peaked at 290 billion dollars in
1992.

<HEADLINE> EU Displays Electric Car with Extra Long Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union put on
display Wednesday a prototype of a next-generation electric car
that combines long range of mileage with zero pollution.
</P>
<P>
The car, designed and manufactured by Renault and its five
partners, was at display at the 15th International Electric
Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition that lasts till October 3.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration vehicle was developed under the EU's fuel
cell electric vehicle of extended range (FEVER) program and
financed by the union under its fourth Framework Program for
Research and Technological Development.
</P>
<P>
It has a range of 400-500 kilometers, longer than most electric
vehicles, and a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Since the car is driven by an electric motor powered by a
2.2-kilogram polymeric electrolyte fuel cell that consumes only
hydrogen and air, its only emissions are made up of pure water.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been supporting the research in the
field of electric and hybrid vehicles. Between 1994 and 1998, the
union devoted some 75 million ECU (82.5 million U.S. dollars) to
research in this area.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the European Commission has negotiated
a voluntary agreement with the Association of the European Car
Manufacturers on committing car makers to reducing the average
private passenger vehicle emission of carbon dioxide by 25 percent
between now and the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, has so far adopted three regulations concerning motor
vehicle emissions and the regulations are expected to advance the
research of electric cars and hybrid vehicles that use both
electric power and conventional fuel.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Seven Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Wednesday named seven more government ministers, leaving only
two posts vacant in Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's team.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers include Sergei Kalashnikov, a member of the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Kalashnikov, to serve as minister of labor and social development,
is the first LDPR member in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky was pleased with the appointment and promised to
render "the utmost backing" to Kalashnikov and to "Yevgeny
Primakov's entire cabinet," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
The remark represented an about-face for the ultranationalist
LDPR leader, who staunchly opposed to Primakov's confirmation two
weeks ago in the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Tass, the Primakov cabinet is made up by two first
deputy prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and 22
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The post of the fourth is now vacant after President Boris
Yeltsin signed on Wednesday a decree which relieves Alexander
Shokhin of his duty upon his request.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also named new ministers for health, culture, regional
policy and education, and reappointed the ministers for atomic
energy and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The posts for ministers of anti-monopoly policy and natural
resources remained vacant.

<P>
Primakov described the one-day working visit as "quite
fruitful," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

He told Belarussian leaders that the most important priority
now is to "exert maximum effort to implement the decisions made
earlier", and that the new Russian government would try its best
to strengthen the Russia-Belarus Union.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing that participation in the Union is advantageous for the
two states, all other states of the Commonwealth of Independent
States will become increasingly inclined to join the Union,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Executive Committee of the union is
scheduled for October 16.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Seven Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Wednesday named seven more government ministers,
leaving only two posts vacant in Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
team.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin signed decrees reappointing two from the previous
government and appointing five new ministers.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers include Sergei Kalashnikov, a member of the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Kalashnikov, to serve as minister of labor and social development,
is the first LDPR member in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky was pleased with the appointment and promised to
render "the utmost backing" to Kalashnikov and to "Yevgeny
Primakov's entire cabinet," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The remark represented an about-face for the ultranationalist
LDPR leader, who staunchly opposed to Primakov's confirmation two
weeks ago in the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Tass, the Primakov cabinet now has two first
deputy prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and 22
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The post of the fourth is now vacant after President Boris
Yeltsin signed on Wednesday a decree which relieves Alexander
Shokhin of his duties at his request.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also named new ministers for health, culture, regional
policy and education, and reappointed the ministers for atomic
energy and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The posts for ministers of anti-monopoly policy and natural
resources remained vacant.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Calls for Conference on Development Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) - Jamaica on Wednesday
called for a conference on development financing to reverse the
decline of concessionary financial flows from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
"Jamaica strongly endorses the right to development as an
integrated part of fundamental human rights," Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Seymour Mullings told the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the annual debate of the U.N. body, he said
that official development assistance (ODA) from developed nations
represents today only an average of 0.22 percent of the GNP (Gross
National Product) of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
This was a far cry from the target of 0.7 percent set in 1972,
he said, noting that the share of ODA in the total net resource
flows to developing countries fell to 22 percent in 1996 from 64
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mullings said the heavy debt burden, including debt service
payments, had resulted in net reverse flows from the developing
countries of the South to the industrialized countries of the
North.
</P>
<P>
"We must explore measures to relieve the external debt of the
developing countries, including the cancellation of debt," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"These trends must be reversed if developing countries are to
have a fair opportunity to achieve meaningful development," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Jamaica considers that the time has come for us to address
these issues in serious dialogue. There is an urgent need to
identify ways in which development financing from industrialized
to developing and transition economies... may be increased," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister of the Caribbean island country hoped that a
conference on financing for development will be convened at an
early date.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tutsi-led rebels fighting to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila claimed Wednesday that
they had captured Punia, a small town in the east of Congo (K), a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Punia, a town with the population of about 10,000 situated
some 300 kilometers southeast of the third city Kisangani, was
taken last week by the rebels who took up arms to fight since
August 2, rebel press officer Faustin Munyapenda said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels at present control a number of towns along Congo's
eastern border with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi apart from
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
They launched an attack in the west in a bid to occupy capital
Kinshasa last month, but was defeated by allied forces from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading to back the
rebels but the two countries deny direct involvement.
</P>
<P>
A number of meetings were held to settle the Congo crisis but
failed because Kabila does not recognize the rebels who demand
direct negotiations with Kabila to solve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Ranking Democrat Supports Watergate-type Rules but </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The senior Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday
welcomed a Republican proposal to use Watergate-style rules to
govern an impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton but said
he wanted limits on the subjects that will be considered.
</P>
<P>
"We've been advocating a Watergate model and I support it,"
Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, said. "But the
Watergate model had a set of facts and circumstances that could
never validate an open end to a matter of an affair, of a personal
relationship with one person."
</P>
<P>
Conyers made the comments as the two sides on the Judiciary
Committee still could not agree on the outlines of an impeachment
inquiry, which Republican leaders hope to bring to the House floor
for a vote in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are pushing to give the Judiciary Committee
authority to expand its investigation beyond the Monica Lewinsky
affair to other questions of conduct surrounding Clinton.
</P>
<P>
While the two sides disagreed on whether the inquiry should be
open-ended, Democrats appeared willing to accept many of the other
technical rules used during the Watergate impeachment inquiry,
such as how witnesses could be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted one anonymous Democratic committee
source as saying, the Democrats would accept a Watergate model in
which either Conyers, as the ranking Democrat, or Chairman Henry
Hyde, a Republican, could summon witnesses on their own if both
agree. If one objected, the issue of a subpoena would be put up to
a vote before the full committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House said Wednesday that Republicans were
making an "utterly ridiculous" attempt to model the impeachment
proceedings after the House investigation of Richard Nixon a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
"The notion that there is any parallel is laughable,"
presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry, in a briefing with reporters, accused Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, a member of the House Judiciary Committee in
1974, of changing his tune dramatically about what constitutes an
impeachable offense. Lott said Tuesday that even "bad conduct"
could warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Lott of a double standard, McCurry said, "In 1974,
Trent Lott signed a minority report for the committee that was
quite clear. It was the kinds of crimes that subvert the
Constitution and damage the country. And the question before the
House is: Does the president's conduct in this instance rise to
that level. And we argue strenuously that it does not."
</P>
<P>
Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, responded that "Lott has not
only withheld final judgment on this matter but has been very
careful to review all the documents and materials to maintain his
consistency."
</P>
<P>
The 1974 minority report said the framers of the Constitution
"intended that the president should be removable by the
legislative branch only for serious misconduct dangerous to the
system of government...."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the Judiciary Committee's proceedings, run by
Chairman Henry Hyde lack the focus and discipline of the 1974
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Syria Urges Arab Solidarity to Secure Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam called on Arab countries to join hands in
political, economic, cultural and security fields to secure their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam made the call Wednesday at a meeting with the
leadership of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, the
Arab-Syrian News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said the complete liberation of the occupied Arab
territories and the restoration of the Palestinians' legitimate
national rights topped the Arab rights promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for Arab solidarity in confronting
challenges triggered by the international changes and schemes
against the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called for the establishment of an Arab
common market and the expansion of the Arab free trade zone, since
economic ties are the much promoted part in bilateral and
multi-national relations.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world can join in the economic globalization drive
through modernizing its institutions, improving the living
standards of its people and throwing up personnel qualified to
face world challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria is one of the Arab countries that have territorial
disputes with Israel, with its Golan Heights still in the hands of
the Israelis since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two sides were disrupted in early
1996 and have not been taken up since because of Israel's refusal
to eventually return the Golan.

<HEADLINE> West Africa Gas Project to start next year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The proposed West African
Gas Pipeline Project, which will supply natural gas to Ghana,
Benin and Togo for power generation and commercial and industrial
use, will start next year, the Ghana News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the commencement of the project, Pipelinu
Engineering of Germany (PLE), a consultancy firm, has been
contracted at a cost of 2.5 million U.S. Dollars to carry out
feasibility studies on the smooth implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the study, which concentrated on the
marketability and viability of natural gas in Togo, Benin and
Ghana, has been completed, according to the GNA.
</P>
<P>
The next study which will pave way for actual execution of the
project, will end in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Already, six companies, Nigeria Gas Company, Shell Petroleum
Development Company, Chevron, Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation and two others from Benin and Togo, have shown
interest in the project and contributed to sponsor the studies.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Mines and Energy Minister Fred Ohene-Kena and Dr John
Sesay, Director of Transport, Communications and Energy of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), expressed
optimism about the fruition of the project which they said would
be completed in a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
They met in Accra Wednesday together with the project's
implementation Committee of 20 experts from Nigeria, Ghana, Benin
and Togo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting chaired by Nigerian Abdullah Jibril Oyekan,
discussed the project component, the involvement of private
sector and adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for the
successful execution of the project.
</P>
<P>
The meeting acknowledged that natural gas has potential in the
West African sub-Region and resolved to avoid further delays in
the implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
Oyekan said the committee would work in close collaboration
with the commercial groups and governments to create the enabling
atmosphere for the completion of the project.
</P>
<P>
He urged Energy Ministers of the beneficiary countries to
impress upon donor agencies, including the World Bank, to support
the project.
</P>
<P>
"The project is of utmost importance to Ghana and the ECOWAS
sub-region as a demonstration to what a sub-regional grouping can
achieve," Ohene-Kena said.
</P>
<P>
The West African Gas Pipeline Project was mooted in 1995 by
Ghana, Nigeria, Benin and Togo to construct a 600-kilometer
pipeline to supply natural gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Togo and
Benin for commercial and industrial purposes.

NEW YORK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- An influential U.S. private

steady in August and the outlook remains healthy.
</P>

The New York-based Conference Board, which reports the economic

The leading indicators are poised to expand through at least
early next year, he said.

The third quarter of the year is predicted to register an
annual growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, according to the Board.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Wednesday

<HEADLINE> Britain to Call Urgent UN Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said Wednesday Britain would convene an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss two alleged
massacres of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after telephone conversations with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and European Union (EU) foreign
ministers, Cook said Britain, as current president of the United
Nations Security Council, would convene an urgent meeting Thursday
to discuss the worsening situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the Security Council would ask U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to report by early next week on whether the Yugoslav
government had complied with a Security Council resolution passed
last week.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic call a ceasefire in Kosovo, pull out his troops and
start serious dialogue on real autonomy for the restless province,
where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ghana Airways Seeking Private Capital: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Ghana are
seeking private recapitalization for the national airline, Ghana
Airways (Ghanair), a report from Accra reaching here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has been the Ghanaian government's goal to make its
national airline more efficient and profitable, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) quoted Ghanaian Deputy Minister of Transport and
Communications Steve Akorli as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It has been the government's goal to turn round the national
carrier "by involving a strategic partner who will re-capitalize
the airline, provide management expertise, as well as link the
airline to the world-wide network," Akorli told a dinner
organized to mark the airline's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The dinner was sponsored by Airbus Industries of France whose
Vice-President Jean-Paul Grimal was in attendance.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Council of State Member Mary Grant, politicians,
diplomats and other businessmen were also there.
</P>
<P>
Grimal's presence in Accra sparked off speculations on a
possible deal between his company and Ghana Airways for the
supply of planes by Airbus to Ghanair. He said that his outfit
is hoping to work in partnership with Ghanair in her desire to
acquire a fleet for operations.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Quartey, the new Chief Executive of Ghanair outlined
plans to enhance the operations of the national carrier, saying
that the airline needs new planes to augment its fleet.
</P>
<P>
"We will require additional equipment which will also assist
in providing us with the much needed fleet flexibility which has
eluded the airline for so long and has been the root cause of
several flight delays and cancellations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quartey, who took office early September, said the airline has
entered a "new era aimed at epitomizing corporate excellence by
maximizing stake-holders value for it to become a dominant link
between Africa and the rest of world."
</P>
<P>
Currently, Ghana Airways operates with two DC9 and two DC10
aircraft for its west coast and intercontinental routes. One of
the two DC10 planes is on lease to the airline.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Hole to Reach Record Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have warned that
this year's ozone hole over the South Pole is shaping up to be the
biggest on record, The Independent newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic ozone hole's current size is approximately 26
million square kilometers, about three times the area of Australia
and already the largest ozone hole ever.
</P>
<P>
However, preliminary satellite data collated in the Antarctic
suggest that the hole in the layer of the upper atmosphere will
expand to its maximum size in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic ozone hole will stretch over 27 million square
kilometers, an area twice as large as Europe, Jonathan Shanklin, a
meteorologist at the British Antarctic Survey, told The
Independent.
</P>
<P>
Ozone, an irritating pale blue gas, is a form of molecular
oxygen which forms in the atmosphere a layer between 10 to 50
kilometers high, absorbing harmful ultra-violet light from the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
The ozone loss is believed to be caused by man-made chemicals
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which have risen in the
atmosphere and started chemical reactions that destroy ozone.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, the warm Pacific current that alters global weather,
and global warming are also blamed for ozone depletion.
</P>
<P>
Shanklin said that as a consequence of El Nino, the
stratosphere has been much colder than usual, which has led to
more stratospheric clouds, and those in turn are a big factor in
ozone depletion because the reaction that destroys ozone occurs on
cloud surfaces.
</P>
<P>
Global warming could also contribute to ozone loss because it
causes the upper atmosphere to cool, which Shanklin said "causes a
vicious feedback cycle which increases depletion."

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Fears of More Refugees from Afghan war </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan said on
Wednesday it fears that the military action by Afghanistan's
Taliban religious militia could cause an influx of refugees and
spread terrorism, arms and drugs across Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We, together with our nearest neighbors and Russia, are very
seriously concerned about the threat, emanating from Afghanistan,
of destabilization of the situation in the entire Central Asia,"
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov told the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual U.N. debate, he said his country's
particular concern is the "possibility of mass and spontaneous
influx of Afghan refugees across the border to Tajikistan" and
the spread of terrorism, arms and drugs.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan fully supports a central role of the United Nations
in coordinating all international efforts for Afghan settlement
against external interference in the affairs of Afghanistan,
including by sending military personnel or arms there, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As history of Afghanistan has shown, use of force by any
internal or external 'actors' not only is incapable of solving the
problems of Afghan society but fraught with new and dangerous
escalation of civil strife in this country," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian minister
Wednesday praised the everlasting Tanzanian-Chinese friendship
and wished that the joint ventures between the two countries
could become a success.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania will do in its power to make sure that the
privatization of Chinese-built industries, mines and farms with
Chinese participation, becomes a success story," said Minister of
Regional Administration and Local Governments Kingunge
Ngombale-Mwiru who attended a reception at the Chinese Embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
The reception was held on Wednesday evening to mark the 49th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Dar es Salaam Zhang Hongxi said that the
past years have witnessed a continuous growth of Sino-Tanzanian
friendly relations and extensive and effective cooperation and
exchanges in all fields between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The successful state visit by Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa to China in April this year pushed the traditional
Sino-Tanzanian friendship and cooperation to a new high, the
ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhang said that China has made great achievements
especially in the past two decades and withstood tests of
Southeast Asia financial crisis and severe floods this year.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the present difficulties, he reassured nearly 200
guests that China has full confidence in realizing the targeted
eight percent economic growth for this year.
</P>
<P>
While saying Tanzania and China enjoy "all weather
friendship," Mwiru revealed that discussions are underway between
the two countries to enter into ventures in several projects,
such as the Mbarali and Ruvu Rice Farms, the Kiwira Coal Mines
Co. Ltd., sisal and wheat farming, and textile manufacturing at
MWATEX.
</P>
<P>
"Similar discussions will be done for Mang'ula and TAZARA," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China and Tanzania have already formed a joint venture,
Urafiki, known as the the Tanzania-China Friendship Textile Mill,
with a revenue of more than two million U.S. Dollars and a
turnover of more than six billion Shillings (about nine million
U.S. Dollars).

BUDAPEST, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian economy
experienced further improvement in the first half of 1998, with a
4.8 percent growth rate in its gross domestic product (GDP).

The Hungarian Central Statistics Bureau Thursday attributed the

The sector of architecture topped all others with a 16 percent
growth, which was followed by a 13.4 percent industrial growth
rate.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to
consider how to respond to reported violence in Kosovo, Serbia's
province of mainly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to condemn reported massacre
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian security forces in even
stronger terms than before, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Jeremey Greenstock, who on Thursday becomes president of the
15-member Security Council for the month of October, told
reporters on Wednesday that he had requested a meeting "to discuss
developments and to share our serious concern... at what has been
happening on the ground" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming council meeting coincides with the Serbian
withdrawal of security units from field and NATO's completion of a
plan for possible air strike.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday afternoon, top U.S. foreign policy officials,
including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and the national security adviser, Samuel Berger,
will visit Capitol Hill to brief senators on events in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government has announced the withdrawal of Serbian
security forces to their barracks at the end of anti-terrorist
drive in Kosovo, the southernmost province in Serbia of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), where ethnic Albanians, who
make up some 90 percent of the province's population of 2 million,
have been battling the Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations on Wednesday, diplomats and officials
reacted with shock to the reported killings of civilians, women,
children and elderly men in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, through his spokesman's
office, issued a statement on Wednesday evening, expressing his
"outrage" at reports of atrocities perpetrated by security forces
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Those actions can never justify the pattern of terror,
including the burning of houses, looting, killing of livestock and
wanton killing that have been reported these past few days," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO completed planning for possible air strikes. At
NATO, Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson told reporters
that the group was proposing sharply targeted military strikes on
Serbian forces, not random bombing, which would endanger
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO officials said military action could begin as soon as
next week, after Annan is expected to report to the Security
Council on Yugoslav compliance with its demands.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last week demanded an immediate ceasefire
and the beginning of political dialogue in Kosovo, where conflicts
broke out in February this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) held informal
talks with the ecologist Greens on Thursday to form a new
government after a landmark election triumph over Chancellor
Helmut Kohl last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
SPD officials said that the two sides would work out an agenda
for the formal coalition negotiations beginning on Friday, which
would create the first center-left government for the country in
16 years.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens broadly agree on economic and social issues,
including job creation, tax reforms and immigration policy.
However, the SPD could have great difficulties to tackle some
radical demands from the Greens like the shutdown of nuclear power
plants and its opposition to NATO eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said that he would take time to negotiate the
details for a stable government under the guidelines of "economic
stability, social order and continuity in foreign policy".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the two sides also have to strike a compromise on a
mutually-acceptable distribution of the cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
The Greens have said they want four ministerial posts,
including foreign minister and environment minister. But SPD
officials have indicated that the Greens might only get two.
</P>
<P>
The coalition talks may last until late October, when Schroeder
is due to be formally elected by the new parliament. During the
transitional period Kohl's government stays on as caretaker.

HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Celebrations in Hong Kong of
the 49th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China reached a climax Thursday night as fireworks lit up the sky
over the Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Huge crowds packed both banks of the harbor hours before the
launch of the fireworks at 9 p.m. and kept cheering with delight
as the sky over the harbor was luminous against the background of
neon lights gracing the skyscrapers around the harbor.
</P>
<P>
During the 23-minute show, about 22,000 fireworks made in
China's mainland were set off while China's national anthem was
played.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks all had names expressing the love from Hong Kong
for the motherland and hailing China's achievements as well as
wishing for a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the mainland institutions stationed in Hong Kong joined
more than 10,000 people at an evening gala at the Hong Kong
Coliseum to celebrate the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the Hong Kong Police band, a 300-strong chorus
sang the national anthem together with the audience to raise the
curtain for the two-hour evening party.
</P>
<P>
Acrobatics, martial arts and Peking opera -- the quintessence
of Chinese arts, stole the show in the evening and won lasting
applause from the audience.

Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers also performed songs

</P>
<P>
The day of celebration began with a flag-raising ceremony in
the early morning near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, where the handover ceremony was held last year.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan kicked
off the National Day Recreation and Sports Carnival organized by
the Provisional Urban Council (PUC) at downtown Hong Kong's
Victoria Park.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Chan toured the various playing zones,
played short-mat bowling and watched spectacular performances
conducted by 1,000 Tai Chi enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
Specially-designed to provide families and people of all ages
with a wide range of recreation and sports programs, the carnival
was organized in line with the PUC's goal to promote the
sport-for-all concept in celebrating the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Play-in sessions such as bowling, table tennis, volleyball,
basketball, cycling and rope skipping were especially popular
among the participants.
</P>
<P>
The elderly favored activities such as short-mat bowling and
gate ball which require less physical exertion. On the other hand,
the more exciting and creative games like mini-train, bouncing
land, clown balloon act and face painting attracted long queues of
children.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denounces Possible Armed Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday denounced the
possible use of NATO force over Kosovo without U.N. authorization,
saying that it "may seriously aggravate the situation."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said that NATO's
intention to use force in Kosovo without permission from the
U.N. Security Council "may seriously aggravate the situation in
the region and deal a serious blow to the United Nations, the
U.N. Security Council, and the entire system of international
relations."
</P>
<P>
Such an action "would create an extremely dangerous
precedent," the Interfax news agency quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Resolution No. 1199 of the U.N. Security Council does not
sanction the use of force and there can be no ambiguous
interpretations in this connection," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary through joint efforts to influence the sides
in the conflict so that they immediately stop hostile actions,
take urgent measures to stop the humanitarian crisis and enter
dialogue without preconditions to attain a speedy political
settlement of the situation," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Resolution 1199 "is a serious warning," but it was
addressed to both Belgrade and Pristina or whoever encourages
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday 15 local residents, including six children and a
pregnant woman, were killed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said the murder of innocent people "deserves the
most resolute denunciation."

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Expects "Tight Finish" for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday night acknowledged that it would be a "tight
finish" at Saturday's poll.
</P>
<P>
He said this when the polling day is just one day away and he
made it clear that he would have no regrets if he lost office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on 2UE radio, Howard said he always knows that it
would be tough arguing for tax reform in an election campaign but
he has no alternative.
</P>
<P>
"I did it because I knew it was good for Australia," he said.
"And if I lose, then I won't have any regrets."
</P>
<P>
"I'll be upset, I'll be disappointed, but I won't have any
regrets because when you're prime minister you have a
responsibility to call it for Australia and do the right thing,"
he said. "This country needs tax reform, everybody knows that and
I don't think I had any alternative consistent with the obligation
of the office."
</P>
<P>
Howard said he hoped the Australian public would support him,
but could not be certain it would.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very tight finish," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What the Australian public has got to decide is whether after
only two and a half years, they're going to go back to a Labor
Party they had for 13 years which left us with a 10.5 billion
Australian dollars (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) deficit."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition leader Kim Beazley in Brisbane raised the
prospect of forming a minority government with support from
independents if Saturday's election does not produce a clear
winner.
</P>
<P>
Beazley gave a downbeat assessment of his chances of victory on
Saturday and said the numbers and history are against the Labor's
hopes of winning the 27 extra seats it needs for victory.
</P>
<P>
"All the mathematics of history in Australian politics has been
against me in this campaign," Beazley told the Nine Network's
Today show.
</P>
<P>
Labor insiders said the Labor appears set to win 15 to 20 seats
at most on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Beazley maintained he would not do deals with Pauline
Hanson's One Nation Party and would not govern in any
circumstances if One Nation holds the balance of power.

ULAN BATOR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nambaryn Enhbayar, chairman
of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), called on
Thursday for a referendum to decide whether to dissolve the Great
Hural (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the autumn session of the Great Hural, which opened
here Thursday, Enhbayar, also the MPRP's parliamentary group
leader, said the Great Hural has failed to do its business for
long and so it has lost the trust of the people.
</P>
<P>
This inaction has lent to the deteriorating political, economic
and social crisis in the country, Enhbayar said.
</P>
<P>
The country has been without a government for more than 60 days
now, he said.
</P>
<P>
The only way to solve the crisis, Enhbayar said, is to hold a
national referendum to decide whether to dissolve the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MPRP's legislators group submitted a proposal to Great
Hural Chairman Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj on September 25, calling
for a referendum on dissolving the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Another tough issue to be discussed in the session is the
formation of the new government.

Donald Tsang at a gathering of investment and fund managers,
business leaders, industrialists and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the Hong Kong SAR government's commitment to free
and open markets and explained the recent counter-activities taken
by the Hong Kong authorities in the region's stock, futures and
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAR government's decision to buy into the Hong Kong
Stock Market in August was "to protect and reinforce the integrity
of the Hong Kong dollar's linked exchange rate with the
U.S. dollar and to restore stability and a level playing field to
Hong Kong's currency and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot stress too strongly our absolute determination to
maintain the linked exchange rate and the link is here to stay."
</P>
<P>
He said that for a highly externally-oriented economy with a
trade to GDP ratio of more than 250 percent, currency stability is
of the greatest importance.
</P>
<P>
The finance secretary said the SAR government's
counter-activities would not signal the beginning of an
intervention era for Hong Kong or a departure from Hong Kong's
commitment to free trade and open markets.
</P>
<P>
"We are still probably the world's most free and open market,"
said Tsang, who spelled out the definition of a free market in
Hong Kong as one with a stable and freely convertible currency, no
quota application or duties, a low and predictable tax system as
well as the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is taking a three-week trip in Europe and the United
States with an aim to rebuild those country's confidence in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Hopes for Interest Rate Cut Dashed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Mounting producer
inflation and money supply growth have dampened hopes for an
early cut in interest rates in South Africa, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the South African Reserve Bank Wednesday
showed that the year-on-year producer price index growth rose to
4.5 percent in August from 3.7 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Statistics South Africa reported that consumer
inflation rose at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in August, up
from 6.6 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The central bank figures also showed that the broadest-based
M3 money supply indicator had fallen by a small margin to 19.05
percent in August compared with 19.13 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The use of credit by business and consumers continued at the
relatively high rate of 17.68 percent in August from the previous
month's of 17.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the figures show that the economic
fundamentals of South Africa are still weak and the central bank
is likely to wait for some time before cutting the interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's prime lending rates and home-loan rates stand
at 25.5 percent and 24 percent respectively, the highest level
since the early 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Place Trash Cans Along the Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 120 volunteers from China,
Britain, the United States and Thailand today placed 250 trash
cans along the Jinshanling Section of the Great Wall which is
located some 120 km north of downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, between the ages of four and 60, include
employees in foreign companies, foreign students, middle school
students, tourists and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers braved strong winds to carry the containers to
the top of the wall and then proceeded to clear litter scattered
about the area.
</P>
<P>
William Lindesay, a British foreign expert who organized the
activity, expressed pleasure at receiving the support of so many
people. He expressed even greater pleasure that "an ever
increasing number of people are participating in effort to protect
the Great Wall, a world-class historical heritage."
</P>
<P>
Lindesay organized a similar activity some five months ago and
found that efforts were somewhat hampered by the lack of trash
cans. Over the ensuing months, Lindesay convinced the Great Wall
Hotel and an unnamed Australian beer company to buy the new trash
cans at a cost of 8,000 yuan (990 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Promotes Agriculture, Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government regards
agriculture, rural development and farmers as strategically
important to the nation, President Tran Duc Luong was quoted
Thursday by leading newspapers here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Vietnam Farmers' Association, Luong urged
people to get more involved in the country's current
industrialization and modernization process as it is an urgent
task to develop agriculture comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that comprehensive development of the
agricultural sector would be possible only through
industrialization and modernization.
</P>
<P>
He asked the association to help farmers get rid of backward
agricultural production and boost production of commodity farm
produce, saying it is necessary to produce enough materials to
feed the processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Luong cautioned that agricultural development should be linked
to the farm processing industry not only for export but also for
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Toward this goal, the association should encourage the
establishment of more new-style cooperatives which have already
brought benefits to many farmers, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a newspaper report, Vietnam is asking
international donors to provide it with more assistance to develop
agriculture and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development presented the country's major agricultural development
targets for the period between now and 2010.
</P>
<P>
They include ensuring food security for 94 million people,
exporting some 11.5 billion U.S. dollars' worth of agricultural
products, increasing the forest coverage to 43 percent,
strengthening the capacity of disaster management, doubling
farmers' income and slashing the poverty rate to below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
To realize these targets, Vietnam will continue to boost land
reform, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has only 4.2 million hectares of land for paddy
cultivation and can expand this area by 100,000 to 150,000
hectares. However, some 20,000 hectares of agricultural land is
lost each year due to construction projects.

<HEADLINE> Local Election Canvas Starts in Bucharest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The race for Bucharest's
general mayoralty, declared vacant after the former Prime Minister
and General Mayor Victor Ciorbea's resignation in March,
officially started on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The winner in the impending election will govern Bucharest for
1.5 years. No less than 15 candidates from all parties in the
Romanian political arena have announced their intention to seek
the post.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of candidates will be known on October 10, the
candidates' deadline for registration.
</P>
<P>
Romania's coalition government decided on September 17 that the
elections for Bucharest general mayor were to take place on
October 25.
</P>
<P>
The decision ended a confusing situation that threatened to
become politically explosive because of Prime Minister Radu
Vasile's statements.
</P>
<P>
Vasile alleged that the elections would cost too much money
(about 1.6 million U.S. dollars) and would be better for the
interim tenure of Viorel Lis, a member of the ruling National
Peasant Party, to be prolonged until the scheduled elections in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The idea won immediate support from other ruling coalition
leaders for different reasons. It, however, spurred the opposition
parties' denunciation.
</P>
<P>
According to the government decision, the election campaign
launched on Thursday will last 23 days in accordance with the law
and will be funded by city hall.
</P>
<P>
Bucharest's citizens will be able to cast their votes in 1,176
polling stations. A maximum of four ballots can be held before the
selection of the general mayor.
</P>
<P>
If the voter turnout is lower than 50 percent in the first
ballot, a new date will be set.
</P>
<P>
If a majority vote is not forthcoming in the second ballot, a
third ballot will be held to decide between the first two leading
candidates.
</P>
<P>
If the two candidates receive an equal amount of votes in the
third ballot, a fourth ballot will be held to determine the winner.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign is to end at midnight, October 25. The
election results will be announced the next day.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM: Decision on CTBT Depends on Talks Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said Thursday that whether India will sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) depends on the outcome of the
ongoing talks between New Delhi and key interlocutors.
</P>
<P>
On his return from a nine-day trip to New York and France,
Vajpayee said he had conveyed to world leaders the message that
his country is prepared for the successful conclusion of the talks
so that the entry into force of the CTBT would not delayed beyond
next September.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that India wants to work with all other
countries, especially the nuclear weapon states, to eliminate this
category of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said certain points are yet to be cleared, but he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister declared that by announcing a unilateral
moratorium on conducting further nuclear tests shortly after the
nuclear tests last May, India has already accepted the substance
of the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have signed the treaty but have not ratified it
as is mandatory under the treaty, Vajpayee told reporters earlier
on board a special aircraft to Delhi.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Vajpayee said
there is also sharp divergence of opinion among the key countries
on the issue of transfer of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the U.N. General Assembly, Vajpayee also
stated that his country is engaged in discussions with key
interlocutors on issues including the CTBT and is prepared to
bring these discussions to a successful conclusion so that the
entry into force of the CTBT will not be delayed beyond September
1999.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on the sidelines of the U.N. session as productive and
friendly, saying India looks forward to resuming stalled foreign
secretary-level talks with Pakistan on October 15 on outstanding
bilateral issues including peace and security and Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On his first visit to France, Vajpayee said France recognized
India as a nuclear weapon state and offered assistance in the
field of defense.
</P>
<P>
He termed his meetings with President Jacques Chirac and other
French leaders as positive and fruitful and expressed his hope
that the new strategic partnership between the two countries would
further consolidate bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Indian Geologist: Evidence of Earlier Life Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- An Indian geologist claimed to
have found convincing evidence that the first multiple-celled
animals evolved about 1.1 billion years ago, a finding, if
verified, would stretch back the chronology of animal life by 500
million years.
</P>
<P>
Pradip K. Bose of Jadavpur University in Calcutta, about 1,460
kilometers southeast of here, said he found wiggly groves on the
surface of ancient sandstone from a road crossing in Churhat, a
dusty town in central Madhya Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express daily reported Thursday that these were
tracks left by worm-like animals, about half-a-centimeter thick
while burrowing though the sea floor in ages gone by.
</P>
<P>
Bose's paper, written along with two collaborators from
Germany, is the cover story of the October 2 issue of the reputed
American journal, Science.
</P>
<P>
Till now, the earliest known fossil records, discovered only
recently in China, indicated that multi-celled animals had evolved
about 600 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery in India was "Staggering" if it was true, said
Charles Marshall, an expert on evolution from the University of
California, Los Angeles, for it provided the "first evidence of
macroscopic animals."
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian Express, scientists had used the most
sophisticated dating techniques, called the vision track method
and potassium argon dating, to convincingly establish the vintage
of the Churhat sandstone.
</P>
<P>
Bose said the trace fossils were preserved in the Churhat
sandstone, which contained sand beds that built up during storms
about a billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tops of many sand beds were covered with a microbial mat
that blanketed the floor periodically and protected the sand below
from disturbances, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian daily said the discovery raised many questions than
answers, for there was a huge gap of 500 million years left to be
explained.
</P>
<P>
As of date, no fossil records are available for the period
between the findings in China and India.
</P>
<P>
The site where the discovery was made reportedly remains
unprotected and even threatened because of development activities
like the widening of the road by local authorities.

<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A military delegation from the
European Union (EU) is expected to arrive in Nigeria next Monday
to discuss the lifting of arms embargo on the country, a Nigerian
defense official has said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Post Express newspaper quoted Acting Director of
Defense Information Lieutenant Colonel Sam Tella as saying here
Wednesday that the European military delegation would be led by
General Wesley Clark, European Command and Supreme Allied
Commander.
</P>

The delegation will discuss with their Nigerian counterparts
about issues relating to the arms embargo on the most populous
African country by the European Union, said Tella. But he
refused to specify the issues to be discussed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China was filled with jubilation
Thursday as people from all walks of life celebrated the 49th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people gathered in the Tiananmen Square early this
morning to watch the daily ceremony of hoisting the national flag.
</P>
<P>
"This was my first opportunity to watch the flag-raising
ceremony in the Tiananmen Square," said Zhang Jianguo, an army
officer who spent 70 days battling summer flooding along the
Yangtze River in Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
"The national flag remained close to my heart and gave the
confidence and strength in the battle to fight the floods," said
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
A local airline in Shanghai, the nation's financial center,
offered a "bird's-eye view of the city" which provided many local
residents with their first opportunity to view the landscape of
China's economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai has changed dramatically and I was unable to
recognize many landmarks," said retired sexagenarian Gao Desheng.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 middle and technical school students in Hainan
Province, China's southernmost island province, marked the National
Day by donating blood and participating in a ceremony marking the
achievements of Haikou, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Thursday also marked implementation of the Law on Blood
Donations.
</P>
<P>
"Eighteen is a milestone for me," said He Wei, a student from
the Hainan Middle School. "It was very important for me to donate
blood and exhibit my sincere concern for other people on our
nation's 49th anniversary."
</P>
<P>
A five-day International Lion's Dance Festival also opened in
Suzhou City in east China's Jiangsu province today. China's
history of lion's dances dates back well over 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Teams from the United States, Japan, Singapore and 23 Chinese
provinces and Hong Kong are attending the festival.
</P>
<P>
National flags hanging at shops, schools, hotels, factories,
residential complexes and government buildings fluttered in breeze
in Hefei, capital of Anhui Province in the lower reaches of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>

local shopkeeper as he raised two flags in front of his
shop. "The policy of reform and opening has enabled many people
like me to gain prosperity."

<HEADLINE> CPV Attaches Importance to Democratic Rights: Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV)  always attaches importance to exercising democratic
rights, Advisor to the CPV Central Committee Do Muoi was quoted by
leading media here Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muoi, former CPV general secretary, said the party also
considers the "strict observance of democracy and promotion of the
people's rights to mastery as a noble objective as well as the
driving force of Vietnam's revolution."
</P>
<P>
The veteran party leader was speaking at a conference on Monday
to review the trial implementation of party and government
directives concerning the carrying out of democratic regulations
at the grassroots level in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Muoi stressed that in the current socialist revolution and
national renewal, socialist democracy has been emphasized with
people's rights to mastery being promoted in various social,
economic and political aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
Now it is widely agreed that together with economic success,
the expansion of democratic rights, including the people's rights
to mastery, is one of the most outstanding achievements of the
country's renovation process over the past decade, the party
leader said.
</P>
<P>
However, the abuse of people's democratic rights is still seen
in many activities and localities, he noted, saying corruption,
embezzlement and authoritarianism remain prevalent.
</P>
<P>
That is "a major threat to the ruling party," Muoi said, adding
that red tape and corruption have been eroding the revolutionary
character of the CPV and the state, undermining the government
apparatus, degrading the lifestyle and thinking of party members
and public employees and undermining the close relationship
between the party, the state and the people.
</P>
<P>
The most important and urgent task in the exercise of people's
rights to mastery is to boost the implementation of those rights
at the grassroots level, Muoi stressed.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Price Costs Nigeria Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Persistent low prices in the
international oil market have dealt a heavy blow to the Nigerian
economy which depends heavily on the crude export, Nigerian Head
of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide broadcast marking the country's 38th
anniversary of independence, Abubakar said that Nigeria's foreign
exchange income will drop by 20 to 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government in its 1998 budget projected a total
foreign exchange earning of 16.04 billion U.S. Dollars, with 9.83
billion Dollars, or 61.3 percent, from oil export.
</P>
<P>
The budget is based on an oil price of 17 U.S. Dollars a
barrel, but in most time of the year, the oil price has been 13
Dollars a barrel due to low demand of oil in the international
market as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The case for belt-tightening can not be overstated in the
circumstance as it is our continued determination to end the
financial year on a most moderate deficit," Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government is now reviewing the 1998
budget from both the resource and expenditure sides.

who was honored for his heroic participation in flood control

</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 people gathered in Tiananmen Square before sunrise

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party Hardens Position: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Talks aimed at solving the
Lesotho conflict hit a snag Thursday, less than 24 hours before
the make-or-break rendezvous Friday between the government,
opposition parties and regional mediators.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying that the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy had hardened its position on
certain proposals aimed at settling the controversy over the
allegations that the May 23 general election in Lesotho was
rigged.
</P>
<P>
"This government is already standing firm that it will not
agree on any proposals for re-election and the formation of a
government of national unity," said the source from the
behind-the-scenes preparatory committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili said Thursday in a
television broadcast that his government was legally and
legitimately in power, and was therefore not prepared to share
power with anybody.
</P>
<P>
One of the items opposition leaders were planning to introduce
to the agenda was amnesty for the Lesotho soldiers who turned
away from the Lesotho Defense Force and finally fled into the
hills surrounding the capital of Maseru during last week's
occupation by South African and Botswana military forces.
</P>
<P>
"Blanket amnesty for these people is crucial so that they can
come out of their hiding places in the mountains or villages...
so that they can also hand over their weapons," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho businessmen, still reeling from the destruction of the
town's shops during last week's rioting and looting, pled for a
swift solution to the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho business community, in a statement on Wednesday
night, encouraged political leaders to put their differences
aside for the sake of their country.
</P>
<P>
A South African advance team to the talks was expected to
arrive in Maseru Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Mufamadi, South Africa's Minister of Safety and
Security, is due to arrive in Maseru on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswana troops entered Lesotho last Tuesday
in the name of the Southern African Development Communication
(SADC) peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 100 people were killed in
skirmishes between SADC forces and mutinous Lesotho soldiers,
including nine South African soldiers.

<HEADLINE> No Change in Tehran-Islamabad Ties: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said here on Thursday that there is
no change in Tehran-Islamabad relation despite of return of some
Iranian diplomats from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the return of a group of Iranian diplomats
from Pakistan did not mean any change in the level of diplomatic
relations between Iran and Pakistan, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan news sources said recently that a group of 60 Iranian
diplomats returned from Islamabad following the tension between
Iran and the Pakistan-backed Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The group of Iranian diplomats have returned home because of
some problems, Mohammadi said, expressing hope the Iranian
diplomats would go back to Pakistan after removal of the
problems. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iran's ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi Akhundzadeh was also
quoted as saying that reduction in the number of Iranian
diplomatic corps in Pakistan would not affect the level of
Tehran-Islamabad relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran has blamed Islamabad for supporting the Taliban forces
who killed nine Iranian diplomats and an IRNA correspondent in
Northern Afghanistan in August.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Scrape Dual Exchange Rates by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's dual exchange rates
will be replaced by a single market rate by the end of 1998,
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar said in a
nationwide broadcast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks in his speech marking the 38th
anniversary of Nigeria's independence which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, Nigeria's efforts in the areas of
economic reform have received understanding and encouragement
from not only its traditional trading partners but also the major
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"With our genuine democratization program in place, my recent
visits to a number of creditor countries have opened a window of
opportunities," said the Nigerian leader.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few months, we intend to consolidate these
initiatives and cap them with the establishment of a single
market determined exchange rate of the Naira by the end of the
year," he announced.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has two exchange rates, one is fixed official rate
of 22 Naira to one U.S. Dollar used for selected government
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The other is determined by the Autonomous Foreign Exchange
Market (AFEM) and has been wavering around 85 Naira to one Dollar
in most time of the year.
</P>
<P>
There had been a strong call for the scrape of the dual
exchange rates from both inside and outside Nigeria in the last
few years, but the idea was dumped for several occassio by
the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Thursday reaffirmed his commitment to the
rule of law and protection of the individual rights and freedom
of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide broadcast to commemorate the nation's 38th
anniversary of independence on October 1, Abubakar said that
"democracy is in essence the politics of equality. Equality is
tethered on expanding economic opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"We are committed not only to democracy but to the rule of law
and protection of individual rights and freedom," the head of
state noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Abubakar took office last June, he has issued orders to
release the political detainees and convicted political
prisoners, and to review the cases and political charges against
some self-exile politicians.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader assured the nation that his government
would not arbitrarily detain people on the excuse of every minor
infraction of the law although there still exists the infamous
Decree Two under which police can detain people without trial.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to ensure that even convicted criminals in
our jails are treated as human beings," Abubakar said, adding
that "our prisons should serve as places of reforms and not as
dehumanizing chambers."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the promise by the head of state on
the need of the reformatory purpose of prisons is a radical
departure from the previous military administrations during which
many important prisoners died while serving jail terms.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Exports Continuing to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports dropped 3.4
percent to 10.9 billion U.S. dollars in September for the fifth
consecutive month, according to the Korean Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Energy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the continuous drop in exports to the
worldwide economic slump, flagging demand in crisis-stricken Asian
countries and the fall in export prices.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also blamed restructuring for the unrelenting
liquidity crunch in the financial sector. The ministry said the
near collapse of the manufacturing sector, which threatened
foreign shipments, was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
However, exports have begun to show some signs of recovery,
boosted mostly by the rise in shipments to advanced countries and
the recovery of vehicle exports following the settlement of labor
disputes at Hyundai Motor Corporation in August, said Yoo
Young-sang, director-general of the ministry's Trade Policy Bureau.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade surplus in September reached 3.6 billion
dollars, a rise from last month's 2.7 billion dollars. If the
ongoing trend continues, the trade surplus could reach 40 billion
dollars as expected by the end of this year, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Determined to Build Brighter Future: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here Thursday
that the SAR government remains determined to implement fully the
concept of "one country, two systems" and build a brighter future
for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an official reception marking the 49th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tung Chee Hwa
said Hong Kong a year ago was under the attack of an immense
financial turmoil which inflicted unprecedented damage upon the
city's economy. He added that the people of Hong Kong are all
facing the greatest difficulties and challenges they have never
had in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "no matter what difficult predicament we are
confronted with, I strongly believe that with determination,
tenacity and solidarity, we will definitely overcome all the
difficulties brought about by the financial turmoil and counteract
the adverse effects of a bubble economy."
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely enhance our competitiveness and put
ourselves on the track of economic revival," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Every time when we are confronted with difficulties, the
Central People's Government and our mainland compatriots always
support us with great encouragement and assistance," the chief
executive noted.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 this year, he added, "we were filled with great joy
to have President Jiang Zemin come to Hong Kong to celebrate with
us the first anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR. We
also felt deeply the unreserved support and great care of our
motherland."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Carry Out Haze Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will carry out a
three-year research on haze, Malaysian Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To that effect, Malaysia will sign an agreement soon with the
Australia-based Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO) under which the Australian government would
finance the study costing 300,000 Australian dollars (about
179,210 U.S. dollars) while Malaysia would provide assistance in
kind, the minister told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was badly hit last year by haze partly caused by
forest fires in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and Australia will have free access to the
findings of the research and are also free to use them especially
in solving environmental problems, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the research would substantially cover the prevention
of haze at source, including vehicles and industries, and its
effects on health.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would appoint two officers from the Department of
Environment and the Meteorological Services to the research team,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Backs Strike Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday expressed support for a bill calling for a
moratorium on strikes in vital industries during times of crises
to help preserve jobs and ensure the smooth delivery of basic
services to the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that his support for the proposal stemmed from
the need for workers to join hands with other sectors in helping
the country weather the Asian economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker earlier filed the bill seeking a temporary ban on
strikes and lockouts in vital industries such as the
transportation, communications, utilities, food and health
sectors, as part of the efforts to help the country quickly
recover from the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We really need to help each other to lead the country out of
the crisis, instead of going on strike. We are not depriving
workers of their rights, we are just asking them to temporarily
set aside their rights to strike while we are in a crisis," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a strike moratorium will help save jobs, noting
that companies crippled by strikes are unable to sustain their
operations in times of crises and usually close shop.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines, the national flag carrier, was shut down
on September 23 due to the breakdown of talks between the
management and the labor union which had been staging strikes
since June.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Reiterates Readiness to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Thursday reiterated his readiness to engage in peace
talks with the Turkish Cypriot side within the U.N. framework
with a view to reuniting Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a televised address to the nation
marking the 38th anniversary of independence of the Cyprus
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to be constructive, ready to discuss any
idea or proposal within the U.N. framework. We are ready to
discuss as a priority the issue of security leading to final
demilitarization of the island," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third in
the wake of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bicommunal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots
opted out of the peace talks last year to protest a European Union
decision to start accession talks with Cyprus, not their ally
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward a proposal in
August, calling for the establishment of a confederation of two
equal states in Cyprus as the basis for resuming talks, but the
idea was rejected by Greek Cypriot-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
Clerides warned that possible acceptance of the Turkish Cypriot
proposal for confederation would lead to "the permanent and
substantive division of Cyprus" implemented through the abolition
of the Republic of Cyprus and its replacement with two
protectorates.
</P>
<P>
This would also draw the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
further apart and would increase friction between Greece and
Turkey with bigger dangers for regional stability and security, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
adopt a strategy to convince the Turkish side to return to the
negotiating table on the basis of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that efforts for accession to the European
Union will continue "as we have planned and irrespective of the
situation of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
He repeated the invitation to the Turkish Cypriots "to
participate on an equal basis with the Greek Cypriot community in
the delegation of Cyprus negotiating accession to the EU."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started accession talks with the EU in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also observed a military parade Thursday to mark the
Independence Day.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Ports Authority has
launched a campaign to woo Rwandan importers who have been
threatening to turn to the rival Dar es Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
Part of the campaign includes the introduction of a window for
processing transit cargo documents last month, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Similar preference was also accorded to importers from Uganda
to break the cumbersome procedures which have caused anger to
business community using Kenya's Indian port of Mombasa, a
traditional leading port in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
KPA Chairman Samuel Maneno recently assured a 16-member
delegation from Rwanda Chamber of Commerce visiting Mombasa that
sufficient space within the existing cargo sheds, yards and the
container terminal would be provided for storage of Rwandan
cargo.
</P>
<P>
There have been complaints in the processing of transit cargo
documents as well as storage space at the port for a long time.
</P>
<P>
KPA managing director Lenny Mwangola said earlier the
authority intended to establish areas outside the port to store
cargo.
</P>
<P>
Msafari assured the Rwandan businessmen that KPA would furnish
them with the latest information regarding the clearance of goods
at the port.

has contributed to the development of the entire world, Tung Chee

<P>
This summer, China faced the test of the severest floods in a

"I am therefore greatly honored to be a Chinese and take
immense pride in the development of our country," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Asian financial crisis, the chief executive said, "I

the Hong Kong people, together with our sound economic
fundamentals, a responsible government and the staunch support of
our motherland, we can overcome these challenges and revive our
economy.

prosperity of our country and our people," he added.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was affected by the
regional financial crises, China's central government offered
timely support, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The central government expressed on many occasions their
determination to support Hong Kong's economy at any cost. China's
determined efforts to maintain the value of the Renminbi and
achieve the targeted growth rate of eight percent have greatly
contributed to the stability of the Hong Kong dollar and the
recovery of Hong Kong's economy, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation in Hong Kong of the policy of
"One Country, Two Systems" has set an example for the renunciation
of China and the people of Hong Kong will, together with all the
overseas Chinese, strive for the sacred cause, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The people of Hong Kong have come to understand more deeply the
policy of "One Country, Two Systems" and "Hong Kong people
administrating Hong Kong" through their own experience since Hong
Kong's renunciation with the motherland last year, the Ta Kung Pao
said in an editorial here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji reaffirmed the central government's
support to the SAR government led by Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa, which boosted the confidence of the Hong Kong people, the
editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said on Thursday that while at
49th birthday, China displayed achievements after its success in
the fight against the severest floods in China in a century.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that people are confident that more
achievements will be made in the implementation of China's
long-term strategy, and China will stride forward into the 21st
century, it added.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- When Mr. Yip and his family
arrived at the Stonecutter Island Naval Base of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) at 8:00 a.m. Thursday, they found
hundreds of people waiting to see the barracks of the PLA garrison
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Three barracks of the PLA garrison in Hong Kong were opened to
local residents on the National Day in an effort to promote
understanding between the Hong Kong people and the Chinese armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Yip and their three children aged 9, 5 and 3 left
their home at Lam Tin at 6:00 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The three children rushed to the ships berthed at the wharf
when visitors were allowed to enter the camp ahead of the
scheduled time of 9:00 am.
</P>
<P>
People were shown around the ships by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Indoor activities were also interesting. Visitors were invited
to watch soldiers' cultural performance staged in a hall. They
were also invited to play chess and table tennis with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some soldiers demonstrated their skills of Chinese painting and
calligraphy and gave their works to interested visitors. An old
scholar described the works of the soldiers as wonderful and said
he did not expect the soldiers to be so well-educated.
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting and writing, soldiers also demonstrated
their singing skills. A young man who just sang a song together
with a soldier said the soldiers were very friendly.

JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
provide foreign investors with various facilities and incentives
to attract more investors to do business in the oil and gas
industry, Antara News Agency Thursday quoted an official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry's director general for

sector will stay attractive to foreign investors.
</P>

Besides, the government will also simplify investment
procedures.

<P>
Suleiman said Indonesia has oil deposits that could be
exploited in the next 20 years and more areas are being explored.
</P>
<P>
He noted that years ago, there were estimates that Indonesia's
oil fields could only be tapped for 15 years but this has been

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price May Go Up in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
consider raising prices of petroleum products next year after the
end of the current fuel crisis, Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar said through media Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar disclosed this in a national broadcast marking the
country's 38th independence anniversary which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader said that his government is making
considerable investments to tackle the lingering fuel scarcity.
He predicted that "by the beginning of 1999, all these efforts
should pay substantial rewards and bringing the situation toward
normality."
</P>
<P>
"It is only then that the need for a more adequate price
regime may be considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major world oil producer with a daily crude output
of over two million barrels, has been suffering from persistent
fuel shortage in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Though ailing refineries are generally held responsible for
the situation, low price of fuel products has encouraged
smuggling to neighboring countries, thus making the situation
worse.
</P>
<P>
A liter of petrol is now sold for 11 Naira (0.13 U.S. Dollar)
in Nigeria, while a liter of diesel is nine Naira, and kerosene
six Naira.
</P>
<P>
Fuel price is a sensitive issue in Nigeria both economically
and politically. A price hike in 1993 by the interim government
of Chief Earnest Shonekan sparked off massive unrest and
eventually led to his replacement by late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
But General Abubakar has proved his great political courage in
his less than four months reign. He has ordered a 600 percent pay
rise for civil servants, which will definitely give him more
strength in raising the fuel price.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the fuel crisis, Nigeria has contracted French oil
company Total to rehabilitate the Kaduna refinery at a cost of
217 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the project, which should have been completed
by now, is trapped in a controversy between Total and the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
While Total was accused of being technically unfit to do the
job, it complained that Nigerian side is not adhering to the
contract terms.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of state's Independence Day speech, the
rehabilitation is "nearing completion."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that contracts for the rehabilitation of
Port Harcourt have already been awarded, while the refinery at
Warri will also be put into operation soon.

MACAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand gathering was held here
Thursday morning to mark the 49th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, chairman of the presidium of the Macao Compatriots
Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the 49th Anniversary
of the Founding of the People's Republic of China, expressed the
heartfelt wish of Macao residents that the motherland will have
lasting prosperity.
</P>

Over the past two decades since China's reform and opening-up,
the comprehensive national strength is bigger, people's living
standard has improved, and the independent foreign policy of peace
has won favorable results, Ma Man Kei said.
</P>
<P>
"A strong motherland provides powerful backing for Macao's
smooth return, and the people in the inland areas have been
showing great care and support for Macao's development and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Macao residents have once again exhibited their
fine tradition of loving the motherland and the strong cohesive
force of the Chinese nation when they donated to their compatriots
in the flood-hit areas of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
joined with about 1,000 local residents and celebrities at the
gathering which was made more lively with artistic performances.
</P>
<P>
At 12 o'clock, firecrackers were set off in the urban areas to
enhance National Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
In the past several days, social bodies in Macao have been
holding receptions, gatherings and tea or wine parties to
celebrate the birthday of New China.

The young man who identified himself as Cheng said he had
visited the barracks of British soldiers before Hong Kong returned
to China and he described British soldiers as "too arrogant."
</P>
<P>
"Here we see our own soldiers and we feel more intimate toward
them," Cheng said. He said the facilities in the barracks are very
modern and he has a sense of safety after the visit.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return to China, I feel I am a real Chinese
person and I have developed the sense of glory and belonging," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors seemed to be interested in everything in the barracks,
even the magazines and newspapers soldiers read and the food they
cooked. The library and the cooking show in the dining hall
attracted a large number of people.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the military performance drew most of the
visitors. Cheers and applause were heard when soldiers performed
martial arts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,000 free tickets were distributed to visitors to
the Stonecutter Island Naval Base located at Kowloon on September

three camps were snapped up by residents in two hours.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997, after more than
100 years under British colonial rule. According to the Basic Law,
Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy with the Central

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tea Output May Exceed Target This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tea production this
year is likely to reach 58 million kilograms, 4 million kilograms
more than the fixed target, The Financial Express newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As far as the weather is concerned, it is very favorable in the
current season for the growth and nourishment of tea, the report
quoted a reliable source as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the weather continues to remain unchanged for the coming
months, production might be more than what is anticipated now, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tea production up to August had been recorded at 32 million
kilograms, 2 million kilograms more than the corresponding period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that increased tea production
vis-a-vis more or less static demand in the world market does not
bring comfort to the planters, because in such a situation, tea
price in the auction market generally slides down.
</P>
<P>
Tea, second most important cash crop after jute for Bangladesh,
is produced by 158 gardens, most of which are in northeast and
southeast districts of Sylhet and Chittagong. Bangladesh earned
more than 2.03 billion taka (about 43.32 million U.S. dollars)
from its tea export in the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year, 55
percent more than the previous fiscal. Major buyers of
Bangladesh's tea include Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and India.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President: Peace Needs Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Thursday said his country will maintain strong national
security cooperation with the United States, Japan and other
surrounding nations.
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen the ROK-U.S. defense system based on our
strong national defense capability and push for cooperation with
Japan, while not neglecting cooperation with China and Russia, for
peace on the Korean peninsula," Kim said in his speech marking the
50th anniversary of the founding of the South Korean Armed Forces
at Seoul Air Base.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he will further strengthen the defensive abilities of
the South Korean armed forces to prevent another war on the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is visiting Japan next week, said he will
discuss the security issue with Japanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes one month after a rocket launched by the DPRK
to put a satellite into orbit on August 31 this year shocked the
world, especially South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, the establishment of strong
national security that can ensure peace and safety can be none
other than the very top priority," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that South Korea needs to maintain firm security not
only to preserve peace on the Korean peninsula but also to help
the nation overcome the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If our security is uncertain, how could anyone feel safe and
concentrate on their work? Which foreign company could come and do
business in our country?" the president asked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kim reiterated his call on the DPRK to respond to
his new reconciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
"The government intends to open an era of peace, reconciliation
and cooperation with the North, based on firm security, leaving
behind the age of confrontation that has lasted for the past 50
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to beg for bilateral talks, but, as far as we
are concerned, the channel for dialogue is wide open," added the
president.

CANBERRA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian rider Neil Stephens
was still clear for the Australian Cycling Federation despite
having been banned from this month's world road racing
championships by the International Cycling Union.
</P>
<P>
Australian Cycling Federation (ACF) president Ray Godkin told

"We still have nothing which proves he is guilty of wrongdoing

</P>
<P>
Stephens was one of the nine members of the Festina team
expelled from the Tour after team officials admitted to providing
banned performance-enhancing substances to their riders.
</P>
<P>
Three Festina riders from Switzerland Alex Zuelle, Armin Meier

substance erythropoietin (EPO) but Stephens denied any
wrong-doings.

CAIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Mubarak is to meet Thursday with Palestinian President Yasser

<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt has warned the Middle East region anew against the
dangers of embarking on an arms race, Egyptian Foreign Minister

mass-destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Flower Farmers Sue Iraq for Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli flower farmers are
demanding compensation from the Iraqi government for damages they
suffered during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz reported on Thursday that the Israeli
organization of flower farmers has met recently in Jerusalem with
representatives of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed the lawsuit
submitted by 327 flower growers, which will be handed over to the
U.N. compensation committee.
</P>
<P>
The compensation demanded by the farmers was 30 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the organization, Avraham Daniel said
the damage was a direct result of Israel closing its borders to
the Palestinian workers during the war.
</P>
<P>
This resulted, he said, in 32 million flowers rotting in the
field, unharvested and unsold.
</P>
<P>
The suit was submitted in accordance with U.N. Security
Council Resolution No. 687, which imposed the responsibility for
damage to various countries because of the war.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War, Iraq fired some 40 missiles to Israel and
caused a serious economic loss to the Jewish country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Urged to Cancel Aircraft Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Transport and
Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban has urged Thai Airways
International (THAI) to scrap its order for three aircraft worth
14 billion baht (364 million U.S. dollars) from two foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current economic situation, the Transport and
Communications Ministry is worried about the aircraft procurement
plan of the airline," Thai News Agency (TNA) on Thursday quoted
Suthep as saying.
</P>
<P>
TNA said the minister urged the cancellation in order to help
cut national expenses.
</P>
<P>
His instruction came in line with a proposal from transport
officials who think that the cancellation is still possible as
both manufacturers -- Boeing Commercial Airplane and Airbus
Industrie -- have not yet started the production of the three
aircraft, one Airbus 330 and two Boeing 777-300s.
</P>
<P>
"THAI will first try to cancel the order. If the manufacturers
reject the cancellation, the airline will negotiate for changing
aircraft types or delaying the production instead," Suthep said.
</P>
<P>
The national airline has placed a deposit of 148 million
dollars for the aircraft and is required to pay 216 million
dollars more to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft are among the 21 THAI planned to acquire during
its five-year operation plan from 1997 to 2001. Under the plan,
THAI has already received six aircraft, four Boeing 737-400s and
two Airbus 330s. Nine more aircraft have been completed, though
pending delivery, and three others are on production lines.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Reserves Up to 46.98 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean foreign exchange
reserves rose to 46.98 billion U.S. dollars in September from the
previous month's 45.09 billion dollars, said the Bank of
Korea Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's usable foreign reserves, excluding deposits at
overseas branches of South Korean banks, amounted to 43.37 billion
dollars at the end of September this year, up 2.02 billion from
August.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the rise of foreign exchange
reserves to loan repayments of 1.62 billion dollars by commercial
banks and the seventh installment of funds of 640 million dollars
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
South Korea agreed with the IMF in July that its usable foreign
exchange reserves should amount to 43 billion dollars by the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, financial institutions have repaid 15.29
billion dollars to the Bank of Korea for emergency foreign
currency settlement and still have eight billion dollars in loans
outstanding, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank settled 500 million dollars in forward exchange loans
due in September and has 1.49 billion outstanding.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's emergency settlement loans were 23.29 billion
dollars last December when foreign exchange reserves almost ran
out after a financial crisis, which was spurred by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions late last
year, began to plague the country, once the 11th largest economy
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Although the foreign exchange reserves rapidly rise, it does
not mean the economy is recovering and the nation still has
maturing foreign debt to pay at the end of this year, some
observers.
</P>
<P>
In August, South Korea's total external liabilities stood at
150 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Urged to Initiate Energy Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- It has been suggested that
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders initiate a
region- wide major energy-related infrastructure project to help
jump-start the economies affected by the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Making the suggestion here Thursday, Francis Yeoh Sock Ping,
chairman of the task force on partnership for equitable growth of
the APEC Business Advisory Council, said the initiatives would
also provide greater energy security, enhance foreign direct
investment, develop new energy-related industries and bring in
immediate and much-needed revenue streams to the region.
</P>
<P>
The task force proposed that efficient distribution of gas
resources in the region will generate regional trade and wealth
creation and in the process develop a more level playing field
among APEC members, he said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
This is the "underlying rationale" for the APEC's Asian Gas
Grid, the task force's early flagship project, which is a network
of gas pipelines to transport natural gas from the Malaysian and
Indonesian gas fields to major demand centers in other members
like China, Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Authority and the
Indonesian Strategic Geographical Location are being proposed as
the hub to link up the proposed gas network existing in Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Asian Gas Grid as "a good project to boost
economy," Yeoh said the APEC Business Advisory Council will move
ahead with the gas grid proposal at the forthcoming APEC Energy
Ministerial Meeting in Okinawa, Japan, on October 12-13.
</P>
<P>
He said the council is also likely to pursue the adoption of
the estimated 5 billion U.S. dollar regional gas pipeline project
at the upcoming APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Briefs Mubarak on Outcome of Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Thursday briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
talks he had with U.S. and Israeli leaders on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Arafat and Mubarak in Egypt's northern
coastal city of Alexandria also focused on the upcoming visit by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the region in the
middle of this month, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been reported for Arafat's talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Israel's second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The peacemaking has been focusing on a U.S. proposal which asks
for a 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to come to the region in preparation for
negotiating schedule for the Israelis and Palestinians in
Washington later this month when an agreement is hoped to be
reached.

<HEADLINE> Bounced Checks on Rise in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The total value of the checks
returned for insufficient funds has reached about 500 million
Jordanian dinars (some 706 million U.S. dollars) so far this year,
a 15 percent increase over that in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The recession of trade activities was responsible for many
negative outcomes, especially bounced checks," the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper on Thursday quoted Haidar Murad, Chairman
of the Federation of Jordanian Chambers of Commerce as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exports suffered from a 4.8 percent decrease in the first
half of this year over the same period of last year, while the
imports saw a 5.4 percent decrease, according to statistics from
the Central Bank of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
One way to check the bounced checks is the privatization of
trade by easing restriction on granting loans to traders and
lowering interest rates, said Murad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescheduling the traders' debts will also help them
fulfill their outstanding financial obligations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Cancels Beijing Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk has temporarily canceled his Beijing trip scheduled for
October 5 for a regular health checkup, said the Royal Palace
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the King changed his mind
because he will come here from Siem Reap on October 5 to help form
a new government so as to stablize the political situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The King's planned departure from Cambodia next Monday has put
pressure on tenuous multi-party talks to form a coalition
government, politicians and experts said.
</P>
<P>
If the King goes to Beijing for medical treatment as scheduled,
Cambodia will have no head of state in the country because a new
National Assembly president has not been formally appointed. Under
the Cambodian Constitution, the Assembly president works as the
acting head of state in the absence of the monarch.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) spokesman Khieu Kanharith said
if the King does leave and there is no elected president for the
Assembly, "the political tension could increase."
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Sam Rainsy also said if the King leaves,
Cambodia will need help from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old monarch has been at his villa in Siem Reap
since he returned home from Beijing on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia held a National Assembly election on July 26. The
ruling CPP won 64 seats in the election, followed by the FUNCINPEC
party with 43 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party with 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
Since the CPP does not have the two-third majority necessary
for a government alone, it has to form a coalition government with
other parliamentary parties.
</P>
<P>
But both the FUNCINPEC Party and the Sam Rainsy Party refused
to accept any offer from the CPP. Instead they demanded that an
investigation be conducted into an alleged fraud of the CPP in the
election.
</P>
<P>
The King presided over an all-party crisis meeting on September
22, which ended a three-week protest and brought the rival parties
back to the negotiation table on the formation of a coalition
government.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Internet Market to Reach 1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Internet market in Israel
is expected to reach 1 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2002,
local daily Haaretz said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a new market survey carried out by
International Documentation Center's Israel branch as saying that
the number of Internet users in Israel will also increase 30
percent a year on average.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that during 1998 some 360,000 people in Israel
have used the Internet and the volume of the Internet market in
Israel will reach 300 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey showed that the largest market segment
in the Israeli Internet market is the access to the Net -- linkage
services provided by Internet suppliers.
</P>
<P>
It assessed that the total value of access services in 1998
will be at 115 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that revenues from access services would
grow at faster rates in Israel than revenues from any other
Internet-related segment.
</P>
<P>
At a growth rate of 45 percent a year, the access services
segment will reach 350 million dollars a year by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that other fast-growing segments include site
storage services, telephony and video products for the Internet,
and intranet-extranet establishment services.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Plunging in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued plunging in
Tokyo Thursday with the Nikkei index falling to a new 12-year low
as the dismal results of a Bank of Japan (BOJ) quarterly survey on
business sentiment weighed heavily on investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 209.27 points, or 1.56
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 13,197.12. At one point,
the Nikkei index fell 390 points, nearly dropping below 13,000, a
level last seen in January 1986.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 27.85 points or 2.67 percent to
1,015.72.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 600
million shares from Wednesday's 565.06 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
While the BOJ's Tankan survey did not produce much worse
figures for major firms compared with those recorded in late 1993,
analysts noted the survey did indicate small and medium-sized
companies are being hit by the recession harder now than before.
</P>
<P>
Banks continued to suffer big losses. Sixteen of Japan's top 19
banks hit record lows for the year as investors grow restless over
the Japanese government's delay in helping them get rid of their
nonperforming loans.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,337 issues listed on the First Section, losers
overwhelmed gainers 1,020 to 186, with 94 issues ending
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's National Airline Set to Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- With the Jordanian government's
determination, the debt-ridden national carrier Royal Jordanian
(RJ) will restructure and then sell itself.
</P>
<P>
The government late Wednesday authorized officials to sign
final agreements with financial and legal advisers for RJ's
privatization, the Al Ra'I, Jordan's leading Arabic daily
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the RJ is part of the government's plan which
was launched in 1989 to tap the potential of the private sector,
draw foreign investment and finally streamline and privatize the
large-scale, state-owned companies. The plan meets strong
opposition from the parliament and has not been not legalized yet.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with France's Bank Paribas, the RJ's financial
advisor for privatization, is worth 1.2 million U.S. dollars and
lasts three years, while that with the British Clifford Chance
Company, the RJ's legal adviser, is worth 925,000 dollars and
lasts 10 months, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Initial agreements had been signed between the RJ and these two
advisors last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Bank Paribas will evaluate the RJ's
assets, restructure its balance sheet and recommend ways to handle
its debts and financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
The bank will eventually market the main parts of the RJ,
which will include the aviation and technical support sectors,
while the remaining business of the national airline, such as the
duty-free shops, engineering services and catering, will be part
of a government-owned company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Clifford Chance Company will help the
government improve its regulations of the RJ, make clear the RJ's
legal liabilities, establish reasonable relationship between the
RJ and the governmental Civil Aviation Authorities as well as
between the RJ and other concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
The RJ is now straddled with 700 million Jordanian dinars
(nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars) of debts, due to years of
mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Strictly Regulate Employment of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has vowed to regulate the employment of foreign workers
to make jobs for locals, the semi-official Jordan Times reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government will toughen the enforcement of the employment
law, take measures to expel the foreigners without jobs, and set
up a system to monitor the situation of foreign workers in the
kingdom, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
No visas will be issued to non-Jordanian laborers except within
the framework of the agreements between Jordan and other Arab
countries, said Tarawneh late Wednesday during a meeting with
cabinet members on the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is doing so because a large foreign work force has a
direct impact on the labor market and the security situation, said
Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 guest workers now stay in
Jordan, of whom only 40 percent hold valid work permits. Jordanian
employers like to hire guest workers for they can pay them low
wages and do not have to undertake their insurance.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Jordan was officially estimated at
15 percent, but independent sources placed it at 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Spain Sign Investment Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has signed a
bilateral investment treaty with Spain in a bid to encourage and
support local and foregin bound investments with developed
countries, local daily Sowetan reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in Pretoria by South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin and his Spanish counterpart Elena
Pisonero on Wednesday, will help South Africa get access to
global investment initiative, capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
It will also lay the foundation for further growth of
employment-creating projects in this country, the South African
Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Africa and Spain will be treated
fairly and in the same manner as investors from other countries
and in most cases also in the same way as the host state's own
investors.
</P>
<P>
Both countries will be ensured that their rights to move
capital and returns in and out are generally unaffected by
foreign exchange control.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance with Spain was in South Africa's favor last
year. Exports from South Africa to Spain were valued at 3.031
billion Rand (about 527 million U.S. Dollars) while imports from
Spain were 1.305 billion Rand (about 227 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said further negotiations on double taxation
agreements between the two countries which started in Spain
earlier this month will take place in South Africa in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
King Juan Carlos of Spain is expected to visit South Africa
during the first three months of next year.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Kills 300 People in Tel Aviv Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 people died last
year from particle pollution in Tel Aviv, the commercial and
financial center of Israel, local daily Haaretz said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report prepared by a panel of Israeli
experts as saying that most of the pollution in the city was
caused by diesel engines used in buses, trucks and taxi cabs.
</P>
<P>
The experts were from Israeli Health Ministry and Environment
Ministry. And the report was the first from official sources in
Israel to link deaths to pollution.
</P>
<P>
The report said that particle pollution from diesel engines
accounts for some 350 tonnes of an estimated 427 tonnes of
particle pollution dumped into the air in Tel Aviv annually.
</P>
<P>
It said that the number of people who died from pollution in
the city last year was 10 times the number of those who were
killed in automobile accidents in the city, indeed more than the
total unnatural deaths, including murders, car accidents and work
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The particle pollution also was responsible for 134 new cases
of chronic bronchitis. It was estimated that the total health
costs of particle pollution for the city has reached 600 million
U.S. dollars a year in lost work and hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Particle pollution is pollution involving liquid or solid
particles that are emitted by engines. The particles do not
dissipate in the air, and when breathed into the lungs get
trapped in the respiratory system, causing infections and other
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
According to studies, particle pollution is particularly
dangerous for the elderly, children and those with chronic
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
To bring down the level of this pollution, the report
recommended the use of natural gas in commercial vehicles and a
substantial increase in the price of diesel fuel.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Interest Rate Blamed for Stock Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The relatively high U.S. dollar
interest rate in Lebanon has kept investors away, the Daily Start
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many banks in Lebanon are still offering 7 percent interest on
(U.S.) dollar deposits despite appeals by the central bank to
reduce the rate by 1 percent," Gabriel Sehnaoui, chairman of
the Beirut Stock Exchange was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Most countries around the world offer 5 percent interest rate
on the dollar," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a drop in the interest on both the Lebanese
and U.S. currencies would boost trading on the market as more
investors moved their money from the banks to the bourse.
</P>
<P>
In August, 2.27 million shares were traded on the stock
exchange with the turnover of 15.54 million U.S. dollars, a drop
of 44.2 percent in volume and 56 percent on the turnover compared
with July.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the bourse also attributed part of the causes
for the flat market to the political uncertainty which is gripping
the country.
</P>
<P>
"It's a wait-and-see period as investors probably want to find
out who will become the next president before rushing back to the
market."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is expected to have a new president after the
incumbent Elias Hrawi ends his nine-year term in office on
October 24.
</P>
<P>
Sehnaoui expected the outlook to be better next year,
especially after more companies listed their shares.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 Lebanese companies, mostly banks and real estate
firms, are now listed on the Lebanese bourse, which was reopened
in 1996 after the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the bourse rose from 64 million dollars in 1996 to
640 million dollars in 1997 with a target of 1 billion dollars
this year.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Poultry Imports From Australia's New South Wales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China announced here today to
ban poultry imports from the New South Wales State of Australia
which has been hit by an epidemic poultry disease since
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
China's State Bureau of Exit-Entry Inspection and Quarantine
said in an urgent circular that imports of birds and poultry
products from the New South Wales State are prohibited and they
will not be allowed to be mailed or brought into China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bureau has asked its local quarantine offices to
conduct as from today rigid and strict inspection on ships, air
planes and trains entering China to guard against and control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The poultry epidemic found in New South Wales last month is one
of the most harmful and fast-spreading poultry diseases which not
only kills birds but also can infect the human being, according to
experts.

<HEADLINE> Listed Singapore Firms' Half-Time Profits Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 190 listed
Singapore
companies that had released their this year's interim results
registered a 80 percent decline in their combined half-time
profits of 1998 over the same period of 1997, local English
newspaper The Straits Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the half-time corporate reporting season closed
Wednesday with little last-minute cheer as 190 listed Singapore
companies worked out a mere 660 million Singapore dollars (388
million U.S. dollars) in their half-time profits compared with 3.2
billion Singapore dollars (1.88 U.S. dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the 190 firms reporting results for the half-year ended June
30, it said, 133 firms made combined net profits of 1.98 billion
Singapore dollars (1.11 billion U.S. dollars). But most of this
was offset by combined losses of 1.32 billion Singapore dollars
(0.78 U.S. dollars) sustained by 57 companies, it added.
</P>
<P>
Eighty three firms of the total profitable companies reported
lower profits while the other 50 firms reported rises in net
earnings, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The top five most profitable firms in absolute dollar terms --
led by United Overseas Bank with 256.4 million dollars (150.8
millions U.S. dollars) of net earnings -- all suffered profit
declines, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper blamed the plunge largely on the regional economic
turmoil. But it also recognized provisions and unforeseen
circumstances as factors contributing to the profit hacking.
</P>
<P>
The paper commented that Singapore's listed corporate sector
has begun to feel the sting of the regional crisis that was
sparked off by the devaluation of the Thai baht in July last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan called on Prime Minister Jean Chretien and
other Canadian leaders here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Chretien, Tang said that Sino-Canadian
friendly cooperation has been gaining momentum and that frequent
exchanges of high-level visits have deepened mutual understanding
and trust and contributed greatly to the in-depth development of
the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a successful state visit to
Canada last year and the leaders of both countries agreed to
establish a partership of all-round cooperation oriented towards
the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang told Chretien that the Chinese government is looking
forward to his re-visit to China this November, and expressed the
belief that the visit will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that he has been giving great emphasis to the
development of Canada-China relations ever since he became prime
minister years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said he was pleased to see the smooth development of
the bilateral friendly cooperation in the political, economic,
trade and other fields, and looked forward to his third visit to
China soon.
</P>
<P>
In his meetings with Senate Speaker Gildas Molgat and House of
Commons Speaker Gilbert Parent, Tang noted the exchanges between
Canada's parliament and China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister expressed the hope that the two sides will
continue to contribute to the overall development of Sino-Canadian
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Both Molgat and Parent said that Canada's parliament is taking
a positive attitude towards pushing the bilateral relations
forward through the exchanges of the legislation organs of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang also held talks here with his Canadian counterpart Lloyd
Axworthy. They exchanged views on Sino-Canadian relations as well
as regional and international issues.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Gears up for Bangkok Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is gearing up for the
forthcoming Asian Games in December, determined that the economic
crisis will not overshadow its moment of regional glory.
</P>
<P>
The games organizers, plastering the Thai capital with images
of Chai-yo, the grinning elephant mascot for the Games, have
dismissed suggestions of a problem with the completion of venues
for the December 6-20 Games.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the organizers Thursday said: "They will be
ready in time, We confirmed that yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"There were worries about completion of several projects but
those worries are behind us. We have passed the worst time now
and it is all better."
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Games are due to attract all 43 Olympic Committee
of Asia members, making them the biggest Asian Games, topping the
record 42 members at Hiroshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the organisers admit they are still trying to get
confirmation of how many competitors will be here.
</P>
<P>
Schools and universities across Thailand will close throughout
the games to ease Bangkok's notorious traffic congestion and
"awaken in teenagers a love of sport and cooperation," a Thai
government official said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic snarls in Bangkok threatened to pose serious problems
for organizers and athletes trying to get to stadiums in outlying
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The games spokesman said special arrangements would be in
place to slash travel time between the two main Bangkok venues.
</P>
<P>
He said that "We hope for the best. At worst, it will take one
hour and 15 minutes between venues."

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The first long-distance pipeline
carrying natural gas from the Qaidam Basin in northwest China
has been completed today.
</P>
<P>
The 350-kilometre-long pipeline, built by thousands of oil
workers after 150 consecutive days of hard effort, connects
central Qaidam in Qinghai province to Dunhuang of Gansu province,
with an annual gas-carrying capacity of 300 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the project is expected to improve the
structure of energy consumption in Dunhuang, a world-renowned
tourist city along the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin is abundant in petroleum and natural gas
resources. Its proven reserve of natural gas totals 150 billion
cubic meters, the fourth largest in China, after the natural gas
fields in Sichuan, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and
Xinjiang.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- A statement issued Wednesday night after the meeting of
the Council of the National Security chaired by President
Suleyman Demirel said that it is clear that Syria supports the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) against the Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Turkish leaders agreed that the
necessary measures should be adopted in case Syria does not
change its attitude towards Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey expects positive step from Italy to ease tension
between Ankara and Rome as the Italian Parliament permitted the
"Kurdish Parliament in Exile," outlawed in Turkey, to hold a
two-day meeting at the Italian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Necati Utkan said at a
press conference Wednesday that "It is not sufficient to call

conceived."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Labor Leaders Accuse Republicans of Being Partisan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. labor leaders
Thursday called for a special meeting to refocus their political
efforts in the wake of the scandal surrounding President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of American Federation of Labor and Congress of
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) said they want to counter
Republicans, whom they accuse of using the Monica Lewinsky affair
to divert attention from issues important to union members.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of forces that don't want working people to go
to the polls in November and are doing everything they can right
now to keep the focus on partisan investigations," said AFL-CIO
spokeswoman Denise Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make an extraordinary effort to counter those
pressures," he was quoted by the Associated Press (AP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Monday to union leaders, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney criticized Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt
Gingrich and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and laid out an
argument that officials said would be adapted for labor's fall
member-to-member campaign.
</P>
<P>
"When the Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to
release the videotaped testimony of President Clinton far and
wide, I believe the Gingrich leadership crew exposed their real
agenda," Sweeney wrote.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't release it because they thought the public needed
to know what's in it, they released it for the same reason Ken
Starr wrote a report that was more about sex than about legal
issues -- to continue the fixation in Washington with the Lewinsky
issue at the expense of the issues our members care most about,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Sweeney told a Wisconsin labor convention that
Republican leaders "are trying to steal the election by smearing
progressive candidates with the results of partisan investigations
instead of debating public issues like health care, education, the
environment and Social Security," according to the AP report.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to restore the election to a debate over working
family issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic agenda of protecting Social Security and fixing
our schools provides American families with a powerful motive to
vote in November," said Olivia Morgan, spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "We welcome efforts
by the AFL-CIO to communicate that message to working Americans."
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Sweeney said there was "plenty to disapprove of
in the president's behavior."
</P>
<P>
"But as disappointing, hurtful, and unacceptable as it was, it
is time to express sour disapproval and move on," he wrote.

<HEADLINE> China: A More Active "Global Villager" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- With a perception that the world
is becoming more multi-polorized and peace and development
continue to be the main trend in international relations, China
has unfolded a series of colorful diplomatic activities this year,
featuring a style of keeping to principles while being responsible
and flexible in her attempts to enhance foreign relations with
nations big and small, powerful and weak, across the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite the end of the Gold War, peace has by no means
prevailed, as conflicts in this decade have clearly shown.
</P>
<P>
"Differences in race, cultural traditions, ideology and levels
of economic development all threaten to destabilize the world
unless effective diplomatic work is done," said a local member of
the diplomatic corps. "But just realizing that these differences
and prejudices exist, and recognizing that they have triggered so
many conflicts in the past, goes a long way toward helping us
avert the ugly repetition of history," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report on international relations, Chinese new
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said that all major powers are
making great diplomatic efforts to build a variety of strategic
relationships and partnerships.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of new China's seventh foreign minister,
new-style international relations are guided by equality, mutual
benefit and respect, as well as non-confrontation, non-alliances
and non-exclusive. "These new-style international relations pay
attention to the existence of common ground and feature a flexible
attitude in handling any divergences," added Tang.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's diplomatic accomplishments in the past two
years in the setup of the strategic partnership between China and
the United States. Such a relationship, described as being
"globally significant" by James Sasser, U.S. Ambassador to China,
was boosted by the American president's visit to China in late
June.

<P>
Bill Clinton became the first serving U.S. president to visit
China since President George Bush in 1989. Clinton spent nine days
meeting leaders and ordinary Chinese. Meetings between Jiang Zemin
and Bill Clinton, carried out in a frank and open manner, and
broadcast on TV nationwide, covered a wide range of topics on
regional and international affairs, as well as human rights.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, Clinton reiterated that the U.S. administration
would observe the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. "the United
States does not support independence of Taiwan, nor `two Chinas',
or `One China, One Taiwan', or its entry into the United Nations
or any international organization composed by sovereign
countries," he told an audience in Shanghai while visiting the
city's library.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after rounds of high-level exchanges, either
bilateral or multilateral, long-term mutual beneficial and
cooperative relationship between China and the European Union, the
strategic coordinative partnership between China and Russia, and
the long-term stable good-neighbor friendly and cooperative
relations between China and Japan, have witnessed marked progress.
</P>
<P>
Traditional friendship between China and developing countries
has also been enhanced. On the first day of 1998, China forged
diplomatic ties with South Africa. Beijing and Pretoria finally
signed a joint communique after long negotiations. China also
resumed her ties with Central Africa and Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
On the home continent, Asia, where economic meltdown caused
much hardship, blunting the claws of once-fierce little tigers,
China made prompt responses to the crisis. As the Japanese yen
freefall made the regional economic crisis worse, China stood up
to the brunt of the storm and refused to devalue her currency,
thus avoiding a possible round of further devaluations throughout
Asia.
</P>
<P>
On future foreign affairs work, Minister Tang said that China's
diplomacy faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges as the
new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
"As long as China adheres to her independent foreign policy for
peace, while actively engaging in consultation and cooperation
with other countries on global stability, development and
security, China can open a new chapter in her diplomatic work," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Troops Recapture Strategic Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops won a major
victory Wednesday when they recaptured the northern strategic
town of Mankulam held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE).
</P>
<P>
In a major operation code named "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain
Victory), the troops have been advancing inch by inch since May 13
last year through the LTTE held territory to clear a 75 kilometer
supply route on the main South-North highway.
</P>
<P>
Mankulam is situated about 45 kilometres north of Vavuniya
town, from where the Jaya Sikuru operation commenced, and is
strategically located with Mullaitivu in the East and Mannar in
the West.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been using Mankulam as a hub with
fortified bunkers and defensive positions since they lost the
Jaffna Peninsula in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The thrust to recapture Mankulam town was launched on Sunday by
thousands of troops backed by armor, artillery and air strikes
while repelling a major rebel assault code named "Oyatha Alaigal"
(unceasing waves) on troops stationed at Kilinochchi, north of
Mankulam.
</P>
<P>
The military said that over 200 soldiers were killed in the
ongoing battles since Sunday and over 400 rebels were killed and a
large number of others injured.
</P>
<P>
However, on Thursday, reports reaching here from the north said
that the LTTE had handed over 400 bodies of soldiers killed in
battle at Kilinochchi and Paranthan. The rebels have admitted
losing 240 cadres in action.
</P>
<P>
In the confrontation troops were able to overcome fierce
resistance in battles to regain Mankulam. Those engaged in
operation Jaya Sikuru had been positioned around Mankulam for the
past several months. They had made previous attempts to regain
control of the town but fierce resistance on every occasion had
prevented them from doing so, according to local newspaper
reports.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday troops had captured both the southern and eastern
parts of the town by which time 62 soldiers had died in action.
The military placed the number of rebels killed at 100.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently both sides suffered heavy losses during the final
stages. However, exact figures of deaths and casualties are still
unavailable, informed sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels Wednesday attacked a defense line of
Kilicochchi district and will try to continue operations in the
district on a wide front. Jaya Sikuru troops were seeking to link
up with Kilinochchi troops. The link will result in an overland
main supply route to Jaffna Peninsula from Vavuniya areas,
according to the military.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting for a separate homeland for the minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east in a war which began in 1983.
some 55,000 people have been reportedly killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Hopes to Settle Traffic Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson wants to make
a settlement with two men who accuse him of assault following a
traffic accident, according to the report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
It is remained as a major obstacle for the former heavyweight
champion to regain a license to return the ring.
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Athletic Commission will rule on Tyson's effort to
return, and on Wednesday waited for reports from doctors who
examined Tyson at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston last
week.
</P>
<P>
After the reports were postponed by the doctors, the
commission delayed Saturday's licensing hearing. A date for the
new hearing probably won't be determined until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two Nevada boxing commissioners said they want to know what
happened in Maryland before they vote on giving Tyson a license,
and that made Tyson and his advisers are considering to seek a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will all be resolved before the hearing,"
Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said. "We're going to try to deal with it
before then."
</P>
<P>
Tyson refused to answer questions about the matter at his
September 19 hearing before the Nevada commission. But with
commissioners now saying they want answers before giving Tyson a
new license, the boxer's lawyers have begun negotiations on a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Richard Hardick, 50, says Tyson kicked him in the groin after
Hardick's car rear-ended a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife,
Monica, on August 31 in a Maryland suburb. Hardick and Abmielec
Saucedo, 62, who said Tyson punched him in the face, have filed
criminal complaints.
</P>
<P>
Hardick's attorney, Roger Titus, confirmed Wednesday that he
had talked to Tyson's lawyers about a possible settlement but
that no agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
"I have talked as I would in any case," Titus said. "In any
civil case, settlement is always a possibility."
</P>
<P>
Wald said clearing up this dispute means more to Tyson than
just a return of the license he lot for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears last year.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is still on probation from his rape conviction in Indiana
 and could conceivably be returned to prison if convicted of
another crime.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Ports Capable of Handling 3.4M Tons of Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's two ports and
internal transportation system are fully capable of handling 3.4
million tons of food, The New Nation daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The observation was made by experts of a World Food Program
(WFP) logistics team after spending four days in Bangladesh
examining the facilities and interviewing shipping authorities,
agents and ground personnel at Chittagong and Mongla ports.
</P>
<P>
Foodgrains are anticipated to arrive from the WFP, donor
countries and government and private purchases over the next
month.
</P>
<P>
"Our recommendation is that with good coordination of shipments
by food controllers and WFP experts, the ports will handle large
consignments without major difficulty," WFP team leader Tim Davies
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WFP will coordinate the massive food aid importation and
distribution to the neediest flood victims, its largest operation
in its history in terms of numbers of people to be fed, Davies
said.
</P>
<P>
The stream of imports began on September 19 with the arrival of
the WFP vessel "Golden Sun" carrying 5,000 tons of wheat, but the
real action in Bangladesh's ports will start this month.
</P>
<P>
The ten-week-long flood, which started early July in the
country and hit about two-thirds of the country's territory
affecting over 30 million people, damaged 1.3 million hectares of
paddy-field and paddy-seedlings, causing a loss of over two
million tons of rice. Besides this, the country has an annual
foodgrain shortage of about two million tons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government has appealed to donor countries and
international agencies for food aid. It has so far received
commitment of over one million tons of food aid from the U.S.
(400,000 tons), European Commission (175,000 tons), the WFP
(355,000 tons) and other donors.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both the government and private sectors will import
1.5 million tons of grains respectively to meet the food shortage,
and so the task of foodgrain transportation is heavy.

<HEADLINE> A Decade Of Development In China's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In a little more than a decade,
China's stock market has gone from a small sales counter to a
modern active stock market with a computer system handling about
10 million transactions most days.
</P>
<P>
The first stocks in China were sold in a 12-sq m. room on a
western part of Shanghai's Nanjing Road in 1986 that was
established by a trust company of the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
There were no computers and no screen flashing quotations then,
and the buying and selling of stocks was done with a verbal
agreement and chalked figures on a blackboard, with staff members
doing their work by hand at the small counter. There were only two
kinds of shares then and about 18 sold daily on average.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later, however, China's stock market has come to
represent one of the major emerging markets in Asia and there are
now two exchanges, one in Shanghai and the other in Shenzhen with
more than 800 companies listed. There are now A shares (for the
domestic market), B shares (for investors from overseas), and a
thriving bond market, and 34 million people investing in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchanges have a modern communications system and
on-line services to facilitate investments. And, the former sales
counter has been turned into a big company, the Shanghai
International Securities Company, the largest of its kind in
China.

<HEADLINE> 3 Vietnamese Drug Traffickers Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Vietnamese were sentenced to
death and two others to life-imprisonment for their involvement in
a drug trafficking ring Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accused were charged with trafficking of 12 kg heroin and
10.4 kg opium.
</P>
<P>
A three-day trial was conducted from Monday to Wednesday in
Ninh Binh, near the capital city of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Supreme People's Procuracy
delivered at the trial, the drug traffickers were involved in what
was termed a major drug syndicate with sophisticated connection to
two other big drug syndicates which were busted more than three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The report said these people have been involved in separate
sales of heroin and opium since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence receivers were Nnguyen Ngoc Phu, 40,
residing in Hanoi; Tran Van Kim, 43, a native of Ninh Binh's Kim
Son district; and Lo Kham Moi, 39, a resident in Quan Hoa district
of Thanh Hoa province.
</P>
<P>
Vu Van Vang, 40, and Le Dang Thong were sentenced to
life-imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers in Ho Chi Minh city reported that chief of
anti-drug police of Hai Phong port city, Vietnam's third largest
city, Nguyen Van Chinh and his wife fled two weeks ago with 6
billion VN Dong (428,500 U.S. dollars) of embezzled money.
</P>
<P>
Chinh, former deputy chief of Hai Phong criminal police, was
appointed to the post early this year. His position allowed him
and his wife to easily obtain credit from many individuals and
organizations "to do business", as they told the lenders, the
newspaper reports said.
</P>
<P>
When the loans amounted to 6 billion VN Dong, Chinh and his
wife "vanished into thin air," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing anti-drug police officer is now being hunted
nationwide by police.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will attend the 53rd
Joint Annual General Meeting of World Bank (WB) and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to be held soon in Washington, the Unitized
States.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar delegation will be headed by Minister of Finance
and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's attendance at the meeting came after the WB declared
recently Myanmar ineligible for new loans because it has not
repaid the outstanding ones.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government responded by postponing the repayment of
loans to the WB until it treats Myanmar like other members and
resumes lending.
</P>
<P>
The WB has suspended all loans to Myanmar since 1987, giving
the reasons that Myanmar is unwilling to modify the highly
distortional economic policies that the bank concludes have
created an environment in which external aid resources could not
be efficiently utilized.
</P>
<P>
The last joint annual meeting of the WB and IMF was held in
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been a member of the WB and IMF for 41 years.

<HEADLINE> Policy of Opening to World, A Driving Force of Chinese Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The policy of opening to the
outside world advocated by late leader Deng Xiaoping and carried
out by the the Chinese government over the past 20 years has
benefited most Chinese as individuals, and improving the economic
strength and international stature of their country.
</P>
<P>
At present, 17.5 million people have found generally well-paid
jobs in foreign-funded enterprises; a growing number of ordinary
people have US dollar accounts in the bank; and products they buy,
from bread, toothbrushes and shoes to elevators, televisions and
cars, are of far better quality than before.
</P>
<P>
Thanks partly to the presence of foreign businesses, which have
brought with them investment capital, technology and management
expertise, the Chinese economy has been able to grow at an annual
average rate of 9.8 percent since 1979 when the open policy began.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 1998, cumulative direct foreign investment
in China had reached 242.3 billion US dollars, marking it the
second biggest recipient of international investment money in the
world after the United States.
</P>
<P>
At present, about a quarter of a million of foreign-funded
enterprises are operating in China. They have distributed
themselves all over the country and are active in most business
spheres.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years, we have expanded areas open to foreign
investment," says Bao Kexin, an official of the State Development
Planning Commission. "Hot areas for foreign investment include
crop cultivation, aquaculture, mining, energy, transport, raw
materials production, project contracting, shipping agency,
retailing, foreign trade and insurance."

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, China's total imports and exports reached 325.1
billion US dollars, ranking it the 10th among the world's top
traders. China's dramatic rise as a trading nation is largely
attributed to its open policy. Last year, for example,
foreign-funded enterprises were credited with 46.9 percent of the
country's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 1998, China had foreign exchange reserves
of 140.5 billion US dollars, the second largest in the world,
after Japan's.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a series of policies the Chinese government has
adopted to reduce the affect on China's foreign trade brought
about by the Asian financial crisis, China's total foreign trade
in the first half of this year reached 151.4 billion US dollars in
value, up 5.2 percent over the same previous period. And the
country had a favorable trade balance of 22.6 billion during the
period.
</P>
<P>
While introducing foreign funds into China, many Chinese firms
are beginning to invest overseas. Chinese construction firms, for
examples, signed contracts worth 5.7 billion US dollars on
projects in foreign countries in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 300,000 Chinese engineers and workers now work
overseas implementing contracts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an increasing number of well-to-do Chinese have begun
to take holidays overseas, mostly in Southeast Asian countries and
Hong Kong -- a luxury no Chinese living on China's interior areas
dared to dream about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Future destinations are likely to be the United States and
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Eight High-tech Projects Clinched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of special guests
visiting China's "Silicon Valley" signed eight high-tech project
contracts yesterday, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives will span 250,000 square meters in the Beijing
Economic and Technological Development Zone (BETDZ).
</P>
<P>
The high-tech projects -- involving computer software,
refractory wire, and electronic media publishing systems -- will
generate 170 million U.S. dollars, said Hwang Jen, president of
Hong Kong Factory Owners Association, which represents Viagolel
Inc.
</P>
<P>
BETDZ and Viagolel established Silicon (China) Development Co
Ltd last year to lure investors from US-based Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
China Silicon Technology Park will be located at the starting
point of Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, 7 kilometers from the
Third Ring Road and 30 kilometers from Beijing Capital
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the zone began in 1992. It was among China's 32
state-level development regions in 1994.
</P>
<P>
BETDZ has attracted 1.43 billion U.S. dollars and 50 companies,
mostly foreign-funded firms and joint ventures, are doing business
in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of the world's 500 largest multinational companies
established factories in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Blueprints outline the zone's expansion to 15 square kilometers
by the end of 2010, and the BETDZ is expected to be 100 square
kilometers by the middle of the next century, said Zhao Yajuan, a
member of the zone's management staff.
</P>
<P>
In the January-August period this year, the zone attracted 67
foreign and domestic companies, which provided an infusion of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many manufacturing companies, pleased with their surroundings,
increased their investments.

<HEADLINE> Stability: Test and Treasure of China's Maturity (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu An'gang explains that, when the United States became
industrialized, it took 47 years for the country to double its
GDP, whereas it has just taken China just ten years, although he
acknowledged that influence of the global economy has accelerated
China's transition to date.
</P>
<P>
Hu says that the Chinese transition is realized under uneven
growth between the country's coastal and inland areas, a result of
which is uneven living standards and regional gap that could
threaten stability.
</P>
<P>
What is encouraging, he adds, is that the current Chinese
leaders "are quite aware of the national realities" and "are on
the alert to any signs that might erupt into chaos."
</P>
<P>
Hu set an example by saying that when the inflation rate peaked
at 24.7 percent in 1994, the Chinese government took effective
measures to tighten its financial policy and curb the scale of
capital construction. The country finally landed on a track of
high growth and low inflation. Inflation has been held down to
around six percent in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is taking a series of measures to settle
the issue of laid-off workers by launching re-employment projects
to create more job opportunities for this group of people.
</P>
<P>
Measures which have been taken to narrow the gap between
China's prosperous eastern coastal areas and underdeveloped
western inland regions are producing results. Investment in the
west exceeded that in the east for the first time in 1996, which
spurred up GDP growth in the west.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders and ordinary people are aware that China needs
stability to develop and prosper. An opinion poll conducted among
600 dwellers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou by the State
Statistical Bureau in March indicated that nearly 60 percent of
the respondents put the safeguarding of social stability at the
top of their wish list.

<HEADLINE> CNFTI Set Up in Line with Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China National Federation of the
Textile Industry (CNFTI) was inaugurated Wednesday in Beijing,
paving the way for the abolition of the State industrial watchdog,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Du Yuzhou, director
with the State Textile Industry Bureau, as saying that the
establishment of the federation complies with the rule of market
economy which requires that industrial associations play a key
role in production activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, Du's bureau, which has been slimmed
down from a pool of 280 employees to 80 in the state
administrative restructuring early this year, is expected to
become one department with the State Economic and Trade Commission
in three years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tiankai, chairman of CNFTI, said that it is time for the
association to co-ordinate industrial activities and companies'
disputes when direct government intervention cannot achieve sound
results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his federation will concentrate on how to serve
member companies and create a fair and orderly competitive
climate.
</P>
<P>
Wang's federation has more than 20 sub-associations, including
clothing, spindles and chemical fibers.
</P>
<P>
The administrative restructuring campaign aims to diminish
government intervention in the market and production activities,
largely by sacking employees of administrative bodies such as
those dealing with the chemical, metallurgical and non-ferrous
metals industries.
</P>
<P>
The CNFTI faces tough difficulties in dealing with the
loss-stricken textile sector, which has been chosen as the
flagship of the state-owned enterprise restructuring campaign.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, experiencing a five-year-long deficit, is
regarded as the most difficult sector to bail out.
</P>
<P>
The average asset-liability ratio among the state's textile
companies jumped as high as 82 percent. More than 40 percent of
companies are on the brink of bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Riders Banned for Eight Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Alex Zuelle, Armin Meier and
Laurent Dufaux were suspended for eight months and fined 3,000
Swiss francs (2,161 U.S. dollars) by the Swiss Cycling Federation
on Wednesday for their involvement in the Tour de France drugs
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The three Swiss were members of the Festina team that was
removed from the Tour de France after banned substances were
discovered in a team car at a check point on the Franco-Belgian
border days before the start of the classic in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Festina riders were expelled after team officials admitted
to systematic controlled administration of banned substances to
their riders.
</P>
<P>
International Cycling Union anti-doping regulations call for
suspensions of six to 12 months but the sport's governing body
had asked the federations to take into consideration the gravity
of the situation when handing out penalties.

<HEADLINE> Stability: Test and Treasure of China's Maturity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- It has become a shared view of
both leaders and ordinary people that China must remain stable to
develop, and it has been proved to be a truth by practice over the
past recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set up goal of achieving an eight
percent growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) and a low
inflation rate of below three percent this year -- despite the
financial crisis that has crippled one Asian economy after another
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs indicate
that Chinese exports reached 86.98 billion US dollars in value in
the first half of this year, up 7.6 percent over the corresponding
1997 period, while imports increased 2.2 percent to 64.42
billion. China has also acted as a steadfast economy by doggedly
refusing to devalue its currency, the Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
"This accomplishment can be attributed to a stable and healthy
macro-economy which we have maintained since the mid-1990," says
Liu Jiansheng, an analist with the Chinese customs.
</P>
<P>
"For four years in succession, China has been the second most
popular destination for foreign capital investors. By the end of
May this year, it had actually used 360 billion US dollars, of
which 220 billion US dollars were directly invested by foreign
businesses." Liu says that China is enjoying its best balance of
international payments in history.
</P>
<P>
Despite some pains such as the numerous laid-off workers
resulted from the reform of state-owned enterprises, China has
managed to "strengthen its stability" by overcoming "unstable
elements," says Hu An'gang, an expert on China's national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
This, Hu says, is "a remarkable achievement" of the 49-year-old
People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Yining, a noted Chinese economist, quite a few
unstable situations have arisen over China's "dual transition"
from a planned economy to market economy and from a traditional
agricultural society to a modern industrial society.
</P>
<P>
"Few countries have attempted to perform the two transitions at
the same time, as China is doing now," Li says. "This means China
is facing double the troubles."

<HEADLINE> Belgium Introduces Card System for Soccer Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- All soccer fans in Belgium
have to have their special fan cards that will entitle them to
the matches they want to root for, it was announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after Belgian Interior Minister Luc
van den Bossche approved the fan card scheme.
</P>
<P>
The fan card system will be in force starting on Thursday but
the new interior minister gave the country's soccer clubs another
four months to make their arrangement and adjustment before the
card-ticket system turns obligatory.
</P>
<P>
Only those with no serious offense at any soccer match in the
country's league tournament can get hold of fan cards.
</P>
<P>
Some critics believe that rioting at soccer matches is
expected to decrease in the wake of the introduction of the
card-ticket scheme in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Some matches in the country's league tournaments have marred
by rioting that sometimes ended up with injured fans from
opposing clubs.
</P>
<P>
The country has been debating whether to introduce the card
scheme in the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Spartak Beats Real Madrid in Champions' League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Spartak Moscow of Russia
displayed a spectacular performance at home with a 2-1 victory
over defending champion Real Madrid of Spain at the European
Champions'League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Spartak Moscow consolidated their leading place
in Group C.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Titov scored Spartak's winner with 12 minutes left,
leaving the Muscovites as the only team in this year's
competition with a 100 percent record after two games.
</P>
<P>
While there were also wins for Inter Milan, Barcelona, Ajax
Amsterdam and Arsenal on Wednesday, it is the less famous teams
who are currently setting the pace in the continent's major
soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
Of the six group leaders, only Barcelona (group D) are
established European powers.
</P>
<P>
Besides group C leaders Spartak, Greek side Olympiakos Piraeus
top group A, Turkey's Galatasaray lead group B and Germany's
Kaiserslautern head group F. Arsenal lead group E.
</P>
<P>
Last year's losing finalists Juventus endured their second
successive draw, while Bayern Munich scrambled a 2-2 draw with
Manchester United thanks to a late misjudgment from Peter
Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
On a wet pitch in the Russian capital Spartak put the skids
under Real Madrid with a spirited fightback.
</P>
<P>
The holders appeared set for their second group victory when
Raul headed them in front after 64 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Spartak captain Ilya Tsymbalar sparked the home side's
recovery with an equaliser seven minutes later and Titov grabbed
the winner from close in with 12 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Tsymbalar and Titov got both goals in Spartak's 2-0 win at
Sturm Graz two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"Spartak are a very good team," admitted Real's Dutch coach
Guus Hiddink. "I saw them dominate Ajax last season and we knew
it would be a tough match."
</P>
<P>
In Munich there was a minute's silence before Bayern's group D
game against Manchester United in tribute to those who died in
the 1958 air disaster.
</P>
<P>
But the Olympic stadium was soon abuzz with noise as Giovane
Elber put Bayern ahead from close range after only 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Dwight Yorke hauled United level on the half hour from David
Beckham's cross and four minutes after the interval Paul Scholes
shocked the home crowd by putting United ahead.
</P>
<P>
Elber spared Bayern a second embarrassing defeat following
their loss to Brondby a fortnight ago in the dying seconds after
Schmeichel failed dismally to reach a high ball.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff sidefooted home three minutes into
injury time to give Inter a much-needed 1-0 victory in Austria
over Sturm Graz.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who lost their opening group C match to Real
Madrid, were without key strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
"We won despite the fact we had important absentees," relieved
coach Gigi Simoni said. "The great thing about the team tonight
was their self-belief -- right to the bitter end."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Sonny Anderson was Barcelona's two-goal hero against
Brondby at the Nou Camp as Louis van Gaal's side won 2-0 to go
top of group D.
</P>
<P>
Anderson gave the Catalan side the lead after 42 minutes and
headed the clincher five minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
In group A Ajax earned a 2-1 home win over Porto of Portugal
thanks to Finn Jari Litmanen's 86th-minute penalty. The goal was
Litmanen's 24th for Ajax in Europe, taking him past Johan
Cruyff's club record.
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Rudy put the Dutch team in front after 57 minutes
before Porto equalised 12 minutes later through Zlatko Zahovic.
</P>
<P>
Central defenders Tony Adams and Martin Keown scored in the
second half at Wembley to give Arsenal a hard-fought 2-1 victory
over Panathinaikos in group E.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, with four points, lead group E by a point after
Dynamo Kiev's 1-1 draw at home to French side RC Lens.
</P>
<P>
In Norway Juventus, held 2-2 at home by Galatasaray a
fortnight ago, could only draw 1-1 with Rosenborg. Filippo
Inzaghi put Juventus in front in the 27th minute but Bent
Skammelsrud levelled with a 69th-minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos Piraeus sit proudly on top of group A on goal
difference after beating Croatia Zagreb 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Alexis Alexandris after 22 minutes and Sinica Gogic after 81
scored their goals.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray lead group B after seeing off visiting Athletic
Bilbao 2-1 in Turkey thanks to Romanian veteran Gheorghe Hagi's
90th-minute winner.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern will probably be disappointed only to have
drawn 0-0 at HJK Heslinki, but it was enough to put them top of
group F by a point after Benfica beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Manager Graham Cleared to Talk with Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Leeds have admitted defeat in
their battle to hang onto manager George Graham by giving him
permission to talk to Tottenham Spurs with a view to becoming
their new manager.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United spokeswoman Liz Dimitrijevic said on Wednesday
the Scottish manager would be allowed to discuss the move which
he favours because of personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the talks to take place almost
immediately,"she said. "The chairman has said the talks can go
ahead and compensation has been agreed (if the move goes ahead)."
</P>
<P>
Former Arsenal boss Graham is interested in making the move as
much of his family lives in the London area.
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: "We had a long chat with
George. George has said for domestic reasons that he wishes to
talk to Tottenham Hotspur...We had to allow him to talk."
</P>
<P>
Under Football Association rules, Tottenham were not allowed
to approach Graham unless permission was given by Leeds.
</P>
<P>
Graham is one of the most highly-paid managers in British
football. But he is not expected to have problems agreeing
personal terms with Tottenham who sacked Swiss Christian Gross in
September after a poor start to the season.
</P>
<P>
Graham, 53, told a Sunday newspaper he had been living on his
own for two years during his time at Leeds and was clearly not
happy about the situation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm engaged to be married and, while my fiancee has been very
supportive and understanding, if there is a chance of me going
back to London she will be ecstatic, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"My son, daughter and wee (small) grand-child live in London."
</P>
<P>
Graham, a cultured midfielder for Arsenal and Chelsea in the
1960s and 1970s, started his managerial career with Millwall in
1982. He moved to Arsenal in 1986 where he won two league titles
in a nine-year spell.
</P>
<P>
But he was sacked by Tottenham's north London rivals for
taking an illegal payment during a transfer. He was banned from
international football for a year in July 1995 but was signed by
Leeds in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> England Confident of Eurpean Match Against Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The English Football
Association has moved to quell fears that England's European
Championship qualifier with Bulgaria could be called off.
</P>
<P>
The match, which is scheduled for Saturday October 10, had
been thrown into doubt by an internal dispute in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
World football's governing body FIFA is threatening to expel
Bulgaria from international competition after the government
sacked leading members of the country's Football Association.
</P>
<P>
FIFA director of communications Keith Cooper said a deadline
of Thursday had been imposed for the sackings to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
"If they cannot come to an agreement, the Bulgarians know full
well that suspension from all international competitions will be
the consequence," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the close proximity of the England match is likely to
delay any sanctions FIFA choose to implement.
</P>
<P>
And the FA is going ahead with preparations for the match as
planned.
</P>
<P>
"We are in close communication with FIFA but at this moment in
time we are planning for the game as normal," said FA spokesman
Adrian Bevington.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that it will be business as usual," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Kurdish Factions to Meet in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the two major
Kurdish factions in northern Iraq will meet in Ankara next week to
discuss the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (KDP),
and Jalal Talabani, chairman of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), and Turkish officials will attend the meeting, Turkish
Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly press conference, Utkan said the upcoming talks are
the continuation of the Ankara peace process, which was launched
by Turkey with the support of the U.S. and Britain after the 1991
Gulf War, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The projected meeting comes after the two Kurdish groups signed
a U.S.-brokered pact on September 17 to end their rivalry in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western alliance set up a buffer zone in northern
Iraq for the Kurds after their rebellion against President Saddam
Hussein failed soon after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
But the two factions have since fought for the control of the
area. The pact unites them in the common goal of establishing an
elected government by summer 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, like Iraq, strongly opposes the creation of an
independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq, fearing that the move
will encourage the statehood aspirations of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting since 1984 for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara reacted to the KDP-PUK accord with an instant decision
to send an ambassador to Baghdad, the first since the Gulf War,
and accused the move of being detrimental to Iraq's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
By hosting the meeting of Kurdish faction leaders, it appeared
that Ankara wants to bring them into its fold and minimize the
impact of their accord, rather than alienate them, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the pact, the spokesman said that Turkey was
pleased with some parts of the agreement that both the KDP and PUK
will strive to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Iraq.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced the approval of two
concessional loans totaling 76.13 million U.S. dollars to support
electricity sector in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The program will improve the reliability and efficiency of
electricity supply, expand access to electricity, and prepare for
future connection to the Central American Electric Interconnection
System.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the resources will support the government's effort to
restructure the Empresa Nicaraguense de Electricidad and to
privatize or capitalize the distribution companies created as a
result of the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 87.66 million dollars.
Both are IDB loans, one for 46.13 million dollars and the other
for 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government of Norway is considering 2.5 million dollars in
cofinancing for the project. Local counterpart funds total 9.03
million dollars.

ANKARA -- Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals Wednesday decided
to approve the sentence of 4.7-year imprisonment for pro-Islamic
Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz was found guilty by the Ankara State Security Court
last October for both provoking religious enmity and providing
assistance to an outlawed armed gang.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the commemoration of "Al-Quds (Jerusalem)
Night" on January 31, 1997, Yildiz called for a Sharia-based
state system and this led to his removal four days later.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Develop New Mad Cow Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the
University of California in San Francisco have developed a new
way to detect the Mad-Cow-causing rogue proteins.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the October issue of the journal Nature Medicine,
they said their rapid test could ease consumer fears about eating
beef or other cattle products, and also help protect people from
having the rare form of this disease -- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
The technique used on hamsters so far would be applied to cow
brain tissue. It might give an answer in just eight hours. The
current standard technique needs months to detect low levels of
the prions in tissue. The test involves treating a tissue sample
with substances that unfold the prions. That exposes a section
that proteins called antibodies can grab onto, allowing the prions
to be detected.
</P>
<P>
The standard technique involves injecting tissue into the
brains of lab animals and waiting to see if the disease appears.

<HEADLINE> IDB Changes Lending Rates on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced changes in its lending
rates on the convertible-currency portion of loans from ordinary
capital for the second semester of 1998.
</P>
<P>
For outstanding balances of currency-pool adjustable rate loans
approved after January 1, 1990, the lending rate is 6.68 percent
per year in second half 1998 as against 6.62 percent per year in
the first semester.
</P>
<P>
The lending rate applicable to outstanding balances of
adjustable rate loans in U.S. dollars from the single currency
facility (SCF) is 6.98 percent. For loans denominated in German
marks the rate is 5.94 percent, for Japanese yen, 2.61 percent,
and for Swiss francs, 4.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
The previous SCF lending rates in effect, during first semester
1998, were U.S. dollars 6.99 percent, German marks 6.36 percent,
Japanese yen 3 percent and Swiss francs 4.31 percent.
</P>
<P>
A credit fee of 0.25 percent will be charged on all signed
undisbursed loans during second semester 1998 compared with the
full fee of 0.75 percent that was charged during first semester
1998.
</P>
<P>
The inspection fee of 1 percent will be waived during second
semester 1998. The full fee of 1 percent was charged during the
first semester.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Officials Urge Payment of U.N. Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Eleven former U.S.
administration officials called on Congress and the Clinton
administration Wednesday to pay U.S. arrears to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the officials said it was "time for us
to meet our legal obligation" to pay back dues of some 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars the U.S. owes to the U.N., now that the world body
had begun to reform its operations.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans-controlled Congress requires President Bill
Clinton to forbid family-planning funds for groups that lobby
foreign governments to ease anti-abortion laws. Clinton has turned
down that deal.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's statement made no mention of the abortion issue but
two signatories, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, made clear at a news
conference that they saw the two issues as unrelated.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that leaders of good faith in both the
administration and on the Hill (Congress) can agree to disagree on
and perhaps resolve it somewhere down the pike," Thornburgh said.
</P>
<P>
"But the pressing nature of the potential erosion of our
leadership role should dictate that this matter be treated
separately and as a priority before the year end," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton has also said the two issues are separate,
Thornburgh and Carlucci blamed both sides for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued at the news conference by the Wirthlin
Worldwide polling organization found that 80 percent of Americans
thought that payment of U.N. dues should not be linked to the
abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Acting Defense
Secretary William Taft and others also signed the statement.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Market Close Sharply Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- European shares plunged
Wednesday, led by banks, amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve's
interest rate cut Tuesday may not be enough to prevent a global
economic slump and a collapse in company earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
Any positive impact from the U.S. central bank's quarter point
cut was buried by a further stream of profit warnings and
analysts' downgrades of results forecasts on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
A slide in Japan's key Nikkei stock market average to its
lowest for more than 12 years and an early decline on Wall Street
added to the gloom.
</P>
<P>
Underlining concern about the deterioration in the global
economy, the International Monetary Fund revised its world growth
forecasts significantly for both 1998 and 1999, saying that the
new lower projections of 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent growth
respectively may be overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
A rise in French unemployment in August was the latest
indication that European economic growth is slowing.
</P>
<P>
Among benchmark stock market indices, Germany's Xetra DAX
closed down 3.68 percent, France's CAC-40 lost 4.17 percent to
reach its lowest levels since February 11 and Britain's FTSE 100
declined 0.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Ibex-35 tumbled 4.83 percent, Switzerland's SMI plunged
4.31 percent, Italy's Mibtel all-share index slipped 2.74 percent,
while the Dutch AEX index dropped 2.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.59 percent at
7,951.78 at the close of European trade.
</P>
<P>
Among the worst hit were European banks amid continued concern
about their exposure to the financial crises that have gripped
emerging markets and to the troubled U.S. hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
"Banks are facing pressure from several fronts," Reuters quoted
one dealer at a major Spanish bank in Madrid as saying. "There's
Asia, Russia, Latin American markets, and now fears of a recession
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
In London, the benchmark FTSE 100 stock index closed at 5,064.4
points, down 44.3 or 0.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed at 4,474.51 points, down
103.76 or 2.27 percent. In later screen-based trade the Xetra DAX
index ended at 4,430.91 points, down 169.42 or 3.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, bank stocks dragged the Paris blue-chip share index
below 3,200 for the first time since mid-February, as the sector
took a beating over renewed emerging markets worries and bore the
brunt of disappointment over a 0.25 percent U.S. rate cut. The
CAC-40 index closed at 3,197.95 points, down 139.1 or 4.17
percent.
