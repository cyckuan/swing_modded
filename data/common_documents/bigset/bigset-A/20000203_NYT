EDITORIAL: THE MYSTERY OF FLIGHT 261 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Feb. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 is the latest in a
stream of ocean crashes _ the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long
Island in 1996, the Swissair crash off the Canadian coast in 1998,
the EgyptAir plane crash off the Massachusetts coast last year and,
just this past Sunday, the Kenya Airways disaster near the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 dropped into the sea near Los Angeles shortly after
the pilots reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, the
device on the tail that helps control the plane's pitch. The
stabilizers on the MD-80 series of planes _the kind of aircraft
used on Flight 261 _ were the subject of a Federal Aviation
Administration directive last May calling for inspections of
possible corrosion, though whether that is relevant to this
accident is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have begun interviewing witnesses,
reviewing radar records and searching for the flight recorders that
now lie in waters 700 feet deep. The aircraft involved has a solid
safety record. Alaska Airlines also has a good safety record, with
only two other fatal accidents in its history, though it has been
under a federal investigation for improper maintenance practices
involving two planes.
</P>
<P>
   The recent high-profile crashes do not change the fact that
commercial aviation remains an exceptionally safe means of
transportation. But public anxiety is perhaps unavoidable because
the mechanics of flight remain to many people a bit of a mystery.
The mystery only deepens when something causes a plane to fail.

VODAFONE, STOCK PRICE RISING, PRESSES MANNESMANN TALKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT _ Faced with the near certainty of succumbing to a
$160 billion hostile takeover against Vodafone AirTouch PLC,
Mannesmann AG continued to negotiate Wednesday for a peaceful
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, remained in Duesseldorf,
Mannesmann's hometown, as negotiators for the two companies worked
past midnight on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are talks under way,'' Gent told the German television
network NTV tonight. People close to Mannesmann said the talks were
still about the price, but those differences have narrowed because
the value of Vodafone's all-stock offer has surged as a result of
the rise in Vodafone's own share price.
</P>
<P>
   So negotiators have been focusing instead on comparatively
technical management and structural issues. Mannesmann's embattled
chief executive, Klaus Esser, scheduled a meeting of the company's
supervisory board for Thursday afternoon though it was unclear
whether a deal would be ready by then.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann has sought a deal that could be presented as a merger
of equals. Until recently, Esser had been insisting that Mannesmann
shareholders receive more than 50 percent of the shares in the
combined company. Vodafone, which has a larger market
capitalization than Mannesmann, is offering 47.2 percent but has
said it would sweeten the offer to 49 percent if Esser agreed to a
friendly deal.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Esser has almost no room for maneuver. Vodafone shares,
which climbed nearly 7 percent in London trading Wednesday to 3.855
pounds, are now so high that its all-stock offer for Mannesmann is
worth 342 euros a share or $333.69 at current exchange rates. That
is more than twice the price that Mannesmann shares traded at six
months ago and is virtually equal to the level of 350 euros a share
that Esser had contended reflected the true' value for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shares, meanwhile, soared again Wednesday for the
third consecutive day. climbing 9.7 percent, to 325 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the extraordinary surge in Mannesmann shares
reflected a nearly universal conviction by investors that Vodafone
would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, people close to Mannesmann say that Esser is prepared to
resign as chief executive and has no interest in remaining with the
company if Vodafone takes control.
</P>
<P>
   Esser has come under intense pressure from some members of
Mannesmann's supervisory board, as well as from his own
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Board members like Henning Schulte-Noelle, the chairman of the
insurance conglomerate Allianz AG, and Juergen E. Schrempp,
chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, have been pushing Esser to accept a
friendly deal.
</P>
<P>
   Esser's dwindling hopes of retaining a majority of shareholders
were all but shattered on Sunday, when Vodafone negotiated a new
alliance with Vivendi SA, the French media and utilities group.
</P>
<P>
   That move derailed Esser's own hopes of negotiating a merger
with Vivendi, which would have given Mannesmann control of France's
second largest wireless network as well as a major stake in Canal
Plus SA, Europe's biggest pay-television company.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Berg, the head of Mannesmann's core telecommunications
group, confirmed Wednesday what people close to the companies
indicated more than a week ago: that Mannesmann had hoped to
negotiate a full merger with Vivendi until it was outmaneuvered by
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Had Esser been able to at least announce an agreement in
principle with Vivendi, he could have laid claim to control of
wireless networks covering more than two-thirds of Europe's
population _ in Germany, Italy, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not enough, Vodafone and Vivendi also appeared
poised to unravel Esser's other major defensive initiative: a major
alliance with America Online's European business.
</P>
<P>
   Esser has been feverishly negotiating a deal in which he would
acquire part of Bertelsmann AG's 50-percent stake in AOL Europe.
But Wednesday, Vivendi announced that it was in talks with AOL
Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
   American depository receipts of Vodafone _ each representing 10
shares of the British company _ rose $4.125, or 7 percent, to $63
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in Vodafone shares suggests that many investors
and analysts accept Gent's vision of the benefits that will come
when his company controls Mannesmann. As a result, analysts have
raised their projections for both Vodafone and Mannesmann. Andrew
Moffat, telecommunications analyst with ABN Amro in London, said
Vodafone shares have received an added boost from a technical
side-effect of the merger. If Vodafone acquires Mannesmann, its
weight within FTSE index of leading British stocks would rise from
6 percent to 12 percent. That would then trigger heavy buying from
investment funds that reflect the index.

FAMILIES, FRIENDS PAINFULLY ACCEPT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the search for Flight 261 survivors abandoned, families of
the 88 passengers and crew prepared to visit the crash site in
hopes of easing their grief.
</P>
<P>
   They included Fred Ost, who traveled from Skokie, Ill., to be
closer to where five relatives died Monday when the ill-fated
Alaska Airlines flight plunged into the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have been too much. For it to be five - I cannot
even describe it,'' said a tearful Ost, 47. ``I want to go out on a
boat and reflect, remember and place a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines will help bus families to the shore Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to be doing is promoting silence, a moment of
prayers, a moment of thought of those families and friends,'' said
John Kelley, the airline's chief executive officer. A memorial is
scheduled for Saturday, at a time and place to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of their tremendous losses began to set in,
family members braced Wednesday for the grim task of working with
coroners' investigators to identify loved ones. In a private
meeting with about 100 people, investigators said they would ask
families for dental records, hair samples and other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying,'' said Greg Ford, a brother-in-law
of one victim, Bob Ost, 39, a San Mateo firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Ost was killed with his wife, Ileana; their 4-month-old
daughter, Emily; Ost's mother, Jean Permison, 73, of Scotts Valley;
and her companion of 10 years, Charles Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The five had gone to Puerto Vallarta last week to celebrate
Permison's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my mom's 73rd birthday, and Bob thought it would be
nice to take her and Charlie away for a couple of days,'' said
Janis Ost Ford, 36, Permison's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said she expected her mother to return in time for a
birthday dinner Tuesday with Russell. Instead, she grieved their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is going to make me a different person. Our life
is going to be very different from now,'' she said in between
floods of tears at her hotel room. ``I just want to know that our
family members didn't suffer and it was fast. To lose your family
nembers, you always think this stuff happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis Ford said closure will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with kids all the time and I'm up all the time, but I
don't feel a smile in here,'' she said, holding the edges of her
mouth with her hands. ``And I miss my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim in the crash, Renato Bermudez, was described as a
well-liked firefighter whose mother had recently bought a house in
Granada Hills. He was heading home from a visit to his girlfriend,
who was spending the winter near Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Francisco, Bermudez was named Firefighter of the
Year in 1999 for rescuing an elderly man from the second floor of a
burning building in the Mission District on July 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a passionate, literate man who loved his work and was
proud of the team he was part of,'' said Jim Gallagher, a retired
firefighter who worked with Bermudez. ``He used to volunteer his
time training other firefighters and trainees in a running program
we had in Golden Gate Park.'' &QL;

 JET STABILIZER MAY BE KEY   
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL and Peter Corbet  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Potential problems with hori zontal stabilizers
emerged Wednesday as a common thread in at least three cases
involving MD-80 aircraft, including Mon day's fatal crash of Alaska
Air lines Flight 261 off California.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer, at the rear of the craft, which helps a plane
fly level, was cited as a potential problem:
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday morning's emergency landing of a Dallas-bound
American Airlines flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor Interna tional
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar emergency land ing nearly a year ago of an Alaska
Airlines flight at Fair banks International Airport, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier flight of the Alaska Airlines MD-83 that crashed
this week in the ocean near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investigators with the National Transportation
Safety Board recovered one of Flight 261's flight recorders. Offi
cials said they will expand their probe of Flight 261 to check
reports that the horizontal stabi lizer was a problem on the air
craft's earlier flight to Mexico. That flight carried a different
crew and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, NTSB officials Feb. 3 plan to examine the
flight-data boxes aboard American Air lines Flight 1538, which made
an emergency landing at Sky Har bor after the pilots reported
problems with the stabilizer trim. The crew members also will be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots on that Phoenix-to-Dallas flight said they were hav
ing intermittent problems with the stabilizer trim at 8:20 a.m.,
shortly after leaving Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency was declared when the aircraft was at 13,000 feet,
said NTSB spokesman Phil Frame. The flight returned to Sky Harbor
and landed safely at 9:03 a.m., Frame said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 59 passengers and six crew members. The passen gers
were placed on another plane.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident has par allels to a Feb. 5 emergency
landing at Fairbanks Interna tional Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the pilot of an MD-82 owned by Alaska Airlines had
trouble getting the plane's nose to rise on takeoff, according to a
preliminary NTSB report. However, after using an ``exces sive
amount'' of pressure on the control that lifts the nose, the plane
was able to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot declared an emer gency in flight and touched down at
Anchorage, complaining that the elevator control was ``slug gish
and slow to respond to control inputs.''
</P>
<P>
   That flight, carrying 138 pas sengers and crew, ended un
eventfully. The NTSB is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Although there seems to be a link, aviation experts cautioned
against a rush to condemn the horizontal stabilizer. Until more is
known, it is difficult to pin aircraft problems on one part.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 series jets have two engines attached to the fuse lage
near the tail. The models, depending on configuration, usu ally
carry 144 to 152 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody has jumped on this stabilizer issue like a
duck on a June bug,'' said Bill Waldock, director of the Center for
Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aviation Uni versity in
Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a functioning sta bilizer, a plane can fly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the speculation is the fact that the stabilizer, as part
of the airplane tail, is subject to a Federal Aviation
Administration inspection order.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1999 directive orders operators of the MD-80 series of
planes to inspect them for signs of corrosion around the hinges
that connect parts of the plane's tail. Inspections must be com
pleted by November.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, FAA spokes man Paul Turk said it is unlikely that
the FAA would move up the inspection deadline, unless there was
some serious reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Waldock said the last time the FAA changed a directive to an
emergency order was 20 years ago, when a DC-10 crashed at Chicago.
The order grounded ev ery DC-10 in the nation for more than two
weeks, causing huge financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Waldock said until more is known about the emergency landing
Wednesday at Sky Har bor, it's hard to say what role, if any, the
horizontal stabilizer played.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines pilot may have been very cautious, a
normal reaction after a crash, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think back to Swissair, we had a whole lot of people
turning back because they were smelling smoke,'' Waldock said.
Swissair Flight 111 filled with smoke and crashed in the Atlan tic
Ocean off Nova Scotia in 1998, killing 229.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months after the Swissair crash, there were
more flights turning back due to smoke complaints than had been
registered in the previous three years. &QL;

TROJANS LEANING ON FIVE PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One starter averaged seven minutes per game last
season. Another barely hit 30 percent of his shots from the field
in conference games. A third struggled just to be the best player
on his high school basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   And almost all of them were either ignored or lightly recruited
by what most would consider the major college basketball schools.
</P>
<P>
   But USC has managed to stun skeptics by clinging to a share of
first place in the Pacific-10 Conference with five players and
little else. How much longer the Trojans (13-6, 6-1) will stay
among the Pac-10's elite is unknown, but few observers thought they
could get this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably figure we'll crack at any moment, but
I don't think it'll happen any time soon,'' shooting guard Jeff
Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   If there are skeptics, it might be for the fact USC has
basically become a five-man team since leading scorer Sam Clancy
(broken foot) and top reserve Jarvis Turner (broken ankle) went
down two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby played his starters 39 minutes against
Oregon State last Saturday, waiting until 57.2 seconds remained
before making his first substitution.
</P>
<P>
   It might sound crazy to think five players could survive the
final 11 conference games, but other Pac-10 coaches are not ready
to write off the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is five players,'' Arizona State coach Rob Evans
said. ``If you take a look at most people's rosters, most play five
guys with maybe a sixth or a seventh getting a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   So who are these five guys, who are relatively unknown outside
the lightly populated world of USC basketball fans? Here's a look
at the players with whom USC is making its unlikely run toward the
NCAA Tournament:
</P>
<P>
   JEFF TREPAGNIER
</P>
<P>
   The 40-inch vertical leap aside, the 6-foot-4 Trepagnier is
making an impact this season with his defense, notably his 3.8
steals per game (second-best in the nation), and his rebounding
(6.7 per game).
</P>
<P>
   Another second-tier player in high school, he was plucked by
Bibby away from schools like Washington State and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a kid who couldn't make a jump shot to save his life but
never stopped shooting,'' Bibby said. ``That's good. You can't
teach athleticism, but you can teach shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff might take some bad shots, but he will make it up with a
deflection or a tip or a steal. The kid basically plays hard every
night. I can't complain about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier's shooting has sometimes been a sore spot, but in
Pac-10 play, he's made 7 of 15 3-pointers. And he hasn't lost his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was relieved to hit all three of his 3-point shots
against Oregon State last week, Trepagnier said: ``It really didn't
matter because I was going to keep shooting anyways.''
</P>
<P>
   BRANDON GRANVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Although the injury to Clancy was viewed as devastating because
he led the Trojans in scoring and rebounding, the one player USC
relies on most is the 5-9 Granville.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one player they simply cannot afford to lose for
any reason,'' Pac-10 TV analyst Dan Belluomini said.
</P>
<P>
   Granville runs USC's offense and is averaging 40.1 minutes in
conference play, including one overtime game. He has six
double-doubles this season and nine double-digit assists
performances.
</P>
<P>
   When Bibby offered him a scholarship two years ago, he was
mulling offers from West Coast Conference schools such as Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been inspiring about this team is other guys besides
Scalabrine are getting better,'' Bibby said. ``Brandon Granville is
better than last year. He had 21 points and 11 assists against
Oregon State. He didn't have too many games like that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also shooting 40 percent this season, after a disastrous
30.2 in Pac-10 play last season.
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN SCALABRINE
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans had a go-to guy, it would be the 6-9 Scalabrine.
But even he was barely recruited out of high school and attended
junior college in Washington. He committed to USC before most major
colleges were able to figure out he was a big-time player. He has
been the heart of the team since Clancy's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see now is what you will see 10 years from now from
Brian Scalabrine,'' Bibby said. ``Brian Scalabrine plays as hard as
he can play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his scoring and rebounding, Scalabrine provides
invaluable help for point guard Granville because his dribbling
skills are impressive for a post player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalabrine is a good ballhandler,'' Oregon State coach Eddie
Payne said. ``I think you can try to press them some, but I don't
think that will have the desired effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine has also improved an aspect of his game, making 47
percent of his 3-pointers this season.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID BLUTHENTHAL
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the 6-7 forward could barely crack USC's rotation,
averaging 7.2 minutes a game, which placed him behind nine other
players. Bibby said he should have redshirted him, and he was the
one player last season who didn't get a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   But Bluthenthal has recovered nicely from a lackluster freshman
year and made huge strides in Pac-10 play. He rarely takes poor
shots and is USC's third-leading scorer (15.7 points) in conference
games.
</P>
<P>
   His turning point probably came two weeks ago, when he tied a
school record with 28 rebounds against Arizona State, and followed
up two nights later with a career-high 26 points against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids sometimes need one or two breakout games to get their
game going,'' Bibby said. ``His last four or five games have been
his best games.''
</P>
<P>
   NATE HAIR
</P>
<P>
   This is where USC's season really gets strange. Last year, the
6-4 Hair didn't even make the Orange County All-Area team after an
inconsistent senior season at Capistrano Valley High. He then
suffered a stress fracture in his knee during the fall and Bibby
considered it doubtful he would play this season.
</P>
<P>
   He was a little-used substitute before seizing an opportunity
after injuries devastated the Trojans. In the two Oregon games last
weekend, Hair averaged 13.5 points, five rebounds and 3.5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he had the ability,'' Trepagnier said. ``We just told
him to just keep shooting it. But I thought he was going to
redshirt. He thought he would redshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair isn't afraid to shoot, but he also understands his role on
the team, which means not forcing bad shots but taking open
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my job is, I'm the fifth option,'' Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   On this Trojan team, that's as good as saying the final option.

BIG RECRUITING DAY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul Hackett was more excited Wednesday than he
had been on his two previous signing days as USC's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   And he had reason to be, if you listen to the recruiting
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC looks like they're going to win the Pac-10,'' said Rick
Kimbrel, e ditor of PrepStar recruiting magazine. ``They're No. 1
in the Pac-10 without question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans signed 17 players to national letters of intent,
along with three junior college players who have already enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' Hackett said. ``The coaches did a
fabulou s job of finishing. I think that's what was different than
a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   USC won several late battles, getting Mater Dei of Santa strong
safety Matt Grootegoed, who had UCLA as his No. 2 choice, and
Harvard-Westlake tight end Alex Holmes, who had been considering
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' class could be even better, but they were still
waiting for Mira Mesa of San Diego linebacker Amon Gordon and
quarterback Teyo Johnson to make their decisions. Neither player is
expected to announce before next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was already gushing about the impact Holmes and
Grootegoed would make next season.
</P>
<P>
   On Grootegoed: ``We have needed a signature leader in the
defense. This guy is the ideal football player in my mind. The way
he plays the game will affect our entire football team. This was a
guy we had to get.''
</P>
<P>
   On Holmes: ``I think Holmes will challenge (starter) Antoine
Harris for playing time and puts USC in a two tight-end offense
much, much, more than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett even said USC could go to a three tight-end offense with
Woodlan d Hills Taft signee Gregg Guenther also in the mix for
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   For immediate impact, though, the player who could make the
quickest splash is cornerback Chris Cash of Palomar College. Cash
is already tentatively slated to start at cornerback, with starter
Kris Richard lik ely to move to free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Chris Cash was the best corner in the nation,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also added a vital wide receiver in Oxnard Hueneme's
Keary Colbert. With not much else besides their three freshman
receivers returning, Colbert will get plenty of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   This class also included five offensive linemen and three
defensive linemen, areas Hackett said have been shorthanded for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a huge step to build the lines here at USC,'' Hackett
said. `` We did what I said two years ago was so important -- to
build a foundation on the offensive and defensive lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of the line is Anaheim Servite tackle Joe McGuire,
which one service listed as its No. 1 prospect in the state at any
position.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a downside, it was that USC signed only one
tailback, Chris Howard of Wilmington Banning, after Hackett said
the position would be his No. 1 priority a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we would have liked another runner. It's more of a
premium fo r next year,'' Hackett said. ``But I'm very excited
about Chris. We're loo king at who's going to be the future guy
running the football.''
</P>
<P>
   USC lost out on getting tailbacks Marcus Houston (Colorado) and
Maurice Morris (Oregon) in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   One player who did not show up on USC's list of signees is
defensive tackle Sagan Atuatasi of Los Alamitos. Atuatasi is
currently attending Cypress College and has reaffirmed his
commitment, but he is not require d to sign a letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   With every high school recruit a Southern California native,
Hackett sai d he would scale back further on national recruiting,
after trying to recr uit in Florida, Louisiana and Texas the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans are expected to add another junior-colleg e
recruit to complete this class. . . . Wide receiver Troy Garner of
Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks will take a medical redshirt,
Hackett said, because of a knee injury suffered last spring. . . .
Tight end Jacob Rog ers has been switched to offensive line while
defensive back Sandy Fletcher has been moved to wide receiver.

U.S. STILL SAILING UPHILL AGAINST PRADO'S SECRET
WEAPONWQILWQILIHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ A forecast 15-knot westerly breeze
failed to materialize on Thursday, forcing the cancellation of Race
7 in the Louis Vuitton finals between San Francisco's America One
syndicate and Italy's Prada Challenge. The five-of-nine series to
select the next America's Cup challenger remains tied at three
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Racing is scheduled to resume on Friday under fresh 15-20 knot
southwesterlies.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, Paul Cayard's America One team will continue to
compete against the well-heeled Italian squad _ backed by the
fortune of the Prada fashion magnate Patrizio Bertelli _ under a
distinct disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi once expressed his disdain for the forward pass
as a simple matter of percentages. When you lofted the pigskin
downfield, he reasoned, three things could happen and two of them _
an interception or an incompletion _were bad.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in a series that has thus far been defined by how each
team reacts when they hoist their spinnakers for the downwind legs,
several scenarios have transpired when the so-called kites went
skyward, and many of them have had disastrous consequences. Botched
takedowns, questionable tactics, exploding fabric: all three snafus
have turned the tide in this maddeningly close series where one
mistake has often been one too many.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have a weapon in their arsenal, however, that in
most situations give them an upper hand on the downwind legs: a
super-strong cloth from which their spinnakers are constructed
called Cuben-fiber.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric, a high-tech composite weave of Spectra and Mylar
materials, took its name from Bill Koch's America Cubed syndicate,
which developed the fabric during its winning America's Cup defense
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough, versatile and expensive, and it gives the Italians
not only a deep sense of reassurance but a tactical edge as well.
Comparatively speaking, Cayard's spinnakers _ he carries two types,
some of which are built of nylon, some of polyester _ are to
Cuben-fiber what paper towels are to terry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   The proof has been underscored time and again during the nearly
four-month-long qualifying series. In that span, the Italians have
torn one or two spinnakers. The Americans have gone through at
least eight, including three thus far in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, Cuben-fiber gives the Italians the ability to sail
higher angles to the breeze when sailing downwind, knowing that if
the Americans follow they stand a good chance of blowing out their
sail because of the increased pressure. And if the sail goes, all
too often the chances of victory go as well.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Italians have cornered the current market on
Cuben-fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard couldn't get his hands on the magic material even if he
could afford it. ``My understanding of it is that for their heavy
spinnakers they've got basically exclusive access to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their kites cost around sixty or seventy grand each,'' he
added. ``They bought all the production of that cloth for this
period even though it's probably more than they need. They just
basically took it out of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's spinnakers cost about a third of those built from
Cuben-fiber. But Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis feels his sails
are a bargain. ``It's expensive, sure,'' he laughed. ``But if you
can save by buying one instead of six or seven, it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans got the last laugh in Race 6, however, when the
Italians botched a spinnaker takedown at a critical moment for the
second straight race and the sail wrapped around the rudder, giving
Cayard his critical opening in a wild comeback victory which
completed a surge from a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally ripped a bulletproof $70,000 spinnaker,'' he
said. ``And the bad news for them is that when one of those
spinnakers gets wrapped around the rudder, they don't come off.
Ours would fall off like toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard was also grinning when he made that observation. But if
the weathermen call for more breeze, and the forecast says they
will, America One's supporters will continue to hold their
collective breath when their crew's spinnakers are hauled aloft and
snap full in the gusty air.

BRUINS COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in three years, signing day at
UCLA did not include a string of superlatives, a top-five ranking
or program-alteringtalent. In other words, the class of 2000 is a
step below those of 1998 and 99 - if not in quality then certainly
in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had 18 scholarships available and signed just 14
players. That's not necessarily a problem - the roster's loaded
with underclassmen - and it might be a blessing. With 12 seniors
next season, the four remaining scholarships will be applied
towards Signing Day 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We easily could have signed 18, but we decided not to go after
a bunch of guys that would be fill-ins,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they signed several prep all-somethings to fill
pressing needs at defensive back (Ben Emanuel), receiver (Tab
Perry) and punter (Chris Kluwe). Other top prospects include
LaMirada offensive lineman Paul Mociler, Carlsbad linebacker
Brandon Chillar and Saugus fullback Patrick Norton. When the
recruiting ink dries, it seems, UCLA's class probably will stand as
one of the 25 best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been better. The Bruins had 14 commitments
secured weeks ago, then failed to land four top players in the
final days:
</P>
<P>
   - Denver tailback Marcus Houston, brother of UCLA sophomore
Lovell, who signed with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   - Sherman Oaks defensive end Travis Johnson, who signed with
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   - North Hollywood tight end Alex Holmes, who chose the immediate
playing time available at USC. (The Bruins return their top-three
tight ends, Gabe Crecion, Bryan Fletcher and Mike Seidman.)
</P>
<P>
   - Santa Ana safety Matt Grootegoed, who picked USC after hinting
for months that he'd sign with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players UCLA got are definitely of good quality, but they
only got 14 of them,'' said Greg Biggins, a recruiting expert for
Student Sports Magazine. ``They're usually trying to find
scholarships. This year, they couldn't give them away. They're
probably still a top-20 class, but they didn't finish very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo attributed the unused scholarships to selective
recruiting and the highly-ranked 1998-99 classes. In addition,
receiver Brian Poli-Dixon and cornerbacks Jason Bell and Marques
Anderson will muddle the depth chart after redshirtng in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all was said and done, some (recruits) were scared off,''
Toledo said. ``I'm a little surprised because I thought we'd get
somebody (in the final weeks), but they were all high-profile guys
and you're not going to get them all. They see who's on the team
and who has committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins did not sign a quarterback or a defensive lineman,
long their weakest unit but now a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   They also lost Long Beach City College defensive end Scott
Parkhurst, who chose Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him there were some classes he needed to take, and he
wasn't willing to take them,'' Toledo said.

COLD RICE A GOOD RECIPE FOR FOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glen Rice's minutes and production are decreasing.
Rick Fox's minutes are increasing. Rice seems at odds with coach
Phil Jackson, and at times, with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, the Rice trade rumors are heating up again.
</P>
<P>
   That last fact might have nothing to do with the others, but the
timing is hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Laker officials, both publicly and privately, continue to insist
Rice will not be traded, even though he might walk away as a free
agent this summer. But speculation around the league the last few
days has Rice being offered to Chicago for Bulls forward Toni Kukoc
or to Philadelphia for second-year guard Larry Hughes and forward
Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As per usual, the Lakers are not commenting.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing unclear about what's happening on the
court. In two straight games, Rice has struggled early and been
benched late. He made just 3 of 14 field-goal attempts in those
games, both Lakers losses.
</P>
<P>
   Rice expressed irritation at not getting scoring chances Sunday
at Houston. Jackson responded that Rice perhaps ``didn't deserve''
the scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackson sat Rice for the entire second and fourth quarters
Tuesday at San Antonio. He played just 23 minutes, his
second-lowest total this season, and the fewest minutes he's played
in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Lakers need to keep Rice as a third scorer behind
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, he's failing in that role. Rice
finished with five points at Houston and seven points at San
Antonio _ the first time this season he's failed to score in double
digits in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox _ who could regain a starting job if Rice is
traded _ is getting longer stints on the court. He's still playing
less than 20 minutes per game, but Jackson is now playing Fox for a
quarter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have helped Fox's game. He played the first nine
minutes of the second quarter Sunday and got six points en route to
an 11-point game (his first double-digit total in 14 games). He
played all but one minute of the second quarter Tuesday and came up
with four points, two assists, a steal and a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Scoring) grooves in short minutes come and go,'' Fox said.
``And wanting to contribute in some fashion while I'm out there has
always been the focus. Unfortunately, we haven't as a team been
playing the way we've been capable of playing, and that's more
frustrating than anything. So, glad to be out there but I'd like to
see a better outcome for us as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Respite: Jackson gave the Lakers, losers of six of their last
nine games, the day off Wednesday, musing that perhaps they needed
time away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   They'll try to avoid their first three-game losing streak of the
season when they play host to the Utah Jazz on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of in a rut,'' O'Neal said. ``We're not
playing well, we're not hitting shots, we're not playing good
defense, so we just have to look in the mirrors at our individual
selves and just pick it up.... But I'm not worried.''

 N.H. WIN BOOSTS MCCAIN COFFERS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Money, the lifeblood of a politi cal campaign, came gushing in
to Sen. John McCain's presidential bid at a record pace Wednesday
on the strength of his huge victory in New Hampshire's Re publican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions were expected to total $500,000 within 24 hours of
the Arizona senator's 19 percent age-point drubbing of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, said Wes Gullett of Phoenix, deputy campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ease of credit card giving over the Internet,
donations flowed faster, reached a higher total and came from a
wider range of sources than ever before in a presidential race,
McCain's campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director at
McCain's national headquar ters in Alexandria, Va. ``It's in
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   The donations likely will prove to be worth an additional
$300,000 in federal matching funds, Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Response was immediate'' af ter the magnitude of the victory
became clear shortly after polls closed, Schnur said. ``We raised
$20,000 in the first hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 5,000 visitors to the Web site signed up throughout
the day as volunteers in the campaign, swelling the ranks of 72,000
grass-roots supporters by 7 percent, Schnur and Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to presidential poli tics 2000,'' beamed Doug Cole,
McCain's press secretary in Ari zona. ``This is a new era. You can
have a major political event and have that type of immediate
interactive response.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume of traffic on the Web site, www.mccain2000.com, was
so heavy Wednesday that it overloaded and shut down one of the five
computers feeding the Web site across the Internet, Cole said. A
backup computer was pressed into service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of more conven tional fund-raisers, such as
$1,000-a-plate dinners in several major cities, also are in the
works for McCain. But some events will have an additional twist or
two. Satellite television hookups to similar gatherings in other
cities are planned, and some will feature transmissions over the
Internet to supporters who pay $100 for a password to log on to the
Webcasts, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Internet fund-raising had been running at about $10,000
a day through mid-De cember, Gullett said, and totaled about $1.5
million by the time of the pivotal New Hampshire pri mary. That
means the total leaped by about one-third in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Other McCain staff members had been more skeptical than Gullett
about the power of the Internet but now have realized its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schnur said, ``we haven't figured out anything that Ama
zon.com didn't figure out a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has attracted the most money of any presidential
candidate, has received $260,000 over the Internet throughout the
campaign, spokesman Scott Mc Clellan said in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush's setback Tuesday night had triggered any
change in the pattern of giving, McClellan said, ``We're continu
ing to receive strong support from people across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which e-contri butions become available means
they can be put to work imme diately, Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett estimated that in previ ous elections, the lag time be
tween an attention-grabbing victory in New Hampshire and the
receipt and processing of mailed checks was two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're talking about half a dozen clicks,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Although one explanation for the surge of contributions is
people's natural desire to back a winner, a larger influence was
Tuesday night's proof that Bush's nomination was far from inevita
ble, Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   Many contributors had said they wanted to support McCain, but
only if his candidacy proved viable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics underlying the surge of Internet contribu tions
buoyed McCain staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Donations were averaging around $114, and Schnur said the
largest group was in the 25-to-44 age bracket, much younger than
traditional donors. Forty percent had never given to a presidential
campaign before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been refreshing to us all to see that we're bringing new
people into the political process, which is one of the important
things that John McCain's candi dacy is all about,'' Gullett said. &QL;

<P>
   The demographics underlying the surge of Internet contribu tions
buoyed McCain staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Donations were averaging around $114, and Schnur said the
largest group was in the 25-to-44 age bracket, much younger than
traditional donors. Forty percent had never given to a presidential
campaign before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been refreshing to us all to see that we're bringing new
people into the political process, which is one of the important
things that John McCain's candi dacy is all about,'' Gullett said. &QL;

JET STABILIZER MAY BE KEY

   (Phoenix) - Potential problems with hori zontal stabilizers
emerged Wednesday as a common thread in at least three cases
involving MD-80 aircraft, including Mon day's fatal crash of Alaska
Air lines Flight 261 off California.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer, at the rear of the craft, which helps a plane
fly level, was cited as a potential problem:
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday morning's emergency landing of a Dallas-bound
American Airlines flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor Interna tional
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar emergency land ing nearly a year ago of an Alaska
Airlines flight at Fair banks International Airport, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier flight of the Alaska Airlines MD-83 that crashed
this week in the ocean near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investigators with the National Transportation
Safety Board recovered one of Flight 261's flight recorders. Offi
cials said they will expand their probe of Flight 261 to check
reports that the horizontal stabi lizer was a problem on the air
craft's earlier flight to Mexico. That flight carried a different
crew and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, NTSB officials Feb. 3 plan to examine the
flight-data boxes aboard American Air lines Flight 1538, which made
an emergency landing at Sky Har bor after the pilots reported
problems with the stabilizer trim. The crew members also will be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots on that Phoenix-to-Dallas flight said they were hav
ing intermittent problems with the stabilizer trim at 8:20 a.m.,
shortly after leaving Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency was declared when the aircraft was at 13,000 feet,
said NTSB spokesman Phil Frame. The flight returned to Sky Harbor
and landed safely at 9:03 a.m., Frame said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 59 passengers and six crew members. The passen gers
were placed on another plane.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident has par allels to a Feb. 5 emergency
landing at Fairbanks Interna tional Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the pilot of an MD-82 owned by Alaska Airlines had
trouble getting the plane's nose to rise on takeoff, according to a
preliminary NTSB report. However, after using an ``exces sive
amount'' of pressure on the control that lifts the nose, the plane
was able to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot declared an emer gency in flight and touched down at
Anchorage, complaining that the elevator control was ``slug gish
and slow to respond to control inputs.''
</P>
<P>
   That flight, carrying 138 pas sengers and crew, ended un
eventfully. The NTSB is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Although there seems to be a link, aviation experts cautioned
against a rush to condemn the horizontal stabilizer. Until more is
known, it is difficult to pin aircraft problems on one part.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 series jets have two engines attached to the fuse lage
near the tail. The models, depending on configuration, usu ally
carry 144 to 152 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody has jumped on this stabilizer issue like a
duck on a June bug,'' said Bill Waldock, director of the Center for
Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aviation Uni versity in
Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a functioning sta bilizer, a plane can fly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the speculation is the fact that the stabilizer, as part
of the airplane tail, is subject to a Federal Aviation
Administration inspection order.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1999 directive orders operators of the MD-80 series of
planes to inspect them for signs of corrosion around the hinges
that connect parts of the plane's tail. Inspections must be com
pleted by November.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, FAA spokes man Paul Turk said it is unlikely that
the FAA would move up the inspection deadline, unless there was
some serious reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Waldock said the last time the FAA changed a directive to an
emergency order was 20 years ago, when a DC-10 crashed at Chicago.
The order grounded ev ery DC-10 in the nation for more than two
weeks, causing huge financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Waldock said until more is known about the emergency landing
Wednesday at Sky Har bor, it's hard to say what role, if any, the
horizontal stabilizer played.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines pilot may have been very cautious, a
normal reaction after a crash, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think back to Swissair, we had a whole lot of people
turning back because they were smelling smoke,'' Waldock said.
Swissair Flight 111 filled with smoke and crashed in the Atlan tic
Ocean off Nova Scotia in 1998, killing 229.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months after the Swissair crash, there were
more flights turning back due to smoke complaints than had been
registered in the previous three years. &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE voice on the other end of the telephone line belonged to a
University of Houston football recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stuck in traffic,'' the recruiter told a local high school
coach in 1997. ``I'll be there as soon as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiter never showed.
</P>
<P>
   At another local high school in 1998, a Houston football
recruiter arrived late for a spring football game. He was given a
videotape of the game and watched about an hour's worth. Then he
scribbled a few names on a Post-It, stuck the paper on the head
coach's office door and left without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need more information on these kids,'' the note said. The
Post-It was trashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy made me feel like I was bothering him,'' the coach
said. ``He wouldn't give me the time of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way during Kim Helton's tenure as Cougars
head coach, things went terribly wrong. One local coach called it
``recruiting by proxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton's coaching staff knew its way around Florida, or the juco
trails, but not Houston. Helton's heart might have been in the
right place, but his recruiters were lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to where I never even saw U of H guys,'' a longtime
high school head coach said. ``They might have been recruiting
hard, but I didn't see it. They never walked out their own back
door to see what was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Dimel, on the other hand, is trying to kick the son of a
gun in, to paraphrase legendary local coach Bum Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dimel is anything but legendary on the local high
school scene. In fact, of the five high school coaches who on
Wednesday offered their opinions on UH football recruiting 2000,
exactly one knew Dimel's name four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But today, while the Texas Longhorns make more national
headlines with their latest super-stud class, and Texas A&AMP;M
promises to put the Wreck back in its Crew with an arsenal of
defensive talent, Dana Dimel is simply making a name for himself.
</P>
<P>
   And that means something to the people who matter most _ local
high school football coaches, who for the first time in years feel
welcome among the Cougars' football staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know Dana Dimel from anybody,'' said North Shore
coach David Aymond, who saw two of his players, Mark Hopkins and
Justin Davis, sign with UH on Wednesday. ``But he came out here and
talked. We just talked _ nothing to do with X's and O's. From that
first day on, I knew his style and demeanor were winners. He talks,
and he listens. He is genuinely interested in the high school
programs in the area. He's linking the gap that was there before.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, during Helton's tenure the gap between this
town's high schools and the university that carries this town's
name was monstrous. In 1999, just six of the high school recruits
signed by Helton were from the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his recruiting focus, or lack thereof, Helton
pointed to A&AMP;M and Texas' dominating presence, or talked of needing
a quick fix via the junior-college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It was astounding to imagine that while virtually every major
program in the country considered Houston a vital stop, UH was
unimpressed. Those most astounded: local high school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never could put a finger on why they didn't emphasize our
area,'' La Marque coach Larry Walker said. ``I guess they thought
the major guys got everybody. But if you draw a circle around the
Greater Houston area and count the number of football players, it's
a whole bunch. There's no way (the big schools) could get
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, they didn't. Dimel's first Cougars recruiting class
certainly made no national top-10 lists, but it was good and deep
and varied, covering virtually every position.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, it made inroads among the fraternity of
local coaches. And as much as that means now, it will mean more
later. Some 11 of the 13 high schoolers in the class of 19 UH
signees are from area schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't just talk the talk,'' Dimel told an enthused crowd
of alumni Wednesday at the Cougars' signing party.
</P>
<P>
   UH recruiters didn't make a lot of plane reservations, either,
and that was the best news of all for the Cougars faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this is the best place I've ever been in terms
of being successful,'' Dimel said. ``Everything's in place. There
might be a few players out (of state) that might have connections
here. But it's not in my best interests to leave the state of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he has only been here a few months, and Dimel already
knows the key to it all: The Cougars don't even need to leave town.
</P>

FAMILIES, FRIENDS PAINFULLY ACCEPT LOSS

<P>
   With the search for Flight 261 survivors abandoned, families of
the 88 passengers and crew prepared to visit the crash site in
hopes of easing their grief.
</P>
<P>
   They included Fred Ost, who traveled from Skokie, Ill., to be
closer to where five relatives died Monday when the ill-fated
Alaska Airlines flight plunged into the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have been too much. For it to be five - I cannot
even describe it,'' said a tearful Ost, 47. ``I want to go out on a
boat and reflect, remember and place a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines will help bus families to the shore Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to be doing is promoting silence, a moment of
prayers, a moment of thought of those families and friends,'' said
John Kelley, the airline's chief executive officer. A memorial is
scheduled for Saturday, at a time and place to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of their tremendous losses began to set in,
family members braced Wednesday for the grim task of working with
coroners' investigators to identify loved ones. In a private
meeting with about 100 people, investigators said they would ask
families for dental records, hair samples and other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying,'' said Greg Ford, a brother-in-law
of one victim, Bob Ost, 39, a San Mateo firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Ost was killed with his wife, Ileana; their 4-month-old
daughter, Emily; Ost's mother, Jean Permison, 73, of Scotts Valley;
and her companion of 10 years, Charles Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The five had gone to Puerto Vallarta last week to celebrate
Permison's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my mom's 73rd birthday, and Bob thought it would be
nice to take her and Charlie away for a couple of days,'' said
Janis Ost Ford, 36, Permison's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said she expected her mother to return in time for a
birthday dinner Tuesday with Russell. Instead, she grieved their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is going to make me a different person. Our life
is going to be very different from now,'' she said in between
floods of tears at her hotel room. ``I just want to know that our
family members didn't suffer and it was fast. To lose your family
nembers, you always think this stuff happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis Ford said closure will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with kids all the time and I'm up all the time, but I
don't feel a smile in here,'' she said, holding the edges of her
mouth with her hands. ``And I miss my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim in the crash, Renato Bermudez, was described as a
well-liked firefighter whose mother had recently bought a house in
Granada Hills. He was heading home from a visit to his girlfriend,
who was spending the winter near Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Francisco, Bermudez was named Firefighter of the
Year in 1999 for rescuing an elderly man from the second floor of a
burning building in the Mission District on July 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a passionate, literate man who loved his work and was
proud of the team he was part of,'' said Jim Gallagher, a retired
firefighter who worked with Bermudez. ``He used to volunteer his
time training other firefighters and trainees in a running program
we had in Golden Gate Park.'' &QL;

TOO SUNNY FOR A GOOD CLAMBAKE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ The weather here sucks. Blue skies, gentle
breezes, the sun glinting off $300 sunglasses and sunscreened
face-lifts. They're trying to play the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am starting Thursday, and so far we're staring at the gloomy
prospect of five days of perfect hair for Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Bing Crosby, can you please talk to someone up there and get
this straightened out? Otherwise it's just the Tucson Open with a
cooler water hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the tournament officials will come to their senses and
postpone play until we can get a decent typhoon or hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really the Crosby (as old-timers still call the
tourney) until the first celebrity gets blown off the 17th green
and onto the rocks below, a sacrificial offering to the gods of the
Clambake (as really old-timers still call the tourney).
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the greatest golf tournament in the world,
because it transcends golf, which can use some transcending. The
format is for each pro player to be paired with a celebrity. The
pros think of this as Take a Doofus to Work Week.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some amazing situations, such as a couple years ago
when Tiger Woods was paired with Costner, and Woods complained
because too many people were taking snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   If you invented a tournament like this today, the golfers' union
would shoot it down in an instant. Golfers today are much more
serious than brain surgeons, because brain surgeons get mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   But they put up with it, and the fans love it. You throw in the
celebrity element, and now you've got stuff to talk about other
than Davis Love II's short irons.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this year's celebrity field is thinner than
Calista Flockhart after a tofu souffle. The dropouts included Bill
Murray, Michael Jordan, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   Carmel this week is the only place in the world where you can
hear people say, ``Gee, I sure miss that nutball Donald Trump.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity field, frankly, could use some shoring up. No
offense to any of the AT&AMP;T's regular cast, but would you rather
follow Glen Campbell or John Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Bill Clinton, or the Spice Girls?
</P>
<P>
   Or any woman. There's not a female in the field. I can't believe
they couldn't have landed a Cameron Diaz or Janet Reno or Oprah
Winfrey or Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the all-celeb day, a five-hole mini-tourney with
the 10 biggest celebrities playing together in one big clump. It
was cute, but also disillusioning, like when Tommy Smothers
out-drove Hercules.
</P>
<P>
   One way to improve the tournament would be to require the celebs
to dress in costume. Who wants to see Hercules in a golf shirt?
Make Kevin Sorbo dress like Hercules, and let's see Clint Eastwood
as Dirty Harry, sneering at the gallery. Jerry Rice, put on some
pads and a jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On the first tee, the rule for the celebs was ``Hit 'til you're
happy,'' which is also the rule at any of the singles bars in
Monterey and Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway out-drove everyone else by about 100 yards, and it's
painfully obvious this guy wasted the best years of his golf career
tossing around a football.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano took some toupee-sized divots, and the buzz behind
the fairway ropes was that ``Everybody fears Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the real thing, which means that the entire event
has boiled down to two words: Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, most of the golfers considered him the greatest
player on the tour. Then he took his game up about two notches,
grooved his swing and started lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   And he was already the Mark McGwire of golf. He has changed the
game. Now when you hear someone at Pebble Beach talking about the
17-Mile Drive, they're referring to a Tiger tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won five tournaments in a row and is on such an
incredible roll that any day now, the rest of the pros are going to
show up wearing T-shirts that say ``Tiger's Caddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's ``celebrity'' partner is Jerry Chang, who is famous for
being one of Tiger's teammates at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Chang) won't get in the way, he won't be chit-chatting or
talking,'' Woods said Wednesday. ``He will be serious. ... That's
something that's nice and refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   And dull. Tiger's got this tournament on his shoulders. He's the
most watchable pro  &UR; and  &LR; the celebrity with the most star quality.
He's the show.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is even rooting for bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that I've always enjoyed, that type of
challenge,'' he said. ``You have to grind it out, and more
importantly, it separates a lot of players. Some of the guys don't
want to be out there'' in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers are the most pampered of athletes, and you have to love
a guy who roots for harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That makes two of us rooting for a monster storm to blow in off
the Pacific Thursday, with heavy swells crashing against the cliffs
edging the 18th green. Ah, I love the smell of salt brine and
golfer's fear in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Call me Ishmael.

DEMOCRATS' BIG CONTEST IS IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Fresh from the battlefields of New Hampshire,
Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley are
rushing to California this week to kick off what is expected to be
a tough _ and potentially nasty _ fight to round up support in this
critical state.
<P>
   Vice President Gore was scheduled to arrive Wednesday night in
Los Angeles, and planned a late-evening forum with undecided voters
at Los Angeles City College. Thursday morning, he is expected to
head to Venice, where he will visit a local firm and discuss
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bradley is scheduled to arrive in San
Francisco Thursday for a noon rally at the Ferry Building at the
foot of Market Street and the Embarcadero. In case of rain, the
event _ which is open to the public _ will be held at nearby
Gabbiano's restaurant, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's coming straight to San Francisco is a
statement of his respect for California voters,'' said Bradley
strategist Gale Kaufman Wednesday. ``It's a way of giving all of
our supporters a moment with him as we begin actively and
aggressively running our campaign here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of the highly competitive nature of the California
race, both campaigns _ even before the candidates set foot here _
urged them to plunge into issues that matter most to California
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator is going to do what he's doing repeatedly, which
is talk about issues which are very important out here, such as
health care,'' said Kaufman. ``He's the only candidate who's
calling for the registration and licensing of all handguns,'' and
has repeatedly spoken on issues such as offshore oil drilling,
education, race relations and abortion, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's campaign said that the vice president has long
cultivated the state, and that he intends to remain a regular
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been to California more than 60
times,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said this week. ``California
is a state where his particular policies, and his particular
agenda, play into good politics _ the environment, the economy,
guns and high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fights that he's waged over the last several years will
serve him well when he gets into the (state) primary,'' Lehane
said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, ``Al Gore is going to fight every single day, 24
hours a day, for every single vote he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's California supporters include Congresswoman Anna Eshoo
(D-Palo Alto) and San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano, Gavin
Newsom and Michael Yaki.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is backed by most major Democratic politicians in the
state, including Gov. Gray Davis, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley will return to the state next weekend, to
address the California state Democratic convention in San Jose.

LITTLE-KNOWN LAW LETS DAVIS FUND PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Using an obscure state law to skirt legislative
approval, Gov. Gray Davis is trying to spend at least $39 million
on new programs or programs that the Legislature didn't earmark
money for.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives the governor the authority to spend more on state
programs than the Legislature allowed in the budget _ but only in
emergencies or when an unforeseen cost increase occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers say Davis has used the law to create new programs
without legislative approval or, in other cases, provide money for
programs the Legislature did not approve funding for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't how the system is supposed to work,'' said
Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, the lower house's chief GOP
budget negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the system is supposed to work is if you've got a
legislative initiative, you go through the process and go through
the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds vote and then it
gets funded,'' Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   A Davis spokeswoman said the governor's requests ``were
important programs that fall within the purview of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Runner and other lawmakers say the move by Davis is a test
to see how much the Legislature will let him get away with. They
say that by spending money without their authorization, the
governor is violating the constitutionally established roles of the
Legislature and the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Department of Corrections, Davis wants to
create $5.6 million in new programs, including $1.6 million for
more guards at high-security cells at Pelican Bay Prison and $1.1
million to increase medical services for female inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But several legislative budget-writers note that with a $4.4
billion budget, the corrections department could direct $5.5
million to these programs until a new budget is approved this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These may be good policies, but they must have legislative
input, like a bill authorizing creation of the programs,'' said
Runner. ``All these programs in corrections had no legislative
overview or authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also seeks $7.8 million to create a new bureaucracy to
regulate the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Managed Care does not open until July 1 _ the
start of the state's new budget year. The bill lawmakers approved
last year to create the department contained no money to staff it
the department &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was because no money was needed until the next
fiscal year and because the bill said Davis would issue an
executive order to transfer personnel from another bureaucracy to
create the department's initial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has yet to sign the executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davis administration wanted to get that department up and
running so when doors open July 1, important work could start,''
said Hilary McLean, a Davis spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Another expense Davis wants paid is $15.4 million for increased
costs of 911 services and higher operating expenses for the Oakland
state building.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget writers said the Davis administration was
aware of the higher costs and should have sought the money through
the normal budget process.
</P>
<P>
   None of the requests by Davis that lawmakers object to have been
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings are scheduled for next week with key legislative
budget-writers like Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, chair of the
Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, who decides which of Davis' proposals are legitimate, did
not return a phone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers don't raise an objection, the governor's requests
take effect 30 days from his notifying the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Budget overruns approved by the Legislature are paid late in the
year with what is known as a deficiency bill, which ties up loose
budget ends.
</P>
<P>
   But because the bill spends money, it requires a two-thirds
vote, which means GOP lawmakers must back it.

GRIFFEY TRADE INEVITABLE; BUT HISTORICALLY SPEAKING, DON'T DO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If there was any question which previous honoree WON'T
be attending the P-I's 65th Sports Star of the Year banquet
Thursday night, the 1989 award winner answered it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front office, the fans and the media, everybody's ripped
me,'' Ken Griffey Jr. told the P-I at Pebble Beach, Calif. ``Think
I can come back (to Seattle)?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that's how you feel ... can I have your dinner roll?
</P>
<P>
   Wait. That's a little too cynical. I will miss Junior. So will a
whole lot of Puget Sound baseball fans who have watched quietly
through most of last season and this winter as Griffey's Seattle
saga unraveled awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Most haven't ripped Griffey. They just don't like the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Who gives a standing ``O'' to divorce?
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake; dissolution is pending. All this talk about a
Griffey return to the Mariners was posturing by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey's words weren't plain enough about his feelings, some
who have had off-the-record contact with Howard Lincoln say the new
Mariners CEO is tired of the Griffey tail wagging the franchise
dog. He wants Griffey gone by spring training, recognizing the
obvious folly of any other option, and has so directed his new
hire, GM Pat Gillick.
</P>
<P>
   Though a trade is the only plausible outcome, that doesn't mean
it is a worthy idea. Call me a sentimental silly, but I've had this
notion that trading the best player of a generation isn't a smart
thing. I keep remembering what was said in Boston about trading
Babe Ruth, what was said in Milwaukee about trading Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, and what was said in Baltimore about trading John
Elway:
</P>
<P>
   NOOOOOOO!!!!!
</P>
<P>
   As with those three, as well as the more locally familiar Randy
Johnson episode, there is not a single good sports reason for the
trade. Inevitably, value is never received in return, and the
franchise never recovers (see the trophy cases of the Red Sox,
Bucks, Colts and Mariners).
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the pure sports rationale, such trades come about
for reasons economic and personal, which almost always means the
player and the team will get sideways.
</P>
<P>
   That's where we are in the Griffey/Mariners divorce. Each side
takes the other's statements or position as ignorant, a challenge
or an insult.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to find someone who isn't sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have adroitly manipulated that inevitability into a
subtle demonization of Griffey, making him the bad guy. And Griffey
played into the strategy by going back on a commitment made by his
agent during the November trade request: To cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners fans have no interest in why Griffey cut his list of
acceptable teams from four to just Cincinnati. They just know that
because he did, the Mariners are about to be hijacked in whatever
deal comes down with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be overemphasized that Griffey's 10-and-five rights (10
years in the majors, five with the same team) on the eve of his
free agency make the degree of difficulty in this deal
extraordinary. Baseball is the only sport with such a privilege,
and it is almost never exercised with a 30-year-old superstar in
his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is so young, so good, so expensive, so close to free
agency, and played his 10-and-5 card so hard, that the Mariners
have virtually no market for him. They might have to take from the
Reds a bat rack and two 16-year-old prospects from Belize.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Mariners were playing poker with a guy
who's seen all their cards. To their credit, they protected
themselves with shrewd free-agent acquisitions around their exposed
hand. They filled most of their roster shortcomings without
proceeds from a Griffey deal. And they still have until July 31 to
trade Alex Rodriguez, whose trade rights they control.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners strung out Griffey throughout the off-season in the
hope of pressuring the Reds by stirring up another trade rival, or
at least a third partner, partly because Gillick and his Reds
counterpart, Jim Bowden, have grown to dislike dealing with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Such a three-way deal could happen. But regardless of the
components, the Reds probably will end up ladling out mere gruel
for Griffey. Yet the Mariners still will be favorites for the
American League West title.
</P>
<P>
   And for whatever it's worth, they can posture themselves as
victims of the baseball system and Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   But the region will be without Griffey, the defining figure of
the franchise who might end up recognized as one of the best
players in two centuries of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   To those focused on the unpleasantness of the past few months,
Griffey's departure will be at least a relief, if not a joy.
</P>
<P>
   But to some of us at Thursday's banquet who have a chance to
celebrate 65 years of unusual athletes and extraordinary
accomplishments, Griffey's imminent absence makes a hole in sports
history's soul.

GOLFING GRIFFEY SHRUGS OFF TRADE QUESTIONS

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ With trade rumors wafting from coast to
coast, Ken Griffey Jr. spent Wednesday in relative seclusion at the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, playing a practice round on
near-empty Spyglass Hill Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   After putting out on the 18th green, the Mariners centerfielder
was quizzed by the Post-Intelligencer about the possibility of a
trade to the Cincinnati Reds taking place this week.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to answer. Several times.
</P>
<P>
   However, that didn't stop him from talking.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes, Griffey railed over and over about how he is a
hated man in Seattle because he wants to be near his family.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Mariners' six free-agent signings since the season
ended had done anything to change his thinking about a trade,
Griffey responded with a question of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front office, the fans and the media, everybody's ripped
me,'' he said. ``Think I can come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said several Mariners officials, general manager Pat
Gillick, president Chuck Armstrong and vice president Lee
Pelekoudas, as well as media outlets, have requested meetings with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to come see me and see what's in my head,'' he
said. ``I'm not talking to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Mariners finally were making long overdue
changes and spending more money, Griffey curiously defended former
Mariners general manager Woody Woodward. Griffey next criticized
Woodward's replacement, Gillick, for releasing third baseman Russ
Davis and pitcher Bret Hinchliffe rather than moving them in
trades.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his Mariners career, Griffey has stated the only
thing that mattered to him was getting a World Series championship
ring; his father has three of them. Reminded of this Wednesday and
pegged about the possibility of a much improved Mariners team,
Griffey only reiterated his latest mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's mad at me because I want to be near my family,''
he said. ``I want to give my son something my father never gave
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey jumped into a waiting sports utility vehicle after he
was urged several times by his impatient caddy to end his
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   At Spyglass, Griffey has played golf with the PGA Tour's Mark
O'Meara and John Cook. No more than a dozen people watched the
baseball player dunk an occasional shot in the water or demonstrate
a deft touch around the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey complied with every autograph request. He was playful at
times, throwing a ball from the elevated tee onto the green of the
125-yard, par-3 15th hole, the ball landing 10 feet from the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has maintained a relatively low profile his first two
days at the popular AT&AMP;T golf event. That will change Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:20 a.m. on Poppy Hills Golf Course, Griffey will tee it up
with O'Meara. The rest of their foursome is filled out by Tiger
Woods and a college friend.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' original choice for an amateur partner was Michael
Jordan, who backed out of a week at Pebble Beach once he became
part owner of the Washington Wizards and started working in their
front office.

LIFELESS STARS EDGE THRASHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The expansion Atlanta Thrashers didn't exactly inspire
the Stars last night the way rivals St. Louis and Edmonton did the
past two home games. And the limp play wasn't exactly endearing to
coach Ken Hitchcock as the Stars readied to catch a flight to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the patient _ maybe too patient _ Stars pulled out a
rather ho-hum 2-1 victory at sold-out Reunion Arena. The Stars
managed only seven shots in the final two periods and needed a
monster third period from backup goalie Manny Fernandez, who made
17 saves in the final period and missed his first career shutout by
a little more than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played one period of hockey, that's about it,'' a disturbed
Hitchcock said. ``I thought the biggest difference in the game was
their workers outworked our workers. We had no physical play after
the first period from the people we needed it from, in particular
\RKirk\S Muller's line and it put us behind the eight-ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory still provided two points and gives the Stars a
chance to tie the Phoenix Coyotes for the division lead tonight,
the final game before the All-Star break. The Coyotes are expected
to get Keith Tkachuk back in the lineup, and the Stars fully expect
a playoff atmosphere inside America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand what strengths we have and how we play
as a team,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``What's given us
success in the past is something we all understand, we all can do
as players. That's the way it's going to have to be tomorrow. The
sooner we understand that, the better we'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars fired 13 shots on goal without scoring in the
first period they seemingly took the rest of the night off. They
sent only two shots in the direction of Atlanta goalie Norm Maracle
in the second period. The second shot, a Modano wrister from the
right side off a pass from Brett Hull, put the Stars ahead, 1-0.
Darryl Sydor set the play in motion with a breakup in the Dallas
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's goal was his 21st of the season and the 332nd of his
career, moving him past Dino Ciccarelli on the Stars' all-time
goals list. He is only 10 goals behind Stars franchise goal-scoring
leader Brian Bellows.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars added the clincher at 11:16 of the third on Guy
Carbonneau's short-handed goal, with due credit going to Thrashers
winger Jason Botteril. Blake Sloan led a two-on-one breakaway down
the left side and passed to Carbonneau in the slot. The puck hit
off Carbonneau's skate backward, and Botteril, sliding on his
stomach head first toward the goal, sent the loose puck off his
helmet and past his own goalie for a 2-0 Stars lead.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brunette spoiled Fernandez's shutout bid when he fought
off Jamie Pushor near the crease and shoved the puck past
Fernandez, who nearly kept the puck out with a sweep of his glove
along the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The goal didn't tarnish a magnificent game for Fernandez, who
ended a personal two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to get the win,'' Fernandez said. ``I was
worried when they scored because there was still a lot of time left
and they seemed to come at us real hard at the end of the third.''

AMERICAONE'S INTENSE SKIPPER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JIM DOYLE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Moments before the start of the first
high-stakes showdown with his Italian rival, Paul Cayard pulled one
of the most aggressive maneuvers of the America's Cup trials _
suddenly rounding a race committee boat by only a few feet and
ducking inside the Prada, which was trying to block AmericaOne's
way.
<P>
   It was a purely instinctive move, not one found in the team's
playbook. Pushing hard on the wheel of AmericaOne with almost
maniacal confidence, the 40-year-old skipper scared the daylights
out of Prada's crew _ and his own. ``For every other member of the
team, their life probably passed in front of their eyes,'' said
strategist Gavin Brady. ``It was a critical time in this regatta. A
critical two seconds. It was a desperation move.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was unneeded that time. Halfway up the first leg of that
race in the semifinals last month, Prada's 10-story-tall carbon
fiber mast snapped in two, and AmericaOne went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same two teams are going head to head in the Louis
Vuitton Cup finals, a best-of-nine series for the right to
challenge Team New Zealand next month for the America's Cup. Cayard
was down 3-1, but came back strong, and the series is tied at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is the most focused man I've ever met,'' said crew member
Jim Nicholas of San Diego, who has known Cayard for 20 years.
``He's probably a genius. His whole career has been setting up for
this one _ the America's Cup is like war. There's diplomacy,
intelligence and the battle. Some of our races have been brilliant.
I've been in five cup campaigns, and this is the best chance I've
had to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away from the salt air and jade-green waters of the
Hauraki Gulf, and long before the greatest battle of his life, Paul
Cayard was just another middle-class San Francisco kid. His family
lived on a foggy Twin Peaks street where Paul gave his parents a
fright by skateboarding down the steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky boy with searing brown eyes _ who one day would start
an America's Cup campaign on his own _ attended Clarendon
Elementary School and played basketball and football. But he was
always different.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a French immigrant, was a boy when the Germans
invaded Paris. Pierre Cayard, who made sets for the San Francisco
Opera, built his 8-year-old a sailboat _ an El Toro, a wooden
dinghy that his proud son would describe decades later as ``a
beautiful work of art made from seven types of wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul's buddies teased him mercilessly when he began to sail.
There was no question that the boy, an only child, had an affinity
for the wind. He also liked getting out of the house, out of reach
of the criticisms of his hard-driving parents. He sailed every
other weekend on Lake Merritt in Oakland and still recalls how
scared he felt when his boat capsized and he had to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 11, Paul's father and mother, Frances, a disability
evaluator, joined San Francisco's Lake Merced Sailing Club. Two
years later, his mother donned a wetsuit and crewed for her son on
San Francisco Bay's freezing waters.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboat racer and ESPN commentator Gary Jobson recalls how,
when he visited the St. Francis Yacht Club nearly three decades
ago, a friend pointed out a 12-year-old sailor named Paul Cayard
and said, ``Watch this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he won the North America championships in the El Toro.
</P>
<P>
   The boy wonder was not exactly plucked off the streets of San
Francisco and presented with the keys to the city's most exclusive
yacht club, but he certainly latched on to some fine-feathered
friends. Doug Holm, a sailboat racer who now sells marine
insurance, met Paul Cayard at the St. Francis Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a kid from San Bruno (where his family had moved)
who came through the junior sailing program,'' Holm said. ``Paul
was rough around the edges. He was just driven to win sailboat
races _ he never expected to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The yacht club provided Cayard with boats to sail, took him to
regattas up and down California and flew him to Rio de Janeiro for
the world championships in the Laser class, a single-handed racing
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard attended San Francisco State University, working his way
through college by building sets for his father. He got his degree
in business management.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Cayard could never quite grasp his son's obsession with
sailing. He was supportive but would have preferred that Paul take
up a more stable profession, like dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is like a bulldog. Once he bites onto something, he never
lets go,'' says Pierre Cayard, who now follows his son's races on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard found kindred spirits in those early years who showed him
the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Blackaller, a San Francisco sailing maverick known for his
killer instinct, was among the first yacht-racing heavyweights to
take the young sailor under his wing. When Cayard was only 18,
Blackaller asked him to sail with him. He was the youngest guy on
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, in 1983, Blackaller asked him to be a sail
trimmer on Defender, which sailed in defense of the America's Cup
for the New York Yacht Club. Cayard's sailing buddy the future best
man at his wedding, Ken Keefe, was also on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard says he learned from Blackaller ``when to go for it. Any
risk-taking tendency I have came from him.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was the year that John Bertrand's Australia II, with
its revolutionary winged keel, took the trophy away from the New
York Yacht Club, where it had sat for 132 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Cayard married Icka Peterson, a stylish and
warm-hearted Swede who is the daughter of Pelle Peterson, a world
champion sailor. The couple, who now live in Kentfield, settled
first in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later came a turning point in Cayard's career: He
began working full time for Italian billionaire Raul Gardini,
overseeing his sailboat racing program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Cayard, his wife and their two children moved to Italy,
where Cayard ran Gardini's $100 million America's Cup campaign. In
1992, helmsman Cayard drove Il Moro di Venezia to the America's Cup
finals, but lost 4-1 to Bill Koch's America3 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He had won the world championship in the Star class in Buenos
Aires in 1988. He tried twice to qualify in the Star boat for the
Olympic Games, but fell short _ dashing his dream of winning a gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   But inch by inch, Cayard was retooling himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wild and out of control during my first America's Cup
campaign,'' he said. ``When Mr. Gardini hired me, I shifted gears
and became very serious. It's because I know it's who I need to be
to excel _ I've probably gone too far and become more extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, American sailing legend Dennis Conner selected Cayard
as his helmsman on cup defender Young America. But that year, Team
New Zealand's Black Magic sailed away with a 5-0 victory in San
Diego and took the cup to Auckland. It was a heartbreaking loss for
Cayard, but he walked away from the regatta with a positive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the most important lessons to learn is how to
lose and come back stronger the next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After getting skunked in the 1995 America's Cup, Cayard lay on
the beach _ without a team or boat, yet looking ahead at the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   He could have signed up as a helmsman with an established
syndicate, but he decided to start from zero with his own group. So
he flew down to San Diego and crewed for Doug Smith _ a lawyer and
friend from the yacht club _ on a Star boat. On the tow-out to the
racecourse, the two secretly worked on the business plan for an
America's Cup team, sorting out the organizational and legal issues
of running a multilevel business campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When AmericaOne's formation was announced in May 1996, Smith
became one of the syndicate's board members, and the St. Francis
Yacht Club was listed as the official sponsor. The next step would
be begging for dollars to finance the team's $32 million budget _
and locking up key team members, including veteran America's Cup
boat designer Bruce Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hand-to-mouth existence, and then came the first body
blow to Cayard's campaign: In early 1997, Netscape Communications
Corp. founder Jim Clark backed away from his pledge to give $6
million to the team. The next blow came soon after, when veteran
cup manager Laurent Esquier jumped ship and took a job with Italy's
big-budget Prada syndicate. Cayard's team was on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Larry Finch, who owns an investment capital firm
with offices in San Francisco and Boston, stepped up to form the
Founder's Club _ a vehicle for seeking contributions from St.
Francis Yacht Club members and others. Finch himself gave $2
million, and they quickly raised $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, AmericaOne made an overture to
Hewlett-Packard Co. HP would invest $5 million in cash in the
syndicate, plus several millions of dollars in goods, services and
related marketing programs. HP not only helped the team set up its
California and Auckland operations, but also lent the team the use
of supercomputers to help sift through thousands of potential boat
designs. In return, HP's logo would be prominently displayed on the
boat, and Cayard agreed to speak at HP events.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Cayard signed sponsorship deals with Ford Motor Co.,
SAIC, United Technologies, Visteon Racing and Telcordia
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, an organization was being built. Once fully
assembled, it would be 70 people strong, including 26 sailors (for
16 slots on the racing boat) plus tender operators, crash boat
drivers and weather spotters. The shore crew would consist of boat
builders, boat doctors, sail makers, chefs, a marketing and public
relations staff, an administrative staff, office workers and
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   An America's Cup syndicate is like a traveling circus _ a
mammoth operation that can easily become a logistical nightmare.
AmericaOne's solution: ``Buddha'' Bob Billingham, an Olympic
medalist and the team's affable chief of operations, who set up its
training compound in Long Beach and base in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard drew no salary the first two years and negotiated a
$200,000-a-year contract for each of the past two years _ an amount
that he calculated was less than half what he could have commanded
had he hired on with another syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he took one of the biggest gambles of the AmericaOne
campaign by deciding to skipper a 60-foot sailboat in the Whitbread
Round the World Race _ the Mount Everest of sailing. Rather than
stay focused on his America's Cup campaign, Cayard reasoned that
his syndicate would gain valuable publicity if he competed in the
high-profile event.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected him to do well. Cayard and his crew were buoy
racers, not blue water sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the Southern Ocean off Antarctica, his boat encountered
30-foot waves and 45-knot winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point in the race when I wondered whether I was
doing the right thing,'' Cayard said the other day. ``I had this
vision of my wife and kids curled up on a couch before the
fireplace in Kentfield. But there we were, planing down 20-foot
waves in the dark, and I didn't know if we might get pasted into an
iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard won, the first American skipper to be victorious in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, the skipper gets the lion's share of the glory, but
there were 11 other guys who did a hell of a job,'' Cayard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitbread victory ``showed us that anything was possible,''
said AmericaOne marketing pro Jen McHugh.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was now set for Cayard's ultimate challenge. On July
17, 1999, the boat USA-49 _ sporting Michael Vanderbyl's dynamic
design of gunmetal gray and green shards _ sat in a cradle before a
crowd of 500 guests at the Port of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I christen thee AmericaOne,'' said Icka Cayard, breaking a
bottle of champagne against its bow. It was an emotional high for
what was becoming a close-knit family of sailors.
</P>
<P>
   But once christened, USA-49 still was not ready to sail.
Winifred Feifel, a Boeing Co. scientist who has designed everything
from cruise missiles to gliders, was putting the finishing touches
on the boat's secret keel.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors, stuck with training in a slower Australian boat
from the 1995 cup races, felt grumpy and stranded. All had strong
egos and winning records. The sunrise workouts under
Australian-bred sailor Billy Bates were grueling. The crew wanted
to sail on a fast boat, not wear themselves down.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them also began to wonder if the man they privately
nicknamed ``The Mustache'' had made the right decision to train in
Southern California. America True, their San Francisco rival, was
already sailing its new boat in Auckland. And the Italians, who
seemed far ahead in the game, would soon be sailing there with two
new boats.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard has a nimble touch at the wheel _ his long, tanned
fingers lightly steer the 75-foot yacht through rolling seas. He
glances from time to time at the digital numbers on his Nike watch.
In his foul-weather gear, leather and canvas boots, Oakley
sunglasses and mustache, he looks like a cutout from a Marlboro
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But near the start of a race, Cayard begins to breathe loudly,
unconsciously, as if his pulse is racing at more than 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the helmsman-tactician relationship is the most
potentially volatile on AmericaOne. John Kostecki is not only a
world-class tactician, but also a brilliant skipper in his own
right. At times, the two have crossed swords because of Kostecki's
need to call tactics during a race and Cayard's need to exercise
the helm without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good, if uneasy, collection of people out there,''
said grinder Jim Nicholas, 46, one of the oldest members of
AmericaOne's sailing team and one of the boat's musclemen who
operate the winches. ``Paul tends to run a little hot, and Kostecki
tends to keep him cool. We all try to keep him light.''
</P>
<P>
   To get around the racecourse, the 16 crew members on an
America's Cup sailing team have to work in unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like in football, when a play is well executed,
it's}ooRdh,/l92 said. But, he acknowledges, ``Sometimes I'm too
overbearing with the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been a major general in the Army, leading
troops, right there in the bunker, not behind the lines,'' said
Roger ``Clouds'' Badham, the team's barefoot meteorologist.
``Mentally, he's like lightning. He sees the big picture, but he
also understands the little pieces _ it'll probably kill him. It
killed his mentor, Tom Blackaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackaller died of a heart attack at 49 in 1989 while doing laps
at Sears Point Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   In the America's Cup trials that started in October, crew
loyalty would be tested to the limits. The team would either come
together or splinter apart.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes collided with AmericaOne in the
first qualifying round _ almost knocking Cayard over the side and
causing structural damage to the boat's transom.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing czar Gina von Esmarch called the incident a ``stomach
cruncher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a lot of damage before we even get to
the semis,'' Cayard told a group of supporters during a dinner at
the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. There, he sipped a glass of
wine and remarked how good it tasted, but he never took another
sip.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-November, nearly half the AmericaOne team had the flu,
and crew members felt they were being pushed too hard _ often
rising at dawn and working for the next 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they come up with new technology _ a new wing on the
keel or whatever _ we have to build it. And that can become a drain
on morale,'' said strategist Morgan Larson of Capitola. ``At this
stage of the game, it's time we're up against. A year ago, it was
money. The America's Cup is a marathon. If you start sprinting,
maybe you'll have legs that will get you the whole way, and maybe
you'll run out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard was looking ahead _ anxiously awaiting the arrival of his
second wind-powered rocket ship, the USA-61. On November 8, the
team's new boat arrived in Auckland inside the belly of a Boeing
747. Still, the skipper was unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sailing as well as I can and not as well as I have in
the past,'' Cayard said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Christmas holiday, he studied videotapes of the early
races _ dissecting the starting tactics of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   At a team meeting, the skipper told his troops: ``I go home at
night and sit in my bed or wake up in the morning and visualize how
we're going to win the America's Cup. My vision of winning was not
clear three or four months ago; now it's getting clearer. We're
going to be on top of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, AmericaOne faced Prada again _ a match that Cayard
would later describe as a ``s_ fight.'' On the final downwind leg,
the two wind-driven chariots dodged and scraped against each for
the lead _ with both skippers yelling their lungs out in protest to
on-water umpires. Cayard, fearing that Prada skipper Francesco de
Angelis was trying to push him off course, screamed over and over:
``Improper course! Improper course!'' AmericaOne won the race by
nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred to be more low-key. I got overly
excited. I regret that,'' Cayard said afterward. But his crew
seemed stoked by his performance _ happy to see the brutally
competitive wild man resurface.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell that he's recharging. It helps to know that he's
got the killer instinct back,'' bowman Curtis Blewett said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the competitive animosity between the crews that
are now competing in the finals boiled over, when AmericaOne
returned to the dock after losing its race against Dennis Conner's
Stars &AMP; Stripes. Prada's shore team greeted Cayard by wearing
Pinocchio noses, suggesting that he had thrown the race to reduce
the Italians' chances of getting into the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose at anything. I fear failure,'' he said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   If he pulls off a win, he would become an American sailing hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of winning is expecting to win,'' Cayard said.
``The test is, can we be as hungry tomorrow as we were today? Those
who pass the test win the America's Cup.''

 VETERAN CHRONICLE REPORTER AND COLUMNIST ART HOPPE DIES  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN, LEAH GARCHIK and JANICE GREENE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Art Hoppe, the gentleman humorist whose sharp
pen crafted a peerless column of political and social satire that
appeared in The Chronicle for more than 40 years, died Tuesday
night in a San Francisco hospital of complications from lung
cancer. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe, who told readers in December of his disease and wrote
movingly about his battle against it, was a much-beloved member of
The Chronicle staff who skewered political targets on the left and
right with eloquence, insight and joy.
</P>
<P>
   He deflated the pompous, tweaked the powerful and weighed in
passionately on such issues as Vietnam, Watergate, the death
penalty and the inability of America to produce low-fat cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   His death came eight weeks after he told readers that he was
being treated for lung cancer. In characteristically upbeat
fashion, he wrote that he was ``impressed with my own worth on
being told my insurance company would be billed $4,000'' for a
particular test. He also said he planned to die after being hit by
a truck, many years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe gave birth in his column to a cast of whimsical characters
_ confused redneck Joe Sikspak, lowly Private Oliver Drab, an
earnestly unelectable Harvard-educated gorilla, the all-knowing
expert Homer T. Pettibone, the celestial Heavenly Landlord and a
presidential candidate named Nobody _ who assisted their creator in
his self-described lifelong campaign of tilting at windmills.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Editor William German called his friend ``the best
reporter The Chronicle ever had _ he wrote with wit, intelligence
and eloquence, and he could find information and convey it clearly,
in a manner that made the reader want to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Hoppe was a great satirist and Bay Area institution, and
his death is a profound loss to all of us,'' said Chronicle
Managing Editor Jerry Roberts. ``In an age of bombast, he was a
writer of tremendous civility and grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Hoppe was a ``journalist
of style and substance (who) captivated the Bay Area for years with
a wonderful blend of humor, satire and grace. He was a fun-loving,
caring man who will be sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   His half century at The Chronicle seemed to amaze everyone but
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've now put in 50 years at The Chronicle,'' he wrote in July.
``Please don't send congratulations. It's not an accomplishment to
be proud of. If you show up with some regularity for work and don't
get hit by a truck, eventually you are bound to reach the same
chronological pinnacle.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined The Chronicle as a copy boy in 1949, at a salary of
$35 a week. Seven months later, he was promoted to reporter. He
spent a week as a bum on skid row, trekked to a snowbound passenger
train in the Sierra and journeyed to Europe to explain to readers
the foreign policies of Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and
Andorra. At the height of the space race, he was dispatched to the
African nation of Zambia, where he described how astronauts were
being trained by being rolled downhill in barrels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he was among the horde of reporters at San Francisco
City Hall to cover the wedding of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio wedded the girl of his and many other
men's dreams yesterday,'' he wrote _ a deceptively simple sentence
often quoted by journalism teachers as an example of how to start a
news story.
</P>
<P>
   His feature stories were models of sharp writing and keenly
observed details that eluded lesser reporters. In 1957, he wrote a
moving account of being among the witnesses at an execution at San
Quentin prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to see Burton Abbott die,'' he wrote. ``There were
53 of them _ official witnesses. All were men. Women are not
allowed to see a condemned man die ... They gathered in front of
the main gate to San Quentin at 9 a.m. yesterday. No one was
late.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he covered the presidential race between John Kennedy
and Richard Nixon, overhearing the idle chat between the two men
just before one of their historic debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither said anything for a moment,'' Hoppe wrote. ``Then
Kennedy, in what seemed like one of those desperate efforts to make
small talk, said, `When are you going out again?' `I leave first
thing in the morning,' Nixon said. `Oh,' Kennedy said. After a few
moments, both turned to talk to others, just as you do at a
cocktail party when you run out of conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   His columns from the 1960 campaign trail led to his regular
humor column, which eventually appeared five days a week and was
syndicated in more than 100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   His columns spanned the presidencies of Just Plain Jack, Elbie
Jay, Nick Dixon, the Scoutmaster, Jiminy Beaver, Sir Ronald of
Holyrude, Mr. Lifestyles of the Rich and Humble and Billy Boomer,
Boy President.
</P>
<P>
   Like many humorists, he was grateful for the 1968 election of
such handy subjects as Nixon and his Vice President Spiro Agnew,
whose photographs he kept on his office wall and whose
resignations, he often moped, robbed him of years of additional
copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always thought, and still do, that Mr. Nixon's basic
problem over the years was his, forgive the word, insecurity ... He
always seemed ill at ease. His suits _ he never wore anything else
_ didn't fit quite right; his sense of humor was nonexistent; he
had no capacity whatsoever for small talk. He was the boy you let
play only if it was his ball...''
</P>
<P>
   With passion, eloquence and common sense, he argued against the
Vietnam War, racial intolerance and capital punishment. In 1971, at
the height of the war in Southeast Asia, he stunned readers with a
frank, difficult admission:
</P>
<P>
   ``The radio this morning said the Allied invasion of Laos had
bogged down. Without thinking, I nodded and said, `Good.' And
having said it, I realized the bitter truth: Now I root against my
own country. This is how far we have come in this hated and endless
war. This is the nadir I have reached in this winter of my
discontent. This is how close I border on treason. Now I root
against my own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers often wrote ill-tempered letters taking issue with such
statements. To many, he was fond of replying that if any more such
letters were received, the newspaper would be forced to cancel the
letter writer's subscription.
</P>
<P>
   To other hecklers, he would send a one-sentence reply: ``The
cookbook you have ordered will arrive under separate cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his friends were fellow humor columnists Russell Baker and
Art Buchwald. Together, the three writers formed an ephemeral
society they called the American Academy of Humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose,'' Baker recalled Wednesday, ``was to keep
everybody else out. We excluded a number of people. We finally let
in Erma Bombeck, that was because Art was soft on Erma.''
</P>
<P>
   Another close friend, Chronicle Science Editor David Perlman,
called Hoppe ``the most graceful writer I ever worked with (and) a
true humanist. No human fault or achievement failed to evoke his
sympathy or his applause, and no public evildoer could escape the
kind of hilarious tongue-lashing that only Hoppe at his satirical
best could administer in print.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe died three years to the day after the death of his friend
and fellow Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, who frequently called
Hoppe ``a genius _ and an unsung one at that.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote two plays and eight books, including several
collections of his columns and a vivid 1995 autobiography titled,
``Having a Wonderful Time _ My First Half Century as a
Newspaperman.''
</P>
<P>
   That book was full of delightful anecdotes, such as his 1966
tour of Lyndon Johnson's ranch with the president himself at the
wheel and Hoppe in the very back of a bumpy station wagon. On that
occasion, Johnson introduced Hoppe to a deer named Charley, who ate
cigarettes, and Hoppe thanked the president profusely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's all right,'' Johnson replied. ``I didn't have
anything else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe's son, Nick, said that the books' modest sales were a
source of amusement to their author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad always said,'' he recalled, ``that some people collect
rare books and that he writes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecating remarks were a specialty. The best thing about
being a columnist, he once wrote, is being ``able to say exactly
what I think ... I've always claimed that I enjoy the utmost in
freedom of the press because the publisher doesn't read my
output.''
</P>
<P>
   But the publisher did read Hoppe's column, and so did the rest
of Hoppe's colleagues, with admiration and awe.
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe, the son of a lawyer and a social worker, was born in
Honolulu and moved to San Francisco at the age of 5. He was a
graduate of Presidio Hill School and Lowell High School in San
Francisco and of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served as a pharmacist's mate aboard a
destroyer in the Pacific. He was fond of telling his wide-eyed
children and grandchildren that, in the line of duty, he
``single-handedly dispatched millions of our country's enemies'' _
by dispensing antibiotics to kill the germs in a sailor's sore
throat.
</P>
<P>
   He was a world traveler, primarily to places with golf courses
and tennis courts, and he was an abstract artist whose painted
masterpieces were less well known than his written ones.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the California Tennis Club and the Claremont
and Lagunitas country clubs, where his shots frequently traveled in
unintended directions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, on his 60th birthday, Hoppe expressed his gratitude in
print to one of his favorite readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God, I've had a marvelous time. I thought it time
to write a thank-you note to my host or hostess, as the case may
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wonderful party, God, absolutely wonderful. It was
the guests who made it. I can't say I liked all of them. A few were
stuffed shirts, a few were wet blankets and a few badly misbehaved.
But they were the exceptions. All in all, it was a grand bunch ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I never quite believed in your wrath. I see you as a kindly
and benevolent host concerned with my well-being. I like to think
that your pine beetles and your storms and your malevolent microbes
have been placed in my path to remind me that it isn't all fun and
games. Nor should it be. So thank you dear God for the deserts, for
Texas and for the pine beetles.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, I've had an absolutely marvelous time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Gloria, whom he met in
high school, by his son Nick Hoppe of Mill Valley, by his daughters
Andy Gonzalez of San Francisco, Leslie Hoppe-Wormhoudt of Greenbrae
and Prentiss Van Den Berg of Kentfield.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by 11 grandchildren: Scriv and Thibault
Hoppe-Glosser and Annie and Charlie Wormhoudt, of Greenbrae; Laura
and Elena Gonzalez of San Francisco; Kelly, Taryn, Will and Brett
Hoppe, of Mill Valley; and Jessica Buerger of Ross.
</P>

Luke's Episcopal Church, Van Ness Avenue at Clay Street, San
Francisco. The family requests that donations be sent to the

SEARCHERS RECOVER BLACK BOX

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. - Searchers recovered one of the black-box
recorders late Wednesday that could explain why Alaskan Airlines
Flight 261 crashed, while investigators focused on reports of
previous mechanical problems with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the cockpit voice recorder came after the Coast
Guard decided to call off its search for survivors, over the
protests of some relatives of the 88 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Terry Williams
said the search continued for a companion box that records data on
a plane's mechanical operation.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders are expected to help explain why the crew of
Flight 261 told controllers in the moments before the crash Monday
that their horizontal stabilizer had frozen, causing the plane to
lose altitude.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said
Wednesday night that they had interviewed four witnesses to the
crash, including three pilots of other planes, who said the Alaska
Airlines jet corkscrewed and tumbled nose-down into the ocean. The
witnesses didn't see any flames or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators interviewed Alaska Airlines employees Wednesday
about reports that a different crew had complained of problems with
the ill-fated plane's horizontal stabilizer as it headed toward
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's true - we are investigating that,'' said
John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB investigators also said they had grounded another jet
of the same type that reported a problem with its stabilizer at
13,000 feet over Phoenix on Wednesday morning. The American
Airlines jet returned to Phoenix and its flight data recorder was
immediately sent to Washington, D.C., for analysis Wednesday night.
Officials said they were taking the incident very seriously and
wouldn't let the plane resume flight until the problem was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew
apparently capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried
to troubleshoot what was going wrong, said Jim Hall, chairman of
the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of
this aircraft for a significant period of time,'' Hall said. ``It's
going to be very important to this investigation to understand why
they were unsuccessful in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kelley, chief executive officer for Alaska Airlines, said
he was unaware of any problems with the horizontal stabilizers on
the MD-83 jetliner. ``If there is a problem, they write it up.
There was nothing written or oral.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from the U.S. Navy, the NTSB deployed specialized gear
10 miles off the coast to find the recorders and recover main
pieces of the fuselage, located about 700 feet underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The pingers on the black box flight voice and data recorders
have enough battery power to last 30 days and there's no real worry
about not finding the wreckage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A 5,000-pound, unmanned submarine fitted with cameras also was
deployed to search for the recorders, finding one about 5:30 p.m.
Two other remote-controlled subs will get under way in the next day
or two, said Navy Capt. Bert Marsh, supervisor of salvage from
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, which has not been asked to bring up the entire plane,
has conducted searches in much deeper water under poorer conditions
in the past, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The roiling surf and water temperature contributed to the Coast
Guard's decision to call off its search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no survivors,'' said Coast Guard Vice Adm. Tom
Collins during a briefing at crash investigation headquarters in
Port Hueneme.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had previously estimated a person could live in the
58-degree water for about three hours before succumbing to
hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Collins
said. ``We have tried to give every chance for success in finding
survivors. I think we have reached that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard rescue operation covered about 1,100 square
miles and involved 42,000 man-hours. No one was found alive and
only four bodies have been recovered - those of an infant, two
women and a man.
</P>
<P>
   Many families still clung to the hope that their loved ones
would be miraculously found alive, even after the Coast Guard
called off its rescue mission. But as the day wore on, most began
absorbing their loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute they're very open and emotional, the next minute
their face might go blank,'' said Rob Wingate, a member of the Red
Cross Aviation Incident response team who spoke with family members
of victims at a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be families who choose to hold out hope and refuse
to believe what they're hearing, but this will always be a moment
they won't forget,'' Wingate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next days these families are going to have to make
difficult decisions. They'll have to decide how long to stay, when
to go home and whether it's worth waiting while the recovery effort
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   As many looked for ways to help the grieving families, a private
boat captain took about 15 mourners out to the watery grave, where
they tossed flowers into the blue sea.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of family members are expected to be shuttled out to the
Ventura County coast sometime today, officials said. It was unclear
whether they would be transported by boat to the wreckage site or
whether they will remain on shore. &QL;

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ Searchers on Wednesday recovered one of
the ``black boxes,'' the cockpit voice recorder, from the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed on Monday and said they had heard
electronic pinging from the other, officials said on Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard ended its search for survivors on Wednesday.
Given the water temperatures, which were in the mid-50s, and the
time that has expired since the crash, ``we have far exceeded our
estimates of survivability,'' Vice Adm. Tom Collins of the Coast
Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder will be shipped immediately to the board's
Washington offices for analysis, said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokseman
for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Wednesday night, Capt. Terry Labrecque of
the Navy, commander of the amphibious group carrying out recovery
work, said technicians had lowered a robot submarine into the water
to test it and ``as luck would have it, almost literally true, as
soon as they got down to the bottom, they found the first box.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hammerschmidt, the safety board member assigned to the
accident here, said at the briefing that investigaors had
inteviewed three pilots who saw the plane fall from the sky. He
said the three had used terms like ``tumbling, spinning, nose down,
continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted.''
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the pilots had seen smoke or fire or saw any
parts fall off the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the safety board said it was looking into a news
report of trouble on a flight earlier in the day on the same type
of plane as the one that crashed, killing 88 people.
</P>
<P>
   And another plane of the same model, an MD-83, made an emergency
return to Phoenix on Wednesday after the crew said it had problems
with the stabilizer trim, the same system that the crew of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 told air traffic controllers in Los Angeles
that they had had problems with shortly before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not disclose anything that made the cause of
the crash clear, but they did mount an intense effort to recover
parts of the plane. The searchers, who covered 4,400 miles with 38
vessels and 9 aircraft, crossing back and forth over an area about
the size of Rhode Island, found more floating debris from the MD-83
but no additional human remains. Four bodies were found on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The second black box, the flight data recorder includes data on
the position of the horizontal stabilizer, the airline has told the
safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The second MD-83 that reported a problem with its horizontal
control system was American Airlines Flight 1538, which took off
from Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix at 8:20 a.m. with 59 passengers
and crew members. The cockpit crew reported an intermittent problem
with the stabilizer trim while the plane was climbing to 13,000
feet, people involved in the incident said. The crew was able to
return the trim to a position appropriate for landing, and the
plane returned safely to Phoenix at 9:03 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   After major airline crashes, reports of similar problems from
other crews are common. After the pilots of Swissair Flight 111, an
MD-11, reported smoke in the cockpit before crashing into the
Atlantic Ocean off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998, killing
all 229 people aboard, several planes made emergency landings
because of smoke. But reports of trouble from other planes have
also helped investigators solve crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board took the Phoenix
plane's flight data recorder, and mechanics began looking at the
electric motor that drives the stabilizer trim, people involved in
the incident said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect part on the MD-83 is the forward two-thirds of the
horizontal stabilizer, the wing-like section of the tail. It is
driven by an electric motor and a jack-screw, similar to the kind
that raises and lowers garage doors. Pilots use the stabilizer to
enable the plane to climb, cruise or descend; for quick changes,
they use moveable parts, called elevators, that make up the rear
third of the horizontal stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Alaska Flight 261, bound from the Mexican resort of
Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco and then to Seattle, had reported
that its horizontal stabilizer had jammed, the safety board said.
Pilots who fly the MD-80 series said on Wednesday that the
stabilizer could have jammed soon after takeoff, but the autopilot
might have masked the problem for a time by using the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch of the plane _ the nose-up or nose-down attitude _
changes with the plane's speed and its center of gravity, which
changes as the plane burns fuel. Pilots said that if the Alaska
Airlines plane gained speed and burned fuel, reaching the point
where the autopilot could no longer compensate, it would switch
off, leaving the crew to determine through their instruments or by
looking out the window what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flying along fat, dumb and happy, and then the autopilot
kicks off and everything is kind of, boom, boom, boom,'' one MD-80
captain said. ``In flight simulators, when we train for this, this
is one of the more deceptive onsets of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree of threat posed by a jammed stabilizer may depend on
the position in which the stabilizer is jammed, pilots say. Many
planes have recovered from such jams. The first line of defense
would be the elevators, which on the MD-80 series are operated by
cables that run back to the pilots' yokes in the cockpit, and also
have hydraulic boost pumps.
</P>
<P>
   If the device jammed in a nose-up position, a crew could
temporarily compensate by banking and putting the plane into a
turn, which would turn the lifting force of the wings somewhat to
the side, making the nose fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said investigators were checking into a news
report that the crew that flew the plane to Puerto Vallarta had
reported ``some mechanical discrepancies.'' He said that he did not
know if the report was true but that investigators wanted to
interview the crew as soon as possible. Such interviews are
standard procedure after crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said the board expected to interview the Puerto
Vallarta ground personnel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After planning an emergency approach to Los Angeles, the pilots
of Alaska Flight 261 radioed that they were going to
``reconfigure'' the airplane. It was their last transmission.

SEARCHERS RECOVER BLACK BOX

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. - Searchers recovered one of the black-box
recorders late Wednesday that could explain why Alaskan Airlines
Flight 261 crashed, while investigators focused on reports of
previous mechanical problems with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the cockpit voice recorder came after the Coast
Guard decided to call off its search for survivors, over the
protests of some relatives of the 88 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Terry Williams
said the search continued for a companion box that records data on
a plane's mechanical operation.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders are expected to help explain why the crew of
Flight 261 told controllers in the moments before the crash Monday
that their horizontal stabilizer had frozen, causing the plane to
lose altitude.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said
Wednesday night that they had interviewed four witnesses to the
crash, including three pilots of other planes, who said the Alaska
Airlines jet corkscrewed and tumbled nose-down into the ocean. The
witnesses didn't see any flames or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators interviewed Alaska Airlines employees Wednesday
about reports that a different crew had complained of problems with
the ill-fated plane's horizontal stabilizer as it headed toward
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's true - we are investigating that,'' said
John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB investigators also said they had grounded another jet
of the same type that reported a problem with its stabilizer at
13,000 feet over Phoenix on Wednesday morning. The American
Airlines jet returned to Phoenix and its flight data recorder was
immediately sent to Washington, D.C., for analysis Wednesday night.
Officials said they were taking the incident very seriously and
wouldn't let the plane resume flight until the problem was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew
apparently capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried
to troubleshoot what was going wrong, said Jim Hall, chairman of
the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of
this aircraft for a significant period of time,'' Hall said. ``It's
going to be very important to this investigation to understand why
they were unsuccessful in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kelley, chief executive officer for Alaska Airlines, said
he was unaware of any problems with the horizontal stabilizers on
the MD-83 jetliner. ``If there is a problem, they write it up.
There was nothing written or oral.''
</P>

   With help from the U.S. Navy, the NTSB deployed specialized gear
10 miles off the coast to find the recorders and recover main
pieces of the fuselage, located about 700 feet underwater.

has conducted searches in much deeper water under poorer conditions
in the past, officials said.

FAMILIES, FRIENDS PAINFULLY ACCEPT LOSS

<P>
   With the search for Flight 261 survivors abandoned, families of
the 88 passengers and crew prepared to visit the crash site in
hopes of easing their grief.
</P>
<P>
   They included Fred Ost, who traveled from Skokie, Ill., to be
closer to where five relatives died Monday when the ill-fated
Alaska Airlines flight plunged into the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have been too much. For it to be five - I cannot
even describe it,'' said a tearful Ost, 47. ``I want to go out on a
boat and reflect, remember and place a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines will help bus families to the shore Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to be doing is promoting silence, a moment of
prayers, a moment of thought of those families and friends,'' said
John Kelley, the airline's chief executive officer. A memorial is
scheduled for Saturday, at a time and place to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of their tremendous losses began to set in,
family members braced Wednesday for the grim task of working with
coroners' investigators to identify loved ones. In a private
meeting with about 100 people, investigators said they would ask
families for dental records, hair samples and other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying,'' said Greg Ford, a brother-in-law
of one victim, Bob Ost, 39, a San Mateo firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Ost was killed with his wife, Ileana; their 4-month-old
daughter, Emily; Ost's mother, Jean Permison, 73, of Scotts Valley;
and her companion of 10 years, Charles Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The five had gone to Puerto Vallarta last week to celebrate
Permison's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my mom's 73rd birthday, and Bob thought it would be
nice to take her and Charlie away for a couple of days,'' said
Janis Ost Ford, 36, Permison's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said she expected her mother to return in time for a
birthday dinner Tuesday with Russell. Instead, she grieved their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is going to make me a different person. Our life
is going to be very different from now,'' she said in between
floods of tears at her hotel room. ``I just want to know that our
family members didn't suffer and it was fast. To lose your family
nembers, you always think this stuff happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis Ford said closure will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with kids all the time and I'm up all the time, but I
don't feel a smile in here,'' she said, holding the edges of her
mouth with her hands. ``And I miss my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim in the crash, Renato Bermudez, was described as a
well-liked firefighter whose mother had recently bought a house in
Granada Hills. He was heading home from a visit to his girlfriend,
who was spending the winter near Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Francisco, Bermudez was named Firefighter of the
Year in 1999 for rescuing an elderly man from the second floor of a
burning building in the Mission District on July 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a passionate, literate man who loved his work and was
proud of the team he was part of,'' said Jim Gallagher, a retired
firefighter who worked with Bermudez. ``He used to volunteer his
time training other firefighters and trainees in a running program
we had in Golden Gate Park.'' &QL;

FLOWERS FLOAT ATOP DEADLY SEA

 and DAVID GREENBERG

 PORT HUENEME, Calif. - Touched by the deaths of the 88 people
aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Ventura County residents sought
Wednesday to express their grief, sharing prayers and thoughts for
the victims and their families.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some have erected makeshift memorials on the beaches in honor of
the 88 who died, while others have tossed flowers into the waters
off the Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Huarte, 23, of Oxnard, Calif., arrived with a fellow
Oxnard College classmate to throw a dozen roses into the sea, where
the MD-83 plunged about 4:20 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt like we wanted to do something to remember the
lives that were lost here, especially since it's so close to
home,'' Huarte said. ``Roses symbolize life. It's a way of honoring
their lives and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of tragedy makes it difficult to have a traditional
burial. Flowers are traditionally brought to a cemetery, but here
you can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Touched by the tragedy, Port Hueneme resident Kim Gunter has
organized a candlelight vigil to begin at 5 p.m. Thursday at the
Port Hueneme pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt really touched by the fact that these people had
perished. I know that families need a place to go to grieve,'' said
Gunter, a 47-year- old dental hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had anything like this happen out here,'' she
said. ``Everything's always been fun-loving and jovial and happy.
This makes us think a lot more about the brevity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is planning a public
memorial service for later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hueneme School District, superintendent Robert Fraisse
said he was monitoring his campuses daily to see whether students
and staffers need emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   Beach Elementary School students have raised the most questions
because the campus is closest to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fears that are coming up are things like the helicopters -
why there are so many over the children's homes at night - as
opposed to the crash itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're checking in with all the principals to monitor the
situation every day,'' Fraisse said. ``But we don't want to create
a problem. We're trying to maintain business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret Pepe, a psychologist who volunteers with the Red
Cross to provide disaster counseling, said the transition in the
search, from hope of rescue to recovery of bodies, is an extremely
emotional one, a critical time for some family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reluctance on the part of some family members to
give up the belief there is hope,'' she said from the Red Cross
headquarters in Virginia. ``For some it is a very strong moment of
despair. It forces them to give up that part of denial, and some
don't make that transition at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some others, they have moved there intellectually
already,'' she added. ``Some of us realize that, even though we're
not ready yet, we are going to have to face it and accept it
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Another movement toward closure for the victims' families, she
said, is the site visit they will be making today with the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe said this group has, for the most part, been insistent
about going to the crash site, wanting to be close to their loved
ones one last time.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the experience, while cathartic for some, may
create memories that will stay with them for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are exposed to some rather nasty and unattractive remains
of the plane,'' she said. ``They smell airplane fuel, see fragments
of the foam that made up the seats. They see very graphic reminders
of the violence with which their loved ones died.''
</P>
<P>
   But many feel a need to see the wreckage for a sense of closure,
of being close to the moment of death, so that they can move on
into the next process of grief, Pepe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has several dozen mental health workers - licensed
psychologists, social workers, mental health counselors, marriage
and family therapists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses -
assigned to help relatives and family members of the crash victims
deal with their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Irby, spokesman for the Red Cross, said four California
Red Cross chapters, as well as chapters in Seattle and Alaska, are
providing emotional support for search teams and the victims'
families who have arrived in Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mental health workers act as advocates for the
family and move with them every step of the way, so the
organization usually assigns one worker to each family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this time is one of devastation, and different
families go through different cycles of grief,'' Irby said. ``It's
important to have one person assigned to a family to have the
history of where they're at in the grieving process. Some want a
lot of information. Others don't want very much information at all

   The mental health worker can get an idea of the family dynamic

   ``It's not really a long list of things they need to do, but one
that is challenging for many family members,'' said Pepe, who
worked with relatives of passengers on EgyptAir Flight 990, which
crashed last Halloween. ``They hadn't thought they were going to
have to describe in detail the clothes their loved ones were
wearing, what kind of luggage they had. Did they have carry-ons?
</P>
<P>
   ``They eventually get down to writing,'' she added. ``And my son
was carrying a brown teddy bear that was 18 inches long - they're
not prepared for that kind of detail.''

HEAT EDGE CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You take the bruises and the disappointment and you put them in
the memory bank. Maybe you allow yourself another look, but you
know there will not be another chance. Not until the next time.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Celtics took away from Wednesday night's
crusher, a 105-103 loss to Miami that, like the night before in
Indiana, went down to the last shot. They rallied from a 12-point
hole in the fourth quarter and had two shots in their final
possession to tie or win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The first, by Paul Pierce, rimmed out. The second, a deliberate,
step-back trey by Antoine Walker, was short. The horn sounded and
the Celtics were again left to explain how they someday soon might
learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't,'' Pierce said, ``it's going to be a long
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Celtics' fifth in six games and second to Miami
in eight days. They missed a chance to pick up ground on the
Pistons, who continue to leave the door wide open. They missed a
lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, for instance. He had 35 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists,
and was booed. The reason? He missed five free throws in the fourth
quarter and after the fifth miss, the rebound came back to him and
he unhesitatingly squeezed off a 3-pointer. It boinged away.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce seemingly played three or four games in one. He was
almost invisible in the first quarter and almost unstoppable in the
second, when he made 8 of 9 shots and had 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he missed his next seven shots and bricked 9 of his last
10. But he also made a huge trey with 1:28 to play that brought the
Celtics all the way back and tied the game at 101.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Heat were reeling. They had gone more than
seven minutes without a field goal in frittering away their
12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But they never lost the lead. Pierce's trey electrified the
crowd, but also jolted Miami out of its offensive stupor.
</P>
<P>
   On the Heat's next possession, Clarence Weatherspoon popped open
and hit a 12-footer with 1:08 left. Kenny Anderson, who had another
strong game, tied it with a second-chancer with 37.8 seconds left.
Then the resolute Alonzo Mourning, whose shot was not dropping all
night, coaxed in a jump hook after bobbling the pass. There were
15.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a random play,'' Tim Hardaway said. ``It turned
out to be a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino had a timeout available, but he decided not to use
it. Pierce hoisted his shot, but it was wide left. Then Walker got
the rebound on the baseline. He had two choices: go back up and try
to tie the game or dribble back to international waters and try to
win the game. He chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good decision,'' mused Anderson. ``It shows he has (guts).
He'd have won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pierce, ``I have total confidence in him taking that shot.
I'd want him to take it 10 times out of 10. I thought it was going
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Celtics could look at many areas from which they
could learn something. How, for instance, not to start a half. They
opened the third quarter missing their first 10 shots and turning
it over three more times. They fell behind by 16.
</P>
<P>
   That was the hole from which they could not extricate
themselves. They trailed by 10 entering the fourth, only the
seventh time in 23 home games this season that they have been in
arrears after three quarters. They managed to win three of those
games, including the last time when they were in such a position
against Toronto a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Miami drought. After Mark Strickland opened the
quarter with an alley-oop dunk, the Heat missed their next 10
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played hard,'' Hardaway said. ``We couldn't get anything
going. We turned it over. That's how they got back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, the Celtics also made it unnecessarily hard on
themselves. Walker missed the five free throws. They shot 36
percent from the field. But in spite of themselves, they got a
chance to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremendous, tremendous effort,'' saluted Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   The effort got them back. It wasn't enough to get them all the
way back. Miami didn't make a lot of plays in the quarter, but it
made the big ones in the final 70 seconds.

   LAMA-RIVALS (Rumtek, India) _ Deshin Shekpa was born during the
year of the male wood mouse (1384), and it is said he could be
heard chanting a mantra and reciting the alphabet while still
inside his mother's womb. At the moment of his birth, he boldly
proclaimed himself to be the fifth incarnation of the Karmapa, one
of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest figures. Now, two rival incarnations
have strained relations between India and China, and one lama says:
``Buddha would not be laughing right now. This is all about
politics. It's a story filled with many traitors and betrayals.''

according to the first published survey of parents whose sons or

Using cobalt atoms as building blocks, they erected an elliptically

of a copper crystal. Then they used the walls of the enclosure as a
tiny hall of mirrors, projecting a single atom to another spot on
the crystal, creating what they call a ``quantum mirage.'' The
technique might conceivably be used as a kind of remote sensing
device, or might someday be perfected into a means of sending
signals inside a future generation of nanoscopic computer chips too
small to make use of conventional wires. By George Johnson.

few weeks. According to LaTulippe and some other hockey players,
his teammates subjected LaTulippe to severe hazing. LaTulippe quit
school soon afterward and filed a lawsuit against the university
that has set off a spiral of events still reverberating across the
school and the state. The state attorney general launched a
criminal investigation. And when it became clear that veteran
hockey players had lied during an earlier investigation of the
hazing, the university president took a bold and unprecedented
step: She canceled the college hockey season with two months to go.

TCU `BUMPS UP' STATURE WITH QUALITY RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To the victors go the spoils. Considering
the victories on the football field for TCU the past two seasons,
the Horned Frogs are spoiling themselves rotten.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione waited patiently for 3 1/2 hours
yesterday morning as faxes from 18 future Frogs streamed into the
football office. Sixteen of the 18 compose the 2000 recruiting
class, with one looking to join the team in 2001 and another in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Frogs had only 16 scholarships available because of
their small senior class, the 2000 class isn't lacking in flash.
Seven members are rated among the /Star-Telegram/'s State Top 100
recruits and two _ Irving tailback Tyson Thompson and Carrollton
Newman Smith defensive tackle Brandon Johnson _ are among the
nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This class may lack a little bit in the quantity in numbers,
but it has great quality,'' Franchione said. ``We feel like we have
bumped our recruiting up a notch to a level higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Johnson tower as the class of this class.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who rushed for 5,758 yards and 51 touchdowns in his
Irving career, made /Parade/ magazine and /USA Today/ first-team
All-America. Rivals100.com ranked Johnson as No. 20 nationally
among defensive tackles. Franchione said their early commitments
made it easier for others to choose TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the high-profile kids, our success with the back-to-back
bowl victories, the conference championship and back-to-back
winning seasons, it has gotten easier for them to say, `I'm going
to TCU,' '' said Franchione, 15-9 in two seasons at TCU. ``Much
more so than it was probably a couple years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive postseason victories _ the Sun Bowl in 1998 and
Mobile Alabama Bowl this past December _ helped greatly, Franchione
said. The Frogs went 8-4 last season, claimed a share of the
Western Athletic Conference title and finished just outside the
AP's final Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, TCU is definitely a program on the rise,'' said
Johnson, who turned down several suitors, including Michigan,
Miami, Texas and Texas A&AMP;M. ``Some of the schools I visited are
already established, and I decided I wanted to be part of a
tradition I helped build.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione and his staff are building that tradition largely
with Fort Worth-Dallas area talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 11 of our guys are probably within 100 miles of the
Metroplex,'' Franchione said. ``So we are continuing to make an
impact and make a strong presence in this area, which is home base
for us. It's important for us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson couldn't resist the lure of having his family in the
stands for every home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your family is your biggest supporter, and you want to share
something with them,'' Johnson said. ``I wanted them to see me
play.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, TCU concentrated on tackles and safeties, areas
Franchione said they struggled to recruit a year ago. San Antonio
Taft safety Marvin Godbolt (6-1, 188) and Galveston Ball linebacker
Derrick Pope (6-0, 195) might find themselves playing key roles as
early as next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's philosophy is to redshirt freshmen whenever
possible. Of the 22 members of the 1999 class, he redshirted 20,
and only starting quarterback Casey Printers saw significant
playing time. Of the current group of 16, Franchione expects only a
handful to get on the field this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Darrell Catlin of Waco is headed to junior college
with hopes of re-signing with TCU in two years. Weatherford
quarterback Zack Moore is planning to enroll at TCU in January 2001
and will count against the 2001 scholarship limit.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Franchione wanted tailbacks in the mold of
record-breaker LaDainian Tomlinson as well as bigger wide
receivers. Franchione got the tailbacks he wanted in Thompson and
Omaha Pewitt's Kenny Boyd. Thompson still hasn't qualified
academically, but will be accepted as a partial qualifier if he
doesn't reach the required test scores. Wide receivers Reggie
Harrell (6-3, 200) and Reuben Randle (6-5, 200) offer Printers some
big targets.

SYRACUSE STILL ROLLING AFTER CUPCAKES SLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this one before:
</P>
<P>
   A team mostly ignored in the preseason, playing in an Eastern
time zone conference that has taken some hits in the respect
department, gets off to an undefeated start thanks to a soft
nonconference schedule featuring a bunch of home games that leads
to talk of a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a summary of Virginia Tech's football season, right?
Well, Syracuse is doing a fair basketball imitation of the Hokies.
The Orangemen weren't considered national title hopefuls before the
season. And, despite producing national champion Connecticut last
season, the Big East Conference has dropped a peg or two on the
national scene.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Boeheim set up a cupcake home schedule that helped his
team fast-break to a 10-0 record. Now, the Orangemen are 18-0 and
ranked No. 4. They appear headed for a No. 1 seed and have become
one of the favorites to succeed the Huskies as national champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't pay attention to the hype, whether it's good or
bad,'' said senior center Etan Thomas, a product of Tulsa's Booker
T. Washington High School. ``When you're playing well, everyone
loves you, and Dick Vitale goes crazy about you. When you're going
bad, everyone brushes you off to the side, saying you need to do
`this' differently or you need to do `that' differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is that this team is really not paying
attention to it, either way. You can't. You'd drive yourself crazy.
If you have a bad game, the papers kill you. Have a great game,
they hype you to where you're the next \RMichael\S Jordan. You have
to be level-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen have two impressive victories against Big East
contenders Connecticut and St. John's. Syracuse has a veteran point
guard in Jason Hart, athletic wing players and a tough front court.
The 6-foot-9, 260-pound Thomas controls the middle. He leads a
balanced scoring attack with nearly 14.9 points a game. He's making
64.3 percent of his shots, averages 8.6 rebounds and 4.1 blocked
shots a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are rolling pretty well right now,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some good omens. When Syracuse reached the Final
Four in 1987 and 1996 _ playing in the championship game each time
_ the Orangemen played in the Great Alaska Shootout the following
seasons. Syracuse has agreed to play in next season's Great Alaska
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   And Hart is wearing a pair of throwback orange-and-white Nikes,
the kind worn by point guard Sherman Douglas during the 1986-87
season. Though Hart's teammates want to put him on the worst
dressed list, he points out that emulating Douglas is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up playing in the national championship game,'' Hart
said.
Spotlight
Florida State's big man creating noisy practices Last season,
Florida State's practices were quiet around the basket. This
season, there are quite a few more grunts and groans. It's not
exactly a WWF Throwdown, but it's quite a bit more physical when
the Seminoles bump and grind.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the extra contact is that coach Steve
Robinson has some post players. And one of the newcomers is big.
Really big. Freshman Nigel Dixon is 6-10 and ... well, he's now
down to 375 pounds. When practice started in October, Dixon _
nickname: Big Jelly _ weighed in around 425 pounds. He wears a size
22 shoe and his uniform pants had to be custom-tailored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's contributing quite a bit and not all of it are his grunts
and groans,'' Robinson said. ``I like to hear that noise. And one
of the reasons for that is Nigel. He's tough to get around
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson considered redshirting Dixon, but instead has been
playing him in short hockey-like shifts that last about two
minutes. Dixon has had to lose weight and increase his conditioning
so that he can keep pace with the Atlantic Coast Conference
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pleased with the progress Nigel's been making,''
Robinson said. ``He's starting to understand just how competitive
the league is and how competitive you have to be every time you
step on the floor. We've given him more and more opportunities to
get out there on the floor, and he's really responded well. We've
got to keep giving him those chances and see how he handles that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to continue to get in shape and get in better shape.
Nigel's in the best shape he's probably ever been in as far as
playing basketball. He has a very large frame, trying to move that
frame around at the pace that we go takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who is from Orlando, Fla., averaged 14.9 points and 11.1
rebounds per game last season at Edgewater High School. This season
for the Seminoles, he's averaging 4.7 minutes, 1.4 points and 1.7
rebounds per game.
Fast breaks A tough sell Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill, who had
successful coaching stops at Marquette and Tennessee, is regarded
as one of the nation's top recruiters. He gained the reputation as
an assistant coach at Arizona. But he is facing perhaps his
greatest challenge in trying to make the Wildcats into a Big Ten
Conference contender.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Wildcats have four freshmen starters and six
freshmen among their top eight players. They're 4-15 overall, 0-7
in the Big Ten Conference. And when it comes to selling tradition,
O'Neill has little ammunition at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely the biggest thing is recruiting against
tradition,'' O'Neill said. ``We've had three postseason bids in our
history. Every time we get down to the last two \Rschools\S, on
recruiting like we did four or five times in the fall, everybody
says: `Look at their record over the last 50 years. ... You're
going to go there and lose.''' Riding a Green Wave Sometimes, a
single shot can make the difference in a season. That's been the
case with Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave opened with a 9-1 nonconference record, then lost
its first three Conference USA games. They were headed for an 0-4
start, trailing at Southern Mississippi. But senior forward
Sterling Davis of Duncanville sank a buzzer-beating 3-pointer for a
54-53 victory.
</P>
<P>
   That victory has helped boost Tulane _ which was a disappointing
13-15 last season _ into NCAA Tournament contention. The Green Wave
is 15-4 overall and leading C-USA's National Division with a 4-3
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were an 0-3 team at that time,'' coach Perry
Clark said of the Southern Mississippi victory. ``I'm pleased with
the way we've handled the opportunity that shot has given us. The
chemistry has really been the biggest thing for us. The chemistry
on the court and in the locker room is a lot better.''
Layups The Mountain West and Western Athletic conferences should
regain their NCAA Tournament automatic bids for the 2001
tournament. The NCAA Management Council forwarded a proposed rule
change that would redefine a ``new'' conference. The NCAA's Board
of Directors will consider the rule change in April. The new rule
would waive the five-year waiting period needed to earn an
automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   California spent $65 million to renovate Harmon Gym and turn it
into Haas Pavilion. Apparently, some of that money was spent on
super-sensitive smoke detectors. Three times this season, the
building has been evacuated when light smoke from concession stands
has set off the alarms. The Bears are 3-0 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford freshman forward Casey Jacobsen has a problem most
teen-agers can relate to. He's an 18-year-old with acne. That means
that Jacobsen often gets special attention from opposing fans. At
Oregon, fans in the student section chanted ``Oxy 10.'' At
California, students held up a blown-up mug shot of Jacobsen with
the word ``Zits'' written above it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's retire the worst postgame news conference question award
right now. After South Carolina lost to Vanderbilt on two free
throws by Dan Langhi with three-tenths of a second remaining,
Gamecocks coach Eddie Fogler was asked if he wanted to
intentionally foul Langhi, who is making 88 percent of his free
throws. ``That's the worst \Rexpletive\S questions I've ever
heard,'' Fogler said. Agreed.
Trash talk Arizona State freshman guard Tanner Shell on the team's
four-game losing streak:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate losing. Losing is worse than death pretty much. You
have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina junior center Brendan Haywood remembering how
Dean Smith was criticized for three consecutive conference losses
during his final season, and the current heat on coach Bill
Guthridge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all that Dean Smith did for the program and the
university as a whole, people were saying Dean Smith needed to
retire; they were basically asking for Dean Smith to be fired
because he lost three games. You can expect no less now. It's
unfortunate and definitely unfair, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins, responding to a comment by South
Florida coach Seth Greenberg, who compared the Bearcats to the 1990
and 1991 Nevada-Las Vegas teams:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Seth get hit in the head? I don't see that, but I see my
guys every day. I kind of know. I think Seth's quote in the paper
was he hadn't watched a lot of film on us. That's kind of
obvious.''
Numbers game 2-15 _ Louisiana State's record in Southeastern
Conference games against Arkansas after the Tigers' 96-75 defeat of
the Razorbacks. Arkansas' 15 victories have been by an average of
11 points.
</P>
<P>

Texas wins decisive edge in Big 12 recruiting 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few truths are self-evident in the inexact world of recruiting.
But this one is clear-cut, based on yesterday's influx of national
Top 100 signees to Big 12 football programs:
</P>
<P>
   Texas landed a haymaker with its most recent signing class.
Comparatively speaking, no one in the South Division punched back.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were plenty of heralded recruits who signed with
South Division rivals, most notably Oklahoma and Texas A&AMP;M. But one
statistic screams louder than the rest: Of nine players from the
``Star-Telegram'' National Top 100 list who signed with South
Division schools, seven selected Texas. No other school had more
than one.
</P>
<P>
   When push comes to shove, these are the difference-makers who
decide championships. And it has been many a moon since Texas
lapped the field so thoroughly against its closest conference
rivals in collecting the bluest of the blue-chip players.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, when the Longhorns' recruiting class was rated
as the nation's best by most analysts, Texas A&AMP;M answered with a
class that ranked fifth nationally. In 1999, Texas landed eight
members of the national Top 100 and A&AMP;M signed four.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the disparity widened. Texas' 23-player class is
considered a consensus top-five by recruiting analysts. A&AMP;M needed
two 11th-hour signatures from a pair of heralded defensive linemen
to squeeze into the Top 25. Oklahoma, with its best showing in
Texas since 1994, cracked the Top 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to say Texas clearly won this year,'' said
recruiting analyst Bobby Burton, director of the Rivals100.com Web
site. ``They had a great follow-up year. It was almost impossible
for them to match (1999). But, with very few exceptions, they did a
tremendous job.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowning achievement was a sweep of the state's top three
receivers: B.J. Johnson, Roy Williams and Sloan Thomas, all three
national Top 100 prospects. All three fit Texas' most pressing need
on offense. All three were highly coveted by A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum,
who identified receiver as ``the one area where we had some
disappointments'' in the Aggies' 22-member signing class.
</P>
<P>
   Burton pointed to the Longhorns' sweep of the heralded trio as
``the story of the year'' on the local recruiting front. Others
might focus on the fact that A&AMP;M's nine-player haul from the state
Top 100 list ranks as the Aggies' skimpiest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, this is A&AMP;M's least-heralded class in Slocum's
12 years at the school. But it's still good enough to crack the
national Top 25, which gives you an idea how high the bar has been
set.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the dropoff will be greeted with angst by some A&AMP;M
fans who sense the state's recruiting pendulum swinging toward
Texas. It's a viable concern, but one that recruiting analysts deem
premature ... for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to raise the flag of surrender,'' said Jeremy
Crabtree, director of Big 12 Blitz, a recruiting site for
Rivals100.com. ``But this was the first time in a long time that
we've seen some major separation between the two \Rclasses\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, for one, considers the Aggies' haul undervalued by
outsiders. Just the same, most analysts rank A&AMP;M's class as
fifth-best in the Big 12 _ behind Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Colorado. A&AMP;M is downgraded for a lack of offensive firepower, with
wide receiver Robert Ferguson considered the only dangerous
playmaker among the signees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't pay attention to those rankings,'' Slocum said.
``I've been recruiting long enough to know that a whole lot of this
is a guess, anyway. We don't claim to be authorities. But these are
guys who we feel good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska coach Frank Solich would be feeling better this morning
if the Cornhuskers had not lost two Texas-based recruits to other
schools yesterday. San Antonio native Carlyle Holiday signed with
Notre Dame, leaving Nebraska without a quarterback in its
recruiting class, and safety Adrian Mayes, a Houston resident,
broke his Nebraska commitment and signed with Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the defending conference champs pieced together a class
ranked among the nation's top 10. Texas was the only other Big 12
school among that group, a status embraced by Longhorns coach Mack
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's class has been as good as celebrated,'' Brown
said. ``We feel like this year's class can be every bit as good. To
reach our goal of winning every game and being the best team in the
country, we need to continue to bring in full classes like we have
the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   By all available measuring sticks, Texas certainly widened the
gap between itself and its South Division peers yesterday.

RODMAN EXPECTED TO SIGN WITH MAVS, BUT DEBUT UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dennis Rodman doesn't yet have a one-year contract for
a place to play, but he does have a four-month lease on a place to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, expected to sign with the Mavericks today and possibly
play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets at Reunion Arena, has
accepted Mark Cuban's offer to stay in his 4,000-square-foot guest
house adjacent to his Preston Hollow mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The price? $3,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the salary-cap rules, I've got to charge him
something,'' Cuban, the Mavericks' owner pending NBA approval, said
yesterday afternoon while shooting baskets on his outdoor court.
``He can stay through the end of the season if he wants. But it's
not just him. I made that offer to any player.''
</P>
<P>
   Having already made unprecedented concessions allowing Rodman to
show up for games later than teammates and ride a stationary bike
during practice, Cuban defended his latest red-carpet treatment of
the 38-year-old cross-dressing forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not special privileges,'' Cuban insisted. ``I'm flying
the guys \RMichael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and Hubert Davis\R and
their families to All-Star Weekend in my plane. I'm letting Greg
Buckner pay to drive one of my cars. I'd do anything to make my
players feel more comfortable and more productive. That's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Making Rodman more cozy started yesterday with one of Cuban's
assistants going on a Rodzilla shopping spree. Not surprisingly at
the top of the list: dark, block-out-the-sun curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do whatever he wants to, stay out all night long,''
Cuban joked. ``As long as at games he helps us win, and I know he
can and will. There won't be any curfews or bed checks, and if he's
late with the rent, I'll just charge him some interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who is host to agent Steve Chasman in his new digs this
week, passed his physical yesterday and began the process of
returning to basketball shape. He could be ready tonight or, more
likely, next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether he still has the same skill level he
had when he played with the Bulls,'' coach/general manager Don
Nelson said. ``I imagine he has lost a little, but we would still
think he is good enough and dominant enough at what he does to be a
major factor. It is kind of a no-brainer on picking up a
potentially very good player for our team for really nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's contract for the remainder of the season will be
$463,410 if he signs before tonight's game, or minus $12,195 for
each game afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said Rodman's debut will occur without the glitzy media
blitz usually associated with the NBA's most tattooed player and
ferocious rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to minimize the distractions until he starts playing,''
said Cuban, who indicated Rodman would be introduced at a game
instead of a pregame news conference. ``The first time you'll see
him, he'll be grabbing a rebound in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks could use some; they are being outrebounded by an
average of 8.8 per game. But how will Rodman's defensive abilities
fit on the NBA's fifth-ranked scoring offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive part is real simple because all of our plays
take place on the weak side,'' Nelson said. ``It is real simple to
set screens on the weak side and go to the glass. That is what
\RRodman\S does anyway. We'll make it real simple on the offensive
end for him and let his skills take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said NBA rules limiting contact in the paint won't
affect Rodman's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rules limiting physical play at the beginning of the
season is history,'' he said. ``As we go into the middle of the
season, it is more the same-old same-old.''

ANGELS, MARINERS TALK ABOUT EDMONDS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angels are talking with the Seattle Mariners about a
possible trade of center fielder Jim Edmonds, which would be
contigent on the Mariners first trading Ken Griffey Jr. to the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are seeking pitching and prospects from the Mariners
for Edmonds, but the price might be too high for Seattle GM Pat
Gillick considering Edmonds, according to a source, would not
re-sign with Seattle once the 2000 season is over and he is a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Mariners players the Angels are interested in is
pitcher John Halama, who went 11-10 in his rookie season last year.
Ironically, he was one of the players the Houston Astros gave up
for Randy Johnson, only to lose Johnson to free agency after the
season. The same thing would happen to the Mariners if they trade
for Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' agent Paul Cohen would not speak specifically on a
potential trade with the Mariners or any other team, but said
Edmonds is looking forward to the upcoming season and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, he and I are both planning that in seven months
he'll be a free agent,'' Cohen said. ``Having said that, he's going
to give 110 percent to the fans and his teammates if he's here. But
the concept of playing in Anaheim is not appealing because a lot of
issues have not been handled properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen would not be specific on what issues, but when asked if
they were issues directly pertaining to Edmonds or were team
issues, he said: ``Both.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds continues to work out rigorously in preparation for the
season, including skating at Disney Ice to build up his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's enamored with the fans and he's loyal to his teammates,''
Cohen said. ``If he's here, I expect him to have a fantastic
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels GM Bill Stoneman said he continues to talk to teams about
possible trades, but said he feels no pressure to get something
done before spring training opens in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a deal is available to help us, we'll do it,'' Stoneman
said. ``I'm not worried about when we do it. You can speak of
ideals, but we don't live in that world. We continue to have
discussions and there are a lot of them being discussed now.''

TOMMIE SMITH: SNAPS FROM   A STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Please, have a seat and make yourselves
comfortable. Our slide show will begin shortly. But first, a brief
explanation, lest you're wondering why we've brought you to this
tired old room inside the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The floor outside the door has been a launching pad for many of
the world's finest sprinters over the years, all participants in
the Los Angeles Invitational that will take place for the 40th year
in this building later this month.
</P>
<P>
   We are privileged to have in our midst one of the greatest
runners ever to scorch the Invitational's straightaways. He is
truly one of the more remarkable athletes and activists of our
time, an African-American man who let his conscience be his guide
and in doing so helped make the world safe for Michael Jordan's
signature sneakers and Ricky Williams' dreadlocks; Ken Griffey
Jr.'s marketability and Tiger Woods' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   We're speaking of Tommie Smith, who broke 11 world records in
his day. He has amazing acceleration, but that's probably not what
you remember. Most people recognize him for something he did while
standing still as the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Smith won the 200 meters,
then raised his black-gloved right fist to the sky on the awards
podium during the playing of the U.S. anthem.
</P>
<P>
   That picture, which found its way into papers and magazines all
over the world, launched a thousand tirades, not to mention
hundreds of rocks, bottles and coins and a few death threats. It is
the lasting image many people have of Smith. He'd prefer that you
picture him as the college-educated son of a sharecropper or a
longtime teacher and coach at Santa Monica College.
</P>
<P>
   But if the black glove fits, you can't quit addressing it.
Especially on the third day of Black History Month. Isn't that
right, Tommie?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed. So that's where I might as well start.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Click(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems most everybody I meet has seen this picture. I'm on
the Olympic awards podium in Mexico City in stocking feet, my head
bowed and my right fist raised. My teammate John Carlos, who
finished third, is standing behind me, also in stocking feet with
his left fist raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is, this wasn't a spontaneous
act of rebellion. We had been planning some kind of civil-rights
protest for a year and a half. People think it was a gesture of
hate, but it wasn't. It was a gesture of frustration over the
social inequities that existed in this country at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my country and I wanted it to be well, more perfect.
But a lot of people looked at me like I was a malignant piece of
humanity for doing what I did. It was really tough. I was shunned
for years after the Olympics. I had a hard time finding work.''

STANFORD D EARNS AN A-PLUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins might not defeat Stanford tonight
at Pauley Pavilion. They might not play well and they might not
play hard. They might not rebound well, pass well or defend well,
but they'll probably score.
</P>
<P>
   As in, make a basket.
</P>
<P>
   As in, avoid a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   This is no joke. Stanford's defense is that good.
</P>
<P>
   Through 18 games, the Cardinal has the best statistical defense
!ital!in college basketball history!off!. Opponents are shooting
33.1 percent against Stanford. The NCAA record for field-goal
defense is 35.8 percent, set by Marquette in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Only three opponents have shot better than 40 percent against
Stanford this season. No one has shot better than 50.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Cardinal (17-1, 6-1) leads the Pac-10 in
scoring defense, field-goal defense, 3-point field-goal defense,
rebounding, rebounding margin, defensive rebounds and blocked
shots. It has made 30 more free throws than its opponents have
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the Bruins probably aren't in danger of a shutout.
After all, Washington State scored 38 points on the Cardinal.
Oregon State scored 45. Tenth-ranked Auburn scored 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it partly out of necessity,'' Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. ``We're not always real smooth offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Montgomery's first dynamite defense; Stanford held
opponents to 38 percent shooting last year, a Pac-10 record for six
more weeks. But it's unquestionably his best _ a perfect
convergence of talent and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's defense is nearly risk-free. The Cardinal does not
fall for pump fakes and it does not gamble for passes. (Stanford
was last in the Pac-10 in steals last season and it's last this
season.) Instead, the guards are instructed to play sound, nose-to-
nose defense, put a hand in the shooter's face and prevent
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Those principles aren't unique. What makes Stanford's defense
different is the responsibility given to the big men. The guards
are not allowed to help when the ball enters the low post, there
are no double-teams, and switching is forbidden. That means
opposing guards are never open on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   With 6-8 Mark Madsen, 6-10 Jarron Collins, 6-11 Jason Collins
and 6-11 Curtis Borchardt, Stanford has the shot-blockers to make
the system work. (It leads the league with 6.11 blocks per game.)
There are arms everywhere. Opposing big men can't see the basket
and opposing guards constantly have defenders in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a couple things going for them,'' Cal coach Ben
Braun said. ``They're very smart. They don't gamble. They don't
give you a lot of opportunities and they play great position
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the guys inside... they don't need to double-down, so
there aren't a lot of open looks. You have to make a play. And with
their depth, they can use fouls, which enables them to play more
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the NCAA record for fewest points scored in a game (six)
isn't in danger tonight. But considering the Bruins' production
against ranked teams _ 43 points against Gonzaga, 61 against
Arizona, 58 against Oregon _ (begin ital)they(end ital) are.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up steam: After a slow start that included a brutal
schedule and lofty expectations, Gonzaga has found its groove. The
'Zags have won eight straight and are rolling toward another West
Coast Conference title. With a few more wins, they'll clinch an
at-large berth (in case they don't win the WCC tournament).
</P>
<P>
   The difference: perimeter shooting. The 'Zags made 6 of 37
3-pointers in a loss to Temple _ a typical performance for them in
December _ but guard Richie Frahm has sparked a sweet shooting
surge. In eight January games, Frahm averaged 19.6 points and shot
57.1 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: Delusional but true: Washington State has
installed a parquet floor in Friel Court. Imagine the reflection of
all those NCAA-championship banners.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 26-point loss at Louisiana State was the largest
defeat in coach Lute Olson's 16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats scheduled the game so senior Eugene Edgerson, a New
Orleans native, could play before his hometown fans. One problem:
Edgerson is redshirting this year for academic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cal center Nick Vander Laan (10.1 ppg, 6.8 rpg) is one of the
league's most surprising freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 has two nonconference games left: Washington State
against Texas-Pan American and UCLA against Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Stanford has three starters from Southern
California (Casey Jacobsen, Mike McDonald and Jarron Collins), and
UCLA has two (Billy Knight and Jason Kapono). &QL;

RED WINGS A TRUE TEST FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings know the Detroit Red Wings are not the
New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   They know that Tuesday's 5-2 victory over the Islanders, who are
last in the Atlantic Division, was two points they needed. But in
their minds the Red Wings, who visit Staples Center for the first
time tonight, are the best team in their conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others may challenge them, but year in and year out there is
no one who can say they are better,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said.
``They have four great lines and terrific defensemen. Oh, and they
have quite a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Scotty Bowman has eight Stanley Cup rings. The Kings
are just trying to make the playoffs. The Red Wings, who lost 5-3
Monday night in Phoenix, are second in the conference with 69
points, one behind St. Louis. The Kings are seventh with 54, but
just two points ahead of the 10th place Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings (22-21-7) have played Detroit tough this year, a
1-1 tie in early November and a 3-1 loss Dec. 10 that included an
empty net goal by the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of speed and talent, but we stayed after
them,'' Murray said. ``I really believe that we are a team you
don't want to face in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity: Donald Audette hoped to be back from his sprained
left ankle by the last road trip. Now, it is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, sidelined almost a month, suffered a setback Monday
during practice. Now, Murray is using rookie Jason Blake in
Audette's spot on the second line beside Bryan Smolinski and Glen
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not certain when Donald will be back,'' Andy Murray said.
``I thought Jason had played well recently and I like the jump he
brings to the ice. He works well with the veteran players.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray says one reason is because Blake has become a more
well-rounded player. He was a scorer in college and thought he
needed to duplicate that role here. In his first game with the
Kings last year, Blake scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured it would be the same here,'' Blake said. ``I
learned in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned a lot Nov. 6 when he replaced Jozef Stumpel as the
first-line center, Blake's natural position in college.
</P>
<P>
   There he was regularly beaten up by Flyers center Eric Lindros,
who is nine inches taller. Blake was back on the bench the next
night and Len Barrie was called up from Long Beach to take his
place.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Blake right now seems better suited to the wing than
center. ``Defense is the hardest position to learn followed by
center,'' he said. ``Playing the wing is more instinctive. I like
the chemistry he has with the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette hopes to be back after this weekend's All-Star break,
but he has been optimistic before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets better then it gets worse,'' Audette said of the
ankle. I've been going out of my mind with boredom. This is the
worst.''

SONICS STUMBLE AS VISITING BULLS EARN NINTH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonics center Horace Grant was the last to get
dressed. He needed extra time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Grant had been injured Wednesday night. But the 13-year
veteran likened the Sonics' 88-81 loss to the Chicago Bulls to
being punched in the stomach. And the analogies went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone went and took food off my table,'' Grant
said. `` ... It's a sickening feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case the point needs to be made clearer, this was the
Sonics' worst loss this season. The Sonics brought relatively
nothing to Key-Arena against the league's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   No rebounding power.
</P>
<P>
   No intensity.
</P>
<P>
   No focus.
</P>
<P>
   So much for a solid victory Tuesday night at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   That was all but negated as the Sonics (29-18) allowed the 9-34
Bulls to dictate the tempo and control the game down the stretch.
Chicago snapped its four-game losing streak, while the Sonics lost
for the fifth time in the past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only as good as you play,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said. ``We beat Utah and we think we're good. Then, we come in here
and lose to Chicago and that's who we are. ... It shouldn't have
been a close game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were lulled into a half-court game and never
distanced themselves from the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 71 with 6:03 left in the game, the Bulls outscored the
Sonics 17-10 the rest of the way. Bulls rookie Ron Artest (24
points, 14 in the fourth) made eight of nine free throws in the
final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc did the most damage, scoring a game-high 31 points on
13-of-21 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had several chances to a claim the victory in the
game's final minutes. But they unraveled. Trailing 80-78, Bulls
rookie Elton Brand pierced the Sonics' defense and sank a 7-foot
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gary Payton was called for an offensive foul on the next
play. The Sonics fouled Artest, and before he stepped to the line,
Payton drew a technical foul. Artest converted all three foul shots
to put the Bulls ahead 85-78 with 27.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one sticks with you a little bit, knowing we could have
been the third team in the league with 30 wins,'' Sonics guard
Brent Barry said. ``We could have taken another step forward. But
this was probably two steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the type of bad losses that hurt playoff positioning.
And the Sonics felt a drastic blow Wednesday night. They entered
the game fourth in the tough Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Sonics from that perch to sixth behind
Sacramento and slightly ahead of Minnesota and the Phoenix Suns,
who visit KeyArena Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never led the Bulls by more than seven points in the
first three quarters. The game was knotted at 40 by halftime. The
Sonics' biggest lead was 62-55 in the third. They led by five
points heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls took their first lead late in the fourth quarter when
former Sonics guard Hersey Hawkins' layup gave them a 71-69 lead
with 6:21 left to play. Hawkins played his first game in Seattle
since he was traded to Chicago during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm extremely proud and happy,'' Hawkins said. ``The
young guys really played great basketball. I told them I may buy
them all dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were the aggressors _ particularly on the boards _
most of the night. Chicago held a 13-1 advantage in offensive
rebounding by halftime, and won the rebounding battle, 39-34, for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just sleepwalking in the first half. It was
pathetic,'' said Westphal, who wrote 13-1 on a board in the locker
room at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on deaf ears, so to speak,'' said Grant, who along with
Baker finished with seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Baker led the Sonics with 19 points. Unfortunately for the
Sonics, it was an off-night for Payton. He struggled through
5-for-18 shooting with 10 assists and five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said the only explanation for the loss is complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not at his best, then other guys have to step up,''
Grant said. ``He did other things to help us. He shouldn't have to
score 30 points a night for us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you don't match a team's intensity, I don't care who
they are and how bad their record is, you're going to lose.''

INVESTORS ASK IF BEIJING CAN ENFORCE ALL ITS NEW INTERNET RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Of all the requirements needed to invest in the
Internet in China these days, the most important may be steady
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing government announced a raft of new regulations last
week governing the release of material on the Internet. The rules
would crack down on Internet providers who distribute information
the government deems to be ``state secrets,'' either through news
services or electronic chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week came word of rules requiring Chinese Internet
companies to receive approval from three state agencies before they
issue shares of stock. These regulations could hobble several
promising start-up concerns, which had hoped to go public this year
to capitalize on the pell-mell growth of online usage here.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to some experts, Beijing has set a deadline of
Monday for companies to register their commercial encryption
software with the government. Companies use encryption codes to
prevent outsiders from monitoring their confidential electronic
communications. By requiring companies to disclose details of the
software, the authorities could keep tabs on e-mail and other data
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these new regulations can be seen as a frontal
assault on the Internet by a government that is afraid of losing
control. Yet most local entrepreneurs and foreign investors
shrugged off the latest blasts from Beijing. As long as China's
policy toward the Internet is still inchoate, they are content to
go about their business and leave the worrying for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential rewards are so great that people are ignoring
the risks,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner in BDA China Ltd., an
Internet consulting firm in Beijing. ``You won't see people panic
unless the government does something draconian, like throw an
Internet executive in jail or shut down a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the companies were betting that China would be able
to carry out only a fraction of its new rules. With the number of
Internet users here more than quadrupling, to 8.9 million in 1999,
and with new online ventures proliferating, they think that the
government will have neither the resources nor the ingenuity to
monitor every chat room or to vet every business plan.
</P>
<P>
   China has been struggling to get a handle on the World Wide Web
ever since its leaders decided to harness the new medium rather
than suppress it. Initially, some officials favored building a
domestic Internet that was walled off from the Web. But the concept
of a Chinese ``intranet'' foundered when it became clear that the
government could not stanch the flow of information into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, experts said, officials seem to have abandoned an
overarching Internet policy in favor of a piecemeal approach that
relies on ribbons of bureaucratic red tape and the occasional stern
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `We're going to take the best of the Internet,
but we will not allow the influences we consider inappropriate or
harmful,''' said Gordon G. Chang, a lawyer in Shanghai who advises
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of scattershot approach reflects a fierce debate
within the government about who should supervise the Internet. The
Ministry of Information Industry had originally been expected to
oversee virtually all aspects of its regulation, and investors
pored over the comments of its minister, Wu Jichuan, like tea
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Wu caused alarm last fall when he unexpectedly reaffirmed a
prohibition on foreign investment in Chinese Internet providers _
only to back off after China signed a landmark trade deal with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wu appeared to retreat further when he said in an
interview with a Chinese magazine that his ministry had
jurisdiction only over Internet service providers. Internet content
companies _ news services, community groups and the like _ were to
be regulated by ``relevant departments.''
</P>
<P>
   That set off a stampede by other ambitious officials eager to
lay claim to various patches of cyberspace. The State Press and
Publication Administration said it is drawing up guidelines on how
companies should disseminate news on the Internet, while the
Administration for Radio, Film and Television said it must approve
services that deliver online broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's motivation seems to be as much economic as political.
``There is a land grab going on by different government
departments, who recognize the billion-dollar valuations that
Internet IPOs are getting,'' Clark said. ``Some of the ministries
are saying, `We can do this ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet entrepreneurs have responded to Beijing officials'
discomfort by steering clear of the areas that arouse the most
sensitivity. Two of the best-known Chinese portals, Sina.com and
Sohu.com, originally made news a key part of their services _ even
signing partnerships with Western media companies like Dow Jones
and Reuters. But after a warning from the government, they dropped
nonfinancial foreign news from their Web sites and cut links to the
sites of foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``News content is not going to drive the Internet in China,''
said R. Mark Mecham, an analyst at Claydon Gescher Associates, a
technology consulting firm in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rage among investors are ventures that specialize in
electronic commerce, online auctions and other activities that are
less likely to touch nerves in Beijing. Among the most prominent of
these are Netease.com, which sponsors online auctions, and
8448.net, an e-commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   But even electronic commerce may not evade the long arm of the
government. Experts said Beijing's demand that companies register
encryption software had especially worrisome implications for
e-commerce businesses. They predicted that some companies would
leave China rather than risk having their transactions monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``No foreign company wants to give up its source code,'' Chang
said. ``They'll have to end up with some sort of a negotiated
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is confident that Beijing and the Internet will
find common ground. Asia Tech Ventures, a venture-capital firm in
Hong Kong, has shunned mainland Internet companies, focusing
instead on Hong Kong and Taiwan. It has only one China holding, a
Shanghai-based online auction service called Eachnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make a single investment in the mainland until last
November because the regulations are always changing,'' said Hanson
Cheah, a partner at Asia Tech Ventures. ``I'm not dismissing China.
I'm just extremely cautious about it.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CONVERGENCE RAISES QUESTIONS OF ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The huge potential power of the proposed AOL Time Warner has
applied electroshock to the cortex of the convergence industries:
information, entertainment and communication. One of the biggest
jolts is being felt in the growing market for high-speed, or
broadband, Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the world's largest Internet service provider with the
world's largest news, entertainment and cable television megalith
has set off increasingly urgent discussions about the future of
broadband and how best to ensure that no single company abuses its
control of the Internet's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for urgency are twofold. First is the issue of how
to open privately owned broadband Internet access to all comers. In
addition, the free-speech issue arises when any single entity, of
any size, controls both a transmission medium and the information
that flows over it.
</P>
<P>
   Open access is a particular concern. Premerger America Online
was in the midst of strident lobbying to shame AT&AMP;T Corp., which
had recently acquired the cable giant Tele-Communications, into
opening its cable network to America Online's (or anyone's)
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent for this demand _ known euphemistically as open
access _ is actually common-carriage law, which for decades has
compelled telephone companies to interconnect their systems and
serve all customers, including competitors, without discriminating
on price or on who can buy access.
</P>
<P>
   Despite America Online's assurances of continued support for
open access, industry executives and public interest watchdogs fear
that once it actually owns Time Warner's high-speed cable network,
that view may ``evolve,'' as one person close to the deal put it.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of AT&AMP;T and America Online as broadband superpowers
controlling enormous closed networks has convinced a growing number
of observers that without some kind of government dictum declaring
``you will interconnect,'' the battle for broadband market share is
certain to devolve into an internecine contest that wastes
trillions of dollars and frightens away customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these issues were being addressed even as the merger was
announced. In October, IEEE-USA, a trade organization for
engineers, co-sponsored a symposium at Cornell University
(www.Johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/mcadams/) at which participants
drew scenarios of a broadband future.
</P>
<P>
   But two participants realized that none were accounting for the
inevitable public policy issues ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every scenario is a nightmare scenario,'' says Richard J.
Solomon, a technology policy expert who is now a senior scientist
at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Communications and
Information Science and Policy. ``We'll end up with a monopoly and
nothing good from a technology perspective. Or there'll be a
stalemate where everyone will sue each other to block everything
from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Or he cites another scenario in which billions, maybe trillions,
will be spent on marketing competing standards, so that building a
network ``will take 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon and Michael E. Bloom, a veteran telecommunications
engineer, consultant and industry analyst based in San Ramon,
Calif., were asked to write a paper for IEEE-USA on these issues.
They concluded that some variation of common carriage was the only
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that common carriage encourages the network to be
everywhere and fully interconnected, they argue, would provide
stability and thus significantly speed the development of the
broadband market. It would also free owners of content and conduit
from legal liability for carrying the content of others on their
wires.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of too much government oversight and control, Solomon
and Bloom say, can be mitigated by getting everyone to the table to
create a cooperative, open system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since government is going to be involved one way or another,
like it or not, we're proposing that the industry sit down with
government now, sit down with public-policy makers now, get
everyone in the same room and work out a set of investment and
public policy scenarios to invest in a broadband network,'' Solomon
says. ``Everyone loves to talk about their pet operating system or
protocol. But five years arguing is five years lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he adds, the broadband standards embraced today by
cable and phone companies are outmoded already.
</P>
<P>
   The pair even proposes that this group agree to create some kind
of entity _ ``governmental, quasi-governmental, a private
corporation with a set of rules'' _ that would own or manage this
network, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Johnson, a former member of the FCC who teaches law at
the University of Iowa, said the precedent for such an arrangement
was ``the Internet itself, before it was sold off by the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government built it, made it available,'' Johnson said.
``You could move over whatever you wanted to move. There was no
content control. It was fully distributed, a flat organization in
terms of control, and the thing just ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says a government-operated network would ``keep us two,
three, 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, because it would
give us the infrastructure we'd really need, and avoid an
incredible amount of wasted time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every expert agrees with the need for so radical a solution.
For example, Glenn Manishin, a lawyer with Patton Boggs LLP in
Washington, argues, ``If we regulate too soon, then we run a risk
of deflecting investment.'' Manishin, whose firm represents America
Online, has been immersed in telecommunications law since serving
as an antitrust lawyer for the Justice Department during the
breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But he agrees that there is a role for government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some kind of requirement that these providers
establish a basis upon which interoperability can occur,'' he says.
``Like the telephone network, like the public Internet, which arose
because of open standards, we'd have an open, broadband,
interoperable network of networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson asserts that the ability for anyone to move content
throughout such a network is essential to free speech. Yet,
powerful corporations like AT&AMP;T and the proposed AOL Time Warner
would have the power to balkanize the broadband Internet for their
own purposes, with no legal reason to open their networks to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And as Johnson points out, ``If you can't get on the network,
you've been locked out of the market.''

INCREASING THE PRIVACY OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft would not be proud to admit it, but the software
behemoth has done more to spur the growth of the e-mail security
industry in the past two years than perhaps any other company.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen blanched at the notion that Bill Gates, of all
people, could be forced to answer questions in court about e-mail
messages that he had sent years before _ supposedly in confidence.
Meanwhile, consumers took note last summer when hackers broke into
Microsoft's Hotmail site and made public some highly embarrassing
personal correspondence by its users.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft was not the first to encounter e-mail
security issues, but its experiences pointed out the extreme
vulnerability of this type of communication. The common analogy
among industry executives and analysts is that e-mail is as secure
as a postcard, but even that may be giving e-mail too much credit.
</P>
<P>
   When a message is sent, it can make a dozen or more stops along
the Internet as it travels to the recipient's desktop. At each of
those stops, it is typically copied, with the duplicate message
stored on a server _ the technological engine that runs any
Internet operation.
</P>
<P>
   Once a duplicate e-mail message is stored, it is subject to
security breaches or mishandling by the employees of the company or
organization that operates the server. Furthermore, the courts can
force Internet service providers to retrieve messages if they are
deemed relevant to a case.
</P>
<P>
   More menacing than the courts, many employees have found, are
the system administrators hired by corporations to screen offensive
or sensitive e-mail in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The creativity of hackers and corporate sleuths in their e-mail
surveillance, however, has been matched in recent months by
services meant to make e-mail as private as a confession booth.
``This is becoming a very big category,'' said Steven Robins, an
analyst with the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm. ``As
more and more business goes onto the Internet, people want the same
safeguards as they get in any other medium.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, the number of e-mail messages
sent per day in the United States will grow to 1.5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to see opportunity in this category was
Tumbleweed Communications Inc., which was founded in 1993 and went
public last fall. Tumbleweed's technology allows a user to send
e-mail and inform recipients that they have received a document or
a message that has been encrypted and stored on the sender's server
computer. When a recipient clicks on a link inside the e-mail
message, she is sent to that server site, where the encrypted
document can be viewed on or retrieved from a secure Web page to
which she alone has access.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Datek, which licenses Tumbleweed's service, offers
users the opportunity to receive confirmation of stock trades by
e-mail. Because the correspondence is secure and documented, it
meets requirements set by the Securities and Exchange Commission
for the transmittal of trading information _ and spares Datek and
its customers the expense and hassle of handling paper confirmation
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dunn, a Datek spokesman, declined to say how much the
company has saved in mailing costs. But he said 30 percent of the
firm's confirmations were now handled electronically. ``The cost
savings are significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that license Tumbleweed's service typically pay in the
``mid-six figures'' upfront and between 3 cents and 50 cents per
e-mail message sent, according to Mark Pastore, Tumbleweed's vice
president of corporate development.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbleweed ``is the leader right now,'' according to Alan
Weintraub, research director of the Gartner Group, a consulting
firm. ``But they won't be alone for long. There's a lot of activity
in this space.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that activity focuses on other ways to secure and
control e-mail. For instance, the e-mail security company QVtech
has developed Interosa, a service whose technology enables a user
to send an e-mail message and control several aspects of how it is
used, including to whom it can be forwarded and whether or not it
can be printed, edited or copied. Notably, the message can be
erased from the Interosa server after a certain date _ the digital
equivalent of paper shredding.
</P>
<P>
   After a user types the e-mail message, he sets the rules for how
it can be used. The message is then encrypted before it is sent.
When the recipient clicks on the e-mail message to open it, a
message travels from the user's desktop to a Web site using
Interosa's technology, which then verifies the recipient's identity
and decrypts the message.
</P>
<P>
   According to a company spokesman, QVtech is trying to sell
Interosa to companies like Mail.com and MessageMedia, which handle
e-mail direct marketing on behalf of Yahoo and ETrade, among others
_ companies that want to be able to track whether and how their
mailings are handled by the intended recipients.
</P>
<P>
   QVtech has not completed agreements with such firms, the
spokesman said, but the company intends to charge about a penny for
each e-mail message sent using its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Authentica, which sells document security software, said it will
release an e-mail security product in April that would compete with
Interosa and others. Lance Urbas, Authentica's chief executive,
said the service could be particularly valuable for companies that
want to send valuable or sensitive documents via e-mail without
worrying that customers might forward them to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a consulting firm that issued a report on a Friday,
and by midday Monday, the author of the report had gotten a dozen
calls about statements in the report from people who hadn't
purchased it,'' Urbas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports like that cost a lot,'' he added. ``That's the kind of
thing we'll prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are not the only target of so-called secure e-mail
companies, of course. According to Jon Gilliam, president of
Hush.com, consumers have already begun to migrate toward secure
e-mail services, with nearly 150,000 users having signed up for
Hushmail since May.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with Hotmail, Hushmail requires the user to visit
the site to read and send mail. The difference, Gilliam said, is
that even Hushmail employees cannot open the e-mail messages stored
on its server _ not only because they are encrypted on the server,
but because the key that unscrambles the messages is tied to a pass
phrase that only the user knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know the pass phrase. If someone forgets their
pass phrase, we can't help them,'' Gilliam said. Likewise, he said,
``if we get a subpoena like we did today for e-mail records, we
have to give the courts an encrypted message. There's nothing we
can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam said Hushmail would soon begin offering to license its
service to companies that want to offer it to their customers. He
said that law firms and health care companies might want to use the
service rather than send confidential briefs or medical notes
through regular e-mail. ``There's a huge demand, because a lot of
sites can't afford to send that information via regular e-mail,''
he said. ``It's just too valuable.''

VOTING BY THE INTERNET: THE MOUSE STILL HASN'T ROARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some parts of Alaska, about the only way to get to a voting
booth in January is by dogsled. So to encourage participation in
its presidential straw poll last Monday, the Alaska Republican
Party tried something different: Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   By logging on to the Web site of VoteHere.net, a new company
that sells Internet voting software, Republicans in three remote
districts (and in the offices of Alaska's members of Congress in
Washington) could point the mouse at any of six presidential
contenders, then click on a button labeled ``Cast this ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the straw poll was not binding, this was not, as the
company labeled it, the ``first binding Internet election.'' Still,
it does appear to have been the first Internet ballot to be
sanctioned by a major party, and it was a happy debut: while only
35 people voted from their computers, they provided Texas Gov.
George W. Bush with just enough clicks (23) to lift him to a narrow
victory over Steve Forbes (4) in the straw poll as a whole. (The
overall tally was Bush 1,571, Forbes 1,566.)
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska may have been the first, it is not likely to be the
last. A small but growing number of state officials in both
parties, impressed by the sales pitches of start-up companies like
VoteHere.net and Election.com, see electronic voting as a way to
attract new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole objective is to open voting to people who don't
participate, like the 18-to-34 age group,'' said Mark Fleisher,
chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, which plans to offer
Internet voting in its March presidential primary, which will be
binding. He added that he hoped the novelty would provide a jolt of
publicity to upstage the Republicans, whose own primary is two
weeks before the Democrats'.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone sees Internet voting as a portal to a more
democratic future. The Voting Integrity Project, a nonprofit civic
group in Virginia, has sued in federal court to block the Arizona
Democrats' plan on behalf of two minority voters, saying it
discriminates against minority voters, who are less likely than
whites to have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are security problems. The two electronic voting
companies use various kinds of software to protect voters' privacy
and make sure nobody casts more than one ballot. But the California
Internet Voting Task Force, a panel of technology experts,
political scientists and civic leaders convened by Secretary of
State Bill Jones, presented an alarming picture in January in a
report rejecting the notion of allowing voters to cast ballots from
home via the Internet anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The task force said that despite security measures, it would be
all too easy to distribute a ``Trojan horse'' virus, perhaps by
e-mail, to take up residence in voters' home computers. Such a
virus, the panel said, could direct Internet voting software to
take over the keyboard and mouse and place automated votes without
the user's even being aware that the vote had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Adler, president of VoteHere.net, said such concerns were
overblown, but he acknowledged that extra security measures might
be necessary and that they would involve some work on the voters'
part. ``You may have to sacrifice convenience for security,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the Defense Department, which is creating a
system to allow Americans overseas to cast ballots through the
Internet, came to the same conclusion as the California panel.
Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said the pilot project,
scheduled to be tested by 250 military personnel in November, would
allow voting only from virus-free machines at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts dispute a central premise of the Internet-voting
movement: that technology, in and of itself, will attract large
numbers of new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pent-up demand for `Gee, if I could do this from
home, I would participate in politics,''' said Michael Cornfield, a
political scientist who is director of the Democracy Online Project
at George Washington University. ``We've been there. We've done
this. It does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Arterton, dean of the Graduate School of Political
Management at George Washington, said that experiments in
``tele-democracy'' in the 1980s, in which people could register
opinions by telephone on issues presented in town hall meetings on
cable television, were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media was not a cure-all for the problems of democracy,'' he
said. ``The real resistance from citizens is attitudes toward
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And many state election officials are far from sold on Internet
voting. ``We have a couple of software companies that are driving
this process,'' said Thomas Wilkey, executive director of the New
York state Board of Elections. ``I don't think anybody is saying
they're totally against this, but let's take a look before jumping
into this. It's like jumping into the lake without testing the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Practical issues aside, the political obstacles are bound to
remain substantial. Consider the culture clash that took place in
Louisiana last spring, when VoteHere.net persuaded moderate
Republicans to propose Internet voting to bring attention to the
party's 2000 presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became a flashpoint in the longstanding rivalry
between conservatives and moderates. And as the software people
looked on in amazement, the old politics rapidly trumped the new:
conservatives, invoking a series of unorthodox parliamentary
maneuvers, managed to bury the proposal, at least for this election
year.

 &HT;    Updated Internet Explorer will have major improvements
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the sale of Netscape to America Online, you
probably thought the Internet browser wars were over. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may now be the clear leader, but it is readying to
release a new version of its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Called Internet Explorer 5.0, this version sports a new look, a
faster engine to draw pages and an easier-to-use search feature.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes built-in automated support for those
participating in Internet auctions. The browser's Auction Tracker
feature will keep you posted on how your bid is faring.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Netscape is also readying a new version for
the Mac, but it looks like Explorer is going to be the first to
market, sometime early this year.
</P>
<P>
   As always, both Netscape Navigator and Explorer are free. You
can download the new versions from various sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a close look at some of Explorer's top new features:
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft seems proudest of, based on the hype in its
promotional material, is something called Tasman. That's the code
name for a new software engine that builds the Web pages you see
within the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Tasman represents a complete rebuild of how Explorer constructs
Web pages. In doing so, Microsoft not only sped up its browser but
added lots of new technologies. For example, Explorer will provide
better support of tables, cascading style sheets and the latest
version of HTML.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, these improvements will work across both platforms.
No longer will a page that works on a PC fail to display on a Mac.
Or so Microsoft claims.
</P>
<P>
   What's received the most media attention in Explorer 5.0 is
Auction Tracker, and it's a pretty cool feature. Basically, once
customized by a user, it will automatically track a bid you've
made. Auction Tracker will alert you if you've been outbid,
enabling you to either drop out or raise your offer.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Tracker is set initially to support 10 of the
most-trafficked auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   While not as publicized, the new Search Assistant will be
appreciated by a lot of users, especially those new to the
Internet. In essence, what it does is reduce Internet searching to
understandable, everyday language.
</P>
<P>
   All the mechanics of searching are hidden from the user. You
tell Search Assistant what you're looking for, say a name, price or
company, and it fires up the appropriate search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in learning more about Explorer 5.0, check
out Microsoft's promotional material at www.microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   /mac/ie/default.htm. The site also has an interactive demo of
the product.

 &HT;    Wine CD-ROM tells more than you may want to know
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I should preface this review of a CD-ROM called Oz
Clarke's Ultimate Wine Guide by saying that I am no student of the
grape, nor much of a consumer of it. Put a glass of it in front of
me and I'll try it. If it doesn't cross my eyeballs I'll be polite
and drink most, or even all, of it, but I'll rarely have a refill.
</P>
<P>
   So when I plugged in this CD from DK, the first thing that
caught my eye on the opening page was a section called ``When to
Drink Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm just drinking it at the wrong time, I thought, an
hour too early or something like that, so I double-clicked there.
What resulted was a page entitled ``When to Drink Wine: a Guide to
Laying Down.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem evident that if you need a guide to lying down,
your problem is not when to drink but when to stop drinking.
Personally I am well-versed in the art of lying down, seldom
missing an opportunity to do so, and was about to depart the page
when I realized my misapprehension. Clarke was talking about the
best time in the life of a wine to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one thing led to another, and finally to the annual
vintage reports from New South Wales, Australia, where one learns
that in 1999, the Hunter Valley had rain at the wrong times and it
wasn't a memorable year for red varieties (no Brokenwood Graveyard
Shiraz will be produced) and Orange and Mudgee also had a wet
vintage and rot was a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, enough of that. On to Mr. Clarke himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is well represented here by numerous video clips and proves
to be a man much given to lip-smacking, gestures of epicurean
ecstacy and all the other things that seem to be required of a wine
connoisseur. I suppose if you are going to get into wine
appreciation you have to learn to say things like ``buttery spice
wrapped around a warm, mouth-filling center of very ripe sweet
fruit. Powerful, long finish.'' You probably also need to
understand them.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, this CD seems to be an extremely useful tool for
those who want to learn a lot about wine and its accouterments.
Clarke leaves no stone that I can see unturned. There is a section
on matching wines with food and a long dissertation on the art of
wine tasting (which, stupidly enough, I imagined to involve nothing
more than getting it into your mouth, tasting and and then
swallowing or spitting it out, as warranted).
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who merely wish to avoid embarrassment at
dinner, the Wine Selector is just the ticket. Here you can click on
food match, and by selecting from a list and then from variations,
get very close to the kind of food you intend to serve. You don't
have to be into cordon bleu dishes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're going to serve chili, and you're enough of a
twit that you want to serve a wine with that. Clarke won't let you
down. Unless you narrow the search further by specifying the
location from which your wine should emanate, you get a selection
of 52 wines, every last one of them two stars out of three. For
instance: Steele Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel, a spicy blockbuster
red, which tastes like brambly fruit with ripe spice flavors, full,
smoothly textured and capable of some age, with a list of its best
years. If you then go to the search screen and enter Steele, you'll
find these wines range from moderately priced to very expensive.

<P>
   It would be more useful to put the price range with the rest of
the information, since you may not want to break the bank on
something with which to wash down chili. Nonetheless, making up a
list of possibilities from the selector, printing them out and
taking them to the store will at least save you a conversation with
some fruity-flavored, full-bodied, long-finished wine peddler.

 &HT;    Magazine rates best sites for buying or selling homes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are as frustrating as buying something big
and finding out later that you could have had it for less. And
maybe nowhere does buyer's remorse hit harder than when you buy a
home. Realtors charge fees that can be negotiated. Mortgage company
costs can be flexible, and the price of a home can vary, depending
on location and time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be a good source of information for all those
things. The February issue of Yahoo Internet Life issues report
cards on the slew of real estate-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The critique starts with a thorough look at some of the sites
that aspire to portaldom, grading them for the quality and quantity
of listings, the site's tools, the research capabilities and the
extras.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com rated highest, receiving an overall B+ ranking. It
was praised for having ``the mother lode'' of listings, with 1.3
million homes in the database. Features such as saved search
criteria and virtual tours gave it a B for tools. Extras such as
articles, message boards and e-mails when a new listing matches
your search criteria earned Realtor.com a B+.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network's Home Advisor, homeadvisor.com, received
a B rating. The site was noted for its research features, which
include guides, tips and FAQs that cover each aspect of the
home-buying process. The site was criticized because of its spotty
neighborhood information.
</P>
<P>
   Homes.com was average. The site had more than 700,000 listings,
but the coverage was spotty: Manhattan had 1,400 listings, San
Francisco 49. The research tools won't let users save listings of
favorite homes, but the site sends users e-mail of new listings.
</P>
<P>
   Homeseekers.com and Cyberhomes.com graded poorly. Homeseekers
has an uneven distribution of 680,000 home listings. The
neighborhood information, however, is limited and the site offers
no FAQs, guides or tutorials, often crucial for first-time users.
Cyberhomes' coverage was weak. There were no listings for
Cleveland; Austin, Texas; or San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For people trying to sell their home, owners.com ranked highest.
The site lets sellers list their homes themselves, replacing the
Realtor and saving a fee that could amount to 6 percent or more.
The listing is free, and users can post a photograph of their
house. A link to homepricecheck.com gives users an idea of what
prices other homes in the area are fetching. The basic listing
appears for three months. A ``premium'' placement costs somewhere
between $89 and $139.
</P>
<P>
   Moving.com was rated the best site for people looking to move.
The site includes a database of licensed movers, including local,
long-distance or international outfits. The site includes a link to
the U.S. Postal Service's change-of-address forms.
</P>
<P>
   One site taps into some of the national interest in home
restoration. Improvenet.com rated tops among home-building and
remodeling sites. Users can fill out a form detailing their
project, whether a repair or a home construction, and local
contractors, designers and architects can bid on the work.
</P>
<P>
   The best home-financing site was eloan.com, according to the
magazine. The site asks a few questions, then suggests the type of
loan best-suited for the user's needs _ fixed-rate, adjustable-rate
or a mix. The site searches more than 70 lenders, including Chase,
the Money Store and Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The article also included these rankings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The best site for virtual home tours, homeseekers.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homefair.com offered the best information about neighborhoods,
including unemployment rates, household incomes, climate
information and student-teacher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best-rated place to find a real estate agent, should you
decide to go that route, is homegain.com. Users can submit a
profile describing what they want to buy or sell, and homegain.com
sends the information to local agents. Interested agents then send
proposals back to the site, along with their credentials, sales
history and commission rate.

 &HT;    DVDs, videotapes always good fit for online shopping
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online merchants aren't just selling a product, they
are selling convenience. So, many people searching for a DVD or
videotaped movie, even those who live close to well-stocked retail
stores, are buying online.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a person making one more stop on the commute home
from work, the movies arrive at the doorstep. And _ unlike buying a
sweater or a piece of furniture online _ there's no need to worry
if your purchase will look and fit right. A DVD of ``Casablanca''
bought online will be identical to the one you find in the store.
</P>
<P>
   If you are into shopping online, it will come as no surprise
that one of the real leaders in merchandising is Amazon.com. It's
an enormously efficient organization with excellent customer
service. Although some people associate Amazon totally with books,
the strategy of the company has been to be an online merchant of
almost everything that can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon.com site at www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com has a broad selection of DVDs and videotapes. Prices
are good. In many cases, you'll pay less _ even with shipping _
than typical retail prices. The ability to search for the movie you
want by title, director or actor is pretty standard at most of the
sites reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com does have other features _ not all are exclusive to
Amazon _ that make shopping fun. For one thing, you can view a
list, updated hourly, of the top-selling videos. Even if you're the
sort of person who doesn't like swimming with the stream, it's fun
to see what's hot right now. You can also browse movies by
categories such as comedies, dramas and action.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into DVD, you may prefer a site that specializes in
just that format. That's literally the name of the game at DVD.com
located at www2
</P>
<P>
   .dvdexpress.com/consumer
</P>
<P>
   /movies/. The assortment is excellent and the delivery times _
based on several orders _ are astonishingly short.
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature that DVD.com pushes is the ability to preorder
a DVD. Usually a discounted price is offered for that kind of
order, and if you've been waiting for a specific movie, you can be
sure that you'll be among the first to get it. DVD.com has a handy
list of upcoming releases, and that makes for interesting browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may be reluctant to buy a videotape or DVD, figuring
they'll watch the film once and that will be enough. So a site such
as MovieRent.Com offers that as a possibility. The site at
www.movierent.com
</P>
<P>
   /resources1.htm will be happy to rent the videotape or DVD or
sell it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nifty site for a lot of reasons. Besides its own
sections within the site, you'll find links to other places on the
Web devoted to movies and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to discuss DVDs and videotaped movies
without mentioning Blockbuster. Undoubtedly there's a retail outlet
near you. But there's also an outlet on the Web at www
</P>
<P>
   .blockbuster.com.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a good selection of movies here in both formats. The
prices are on par with those you'd find elsewhere. But one feature
that takes advantage of the Blockbuster retail business is the
ability to buy used videotapes online. The prices are great ...
averaging about $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you really need to know about a site that doesn't sell
DVDs or videotapes. Instead, it searches the sites that do sell
them and tells you where the bargains are. This truly valuable
service is located at www.moviepriceguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since the service is unique and difficult to explain in a few
sentences, go to the page at www.moviepriceguide.com
</P>
<P>
   /aboutus.shtml to read the explanation. It's a free service and
well worth checking out.

 &HT;    Connecting to the blind
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired is focusing
on using the computer to give employment and independence to blind
citizens who want to work.
</P>
<P>
   In that connection, the center, located in downtown Atlanta,
works on computer skills and communicates with businesses that may
be able to adapt data-processing and other jobs to the skills of
the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the kinds of skills being developed at the center,
which is funded by the state and private agencies such as the
United Way, blind people work at companies like BellSouth Mobility,
Federal Express, Wachovia Bank, Marriott, MARTA and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if human resources people look beyond the supposed
handicap, they will see dependable employees who are likely to
stick for a long time because they value their opportunity,'' said
Susan Bernardo, the center's adaptive technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For people interested in the center's programs, Bernardo said
the guidelines are few but important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good typing skills, not the hunt-and-peck variety, are very
important,'' said Bernardo. The center has its own typing or
keyboarding classes.
</P>
<P>
   Good typists are then introduced to special computer software
that can translate text to speech, which is the primary means the
blind person uses to process material on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the partially blind, the mouse is put aside in favor
of keystrokes for opening, processing, closing and organizing
files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sighted people don't even realize it, but nearly everything
done with the mouse can be done from the keyboard,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Paper documents that come to the blind worker can be scanned on
a machine adjacent to the computer and converted quickly to
electronic files, which then can be handled by the worker.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are exceptions, most blind workers can work only
on text files because it is harder for them to process files with
pictures and graphics _ although some programs can help the blind
operator identify pictures though they cannot see them.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, with the help of the staff at the Center for the
Visually Impaired, many of the information or data-processing jobs
in business can be adapted to the software learned by the blind at
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can adapt the processes, or companies can contract out that
work to others,'' Bernardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Zibula, marketing and public relations assistant at the
center, said there is a challenge in helping businesses understand
the capabilities of the blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sighted person looks at her computer, then closes her eyes
and imagines being blind and shakes her head, certain that the
machine cannot be operated without sight,'' Zibula said. ``But that
is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind people, either through experience or training, learn to
memorize better than others the organization of files in the
systems they use. They therefore depend less on random searching
and other common procedures used by sighted workers to find and
organize their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail, which is the most common form of computer
communication, is used a lot to send work and receive work from
blind workers,'' Bernardo said, partly because it is formatted in a
familiar way and can be adapted to many tasks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a satisfying skill because it opens communication
between the blind person and fellow workers and with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Zibula, who is blind, carries around a remarkable device, not
much larger than the now-familiar PalmPilot, called a Braille Lite,
which operates on the Braille system to fetch files from computers
and then allows her to read them, process them and store them in
computers as regular text files.
</P>
<P>
   It can store and manage about 2 megabytes of material at once,
about equal to two floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry this everywhere with me; I'd rather dispose of my
microwave than this machine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While agencies like the Center for the Visually Impaired expand
their daily work to put the blind into the work force, others such
as the Graphics, Visualization &AMP; Usability Center in Georgia Tech's
College of Computer Science work the frontiers to create new ways
for the blind and other people with disabilities to work with new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, advances are being made in translating not only
text but various kinds of graphics into auditory form, which will
further expand the abilities of the blind to work and function.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be very helpful to the blind if people would
simply realize that computers allow them to work and carry
responsibility in practically any kind of organization or
company,'' said Zibula.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 75 percent of the blind are either unemployed or
underemployed, but with the computer that record could be
improved.''

Just one of new critters you're sure to encounter in Half Life &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   With football winding down, it's time to once again concentrate
on basketball as our primary sport of choice. Just in time for the
switch is 989 Studios' NBA Shootout 2000 ($50; www.989studios.com).
This Playstation game is a definite improvement over its
predecessor. The newest version has great graphics and rim-rocking
action. Where a lot of the basketball games lack in action (how fun
could running up and down a court shooting and scoring really be?),
Shootout 2000 excels with its Total Control shooting _ each shot is
made on a graphic meter where you measure your shot. There is also
a cool ``create-a-dunk'' feature where you design how you want your
players to crush the ball into the net. If you're looking for
handheld b-ball action, look no further than Nintendo Gameboy's NBA
3 on 3 ($30, www.nintendo.com, for the Gameboy). This is NBA action
in the palm of your hand that plays incredibly well for its smaller
format. In the game, you pick three NBA team players to go up
against another team's. The game has a fun season function that is
automatically continued every time you turn on the game. Also, look
out for those monster jams. This game does a close-up of player
taking the ball to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   You know who Lara Croft, the busty heroine of the ``Tomb
Raider'' games, reminds us of? Roger Moore. Roger Moore made his
entire career off of being James Bond. All he was _ or ever will be
_ is James Bond. As a result, everything he has acted in since
``Live and Let Die'' has been some sort of minute twist on James
Bond. He never changes his character, and that's what's so annoying
about him. It is also the problem with Lara Croft. Tomb Raider: The
Last Revelation ($50; www.eidos.com) is the fourth game in a video
game franchise that has won the hearts of prepubescent boys across
the nation. Unfortunately, the game hasn't changed much since it
was introduced three years ago. This time, Lara is back in Egypt
and accidentally unleashes an evil Egyptian god. She must quash the
god before it's too late. Just like Moore reciting that annoying
line (``Bond, James Bond''), the Tomb Raider game hasn't changed:
she looks the same, she sounds the same and the controls are the
same. The one saving grace is that this game harkens back to the
first ``Tomb Raider.'' It is action-packed and less dependent on
the puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Combining addictive, chesslike game play with atmospheric
settings and an interesting menagerie of monsters, Odium ($40;
www.lith.com; for the PC) doesn't try to break ground in the
turn-based role-playing genre but rather tries to create a game
that's a whole lot of fun. At that goal it succeeds admirably.
Guide a small international team of soldiers into a
post-apocalyptic Russian nightmare where monsters and secrets lurk.
The downside: Amateurish voice acting, thin characters and
plotting, some interface clunkiness and tiresome cinematic scenes
that must be endured between actual game play. The upside: A
well-paced and challenging game that requires careful resource
management and some fairly deep thinking. Bottom line: What could
be higher praise than finding yourself awake at 2 a.m., emotionally
involved in Odium and struggling to find the next secret or defeat
the next set of monsters?
</P>
<P>
   Half-Life, the stunning horror-adventure game that still has us
intrigued two years after its release, has finally gotten the
sequel treatment _ well, sort of. Half-Life: Opposing Force ($40;
www.sierrastudios. com; PC only), the first official add-on to
Half-Life, is likely the most complete expansion pack to a game
we've ever seen. Instead of just adding a few levels or new weapons
to the original game, the folks at Sierra Studios instead unleash a
new adventure that takes the original premise _ escape from the
Black Mesa research lab as scientist Gordon Freeman _ and
flip-flops it. Now you play as one of the marines sent in to
eradicate Freeman. The game runs along the same timeline as the
original Half-Life and explores some of the same locations,
inserting new pieces to the story's plot. Adding to that new
monsters, new weapons and new characters to interact with, Opposing
Force takes the concept of the add-on pack and raises the bar as
far as Half-Life did for PC games. Is it worth what you'd pay for a
brand-new game? For fans of the original, Half-Life is still one of
the best single-player games in existence, and Opposing Force is
more of the same.

 &HT;    Memory chips race to catch up to processors
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The advent of lightning-fast microprocessors
running at 700 megahertz and more has put pressure on the rest of
the electronics innards in personal computers to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the pressure is coming down on the companies that
make lots of computer memories, including Korea's Samsung and
Hyundai and Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho. Among them, those
three companies controlled about 60 percent of the $20 billion
memory market last year.
</P>
<P>
   If computer users are going to harness the latest whiz-bang
processing performance, their computers had better have memory
chips that are running lickety split. If memory chips cannot keep
pace, then those fast and expensive new processor chips will be
sitting idle most of the time and not earning their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers have created a series of faster memory
technologies throughout the 1990s. Usually, after a short period of
time, the new standard dominates and all the world's memory makers
shift their production to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   But this year and next year, things could go differently. Two
competing standards could emerge, and, if they do, then life gets a
little more complicated for the companies that make computers and
for PC buyers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The big driver behind this industry shift is Intel Corp., which
makes most of the computer world's microprocessors, and, because of
that, has become the biggest, richest and most powerful chip
company.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, more than most companies, depends on memory chip
performance getting faster. Without that steady progression, the
improvements Intel makes in processor speeds won't translate to
significant increases in computer performance. And if that happens,
then Intel's incredible profit margins from processor sales are in
jeopardy. Intel would have a hard time commanding big price
premiums for its processor chips if it couldn't show that they make
computers work faster.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is pushing hard for the industry to adopt a new kind of
fast memory, promoted by a small Silicon Valley company called
Rambus Inc. Rambus had designed special circuitry for memory chips
that lets memory chips spit out streams of information more rapidly
than before.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus technology, for example, has been used in memory chips
that go into Nintendo 64 game consoles in order to deliver more
graphics information faster to meet the demands of graphics-hungry
game players.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chip makers must pay Rambus Inc. a royalty _ typically
between 1/2 and 1 percent _ for every Rambus chip they make. And
Rambus chips, because they contain extra circuitry, are larger that
standard chips. That means they are more expensive to make.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those added costs and because of some recent delays
at Intel, memory chip makers haven't been chomping at the bit to
make Rambus memories. Samsung has been the most active Rambus
manufacturer. Because supplies have been limited, analysts say
Rambus chips cost about three times more than conventional memories
right now.
</P>
<P>
   That has slowed their adoption in computers. Dell Computer Corp.
is one of the few big computer makers that makes and promotes
high-end computers with Rambus chips. Dell chief executive Michael
Dell was an early investor in Rambus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry is sticking with conventional memory chips
that run at 100 megahertz. That's what Samsung's Austin factory
presently makes. Soon, however, those conventional chips are
expected to speed up to 133 megahertz, resulting in performance
boost of about 10 percent that will show up in some computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even faster versions of conventional chips, employing something
called Double Data Rate technology, are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   So who wins this battle of technologies? Different analysts have
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest Inc.'s Jim Handy says the smart money has to stick
with Intel and the technology that Intel supports. Because Intel is
backing Rambus, Handy believes that Rambus will capture about 15
percent of the memory market this year and more than half the
market next year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Handy believes, is simply too powerful a force in the
computer business for memory chip makers to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mike Feibus of Mercury Research in Scottsdale,
Ariz., isn't so sure. Maybe there will be two high-speed memory
standards, he says, because Intel's main rival in the processor
business, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., doesn't seem interested in
backing the Rambus standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on the fence about which memory technology is
going to dominate,'' Feibus said last week. ``So far, we haven't
seen much movement toward Rambus.''
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of next year, the question of which technology
will win will probably be settled. In the meantime, there is plenty
of uncertainty in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the most fascinating years ever in
the computer industry,'' Feibus said.

FILING OFFERS A WAY TO FIND MICROSOFT VIOLATED THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft
antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its
Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious
benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers. But he then
proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining
that the bundling strategy violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar
and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson. It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust
law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case. The
intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will
probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government,
Microsoft and antitrust experts. Unlike other filings, it is not an
advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the
other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single
conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief. Instead, he stated
that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in
this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises
doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers
accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading
product. The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft
did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with
its Windows operating system. Microsoft asserts that the browser is
not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free
to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a
``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent
decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal
prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to
read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the
contours of antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software
was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if
prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time
dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal
with physical products like cars and tires. If given a chance at a
software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a
significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current
doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick,
however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly
applies to software products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _
that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a
dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be
whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at
anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its
interlinkage through contract or software.''
</P>
<P>
   Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the
legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate
tying law. ``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible
rationale for finding there were two products and a tying
violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University
of Iowa law school. ``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson
will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court
will buy it.''

Electronic filing may prove to be a quick, easy solution to what's
taxing you 
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Under the best of circumstances, filing income
tax returns is an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the worst circumstances _ you owe lots of money, your tax
situation is complicated, you don't have all the forms and records
you need, etc. _ filing your taxes can be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer technology to file your taxes can cut down on
some of the headaches and can even get you your refund a little
faster than paper filing. But unless your tax situation is among
the simplest, you'll probably pay a bit extra for the convenience
of electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic filing covers five methods of submitting income tax
forms to the government without filling in the traditional paper
income tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The methods are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Professional tax preparation services who specialize in
filling out tax forms for people who can't or don't want to fill
out their forms on their own. These services will file the returns
they complete electronically for a fee. Or you can fill out your
forms yourself and take them to a tax preparation service for
electronic filing, but the fees are quite high. You'll probably pay
two to four times as much to have a tax service file your return
electronically than you would pay an online service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Volunteer tax preparation services. Senior citizen service
providers and some social service agencies provide tax assistance
to certain groups, typically the elderly and the poor. The services
are usually free or carry only a nominal fee. Not every community
has volunteer tax preparers, and not all services are the same. So
you may have to call a couple senior citizen centers and other
agencies to see what might be available close to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Telefile, a free service provided by the Internal Revenue
Service that lets unmarried taxpayers of moderate income file using
a touch-tone phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home-based electronic filing using software programs. You buy
a software program, enter tax information to complete a return,
then pay the software provider to transmit your return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online tax preparation services. You skip the step of buying
software and log on to a tax preparation site on the Internet. You
pay to complete your return using the online system, and you may
pay a separate fee to have the service provider forward your return
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Carolee Pfefferman, acting public affairs officer for the
Internal Revenue Service office in Cincinnati, said the government
expects the number of people filing electronically to increase
every year as taxpayers become more comfortable and proficient with
electronic filing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pfefferman said the IRS expects 23.7 million taxpayers to file
electronically through professional tax services, up from 21.2
million who used the option last year. The number using Telefile is
expected to rise from 5.7 million last year to 5.9 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The largest percentage increase, however, is expected in online
filings. About 2.4 million taxpayers filed federal returns online
using software or Web-based tax services. The IRS expects 4 million
such filings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pfefferman said the government welcomes electronic filing and is
encouraging the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you file electronically, the chance for human error is
greatly reduced,'' she said. ``There's less chance for math errors
on the part of the filers, and less chance of error on the part of
IRS employees copying information from tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax returns are processed faster with fewer errors, and
refunds go out more quickly. Everybody benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   TAX SOFTWARE FOR 2000
</P>
<P>
   If you bought an income tax preparation software product for
your tax return last year, you won't be able to use it again for
this year's return.
</P>
<P>
   An article in this section last year erroneously implied that
income tax programs could be updated from year to year. Tax
programs can be updated when tax laws for the year they cover
change, but they aren't updated to cover subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax laws and tax tables change too much from year to year
to keep using the same programs,'' said Colleen Ferrin,
spokesperson for Intuit Inc., the leading producer of tax software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has entered the tax preparation software arena this
year with TaxSaver Federal and TaxSaver Federal Deluxe.
</P>
<P>
   Local software retailers are displaying the new Microsoft
programs alongside Quicken TurboTax and Quicken TurboTax Deluxe
from Intuit Inc. and Kiplinger TaxCut and Kiplinger TaxCut Deluxe
from Block Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information on the packages and the company Web sites,
the software programs are fairly similar.
</P>
<P>
   The basic tax programs lead users through the tax preparation
process by asking questions. The taxpayer uses the computer
keyboard to enter figures, names and addresses, and uses the mouse
to pick answers from multiple choice lists.
</P>
<P>
   When the questions are answered, the programs calculate the
taxes and produce a return for the taxpayer to check.
</P>
<P>
   After verifying the accuracy of the return, the taxpayer can
either print out a return and mail it or link to the company's Web
site to electronically file the return.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe versions of the three companies software work about
the same but they include onscreen videos of tax experts and other
extra features.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the costs of the programs can be complicated. Most of
the basic programs have a list price of around $20, and the deluxe
packages sell for $30 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all the packages offer significant rebates, and you
can get several of the tax preparation products for free if you buy
other financial management products from the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Also you have to calculate the costs of electronic filing and
the costs of state forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the programs include rebates for the fee for filing your
first electronic return. After that software companies typically
charge around $10 per return.
</P>
<P>
   None of the basic tax preparation packages include programs to
file your Ohio income taxes, so you'll have to buy a separate
program for your state taxes. But you may get a state program free
if you buy one of the deluxe packages.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE SERVICES FOR TAX RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   If you are comfortable working with businesses online, you might
want to consider using a Web-based tax service instead of buying a
software package.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies offering online services has increased
from last year, they are more experienced so their services should
be more reliable and easy to use, and competition is holding the
price of services down.
</P>
<P>
   Typically the fee for filling out and filing a federal income
tax return online runs about $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Online services work much like the tax preparation software
programs you buy for your home computer. In fact, the leading
software producers run Web sites using essentially the same
programs they sell to home users.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have a slow Internet connection, the process of
filling out tax forms online can be especially tedious.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not possible to link directly to IRS computers to
file your taxes online. For security reasons, the IRS requires
taxpayers to work through intermediary companies or agencies, and
generally the companies demand payment for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS responds to online filings with a confirmation notice
within 48 hours. If you sign up to have your refund deposited
directly to your bank account, you can have a refund in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To complete an online filing, you'll have to send the IRS a
signed Form 8453-OL along with your W2 forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you filed online last year, you might receive a special
electronic code number from the IRS this year. The code numbers are
being distributed to 11 million taxpayers as part of a pilot
project, and if you receive one you'll be able to use it to sign
your return electronically and skip mailing Form 8453-OL.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start getting information about your
electronic filing options is at the IRS Web site at
www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/elecsvs/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   From there you can link to the information page for individual
taxpayers. There you'll find listings for about 15 companies
offering tax filing services online.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES
</P>
<P>
   _ The Digital Daily at www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html is
the Internal Revenue Service's main taxpayer information site, and
it's quite complete. You can get answers to frequently asked
questions, download tax forms, find tips and statistics, and link
to commercial sites for online filing and tax software.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. Tax Code On-Line at www.fourmilab.to/uscode/ is basically
a site that links chapter by chapter to the entire tax code. Much
of it is in dense legal language that's hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of tax preparation software packages can vary as much
as $20 between stores, so it pays to shop around a bit. Also, just
about every package comes with some sort of rebate offer. If you
read the offers carefully, you may be able to get the tax software
for free if you're willing to buy other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The following prices were offered by the software manufacturers
online:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger TaxCut, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger daxCut Deluxe, $39.95
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger TaxCut Allstate, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft TaxSaver, $19.95

BOXER URGES PERMANENT BAN ON INTERNET TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly rundup of computer features)   By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer on Tuesday urged a federal
advisory panel to permanently ban sales taxes on the Internet,
warning that such a tax would be ``a gamble with our nation's
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the 19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, Boxer also argued that exempting Internet sales from
taxes wouldn't give Internet merchants an unfair advantage over
more traditional retailers because the e-commerce merchants have to
deal with shipping costs but store-based merchants don't.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing Internet sales ``would be a dangerous and unnecessary
gamble with our nation's prosperity,'' the California Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was created to advise Congress on how to deal with the
issue of whether sales transactions conducted on the Internet
should be subject to sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sales over the Internet, known as e-commerce, have exploded in
recent years, hitting about $20 billion during the 1999 Christmas
season. E-commerce is expected to triple every year for the next
four years, according to the National League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Because sales taxes are the lifeblood of state governments, many
state governments say they are losing tens of millions of dollars
in sales taxes as e-commerce mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   California's budget analyst Elizabeth Hill said earlier this
week that untaxed Internet sales may be costing the state as much
as $200 million a year in lost sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In urging that e-commerce remain untaxed, Boxer argued that
technological innovation has created high-paying jobs and that
taxing e-commerce would jeopardize economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe we should risk having this growth stymied by
imposing sales taxes on Internet transactions,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   She said sales taxes are intended to pay for such services as
police, fire, sewer and water for retail merchants. But, she
argued, those public service costs don't apply to sales on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers complain that they can't compete with
cyberspace merchants who aren't subject to sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Boxer noted that Internet sales require that the e-commerce
merchant ship the product to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Boxer wrote, ``the argument made by
brick-and-mortar stores that Internet sellers have an unfair cost
advantage is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments came a day before the Senate Budget Committee is
scheduled to hold a hearing on Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory commission was created by Congress last year to
make a recommendation on Internet tax policy. The panel's members,
who come from local, state and federal government and from the
e-commerce indwstry, are scheduled to present their recommendation
to Congress by April.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a state can't force an
Internet seller or catalog to collect sales tax unless it has a
presence in that state, leaving it to Congress to make any changes.
In 1998, Congress imposed a moratorium on new Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Tuesday she is awaiting
the commission's findings before making a judgment on Internet
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in a position to tell the commission what to do,''
Feinstein said. ``I have supported the moratorium and I believe we
should take no precipitous action.''

WEB SITES OPEN A WINDOW ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By NEVA CHONIN   
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To experience black history in progress, just step out the front
door. Look and listen. Almost every mode of pop music is grounded
in African American music forms. Everyday fashion statements such
as baggy jeans, flashy boxers and big, fat sneakers are direct
lifts from hip-hop couture. And much of our most fashionable
non-techie slanguage _ the kind that eventually makes it into
Webster's Dictionary _ hails from black America, not old Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When we stop to think, we remember these things. But we don't
stop to think often enough. That's where Black History Month comes
in. This four-week holiday of learning has been around since Carter
G. Woodson established it on Feb. 19, 1926 _ it was known then as
``Negro History Week'' _ but the possibilities for exploring its
richness have never been more diverse and accessible than they are
today.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet has opened the door to new ways of
researching the cultural contributions of African Americans. In
fact, there's so much information and so many resources out there
that it's easy to get lost. To help you on your way, we've provided
a starter list of sites documenting the black American journey.
Have an enlightening and rewarding trip.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Afro-America: The African American Newspapers Homepage &LR; 
(www.afroam.org). A comprehensive site offering a link to its own
African American History Museum, a kids page, news, classifieds,
Web links to Africa, an art gallery and a community discussion
board.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The African American Mosaic &LR; 
(www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/intro.html). This Library of Congress
research resource accompanies its African American collections, but
it stands alone as a meticulously documented exploration into the
African American experience from colonization, slavery and
abolition to the explosion of black arts in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; A Deeper Shade of History &LR;  (www.ai.mit.edu/people/isbell/HFh
/black/bhist.html). Part of the larger ``Deeper Shade of Black''
site, this page offers a splendid feature called ``This Day in
Black History'' as well as a search engine allowing users to
investigate dates of interest to them (what was happening on their
birthdays, for example).
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Family Education Network: Black History Month &LR; 
(www.familyeducation.com/topic /front/0,1156,1-4818,00.html?yah).
It may have an unwieldy URL, but this is a good site for parents
and kids to cruise together. The easy-to-access design offers
African American genealogy resources, literature links, quizzes,
polls and smart, informative articles that avoid pandering to any
particular age group.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The International Black Index Source Directory &LR; 
(www.blackindex.com). An excellent site that greets visitors with a
cool blast from a swanky saxophone. In addition to a history
section with a huge library and a variety of search options, it
offers extensive links to Afrocentric articles on business,
entertainment and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; NetNoir &LR;  (www.netnoir.com). Chock-full of information and
resources for the international, interactive black community,
including everything from provocative editorials on Puff Daddy to a
list of daily inspirations. The focus here isn't in history past
tense, but in making history as you go.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The Harlem Renaissance &LR; 
(www.fatherryan.org/harlemrenaissance). A primer on the genesis of
literature and fine arts in Harlem from 1920 to 1930. Includes a
historical overview and biographies of the era's most influential
writers and artists, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston
and Paul Robeson.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; We Shall Overcome &LR;  (www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights). A
national register of historic sites relating to the civil rights
movement. For those who want to relive the journey, it includes a

history of the movement as well as the strategies and people behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Juneteenth World Wide Celebration &LR;  (www.juneteenth.com). A
site with information on African American Emancipation Day, first
celebrated on June 19, 1865. Includes a poetry section, links to
related sites, a guide to celebrations worldwide and an
``Empowerment Zone'' for news and announcements.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; African American Timeline &LR;  (wanonline.com/blackhistory/1999/
tl.html). Created for Black History Month 1999, this timeline
begins in 1527 with events leading up to African colonization and
slavery and wraps up with 1997's Million Women March. Includes a
quiz and a multimedia section.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; BlackPlanet.com &LR;  (www.blackplanet.com). A great place for the
younger set. Attractions include everything from film and music
articles to news and career resources, chats and Web events. It
isn't necessarily grounded in the past, but it's a fun and valuable
online community resource.

HEALTH WEB SITES FAIL TO KEEP PERSONAL DATA PRIVATE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet health sites collect some of the most
personal information about their users, but few follow their own
declared policies about maintaining the privacy of that data,
according to a survey made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by the California HealthCare Foundation, found that
19 of the top 21 health sites had privacy policies but that most
failed to live up to promises not to share information with third
parties. And none of the sites followed guidelines like those
recommended by the Federal Trade Commission on collection and use
of personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes as policy makers are more closely scrutinizing
the privacy practices of Web sites to determine whether new laws
are needed to regulate online marketers. Privacy advocates
immediately cited the findings as proof that the Internet industry
had failed in its efforts to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the 7,000th piece of conclusive evidence that
self-regulation is not working,'' said Jason Catlett, founder of
the Junkbusters Corp., a company that helps people protect their
privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors were less judgmental, comparing the online
health industry to an awkward adolescent. Richard M. Smith, an
Internet security analyst, and Janlori Goldman, director of the
project, said health sites were well aware that consumers expected
the information they supplied to be confidential. They said they
believed that many sites were unaware that third parties could gain
access to the information they were collecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the privacy violations, Smith said, is the
use of so-called cookies, which track consumers' movements on the
Internet, and other advanced technology that delivers advertising
to Web pages and can pick up information entered by users on pages
where the advertisements are displayed. The combination allows
advertisers to build detailed profiles of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Smith said a site promising not to share its users'
names, addresses or other information had contracted with a company
to administer a health assessment test on the site, providing that
company with access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said it was plausible that many sites were unknowingly
violating their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these sites are being set up in great haste, and
often without sufficient knowledge or attention to the leakage that
takes place with online advertising,'' Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Although privacy advocates for years have been calling on
Congress to pass a law setting standards for Internet sites to
follow when collecting personal information, the Clinton
administration and the Federal Trade Commission have sided with the
industry in its call for a chance to prove that marketers and
online merchants can police themselves.

AOL, AMERICAN TO OFFER LOYALTY AIR-TRAVEL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATTHEW BRELIS   
 c.2000 The Bost/n Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. and American Airlines will combine their
rewards program to create the largest on-line customer loyalty
program in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year agreement between the nation's largest on-line
service provider and the second-largest airline will create AOL
AAdvantage and allow members to redeem points earned for air
travel, AOL membership fees and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are essentially creating a whole new currency for the
on-line generation,'' said Don Carty, chairman and chief executive
of American Airlines. ``By teaming the first and largest
frequent-flier program with the world leader in interactive
services, we're establishing a powerful new brand that we think
will change the face of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, first discussed last summer, the airline AOL
AAdvantage will be operated by a joint management team from
American Airlines and AOL's digital marketing services division.
</P>
<P>
   American's frequent-flier program, AAdvantage, has about 38
million members. America Online and its subsidiaries have some 22
million members.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Engel, an airline analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said
the program will benefit American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling frequent-flier miles is a very profitable exercise for
the airlines. If you can increase the usage of the program, not
only is that good because it is profitable traffic to carry, it
also increases loyalty, which is what frequent-flier programs
started for.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding consumer products including books, CDs, and
appliances, the program also will take some pressure off American
to redeem the miles, Engel said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gunn, American's executive vice president for marketing and
planning, said America Online has bought a pool of miles from
American for promotIonal offerings and both companies will be
involved in selling miles to other companies, such as retailers,
that want to be involved in the reward program. The revenue from
sold miles and advertising on the site will be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the program will be up and running by May.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: BILL GATES GOES WINDOWS SHOPPING
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Co-founding what has become the world's
largest software company has made Bill Gates the richest man on
Earth. But it hasn't made him content.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Microsoft will launch the latest version of its
operating system for personal computers, dubbed Windows 2000. But
Gates knows that even if it proves to be a hit, Microsoft has but a
few years' grace before the computing multitudes seek more robust
and simpler-to-use products.
</P>
<P>
   Gates came to this snow-covered Alpine ski resort to brief his
fellow entrepreneurs, as well as assorted ``media leaders,'' on his
newly self-anointed ``visionary'' role as Microsoft's chief
software architect.
</P>
<P>
   He told the globalizers: ``I think the evolutionary approach
won't get us where we really want to be. And so it's the same type
of bet that was made when we bet the company on the graphical user
interface, (and) when we bet the company on the Windows NT code
base.''
</P>
<P>
   In Windows 2000, the durable NT (for new technology) corporate
version melds with the automated plug-and-play routines of the
Windows 95/98 consumer versions. Microsoft sees the new software as
having a useful sales life of perhaps 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   Those three years, Gates said, will be spent trying to
seamlessly blend Microsoft's crown jewel with a wide range of still
emerging Internet functions. A voice interface is also in the
works. All that, Gates added, will require ``quite rational''
research spending of $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also believes that Windows 2000, as ``the largest systems
project in the history of the planet,'' creates a judicial bulwark
against the Justice Department's antitrust suit, which brands
Microsoft as a bullying monopolist. Should the trust-busters seek
to challenge Windows 2000, he suggests they would need to start
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Klein, the government's chief trust-buster, isn't
buying. He thinks the House of Microsoft may defeat itself under
the weighty burden of its inflexible ego-driven leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such tendencies were evident when a columnist asked Gates over
ice cream why Microsoft had hired a lobbyist in a vain bid to get
Congress to cut Klein's operating budget. Gates stared back in a
cold fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an outrageous characterization,'' Gates said. All
Microsoft had in mind was trimming back Klein's publicity budget,
he said. He alleged that Justice was using the funds to leak
damaging stuff as the case wound its way through federal court.
</P>
<P>
   While the snowflakes fell evenly on both Gates and Klein in
Davos, Klein was the guy in the white hat. Justice spends less than
$100,000 a year on its antitrust PR; Microsoft sought to cut
millions. (What truly enraged Gates were Klein's trips to such
places as Britain and Brazil, where Microsoft does business, to
coordinate antitrust work.)
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take $3 billion in annual research funds to figure
out that Gates has also bet the company by stubbornly playing
hardball with the feds. From his new spot on the mound as starting
software pitcher, he still seeks to throw strikes at the legal
plate.

 &HT;    Georgia may adopt school `councils', following Kentucky's lead
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. _ To see what could be in store at public schools
all over Georgia, look at the way teachers and parents sit down
together every month in decision-making bodies called school
councils in almost every school in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   From the hollows of Appalachia to cities of the Bluegrass to
farmlands on the Mississippi River, these elected councils are
changing the old relationships of parents, teachers, principals,
superintendents and local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely changed our role from that of manager or
supervisor to that of facilitator,'' said Karen Cheser, a central
office administrator in the 12,000-student Kenton County school
system, in northern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's 1,224 school councils, which typically appoint larger
committees to study anything about a school's operation that seems
important, control each school's budget with a near autonomy that
was backed up by a sweeping Kentucky Supreme Court decision in
1994. District school boards can no longer meddle in hiring or
other matters at individual schools, curtailing powers that some
say school boards had no business exercising anyway. Others say
that many principals and superintendents quietly undermine the
councils by controlling who is on them and how much information
they get.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's proposed school councils wouldn't have the power
Kentucky councils have. But the purpose is similar _ to create more
substantive parent and community involvement, according to Gov. Roy
Barnes' education reform bill. The bill would require all 180
school boards to set up seven-member councils in every school
during the next three years. This is Barnes' answer to critics of
his bill who ask, ``What about parent accountability?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts told the governor's education reform commission last
year that for the state to hold schools accountable for their test
scores, it must give them more authority to control how they are
run and how teachers teach. Involving parents and teachers in
decision-making can lead to stronger policies, they said. Barnes
borrowed the idea of school councils from Kentucky, known for
having the oldest and strongest system of school councils as part
of its bold reform law of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on student achievement has been hard to measure, said
Jim Watts, a school reform expert with the Southern Regional
Education Board, a consortium advising Southern governors. But, he
said, ``Ultimately, reform is the responsibility of school people
and the communities that they serve. At some point in time, this
stuff has to be embraced by local people.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea for Georgia's school councils is the same as
Kentucky's, with budgets, curriculum and hiring put under the
scrutiny of a representative body at the school chaired by the
principal. In both versions, councils hire principals from
nominations sent by the superintendent or school board. But there
are a few differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia bill puts two business representatives alongside two
parent representatives, giving the community outside the school the
dominant majority. Kentucky's five-member school councils have
three teachers, two parents and the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky parents sometimes complain that they should have more
of a voice to balance the three teachers, especially since the
teachers can be controlled by the chair, who is also their boss.
Others stick with the original thinking behind the teacher majority
_ teachers are the ones on the front line, under Kentucky's
accountability system.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, though, the experience in Kentucky is that
successful councils work with a consensus that makes the exact
representation irrelevant. ``When they work on a common goal, they
work wonderfully,'' said Cindy Hinds, a parent who nonetheless lost
some bitter fights as a member of the Caywood Elementary School
council in Kenton County. But she doesn't blame Kentucky's council
policies, which she said work well most of the time; she blamed a
lack of leadership at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a successful council, and a successful school in
general, is a strong principal, agreed Robert Sexton, director of
the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, a nonprofit
Lexington-based school advocacy group that has helped shape much of
Kentucky's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Good principals, these days, know that school improvement can't
be commanded from on high, say council advocates. ``Decisions are
made better if the people doing the work are part of the
decision,'' Sexton said. ``Their purpose is to organize the school
so that student achievement increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky councils have learned from experience that this means
not wasting time arguing about school parking spaces or where to
put the soft drink machine. Getting school councils and their
committees to focus on student achievement requires that they have
student test results and a plan to do something about those
results, said Susan Perkins Weston, director of the Kentucky
Association of School Councils, which represents just under half
the state's councils. Once they have a plan with a time line, they
can make decisions about anything from class sizes to staffing
without being second-guessed by the district's central office.
</P>
<P>
   Another essential requirement for successful school councils is
intensive training, Weston said. Such training not only teaches lay
people how to conduct meetings and reach group decisions, but also
how to understand school operations and student-achievement data in
deep enough ways to connect these two things. Since establishing
councils, Kentucky has added a requirement for six hours of
training for each new member, and three hours yearly for each
re-elected member. Weston said she'd like as much as 15 hours, and
a stronger training curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was dismayed to see the lack of training requirements in
Georgia's education reform bill. It gives local school boards the
charge of developing the training, although Barnes said he could
easily move that responsibility to the state school board. The bill
also says nothing about the hours or content of training. If that's
all that Georgia's reforms offer on training, Weston said, then
Barnes is not serious about school councils. ``It's a fraud,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Kentucky disagree, saying a comprehensive reform bill
doesn't have to get everything right at first, as long as it gets
everything on the table. ``Even if they make mistakes because of a
lack of training, I'd rather see that than to miss that
opportunity,'' said Bill Stearns, of the Office of Education
Accountability, an arm of the Kentucky Legislature with authority
to investigate and prosecute anyone who circumvents the
decision-making powers of school councils.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether Georgia's councils would have any
meaningful decision-making powers at all. Confined by the language
of the state constitution, Barnes' bill makes the councils advisory
_ but with a twist. Every council recommendation stands _ in other
words, becomes controlling policy _ unless the school board
overturns it under the public scrutiny of an open meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this is like having an appeals process for council
decisions, something the Kentucky School Boards Association has
lobbied for, said association head David Keller. ``If our boards
had that kind of safety hatch, I think there would be a lot less
concern about what happens if the council makes bad decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the power to make real decisions, say council
supporters, Kentucky would not have some 3,700 teachers and 2,500
parents sitting through exhausting meetings in school libraries
without pay _ and that's not counting the thousands more who do the
grunt work in committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they have the authority, and it's not going to be
advisory, and it's going to do things for children,'' said Charles
Edwards, who oversees school-based decision-making for the Kentucky
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   A possible weakness for Georgia councils, rather than a lack of
power, may be what some think is a lack of flexibility at the
school level. Carl Glickman, a University of Georgia education
professor who helped advise Barnes' reform commission last year,
said he is distressed over the way the reform bill dictates
policies such as the size of classes and the structure of the
councils. If a school decides to have some above-maximum class
sizes, perhaps using teacher aides, to free up money for other
things that should be a school-based decision, Glickman said. If it
wants a larger council with other sectors of the community
represented, that should also be a school decision, he said.
Glickman said he supports strong accountability from the state, but
coupled with equally strong autonomy at the school level.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' aides say that giving school councils the power and
flexibility they need will have to happen gradually, as they prove
themselves to school boards. To start out, Barnes sees school
councils as setting the pattern for achievement. ``They will be a
drum major for change, created in every school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, school councils can expand as long as the
proportions of teachers, parents and principals remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   The council at Woodlawn Elementary, a 600-student school outside
Danville, has been given waivers by Kentucky to have 16 members and
be chaired by a teacher, rather than the principal.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent council meeting, parent Erin LeMay, council
secretary, brought up the kind of question that could blow up at
another school, where teachers aren't used to having their policies
questioned by parents. One of the council's six standing
committees, the assessment committee, had successfully recommended
throwing out letter grades in kindergarten through third grade,
replacing them with such indicators as ``SP'' for ``steady
progress'' and ``AP'' for ``accelerated progress.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMay said she and several parents she had heard from were
unhappy seeing their children's latest report card because they
felt teachers were giving out too many undeserved APs. Annette
Cooper, the teacher who chairs the assessment committee, defended
the grading system, saying it was an attempt to get away from
having children compare themselves to their peers. LeMay stood her
ground. Another mom said children were well aware of how many APs
their classmates were getting, so they were still comparing
themselves to others. A third mother, a music professor at Centre
College, suggested tabulating the number of APs and SPs that each
teacher gives, as is done at Centre College.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers did not like that idea _ at all. Principal Max Pope
came to the teachers' defense. ``Some of those APs might be
deserved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're highly deserved,'' Cooper said somewhat icily.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was reached. The principal will talk to the teachers
again about the grading system, to try to make it more consistent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the oddly different perspectives of parents and teachers
were shared, and each side listened to the other respectfully.
That, say council supporters, is a huge step forward for public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the time and effort it takes to turn those shared
conversations into school governance is well worth it. Otherwise,
some suggest, the best state reforms will never reach the
classroom. Pope agrees, quoting something he had read from a
historian about American democracy: ``As someone said, the
government that governs best governs slowly.''

 &HT;    You take your chances with judicial elections
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When you get right down to it, Texas judicial
races are a lot like a back-room craps game. In both, a wrong move
can have dangerous consequences, and people trust an awful lot to
luck.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, an important distinction between judicial
elections and back-room craps games: You may get to know some of
the players in the back room. In a judicial race, most voters
haven't the slightest notion who the candidates are or what they
believe. So, when you get right down to it, you make a surer bet at
the back-room table.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial races make the eyes glaze over on most voters, but talk
about changing things and you're in for a fight as bruising as any
you're liable to get into in that back room.
</P>
<P>
   This is a result of a combination of inertia, politics and
absence of major scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Tom Phillips, chief justice of the Texas Supreme
Court, has expended a lot of his considerable intellect on the
issue of judicial selection. And for years, not much has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Texas voters, the state's judiciary is by and
large populated by good and dedicated people at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, however, we roll snake eyes.
</P>
<P>
   People whose Texas political memories stretch back a couple of
decades will recall the Don Yarbrough fiasco. He got elected to the
Supreme Court (some say because his name was similar to the late
Ralph Yarborough, who served in the U.S. Senate in the 1960s, and
unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Don Yarborough) but resigned
as the Legislature was gearing up to impeach him. He was later
convicted of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the more recent story of Steve Mansfield, the Court
of Criminal Appeals judge who fudged just about everything on his
resume _ including where he was born _ and wound up in the
embarrassing position of having to answer a trespassing complaint
filed by the University of Texas. Seems the judge was scalping his
complimentary tickets to UT football games.
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough wound up in prison. Mansfield declined to seek a
second term. Those two, however, are not the only errant judges in
the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to work at it hard to hear stories of judges who
are lazy, both physically and intellectually. You hear stories of
judges who suffer from what lawyers call ``robe-itis,'' a condition
caused by a belief that election to the bench is really an election
to the papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the system like to point to those as examples of what
happens when you roll the judicial dice. Others shrug their
shoulders and say all that shows is that judges are just as human
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has spearheaded efforts to change things, but setting
fund-raising restrictions has been about as far as his efforts have
been allowed to roll.
</P>
<P>
   A system of appointing judges has been advanced periodically but
seldom gets much attention. Gov. George W. Bush has been clear on
his preference for an elected judiciary, so there isn't much point
in wasting breath on it now.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, an array of amateur and professional observers say,
there is no incentive to go through all the hassle of a
constitutional amendment election _ necessary to overhaul the
system _ because there is no outcry for it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you listen to judicial candidates at all you will
hear some bemoan the fact that good judges lose elections simply
because of party affiliation. Republicans have lost in Democratic
tides. Most recently, it has been Democrats drowning in a GOP tide.
</P>
<P>
   That raises a cry for nonpartisan judicial elections. Not a bad
idea, actually, but one that falls into the ``fat chance''
category. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have worked for years to get to the point where
they can elect judges and they're not about to change things now,''
is the comment echoed by candidates and others who keep close tabs
on judicial politics.
</P>
<P>
   So that combination of inertia, politics and absence of major
scandal keep us at the craps table, and we keep rolling that dice.
</P>
<P>
   Let's wish ourselves luck.

 &HT;    Offensive Confederate banner not actually the official one
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Back when I was protesting the segregation of my
native South, I used to wonder what I would have done at the same
age during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   My relatives called the terrible conflict the War of Northern
Aggression or the War Between the States.
</P>
<P>
   My ancestors fought for the Confederacy. They fought long and
hard. I sure hoped they did not fight to defend slavery. I wasn't
sure what that would say about me.
</P>
<P>
   Since my relatives also fought in the Revolutionary War, and
every other war that came along, I hoped that their efforts were in
defense of their families, friends and neighbors, certainly not
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Lee was asked to head the army of the North. He
declined even though he abhorred slavery.
</P>
<P>
   William Faulkner, the Nobel-prize winning anti-slavery novelist
who chronicled the anguish and decay of the post-Civil War South,
said he also would have chosen to defend his home state of
Mississippi during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   If only a tiny minority of Southerners owned slaves, I know of
no uprising of Southern nonslave owners who struggled to overturn
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Even 100 years after the Civil War, it was obvious to me that
precious few of my fellow white Southerners still were ready to
give black citizens equal access and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   History books say the Civil War was fought between 1861 and
1865.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it seems as though the terrible war will never end.
The latest battle is over a Confederate battle flag that flies over
the South Carolina State House.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has threatened a boycott of South Carolina if the
battle flag is not removed.
</P>
<P>
   So far the candidates representing the Republican Party, which
is the party that fought to defeat the slave-holding South, have
ducked the issue by saying the decision is up to the people of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The battle flag is not South Carolina's official state flag nor
was it one of the three official flags of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The first Confederate national flag was the ``Stars and Bars,''
which turned out to be easily confused with the Union's ``Stars and
Stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate lawmaker who proposed the Southern Cross design
of the currently controversial battle flag could never win approval
to make it the national flag. Versions of that design were picked
up by some of the states and commanders as a battle flag. It also
was the Confederate Naval Jack.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederacy's second national flag was the ``Stainless
Banner,'' which didn't look like the Stars and Stripes, but it
contained so much white that it was confused with a flag of
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The third and final national flag added a red bar to the flag
that contained the Southern Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag has become the adopted symbol of the
Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other assorted racists and bigots.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame because it allows Americans to use this symbol to
advance their political agendas by keeping the divisions of Civil
War going from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas state flag uses elements of the Confederate
Southern Cross battle flag, which is incorporated in the flags of
Mississippi and Georgia. Other Southern states have flags that were
derived from the Confederacy. All Southern states have monuments
and memorials commemorating Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago I suggested that people who want to honor their
Confederate ancestors use one of the official Confederate flags in
lieu of the Southern Cross battle flag that is highly offensive to
many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I still think it is a good suggestion. And I still wonder what I
would have done had I been a young man during the Civil War.

 &HT;    New Hampshire voters showed they weren't up for barter
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush has won an election or two, so
don't call him a learner at this electoral thing. But Americans on
Tuesday were reminded of the difference between amassing a
political doomsday money machine _ capable of vaporizing any rival
_ and actually beating rivals on election day.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's Republican lesson proves most elemental: Donors
help. But to win, you need voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's result also raises questions about the soul of the
Republican Party, or at least those who claim it. McCain won
challenging two seemingly fundamental GOP tenets: first, that
massive tax cuts are more important than debt reduction; second,
that the dispensing of big campaign dollars is a precious right,
and that to harvest it is as American as amber waves and Wheat
Thins.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the big money didn't talk so loud in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Before we read too much into that and start discounting the role
of cash in politics, hear tolled the names of rivals Bush already
has squelched with his money: Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Lamar
Alexander and John Kasich _ all scared off before a single primary
was waged.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's monster stash effectively has won him the equivalent of
half a dozen primaries by narrowing the field, and that's
conservative. When all shakes down, it may have won him the
equivalent of 50, leaving McCain's New Hampshire coup as irrelevant
as ethanol in Iowa. Bush is en route to being able to refuse public
financing of his presidential campaign, freeing him of the spending
limits that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   In debates featuring McCain, Bush has taken a peculiar tack in
arguing against the kinds of controls contained in the campaign
finance bill co-authored by McCain and Wisconsin Democrat Sen. Russ
Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would ban soft money, the unregulated donations to
parties that serve as a dodge of campaign spending limits on
presidential campaign committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush response to McCain-Feingold? Rather than find the
highest ``high ground'' possible in defending the legal graft of
soft money _ the argument that campaign donations are patriotic
expressions on behalf of good government _ he took the purely
partisan route.
</P>
<P>
   His argument against McCain-Feingold, at least in front of
Republican audiences, was that it amounts to ``unilateral
disarmament'' _ taking away the GOP's means of amassing death-star
war chests from corporate soft-money donations while not taking
away the Democrats' advantages, principally with trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. McCain-Feingold would restrict unions just as it would
corporations. Unilateral it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Texans should have been surprised to see Bush address the
campaign-finance issue on a national stage as if only Republicans
were watching. Clearly the most commendable feature of Bush as
Texas governor has been his ability to be above partisanship. (Some
Democrats will say that rather than being magnanimous, Bush is just
crafty at co-opting his enemies.)
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that in New Hampshire such partisanship did not
play well, not even with rank-and-file Republicans. Though the
presence of independent voters joining the fray has been known to
skew results in New Hampshire, McCain defeated Bush among
registered Republicans as well as every demographic, income and age
group.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy McCain can be forgiven for an overstatement, that in
Tuesday's vote ``the Republican Party recovered its heritage of
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear where that heritage resides, and in what movement
it ever manifested itself in recent memory. But to such pillars as
Trent Lott, Phil Gramm, Tom DeLay, Mitch McConnell and the
still-front-running George W. Bush, campaign reform sounds as icky
as squid jelly.

 &HT;    Book of `mullets' pays homage to the hairstyle that always swims
upstream
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some hairstyles are considered classics.
Witness the bob, the pageboy, even the crewcut. On the right head
and under the right circumstances, they hold up decade after
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hairstyles that simply refuse to die, even
though they never looked all that great in the first place. Exhibit
A: The mullet.
</P>
<P>
   You know the mullet _ short on top, long in back. The haircut of
singer Michael Bolton, pitcher Randy Johnson and pro wrestler Hulk
Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime people think it's gone, it's back in some way,'' says
graphic designer Mark Larson. ``What's the power?''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to answer that question, Larson has penned ``The
Mullet: Hairstyle of the Gods'' (Bloomsbury USA, $15) with his
friend, writer Barney Hoskyns. ``You don't go to the hairdresser
and say, `Give me a mullet.' It evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's humorous, heavily illustrated book traces the
evolution of the mullet all the way back to Neanderthal Man, which
they say explains the use of the phrase ``Ape Drape'' as a synonym
for the hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, neither of whom has a mullet of his own, also gives
ink to the many incarnations of the modern mullet, from the Midwest
Metal to the Fading Glory, from the Latin Soccer Mullet to the
Lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the mullet is it's really two haircuts on one
head,'' says Larson, 48. ``It's not only bi-level, it gives you two
chances at life. It's that kind of good feeling when you've had
your hair cut, and then you also want to rock out and have long
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheek book began as a lark. Half-joking, Londoner
Hoskyns asked Larson, who lives in Woodstock, N.Y., if he wanted to
travel the American West snapping black-and-white, Richard
Avedon-style portraits of real people with mullets.
</P>
<P>
   They never made that road trip, but the 128-page hardcover does
contain shots of 18 mullet wearers from Woodstock, as well as a
section on mullet care and feeding (''the trick is to shampoo the
top tier more often than the lower level''), mullet cuisine
(''Twinkie-Misu: an easy adaptation of the classic Italian
delicacy'') and tips on mullet lovin' (''Don't say: `Didn't I see
you on America's Most Wanted?'; Do say: `Thank God, a real man at
last!''').
</P>
<P>
   And there's a salute to movie mullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood works in metaphor, and the mullet is shorthand for a
certain kind of power, a certain kind of nonconformity,'' Larson
says.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: Mel Gibson in ``Lethal Weapon 3,'' Jean-Claude Van
Damme in ``Hard Target,'' Eddie Murphy in ``A Vampire In
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never denigrate the hairstyle,'' Larson says. ``We love the
hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   So much, in fact, that they mainstain a Web site
(www.mulletgods.com) and are working on a movie treatment of their
book.
</P>
<P>
   MEET THE ROYALTY OF THE FISHIEST 'DO
</P>
<P>
   Mark Larson can't help but marvel at mullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `That's that '70s haircut.' Watch yourself
next week and see how many mullets you run into.''
</P>
<P>
   The mall might be a good starting point. That's where Larson
spotted a mulleted gent recently in Woodstock, N.Y. The man's
thick, chestnut hair was chopped short on the top and sides, but it
flowed like a horse's mane down his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this guy, and his hair is beautiful,'' Larson
says. ``That's the bizarre thing about it. It was actually
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at that, and you realize he'd be an ordinary guy
otherwise. It makes him spectacular in his own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Which three celebrities have had the most spectacular mullets,
according to Larson, who co-wrote ``The Mullet: Hairstyle of the
Gods''? The first two are easy:
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bowie: ``If there's a king of the mullet, it has to be
David Bowie,'' Larson says.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie sported mullets over the course of a quarter-century, from
the mid-'60s to the early '70s and right on up to '87.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have one presently, but that doesn't mean he won't
have one again,'' Larson says. ``The Ziggy Stardust mullet was a
profound choice. He went in and said, `This is what I want to
do.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Billy Ray Cyrus: ``The crown prince,'' says Larson, who
visited Cyrus backstage with members of the country singer's fan
club, many of whom were wearing mullets too. ``The symbol of his
artistry is his haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lou Reed: Actually ``third place is like a big tie,'' Larson
says. Other contenders in the book include Barry White, Paul and
Linda McCartney, Martina Navratilova and Buffalo Bill Cody.

wit. ``I love a baby T. How much is it? A dollar? Excuse me! The
Gap's too high.'' The designer, visiting Palm Beach for a personal
appearance at Saks and a charity fashion show at a private home,
has one hour to pull together three outfits from the thousands of
mismatched pieces at the South Dixie Goodwill. It's a gauntlet that
we've thrown down and he has gamely picked up.SS (Sturrock, Palm

   FASHION-SURVEY _ After years of all but outfitting herself in a

boring black and khaki. Beading and embroidery and ruffles, not

flats. Tailored clothes, not torn jeans and T-shirts. A look

But what do you wear? We have a survey for your readers. (Sturrock,

   HAIRSTYLES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some hairstyles are
considered classics. Witness the bob, the pageboy, even the
crewcut. On the right head and under the right circumstances, they
hold up decade after decade. Then there are the hairstyles that
simply refuse to die, even though they never looked all that great
in the first place. Exhibit A: The mullet. You know the mullet _
short on top, long in back. The haircut of singer Michael Bolton,
pitcher Randy Johnson and pro wrestler Hulk Hogan. ``Anytime people
think it's gone, it's back in some way,'' says graphic designer
Mark Larson. ``What's the power?'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 30.

   COXNET ENTERTAINMENT 0203 -- Why all this shake, rattle and roll
on television? For starters, nostalgia-waxing baby boomers who grew
up grooving to Elvis, the Rolling Stones and Motown now run the
networks. For them, rock 'n' roll and classic rhythm-and-blues
songs bring back memories of a rebellious, fun-loving era. And
everybody already knows the stories behind the songs. (Thompson,

   BOOK-NOTES _ When Nelson DeMille's novel, ``The General's

nasty reviews. The Long Island writer gets a small measure of
revenge in his new best seller, ``The Lion's Game,'' when he has
one of his characters talking about New York Times critic Janet
Maslin's ``tortured syntax.'' Maslin will have another shot at him,
however. ``The Lion's Game'' and his previous novel, ``Plum
Island,'' have been sold to Hollywood for $1 million each.

   BOOKS-WILLIAMGAY _ HOHENWALD, Tenn. _ It is a bitterly cold day
in this small, southwestern Tennessee town where explorer
Meriwether Lewis committed suicide. Turning up the collar of his
faded denim jacket, William Gay lopes across a near-deserted main
street and ducks into the local pool hall and cafe. Nodding briefly
to the locals, he waits for the woman behind the bar to flip a
hand-shaped hamburger patty on the grill and orders a beer. His
agent, Amy Williams, had described him as a cross between singers
Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett, and there is a resemblance. With a
tangled mass of dark hair and a face as lined as a Tennessee state
map, the 56-year-old Gay evokes the image of someone who has lived
hard and driven on a lot of dirt roads. Most folks in Hohenwald
know Gay as a carpenter and drywall hanger, but in the rest of the
South the self-taught writer is already being talked about as the
next Larry Brown or Cormac McCarthy. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   HAIRSTYLES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some hairstyles are
considered classics. Witness the bob, the pageboy, even the
crewcut. On the right head and under the right circumstances, they
hold up decade after decade. Then there are the hairstyles that
simply refuse to die, even though they never looked all that great
in the first place. Exhibit A: The mullet. You know the mullet _
short on top, long in back. The haircut of singer Michael Bolton,
pitcher Randy Johnson and pro wrestler Hulk Hogan. ``Anytime people
think it's gone, it's back in some way,'' says graphic designer
Mark Larson. ``What's the power?'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 30.

   BOOKS-WILLIAMGAY _ HOHENWALD, Tenn. _ It is a bitterly cold day
in this small, southwestern Tennessee town where explorer
Meriwether Lewis committed suicide. Turning up the collar of his
faded denim jacket, William Gay lopes across a near-deserted main
street and ducks into the local pool hall and cafe. Nodding briefly
to the locals, he waits for the woman behind the bar to flip a
hand-shaped hamburger patty on the grill and orders a beer. His
agent, Amy Williams, had described him as a cross between singers
Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett, and there is a resemblance. With a
tangled mass of dark hair and a face as lined as a Tennessee state
map, the 56-year-old Gay evokes the image of someone who has lived
hard and driven on a lot of dirt roads. Most folks in Hohenwald
know Gay as a carpenter and drywall hanger, but in the rest of the
South the self-taught writer is already being talked about as the
next Larry Brown or Cormac McCarthy. (O'Briant, Atlanta

SO YOU WANT TO BE A (WEB) ROCK 'N ROLL STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUGLAS BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the analyses written on the corporate motives behind the
giant Time Warner-America Online-EMI mergers overlooked the most
obvious, darkly ingenious one: to prevent you from becoming a rock
'n' roll star.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The great promise of digital music recording and
publishing via the World Wide Web was that anyone from a weekend
strummer to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince could bypass the
distasteful gatekeepers of the music business and market directly
to their audience. No more having to go crawling to record industry
weasels and publishing company turks, no more having to be
humiliated by sleazy managers and agents. The performer would
control all elements of the product, from conception to publishing
to recording to distribution.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I was counting on, and as soon as I wrote my Great
American Rock Anthem, I was planning to take advantage of the Web's
Marxist axiom.
</P>
<P>
   But look what has happened. The same gatekeepers who control
access to the major recording studios and the nation's CD bins now
_ or will soon _ control access to Web music. Suddenly, the company
that serves as the Internet gateway for more people than any other
in the world _ AOL _ merges with the company that owns the most
high-speed pipes _ Time Warner _ and buys the company that owns the
Beatles, Rolling Stones, and the Beach Boys, and hundreds of other
artists _ EMI. The merged company now owns song publishers, agents,
talent scouts, producers, and is already well on the way to
delivering its music catalog directly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this consolidation, which really began in 1998
when Universal Music Group bought Polygram Records, is
mind-blowing. The six big recording companies are now the four big
recording companies. And that may drop to two before the year is
over. Layoffs will come. Recording acts will go. Less music will be
recorded, not more. Fewer acts will be signed, and the barriers to
breaking into the business for artists will be ever higher. The
distribution of Internet music, which just four years ago looked
like it would be in the hands of upstart tech companies and
Internet visionaries, will now rest with hipsters Steve Case, Ted
Turner, and Gerald Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Already, record companies are trying to register the Internet
domain names of bands under contract in order to better control Web
distribution _ and reap the profits from it. Like bands who are
overlooked because they are deemed ``not MTV friendly,'' pop acts
of the future may go unsigned and unpromoted if they're unwilling
to relinquish their rights to Internet merchandising, T-shirts,
tickets, and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you give up the dream and put off buying
that DAT recorder and home mixer you were going to use to produce
your songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait,'' you say, ``what about www.mp3.com? That's a Web
site that was founded specifically as a place where artists could
post their own recorded music for free and sell their songs without
any middleman involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   You're right, I would say. But have you visited mp3.com lately?
While its Utopian motives are praiseworthy, the Web site is a
victim of its own success. The company could hardly be called a
little upstart with its $2 billion market capitalization. And right
now, according to the site, more than 31,000 independent artists
have posted nearly 200,000 songs. You'd have better luck trying to
become a pop star by skiffling on the nearest street corner than by
trying to be spotted among 31,000 other acts. It's like being on
the world's largest ``Star Search'' without Ed McMahon to guide the
audience through
</P>
<P>
   the rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the goal of most of the bands on mp3.com is not to
sidestep the recording moguls, but be discovered by them. But is
anyone really listening to this stuff? The record companies say
they have talent scouts who do little else but surf the site in
search of new acts. Few have been found. One executive from
Atlantic Records told Forbes Magazine last year that he gets better
music sent to him on tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Music fans aren't buying, either. While mp3.com receives a small
fee from song sales _ the rest of the money goes to the artist _ 85
percent of the company's revenue is coming from on-line
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Already the company has shifted gears and is trying to become a
vast warehouse of recorded music from established acts that is
being freely copied and openly traded among its members. But this
could be shut down at any moment if the record industry succeeds in
its lawsuits against mp3.com. Even if it fails on that front, when
the record industry finally gets its Internet act together and
stops worrying about illegal copying and bootlegging from sites
like napster.com, there's nothing to prevent it from hosting its
own mp3.com-like site (mp3.com owns no proprietary technology,
copyright or product). The major record labels could easily start
their own pseudo ``Star Searches'' and let unsigned bands post
recordings on their sites. If you had a choice between uploading
your homemade digital demo tape to mp3.com or to a Web site owned
by the company that has Mariah Carey and Bruce Springsteen under
contract, what would you do? Hello Sony, goodbye mp3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. The only thing a modern-day aspiring band or pop
singer needs is old-fashion advertising and promotion. And that's
the only element of the recording process that's still mostly in
the hands of the major companies. Home recording devices, mixers,
PC sound cards, rewritable CD drives, mp3 audio players, and the
vast distribution network of the Internet are all within easy reach
of the struggling artist.
</P>
<P>
   But no one will hear your music if they don't know where to find
you. The record companies can get behind an act and flood the Net,
the rock magazines, the airwaves and billboards with advertisements
for your latest song, CD, or video. Without that support, it
doesn't matter how good your songs are or even how big your name
is. The guy who used to be called Prince found that out last year
when he went over the heads of record company executives and
distributed his new CD on the Internet. It flopped, mostly because
few people knew where to go to get it (and partly because it was
just bad music).
</P>
<P>
   EMI last year did a survey of people who said they were fans of
Bonnie Raitt in an attempt to find out why her latest CD didn't
sell well. The most common answer was they didn't know she had
released a new CD.
</P>
<P>
   An even more stunning finding comes from the recording industry
itself: of the 34,000 CDs produced last year, just 94 sold more
than a half-million copies. If these artists, who are all signed to
labels, can't sell their music, what hope does an independent
artist have?
</P>
<P>
   The answer still could be on the Internet, if artists could
figure out how to harness its power to put people in touch with
music they want but don't know is out there.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldberg, a former Bain Consulting executive and former
director of new business for Capitol Records, thinks the
controversy surrounding Internet music distribution is old news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transmitting via the Internet is going to happen,'' he says.
``But distribution has never been a problem for this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, Goldberg says, ``is hooking people up to the
music they want even if they haven't requested it.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago he co-founded Launch Media, one of the biggest
music information sites on the Web (launch.com). Goldberg says the
industry should stop obsessing about piracy and making copy-proof
CDs and audio files (``The only truly secure music is music you
can't hear, and no one will pay money for that''), and focus
instead on connecting with the vast buying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of great music that people never hear, but
distribution is not the solution to that problem,'' he said. ``The
radios don't play new acts, MTV barely plays music at all, and
there's no way for a new artist to break through.''
</P>
<P>
   Launch, which has about 2 million registered users, lets
customers choose their music and set up personalized ``radio''
stations of varying genres. The site keeps track of the users'
tastes and eventually will recommend music by unknown artists that
the customer will likely enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   That, someday, might be how the Great American Rock Anthem will
get heard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999, the concept of working from home for yourself or an
employer came under fire:
</P>
<P>
   --Sociologists warned of the isolation and anxiety inherent in
working from home.
</P>
<P>
   --The federal government suggested that employers could be held
responsible for health and safety violations at the homes of
employees who telecommute _ a position that was quickly reversed.
</P>
<P>
   --Companies announced they were working on products designed to
keep a better eye on at-home workers' hours, feeding a perception
that telecommuters are slackers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tried them and studied them caution that
alternative work arrangements don't work for everyone and that
there are a variety of factors to consider, financial and social.
</P>
<P>
   Costs alone put teleworking out of the reach of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board, a business-backed research organization,
estimates that telecommuting and other work-family initiatives are
not an option for workers who earn less than $20,000 _ more than a
third of the US work force.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of telecommuters in November by the American
Management Association, about half said their employers loaned or
purchased the necessary equipment for them to do some or all of
their work at home.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of any additional phone lines needed was paid in full
or in part by the employer in just 36 percent of the cases. In a
survey by Computerworld last year, 59 percent of the 124
information technology managers responding said their companies
furnished telecommuters with all the equipment needed to work
remotely; 41 percent said those off-site employees supplied at
least some of their own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At HireSystems, which relies on 300 part-time employees in their
homes, the workers supply their own computers and high-speed
connections to the Internet so they can work directly on the
company's servers.
</P>
<P>
   But most telecommuters report that the gains in their personal
lives outweigh any additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Barry, director of the Community Reinvestment Act/Fair
Lending program at FleetBoston Financial, uses two phone lines, a
PC, and a fax machine, all of which she purchased, to work from
home.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to work at home once each week came about during a
study of flexible workplace options by the Radcliffe Public Policy
Institute, in collaboration with Fleet, more than two years ago. As
a manager working on the project, she decided to try being a
part-time telecommuter to aid her understanding of flexible work
schedules. She came to rely on the time away from the office for
strategic thinking and other work preparation and has continued to
telecommute every Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she likes the personal convenience associated with
being in her home once a week during the work week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that when I telecommute one day, the rest of my week
goes much smoother. I'm more organized,'' she said. ``But I think
it takes a special kind of person to do it. I'm very focused.
Sometimes, I work until 10 p.m. on Mondays.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Besemer of HireSystems agrees that not everyone is
suited for working at home. Usually, she said, the company and the
employee know within two months whether the arrangement will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that what doesn't work for some people is the lack
of a structured work environment. They had good intentions, but
find that with their schedules and other things, they just don't
get to (the work).''
</P>
<P>
   A host of Web sites offer resources, job listings (for
subscribers), and more information to help you decide if
telecommuting is for you:
</P>
<P>
   --www.pscw.uva.nl/sociosite/TOPICS/Telework.html(NU)USA
</P>
<P>
   From the University of Amsterdam, it has an extensive collection
of articles.
</P>
<P>
   --www.gilgordon.com/resources/reports.htm
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a consultant, specializes in telecommuting issues. The
site also contains how-to resources and lists of new products.
</P>
<P>
   --www.businessweek.com
</P>
<P>
   Use its search engine and enter the word ``telecommute.'' It
will return over four dozen articles published in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   --cta.ca
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Telework Association's site is extensive. There is
a US-based nonprofit organization called the International Telework
Association and Council, but the Canadian organization's site is
up-to-date and offers advice for telecommuters and those who manage
them.

<P>
   For those for whom Valentine's Day has become a marker for
love's disappointments or has come to symbolize a partner's soaring
expectations, there are no solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at least, there is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While cyberspace may not provide the definitive remedy it
certainly expands the possibilities. The offerings _ from gift
ideas and weekend getaways to bad poetry _ have caused an explosion
of romance-oriented Web sites this year. Virtual Valentine's Day
1999 was a plain affair. But, following a $5 billion e-commerce
Christmas, Internet consultants predict that Big Red is set to
become the next highly commercial holiday on line.

   The Valentine's Day cyberspace scene is so new there are no data
on sales or number of sites geared to the holiday. Still ``there
have to be hundreds, if not thousands of sites, that are doing
something special for Valentine's Day,'' says Alan Alper of Gomez
Advisors Inc., an e-commerce research firm in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, with its links and hyperlinks from one site to the
next, seems constructed for love. Retail sites decked in red offer
seemingly endless gift suggestions for Valentine's Day. And there's
more. Lovingyou.com promises no less than the secrets of ``getting,
falling and staying in love.'' Thelovechef.com offers romantic
recipes (chicken rice pilaf anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   But Virtual Valentine's Day, like true love, requires
imagination. Finding the sites is easy but it's only a start. When
choosing the perfect gift for the perfect guy or gal, it's all
about message. A problem with the Internet is the bewildering
number of ideas and information that proliferate like kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one cannot recklessly plunge into buying a
bouquet. According to GeraldStevens.com every flower has a specific
meaning. That perennial favorite, red roses, should not be sent
lightly _ they represent ``love and desire.'' Pink roses are a
perkier kind of love, with ``perfect happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   For the brooding type, it becomes much more complex. Did anyone
realize that by sending wormwood, the source of absinthe, one is
transmitting passion and torment? Or, that apricot blossoms express
timid love, and clematis _ those airy purple flowers growing on
chain-link fences in summer _ express artifice. For a spouse of 50
years, send cactus, which show bravery and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Stevens is at the very least an alternative to the subway
flower stand or Web florists, 1800flowers.com and FTD.com. The
company owns florists in 31 cities, guaranteeing freshness and
minimizing the likelihood of sending that special someone an
arrangement with a very unspecial plastic-heart balloon on a
pitchfork.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury gifts are in every nook of cyberspace now. I was drawn to
satiny red advertisements plastered on the sides of buses all over
Boston for RedEnvelope.com, which offers a mind-numbing range of
Valentine's Day choices. There are red roses _ make a statement by
sending three dozen, for $138. Or miniature roses to convey
miniature feelings, for $28. To express perfect love, try 10 pink
and white French tulips. If hipness is a consideration, there are
chocolate body paints for $24 (very in) or a rainbow of Pashmina
shawls for $295 (very out).
</P>
<P>
   With the Napa Valley picnic basket you can fly her to the Bay
Area _ or whisk her off to Revere Beach _ for $28 up to $159.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous soul, there are Valentine's Day weekend
getaways in the Green Mountains of Vermont or the blue Caribbean on
lodging.com. For wine lovers, there is wine.com with a cellar full
of Valentine's Day gift ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For guys, RedEnvelope.com sells four types of cuff links
(starting at $75): golf balls, footballs, sand timers, and _ my
personal favorite _ squares! For those lucky enough to have a
sweetheart who is a sea captain, there is an explorer's pocket
scope or a leather journal. And for those prone to seasickness, a
miniature yacht for floating on the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Men are difficult to buy for. It goes without saying that what
many may be most eager to receive can be found in the kama sutra
pleasure box, which has oils, balms and ``honey dust'' (?)'' for
$65. Perhaps the kama sutra weekend kit, for $22, will do. How much
oil can one couple use?
</P>
<P>
   For braver hearts, there are diamonds, diamonds, diamonds. Do
women actually wear those diamond or ruby heart pendants that are
de riguer on Valentine's Day jewelry sites this year, such as
diamond.com _ an Internet road map to diamonds, carats, and
auctions _ and mainstream jeweler denmans.com. High-end sites for
high-priced jewelry include mondera.com or tiffany.com, which I
recommend tackling with a neat glass of scotch and plenty of time
to wait for slowly unfolding images of floating white ribbons and
golden jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   A husband or boyfriend might go for jewelry, if it were a
vintage Rolex or Cartier watch offered on miadora.com. A very cool
gift for a guy, vintage watches range cost $2,000 to $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we're getting ahead of things. For those who haven't
found their soulmate yet, dating sites are claiming more success as
more people explore cyberspace. Think about it: the possibilities
for finding a mate are as infinite as gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much anxiety about creating a perfect Valentine's Day,
there is overwhelming support for the holiday, according to a
survey of 1,009 singles by People to People (people2people.com), an
on-line dating service based in Boston boasting 960,000 members.
Those singles who made up the minority voted to cancel Valentine's
Day because it's too hyped, too expensive, and creates too much
pressure to find a date. Relax. Find a date by Valentine's Day on
the Internet. Everybody's doing it, People to People's survey
revealed: Nearly two-thirds of singles surveyed believe people will
meet a mate in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The undiscriminating can meet like-minded folk and strike
conversations in chat rooms that are a dime a dozen. I was lured by
pulsating red hearts that decorate the amateurish Cupid Connection,
mscupid.com. You can browse the site and click on potential mates
in three categories: women, men, or Alaskan men. Alaskan Men??!
Hmmm . . . Alaska, a place of ``stark beauty and rugged
wilderness,'' has another natural resource: ``the most wonderful
and eligible men imaginable!'' Bill, who plays bluegrass and wears
a funny hat, looks pretty eligible. Troy is a ``non-drinker,
non-smoker, no drugs, non-judgmental, positive outlook, and can
just take life day by day.'' It doesn't get any better than that!
</P>
<P>
   There are more private places to meet than plastering your bio
on the Internet equivalent of a bathroom wall. Match.com, which is
owned by Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., and Matchmaker.com
and are said to be popular with professionals who don't have much
time for a partner-hunting. America Online Inc. also has a dating
site, Love(at)AOL.com.
</P>
<P>
   To check out what's available on most dating services, you are
required to sign up. But interlopers
</P>
<P>
   are urged to sign up with a seven-day, free trial offer. So, I
did. What's to lose? Match.com promised me no less than the perfect
mate, right down to the color of a desired partner's hair _ dark or
light brown or salt-and-pepper _ and their emotional availability
or lack thereof. You click on the single/never married category or
divorced category. For that special temporary someone, you can
click on married or separated. (Wives may find this handier and
cheaper than hiring a private detective to spy on a wayward
husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, you fill in a list of preferred activities, a veritable
``walk on the beach'' of life's dating possibilities. (Is there
someone out there who does not like to walk on the beach?) To
match.com's credit, suggested first dates include novelties such as
``horseback riding on a dusty trail.'' In a section called ``My
friends describe me as. . .,'' there is room for the ``mildly
neurotic,'' the ``brainy/intellectual'' or the ``theatrical/life of
the party'' type, with lampshade I presume.
</P>
<P>
   You fill in the blanks, write up a scintillating profile of
yourself, and sit back and wait for the e-mails to flow in from
prospective partners. Trish McDermott, vice president of romance,
said 300,000 people have met someone on Match.com, resulting in 800
confirmed marriages. She believes the marriage figure is actually
higher. ``When people are successful they leave us.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people shop on the Internet for mates and bouquets of
flowers, there is a growing need to discern who or what is
legitimate, consultants warn. For example, you type in
``chocolate'' and lists of sites pop up, including
GiveChocolate.com, fowlerschocolates.com, rothschild-chocolates.com
(for truffles), grannyschocolate.com (``darn proud'' of its
chocolate candy roses), and virtualchocolate.com. In picking any
chocolate site, one fears that is precisely what one will get _
virtual chocolate. Valentines.com promises greeting cards, chat,
poetry, flowers, music, and, of course, chocolates. But, as of Jan.
24, the site was under construction _ perhaps awaiting financial
backers.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to protect against Internet fraud, such as buying
from retailers that exist in the real world. Gomez Advisors
recommends that in buying jewelry, for example, you should get a
certificate of authenticity. ``It's a mating game. There's a
certain comfort level,'' Alper says.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to take no chances and still enjoy Valentine's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   For the cheapskate at heart, there's lots of free Valentine's
Day stuff on the Web. Cupids Corner promises ``everything you
need,'' including a history of Valentine's Day. According to myth,
under Emperor Claudius II, Rome was having difficulty signing up
soldiers who did not want to leave their families to go out and be
slaughtered, so marriages were stopped. But the ``good Saint
Valentine'' began secretly marrying couples until his head was cut
off on February 14th. Apparently, love and war have been
entertwined since the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Free greeting cards are jamming up traffic on the Internet.
Breakupgirl.com, a cheery site geared to teenagers, offers to send
candy hearts containing messages such as ``Fries with that'' or
``Other fish in sea'' or ``It's over.'' To send cards, there are
zillions of sites, from search engine Yahoo! to
BlueMountainArts.com and americangreetings.com. Valentine's cards
can be custom-made for, say, German Shepherd lovers on
fortunecity.com. One begins to understand why the Internet is often
a money-losing proposition. I liked the advice of of Michael Webb,
editor of the Romantic Newsletter. He suggests sending an actual
paper card via Loveland, Colo. The Chamber of Commerce will stamp
the town's name and a short poem on it. Webb also suggests
including one of Shakespeare's sonnets, which can be found through
any search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, you can write a poem with help from
www.nando.net/toys/cyrano/v2.1/loveletter.html. By answering
questions about your love's favorite food or article of clothing,
the site will elicit a full poem with lines such as ``Unliked with
hamburger hope that thou wouldst free/Your flannel shirt from a
dark slavery.''

TALKING RATES: PRICE COMPARISONS ON-LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's OK to admit it: You think you want a cellphone, but all
those the ``best deal'' ads, with their 400-minute plans and free
nights and weekends, give you a headache.
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site can help.
</P>
<P>
   Called www.GetConnected.com and run out of offices in Cambridge,
Mass., the site offers a regularly updated, easy-to-use way to
compare wireless calling plans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful features lets you specify the amount you
want to spend per month for a wireless phone, then see how many
minutes different carriers will sell you _ and with which
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I told the site I wanted to get a wireless plan in
metropolitan Boston that would cost no more than $40 a month, with
no charge for calls on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In half a second, the site informed me the most minutes I could
get would be 400, under a $39.99 Omnipoint plan. But it would also
squeeze me for a shocking 49 cents a minute for long-distance
calls. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there were two other options, a $35 Cellular One
package (with 300 minutes and 25-cent long-distance) and a $40 AT&AMP;T
Wireless plan (with 300 minutes and 15-cent long-distance).
</P>
<P>
   If you think you know how many minutes a month you will use your
wireless phone, you can also have the site produce comparisons for
60, 120, or 300 minutes, or for anything up to 1,500 minutes
(that's almost an hour a day) in increments of 300 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you can use the site to sign up immediately for a
plan, by clicking on an ``order here'' button. This means the
company offering the plan, such as AT&AMP;T Wireless or Bell Atlantic
Mobile, has paid an advertising fee to GetConnected.com. Clicking
on listings for nonadvertisers only tells you how to call them.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, that connection may raise red flags about whether the
site is really impartial, or whether its owners are tempted to
steer you toward advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insist there is nothing unethical going on,
however. They know that, in the long run, savvy Net customers will
shun the site if they think GetConnected has gotten too connected
to its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to providing consumers with free access to
comprehensive, unbiased information,'' said company cofounder Tracy
Lawrence, who graduated from Harvard Business School last June and
set up the company with classmate Sasha Novakovich.
</P>
<P>
   One place to go for a second opinion is www.contentunwired.com,
a San Francisco-based site that ranks the best three deals in each
of several different calling-plan categories. This site, however,
is far more general, less frequently updated, and nowhere near as
geographically specific as GetConnected.com.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless calling plan search, by the way, is one of only
several telecommunications shopping comparisons offered by
GetConnected.Com.
</P>
<P>
   By entering your hometown, you can also get a list of local and
long-distance telephone companies' plans and information about
Internet access, cable television, and companies such as ServiSense
and Essential.com, which sell ``bundles'' with other services, such
as heat and electricity.

TELECOMMUTING 2000: STILL NOT PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.E. MALONE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fire up the personal computer, with its high-speed data line and
VPN access software _ don't forget the coffee maker and the
toaster, too _ then go to work, without ever leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting may not always be as easy as all that. But the
number of people who try it and the number of companies
accommodating such arrangements, even if only part time, is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the trend are increasingly more sophisticated tools and
no shortage of entrepreneurs, who are looking to capitalize on the
at-home labor force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is one of the big enablers now,'' said Mary Porter,
a senior analyst for IDC Inc., a market research firm. ``Remote
access to the office on a high-speed line is helping to drive
telecommuting and working at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinning down the number of people who work partially or
exclusively at home is difficult. Government estimates are
considered conservative; private enterprises that publish estimates
use differing definitions of home-based work. Nearly all agree,
however, that telecommuting has not lived up to forecasts that a
much larger segment of the American work force would occupy
``virtual offices'' in or near their homes by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the predictions about telecommuting are made by those
of us who are advocates,'' said Wendell Joice, a research
psychologist with the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at almost any of the things that were predicted
when we switched from being an industrial society to an
information-based one, you'll see similar results. We're doing it,
but not going gangbusters yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to a 1998 survey by IDC, more than 10 million
American households have a member who worked from home for an
employer for at least three days a month in 1998 during normal
business hours, up from 9.1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When home-based businesses and freelance contractors are
counted, the number might be closer to the 23.8 million households
that IDC projected contained a home office in 1999 that was used
for at least some income-generating purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who works from her Long Island home for the Framingham
company, said there is also evidence that small-business employees
may be contributing to much of the current buzz about
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   A January 1999 survey of owners of small businesses found that
almost 28 percent of employers with fewer than 100 workers had at
least one employee who worked from home on a somewhat regular
basis. That was up from 24 percent the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Besemer, president and CEO of HireSystems of Waltham,
Mass., runs a company where the number of telecommuters outstrips
full-time office workers almost 3 to 1. HireSystems dissects
resumes for clients who come to them for Web-based help in
streamlining their hiring. In addition to 110 in-office workers,
about 300 people are employed from their homes on an hourly basis
with work weeks that range from 10 to 35 hours. The majority of the
workers are stay-at-home mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real advantage to us is that it gives us an accordion-like
capability to expand or contract, based on the workload,'' Besemer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home-based work ``allows us to grow at the rapid rate we're
growing, and it's wonderful to work at a company where the core of
the business actually thrives on this.''
</P>
<P>
   About one supervisor is needed for every 80 to 100 home workers,
she said, compared with one for every 10 to 15 office employees.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are working on the company's server, ``we can
always observe their work, keep track of their hours, and check on
their quality,'' Besemer said.
</P>
<P>
   I Belong Networks, based in Waltham, provides a laptop and a
cubicle with a large monitor to most of its 80 employees, but when
and where they do their work each day varies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very autonomous environment where people are
responsible for their own work,'' said Kirsten Lewis, who handles
public relations for the two-year-old company, which develops
portals for affinity groups. ``Whether you want to telecommute or
use flex time, the company really makes it easy for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Cui was recently hired as an engineer. With two daughters,
ages 1 and 9, she is able to shorten her time in the office two
days each week and pick up where she left off at home after the
girls are in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Using virtual private network (VPN) access software on her home
computer, ``it's exactly the same as working at my office.'' She
described this flexibility as ``a major reason that I joined this
company.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Cui takes advantage of the flexibility offered to help
with her family obligations, some employees juggle work with study
and other demands.
</P>
<P>
   June Langhoff, senior editor of Telecommute Magazine in
Pacifica, Calif., predicted that the competitive labor market and
high residential and commercial real estate prices near cities on
the East and West coasts will continue to feed the number of
workers who need or want to telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have almost full employment in certain sectors'' of the job
market, she noted. ``Companies will do almost anything to attract
talent _ employers have to be a lot more flexible.'' There is also
a cost savings for many companies. In the case of HireSystems, the
cost of office space and computer equipment is significantly less
than it would be with an in-office work force of more than 400
full- and part-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   A study done for the International Telework Association and
Council last year concluded that employers also save money because
of increased productivity, decreased absenteeism, and greater
worker retention. There is no shortage of companies that see a
marketplace full of workers and small-business owners who will use
the Web and other technologies to work more efficiently and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Some measures used by companies to accommodate telecommuters
have proven unpopular with workers. For example, ``hoteling,''
whereby telecommuters who periodically need to use the home office
reserve a cubicle for the purpose in advance, left many feeling
like second-class employees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the capability created by high-speed, ``always
on'' connections to the Net through cable providers and digital
subscriber lines, a host of products in the design and
implementation stage will enable work to be conducted by a
dispersed work force.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual private networks allow employees engaged in business
from home to access the corporate network securely. Businesses that
run large customer service call centers _ from large utility
companies to catalog merchandisers _ can now use the Internet to
allow agents to answer large volumes of customer service calls from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based application service providers make it possible for
smaller, home-based businesses to rent access to the latest
software tools, without making large investments in the products.
And for those who work more from their cars than from a home or
office, both General Motors and Ford expect to have limited
voice-recognition capability in several 2001 model year cars to
enable workers to access their e-mail through their cellular phone
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are retooling their products or creating new ones
to target those who work without the supports typically found in an
office setting.
</P>
<P>
   TimeBills.com of Boston recently released new Web-based products
to help small businesses and independent contractors keep tabs on
their time, expenses, and client invoices without buying a series
of software packages or doing it manually. The company's vice
president of marketing, Jeff Hunt, said that 11 million service
professionals work for companies with fewer than 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are opening up shops of their own, especially
Web-related businesses,'' he said. ``This a group that will adopt
this kind of service; they have no distrust of on-line services.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``huge growth potential'' of this market as his company
seeks to increase its accounts from 13,000 to 100,000 by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Centra Software, of Lexington, Mass., has about 180 corporate
customers, many of whom are large, global companies that use their
software to collaborate with colleagues worldwide, using Internet
voicing technology to share conversations, presentations, and
applications. The company has adapted its technology to a new
Web-based product designed to allow smaller companies and
individuals to meet with clients and others with nothing more than
a Web browser and standard multimedia setup on their personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to collaborate with a business partner or client
very easily,'' said Ellen Slaby, who directs public relations for
the five-year-old firm.
</P>
<P>
   To Porter, the potential is there for telecommuting to mount in
popularity, most especially among workers in technology fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people are really experiencing the type of speed and
connectivity they have at the office, then they really can do their
job from anywhere,'' she said. ``There is still a great desire on
the part of many employees to work at home _ though it is not
universal.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Catholics, Jews face changing times
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 6, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the resurgence in religious fundamentalists within the
United States, these are not the best of times for them. Hypocrisy
and falsity hover over them like a plague.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a Kansas City Star investigation uncovered what
it claimed to be several hundred Roman Catholic priests suffering
with AIDS. The interviews located victims, but they danced around
the root cause of the lethal disease. Anyone who can think with his
or her own brain can draw a picture of what caused it, even though
the church is saying everything but what it needs to say: the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the harsh stance the Roman Catholic Church has taken
vis-a-vis homosexuality, it is a grand dilemma. Not only does the
church consider homosexuality to be an abomination but it demands
celibacy of its priests. Vows have been broken.
</P>
<P>
   The years of openly condemning gay cohabitation and gay
marriages weigh heavily on the Catholic church. How can it create
an understanding of its own priests' foibles but not be
understanding of its parishioners'?
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation is dogging elements of Judaism. At a meeting
scheduled for March, the Central Conference of American Rabbis will
vote on a resolution that would permit Reform rabbis to perform gay
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   This more liberal wing of the Jewish faith several years ago
voted in favor of civil marriages of gays, but, if passed, the new
resolution would take them up the steps of the altar to stand
before the Holy Scriptures and be married.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this most interesting to me is the dogmatic practice
of most of these same rabbis in refusing to perform a
mixed-religion wedding. I will keep an eye on my own rabbi to see
whether he agrees to enact gay marriages while still refusing to
perform mixed marriages.
</P>
<P>
   My two sons both married Christian girls and my rabbi declined
to participate in the ceremonies. It left me scouring the
countryside for a Reform rabbi _ any rabbi _ who would stand
alongside the Christian minister and co-conduct the ceremony. They
are there; some of us call them Renegade Rabbis because they have
no temple. They just travel around performing ceremonies that other
rabbis will not. But there are not many of them.
</P>
<P>
   I assume something similar will happen with gay marriages. The
resolution to permit them likely will pass, but that doesn't mean
most rabbis will perform the services. Like mixed marriages, even
liberal rabbis have a line drawn somewhere. Gay marriages likely
would be for the Renegade Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The reform movement of Judaism is caught between two significant
factions. It never has been accepted by the Orthodox rabbis,
particularly in Israel, where it has been proclaimed that Reform
Jews are not really Jews. (So what am I?)

<P>
   Now, if it assents to validate gay marriages, whatever softness
there was in the Orthodox vs. Reform schism will grow harsh again.
The Conservative wing would be expected to side with the Orthodox,
which accepts that the Holy Scriptures consider homosexuality to be
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   We live in different than biblical times. What the early rabbis
interpreted, and what Peter preached, is being overtaken by
real-life, complex experiences. Even dogmatism has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   If a rabbi, priest or minister wants to marry a gay couple,
that's their business. Whether the governmental sector looks upon
it as a legal marriage is another matter. But while the rabbis will
argue about that next month, don't forget that heartbreaking
embargo on mixed-religion marriages.
</P>
<P>
   They're not evil, just young kids in love.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Retreat from nationhood in the high court
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dumb and happy, most of us have been bopping through life on the
blithe assumption that our American citizenship came with oodles of
legal and constitutional rights and that if anyone tried to mess
with them, we could turn to the very nation itself, as represented
by the federal courts, to stand up for us.
</P>
<P>
   Silly us. The U.S. Supreme Court in recent years, with a
particularly busy hammer over the past year, has been tearing down
that protection. And the political system, especially the
Republican Congress but abetted at the margins by President
Clinton, has been adding legislative wallop to the reactionary turn
to state's rights.
</P>
<P>
   A number of bills were at play last year to let state and local
governments override federal regulations they don't fancy. Expect
more this year. One, enacted in 1996 and signed by Clinton, is
freeing state prisons and local jails from federal-court oversight.
Prisoners are being returned to the mercy of the sometimes
merciless, with diminished resort to a national standard of
decency.
</P>
<P>
   But the most energetic retreat from nationhood has been in the
Supreme Court, usually by a 5-to-4 call.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last month told lower federal courts in
Illinois and New York to rethink rulings that states and state
agencies must abide by a 1963 federal law requiring employers to
pay men and women equally for equal work. The justices cited their
ruling of the previous week that state workers aren't protected by
the federal law banning age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Usually invoking the Constitution's 11th Amendment and sovereign
immunity, the high court since 1992 has eaten away at Congress's
power to revoke state immunity. Congress may now do so, it appears,
only on constitutional, not statutory, matters.
</P>
<P>
   The court held last year that Congress can't subject the states
to lawsuits for patent violations. It has implied that federal
fair-labor standards _ for minimum wage, overtime pay rules _ are
doubtful. Similar challenges are under way against the Violence
Against Women, Medical Leave and Americans With Disabilities acts.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow court majority is dusting off doctrines and
interpretations that had been gathering cobwebs in the legal attic
since the late 1930s, reverting to an antagonism toward national
government that had seemed definitively retired in favor of an
understanding that Congress has broad powers to act in the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over how power should shared between Washington and
the states are as old as the nation and periodic fine-turning is
fine. The court would do well to haul the politically grandstanding
Congress back from federalizing what should be state and local
crimes, like carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite another matter, however, to take back evolved
protections for individual rights _ and into the bargain hamper
pragmatic economic unity in a globalizing economy _ in the name of
an 18th century political ideology that was argued to an uncertain
standoff even in its own time.

CELLPHONES, HEADSETS _ WHAT ELSE IS NEW IN WIRELESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you see someone walking down the street, talking
animatedly to no one, check to see if she has a wire dangling out
of her ear before you decide she's nuts and avoid eye contact. It
could be she's caught on to what seems to be the hottest fad in
wireless telephone gadgets: the cellphone headset.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices _ already a full-scale trend in the trendiest parts
of Los Angeles and Miami _ allow you to talk on your wireless phone
without using your hands. They are becoming hot sellers among local
wireless providers. You keep the phone in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be the most common thing we're seeing with new
subscribers,'' said Karin Olson, spokeswoman for the New England
operations of Omnipoint Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two months, probably 20 to 25 percent of new
subscribers'' asked for them,Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   David Thomson of Bell Atlantic Mobile agreed: ``The biggest
trend we're seeing is headsets, both to promote safety and to
improve the convenience and clarity of conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of its rivals, Bell Atlantic Mobile offers headsets
for every phone it sells, ranging in price from about $15 to $30. A
headset plugs into an outlet on the telephone, so the subscriber
has two hands free to drive or work on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a few different models:
</P>
<P>
   --``Ear buds'' have a little plug that fits inside the ear and a
miniature microphone that dangles from a wire.
</P>
<P>
   --Headsets with ``boom'' microphones, like
</P>
<P>
   you would see an airline reservation agent wearing.
</P>
<P>
   --``Ear caps'' slip over the top of your ear, which some people
find less annoying than having a little plug in their ear canal.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Bell Atlantic plans to roll out improved headsets
with volume controls and ``noise cancellation'' technology to focus
the sound of your voice _ not the kids' screams from the back seat
_ into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, once problems with recharging batteries are
worked out, Bell Atlantic hopes to roll out the ultimate: a
wireless wireless headset, with no cord connecting the headset to
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   At least one motivation for the products seems to be largely
unproven but hard-to-extinguish concerns that using cellphones can
cause brain cancer or other illnesses. Even though current digital
phones use far less power and emit much less electromagnetic
radiation than the first-generation wireless phones of the 1980s,
many people prefer to keep their phones what feels like a safe
distance from their brains.
</P>
<P>
   A company called EarHugger in Lindon, Utah, on the Web at
Earhugger.com, sells a $15 improved wireless phone headset that has
no microphone. It picks up the sound of your voice through
vibrations transmitted through your jaw and works on Ericsson,
Nokia, and other units.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular new wireless gizmos include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $90 desktop device that turns your wireless phone into a
speakerphone. Bell Atlantic plans to begin selling it locally later
this month, initially for the Motorola StarTac line of phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Communications, whose phones with built-in two-way radio
capabilities make them popular with tradespeople, delivery fleets,
and public safety officials _ but a little pricey for average
consumers _ sells a range of Motorola phones that have a speaker
phone built in.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you still don't believe that wireless phones are not going
to turn your brain to microwaved mush, Consider spending $59 for a
Microshield sheath made of PVC plastic, wire mesh, and leather.
It's available at wavelengthonline.com. and includes a part that
covers the antenna, the source of most radiation emitted by the
phone while allowing you to see the screen clearly.

<P>
   Most humans who have ever lived have known roughly where they
were, day by day, year by year. Not in abstract terms, of course,
but in the terms of experience and familiarity _ by neighborhood,
not map.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, we've known things about ourselves that could be
expressed in a statement like ``I'm standing on the threshing floor
in the village of my birth,'' or even, ``I'm in a part of town I've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we utter it or not, this awareness of ``whereness'' is
part of the meaning of being human. But for centuries, a dedicated
band of mapmakers, navigators, astronomers, inventors and
mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
of change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know where they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

<P>
   If it feels as though a battery in your skull has run out of
juice when you work too hard, that's because it has.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of nerve cells dwelling inside your cranium are a
lot like tiny, rechargeable AAs. In most cases these cells won't
tire enough for you to notice, but with careful observation, you
can catch them napping.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons are reservoirs of electrical charge. When stimulated, a
neuron sends an electrical signal and then needs some time to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   During a resting phase _ which can last 10 seconds and longer _
other active nerve cells continue to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances this neural tradeoff is seamless and your
brain doesn't detect the shift of activity from one neuron to
another. But once in a while too many nerve cells expend too much
energy too quickly and cause perceptual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to experience glitches as optical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The following experiments show you how to trick some of your
neurons into recklessly expending most of their energy at once, so
you can detect them when they're in the act of recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of flag with horizontal black and blue lines accompanies
this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the addition sign in the flag for 30 seconds, and then
look at a blank sheet of paper. While you were staring, a battle
was raging between the neurons in your brain that sense yellow and
blue and the ones that sense turquoise and red.
</P>
<P>
   On the blank sheet, you should see an afterimage of the colors
of the American flag. The suppressed blue and red activity, which
was kept at a minimum as you looked at the flag, now dominates, and
those are the colors you see on the blank sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The interval required for the illusion to vanish corresponds
roughly to the rallying time of the neurons used to see yellow and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of spoke pattern accompanies this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look into the center of the spoke pattern for 20 seconds. Now
look at a blank sheet of paper. The negative of the image emerges
from nowhere and shimmers with a circular motion.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Neuroscientists know why a negative afterimage appears _
the pattern simply exhausts nerve cells that sense white spokes.
But they don't yet understand why a static image creates a
perception of motion.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect that, because real motion produces moving
afterimages similar to those seen here, the pattern of the spokes
depletes the class of neurons used to sense movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the image fades from the blank page, your neurons are
approaching their original state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of the predominantly green flag accompanies this
experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the horizontal red bar on the left for 60 seconds. Now
focus on the red square on the right. Notice that the bars above
the red square appear narrower than those below it.
</P>
<P>
   This happens because the upper left pattern exhausts the nerve
cells that sense wide bars, but only in the upper visual field. So
the top bars will look narrower and the bottom bars wider until
your wide-pattern neurons recover.
</P>
<P>
   If these feuding nerve cells have worn you out, remember that
even now your brain is reinvigorating spent nerve cells, fortifying
you for whatever comes next.

<P>
   Most humans who have ever lived have known roughly where they
were, day by day, year by year. Not in abstract terms( of course,
but in the terms of ezperience and familiarity _ by neighborhood,
not map.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, we've known things about ourselves that could be
expressed in a statement like ``I'm standing on the threshing floor
in the village of my birth,'' or even, ``I'm in a part of town I've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we utter it or not, this awareness of ``whereneSs'' is
part of the meaning of being human. But for centuries, a dedicated
band of mapmakers, navigators, astronomers, inventors and
mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
ob change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know w`ere they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds ar strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
m`nmade objects as well. This would be `n ever-changing map of a
world filled sith artifacts busily announcing something signifhcant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to

This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS

declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>

   In the past few yeaRs, consumers have(grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
po{itioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, lost GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newgst farm

mathematicians has tried to turn this innate sense of place into a
more precise determination of position that is intelligible to
anyone, not just to locals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is like the difference between knowing you're
coming to the corner where you always turn left on your way to the
grocery store and knowing the names of the streets that cross at
that intersection.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, the pursuit of pure position is about
to lead us into a world that not one of us has ever seen. The agent
of change will be GPS _ the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, not a single human-made object has ever known
where it was. Even a venerable tool of navigation like a sextant
knows nothing more about its location than does the Mona Lisa or
the pigments of which she is painted. So imagine a world in which
manmade objects know where they are and can communicate that
information to other self-locating, communicating objects too.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as strange and surprising as the Marauders Map in
the Harry Potter novels for children. The Marauder's Map shows the
position and movement of every animate creature at the school of
wizardry called Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   A Marauder's Map of the world would be even stranger. It would
show the position and movement _ even a history of movements _ of
manmade objects as well. This would be an ever-changing map of a
world filled with artifacts busily announcing something significant
about themselves to each other and to anyone else who cared to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   That world is nearly here. In August, a company called SiRF
Technology, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced that it had
developed an advanced GPS chip no bigger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Kanwar Chadha, one of SiRF's founders, declared, ``Our vision is
to bring location awareness to virtually everything that moves.''
This is a subtle but profound change in the history of GPS
technology _ a change driven by increasing miniaturization and
declining prices for sophisticated circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, consumers have grown used to the sight of
handheld GPS receivers, which have been marketed as individual
positioning devices for anglers, hunters, hikers and cyclists. But
what SiRF and other companies have in mind is conferring upon
objects a communicable sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   One day soon, most GPS devices will not be stand-alone receivers
used by those of us who venture off the beaten path but integral
components of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these objects, especially the big ones, are easy enough
to imagine, because they exist now. Boats and ships of every kind
already incorporate GPS technology, as do some automobiles made by
Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Cadillac. So do the newest farm
implements, like combines that allow farmers to map crop yields in
precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   But some uses of GPS that are not yet widely available will soon
be common in smaller devices. Beginning next October, for instance,
the Federal Communications Commission will require cellular-phone
service providers to be able to identify the location of a
cell-phone caller who dials 911. This means that most cell phones
will likely include a tiny GPS chip. So will beepers and watches
and handheld digital assistants and, who knows, Game Boy Colors and
probably handguns too.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of a technology like GPS is easy enough to
predict, but it's much harder to foresee what the effect of that
spreading will be. There's always a limit to how far we can see
into the future of the tools we use, especially into a future where
those tools become interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's already obvious how useful GPS is in discrete applications:
for surveying and mapmaking, for tracking commercial vehicles, for
maritime and aeronautic navigation, for emergency rescue crews and
archaeologists. But there is simply no telling what it will mean
when, on a planet full of location-aware objects, a way is found to
coordinate all the data they send out.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness may be a metaphor when applied to inanimate objects,
but the potential of that metaphor is entirely literal and, so far,
almost entirely beyond our ken.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for most of us, there is still a more basic
question to be answered: Where did GPS technology come from and how
does it work?
</P>
<P>
   GPS depends on an array of 27 satellites _ 24 in regular use,
plus spares _ flying some 11,000 miles above Earth. They were put
there by the Department of Defense, which began the NAVSTAR global
Positioning system Program in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A version of GPS was first tested in 1964 when the Navy deployed
a five-satellite prototype, called Transit, for submarines. It
could take an hour and a half for a Transit satellite to saunter
above the horizon and then another 10 or 15 minutes to fix the
submarine's position.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of satellites was built by The Boeing
Company and Lockheed Martin, and each one orbits the planet in
about 12 hours, cutting across the equatorial plane at an angle of
roughly 55 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force tracks the satellites from Colorado Springs,
Hawaii and three other islands: Ascension in the South Atlantic,
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, and Kwajalein in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   These ground stations provide the satellites with navigational
information, which the next generation of satellites will be able
to supply to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary users can track this constellation of satellites with
one of several Web sites or with an appealing public-domain
software program called Home Planet, which can map any satellite
you choose, GPS or not, against a projection of the Earth's
surface. Or you can track the satellites with a GPS receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems as though
freedom gets defined in more basic terms. GPS offers one version of
freedom _ knowing where you are. But it may ultimately threaten a
more basic kind of freedom _ being where you are without anyone
else knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would like to have a Marauder's Map, but no one wants
to appear on the Marauder's Map without approving it. The value of
cell phones embedded with GPS chips is obvious when it comes to
emergency services. But the fact that cell-phone service providers
are able to track the location of a 911 call means that GPS could
track the location of every other kind of call as well.
</P>
<P>
   Already GPS is being used to monitor the movement of commercial
trucks of every description. This is both a form of insight to the
vehicle owners and a form of intrusion to the drivers, who find
their movements visible to management in a way they never were
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nonaqueous, nonarctic globe is mostly paved, and
people are as thick upon the Earth as mold on month-old bread, a
device has been invented at last that tells you where you are
without having to ask strangers.

   If it feels as though a battery in your skull has run out of
juice when you work too hard, that's because it has.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of nerve cells dwelling inside your cranium are a
lot like tiny, rechargeable AAs. In most cases these cells won't
tire enough for you to notice, but with careful observation, you
can catch them napping.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons are reservoirs of electrical charge. When stimulated, a
neuron sends an electrical signal and then needs some time to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   During a resting phase _ which can last 10 seconds and longer _
other active nerve cells continue to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances this neural tradeoff is seamless and your
brain doesn't detect the shift of activity from one neuron to
another. But once in a while too many nerve cells expend too much
energy too quickly and cause perceptual glitches.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to experience glitches as optical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The following experiments show you how to trick some of your
neurons into recklessly expending most of their energy at once, so
you can detect them when they're in the act of recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of flag with horizontal black and blue lines accompanies
this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the addition sign in the flag for 30 seconds, and then
look at a blank sheet of paper. While you were staring, a battle
was raging between the neurons in your brain that sense yellow and
blue and the ones that sense turquoise and red.
</P>
<P>
   On the blank sheet, you should see an afterimage of the colors
of the American flag. The suppressed blue and red activity, which
was kept at a minimum as you looked at the flag, now dominates, and
those are the colors you see on the blank sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The interval required for the illusion to vanish corresponds
roughly to the rallying time of the neurons used to see yellow and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of spoke pattern accompanies this experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look into the center of the spoke pattern for 20 seconds. Now
look at a blank sheet of paper. The negative of the image emerges
from nowhere and shimmers with a circular motion.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Neuroscientists know why a negative afterimage appears _
the pattern simply exhausts nerve cells that sense white spokes.
But they don't yet understand why a static image creates a
perception of motion.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect that, because real motion produces moving
afterimages similar to those seen here, the pattern of the spokes
depletes the class of neurons used to sense movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the image fades from the blank page, your neurons are
approaching their original state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Drawing of the predominantly green flag accompanies this
experiment.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stare at the horizontal red bar on the left for 60 seconds. Now
focus on the red square on the right. Notice that the bars above
the red square appear narrower than those below it.
</P>
<P>
   This happens because the upper left pattern exhausts the nerve
cells that sense wide bars, but only in the upper visual field. So
the top bars will look narrower and the bottom bars wider until
your wide-pattern neurons recover.
</P>
<P>
   If these feuding nerve cells have worn you out, remember that
even now your brain is reinvigorating spent nerve cells, fortifying
you for whatever comes next.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Today the law school campus at the old
Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of
Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and
restaurants. But some three decades ago the nearest eatery offered
watery slop that simply went by the name of coffee, and it was
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is
now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after
finishing secondary school in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the rambunctious students used to buy cheap
fortified wine in a cellar shop nearby and drink it at home in
their kitchens. True, we don't yet know whether Putin had ever been
observed thus amusing himself. Today the university alumni mostly
recall the energetic prime minister's athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during his undergraduate days Putin actively engaged in
what were at the time exotic martial arts: sambo and judo. In 1974
he won the Leningrad judo championship, earning a title of
Candidate Master of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   While still a sophomore, Putin was entrusted with forming a
college sambo team to compete in a University championship. Because
experienced wrestlers were few and far between, Putin persuaded a
fellow student, who had just learned a few sambo throws and holds,
to take part in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed, but the championship matches ended in
tragedy: Putin's friend injured his cervical vertebra and died in
the hospital several days later. It was a serious blow to young
Putin: He withdrew into himself and remained something of a recluse
until graduation. In any event, none of Putin's former classmates
can now boast of an early, close friendship with the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final year at the university, Putin was approached by a
Leningrad KGB officer, who invited him to collaborate with state
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that in those years it was common practice to
recruit future security officers, as well as ordinary informers,
from the ranks of college students. To all appearances, however,
Putin was offered duties more advanced than just informing on his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the latter recall that shortly before graduation,
Putin became the proud owner of a Zaporozhets mini _ a luxury
automobile at the time. Putin personally explained that he had won
the car in a lottery, but few people believed that.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he graduated cum laude in 1975, Putin, along with two
other graduates, was assigned to work as a junior officer at the
KGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. For a long time he worked in
Germany as a KGB undercover agent. Later on, when he was discharged
into the reserve, he got a job at Leningrad University as the
pro-rector's assistant for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he became an adviser to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the
Leningrad city council, and in 1992, chucking his KGB career, Putin
accepted Sobchak's offer of a full-time job at Smolny, the city
hall, becoming head of the St. Petersburg mayor's office External
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence officer turned public figure in St.
Petersburg _ it was news. And Putin practically never turned down
journalists' requests for interviews either. True, Putin's comments
were not particularly popular with readers. In print, he had the
reputation of being articulate but vague.
</P>
<P>
   Some rather cynical journalists dubbed him ``the Smolny gray
eminence.'' In St. Petersburg law-enforcement structures he was
nicknamed ``Stasi.'' Ill-wishers called him simply ``the KGB man,''
and everyone instantly recognized the reference.
</P>
<P>
   It was of course Sobchak who introduced Putin to big-time
politics. They first met on the way to Vasilyevsky Island and in
the mid-1970s, Professor Sobchak was teaching law at the University
where Putin was an undergraduate. Yet they did not become really
close until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who
recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person. Over the
10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation: He
followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to
more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla
Pugacheva, who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks, even though
Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin's
knowledge. Sobchak, who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed
his opinion about the people around him, seemed to trust Putin
absolutely, saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, during a rebellion by the deputies after
President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament, a contingent of
combat tanks stormed the building. In that atmosphere of chaos,
Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's
orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak's election campaign and
also sued Alexander Belyayev, who was then the chairman of the
Legislative Assembly. At the height of a gubernatorial election
campaign, he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate
abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks. Belyayev
had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Sobchak's defeat in the gubernatorial election, Putin
flatly refused to work with the new team, saying that ``it would
look like an act of treachery.'' Sobchak's recent triumphant return
from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin's
increased clout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, only a short while ago it was rumored in St.
Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor. Yet,
responding to my question about the likelihood, Sobchak said that
Putin's potential was much bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he
always acted in an admirably manly style: ``If he was friends with
someone, that was great luck, but those he was down on were in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when moving into a new office, Putin never initiated
any redecoration jobs, which never failed to stun some of the
bureaucrats. Thus in St. Petersburg, when he first entered Putin's
office, Sergei Tkachev, the office's former occupant just appointed
chairman of the Smolny External Relations Committee, could not hold
back his astonishment: ``Why didn't he have the furniture changed
at least?''
</P>
<P>
   Putin liked meeting with his friends at a suburban dacha which,
incidentally, burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not
been rebuilt. His wife with two daughters immediately followed her
husband to Moscow. Putin's parents are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in St. Petersburg, Putin has just a handful of friends, and
also his wife's relatives. And of course, the Neva River, the
Mariinsky Opera House and Vasilyevsky Island too.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin is a hero to anyone it is to the military. By his
edict, the defense budget will now have more money for guns and
less for nuclear bombs. At a government cabinet session on Jan. 27,
Putin said defense spending this year will be 50 percent higher
than last year. A bigger defense budget, he stressed, was a
``conscious choice,'' not related to the recent events in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here runs deeper and it has to do with the fact
that the military has been underfunded for many years in a row,
which has led to negative consequences for the country's defense
capability,'' Putin summed up. He is the first Russian leader in
recent years to state bluntly that Russia intends to put more money
into weapons production and its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Putin's habit to carefully select the venue and
timing for such statements, his address at the cabinet session was
a well-calculated move that clearly had a specific target audience
_ above all, the Russian armed forces, who remain desperate for
support, and the outside world, which is concerned more about the
security of Russian nuclear stockpiles than about tanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years, the defense production and
arms-procurement program has been approved in January. Previously,
neither the Defense Ministry, which places production orders, nor
the defense production enterprises knew what to produce, or in what
volumes, until summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, 80 percent of all funds was spent on the
Strategic Nuclear Forces, with conventional weapons programs _
given the chronic underfunding of the defense sector _ getting just
a pittance. This year, according to Ilya Klebanov, vice premier in
charge of the military-industrial complex, 30 percent of the
defense budget will be spent on the nuclear forces while the
remaining 70 percent, on conventional weapons systems. Considerable
sums will be spent on R&AMP;D projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin denies the new defense budget is linked to the
war in Chechnya, there is a link. The war has apparently affected
the military's kitty. After the outbreak of the second military
campaign in Chechnya, the state disbursed, as a matter of urgency,
an extra 4 billion rubles for arms procurement programs and
immediately raised the question of increasing the share of defense
spending in the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   True, the government has yet to find the money _ not just on
paper. Before the operation in Chechnya began, the defense sector
received only 46 percent of the earmarked funding, whereas by the
end of last year this figure had grown to 86 percent, which is an
all-time record in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene. For the
first time since the 1917 Revolution, the next head of state in
Russia could be a person born in a capital city _ in Putin's case,
in Leningrad on Oct. 7, 1952. And not in snobbish Moscow either,
but in Europeanized St. Petersburg.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Today the law school campus at the old
Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of
Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and
restaurants. But some three decades ago the nearest eatery offered
watery slop that simply went by the name of coffee, and it was
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is
now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after
finishing secondary school in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the rambunctious students used to buy cheap
fortified wine in a cellar shop nearby and drink it at home in
their kitchens. True, we don't yet know whether Putin had ever been
observed thus amusing himself. Today the university alumni mostly
recall the energetic prime minister's athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during his undergraduate days Putin actively engaged in
what were at the time exotic martial arts: sambo and judo. In 1974
he won the Leningrad judo championship, earning a title of
Candidate Master of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   While still a sophomore, Putin was entrusted with forming a
college sambo team to compete in a University championship. Because
experienced wrestlers were few and far between, Putin persuaded a
fellow student, who had just learned a few sambo throws and holds,
to take part in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed, but the championship matches ended in
tragedy: Putin's friend injured his cervical vertebra and died in
the hospital several days later. It was a serious blow to young
Putin: He withdrew into himself and remained something of a recluse
until graduation. In any event, none of Putin's former classmates
can now boast of an early, close friendship with the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final year at the university, Putin was approached by a
Leningrad KGB officer, who invited him to collaborate with state
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that in those years it was common practice to
recruit future security officers, as well as ordinary informers,
from the ranks of college students. To all appearances, however,
Putin was offered duties more advanced than just informing on his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the latter recall that shortly before graduation,
Putin became the proud owner of a Zaporozhets mini _ a luxury
automobile at the time. Putin personally explained that he had won
the car in a lottery, but few people believed that.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he graduated cum laude in 1975, Putin, along with two
other graduates, was assigned to work as a junior officer at the
KGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. For a long time he worked in
Germany as a KGB undercover agent. Later on, when he was discharged
into the reserve, he got a job at Leningrad University as the
pro-rector's assistant for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he became an adviser to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the
Leningrad city council, and in 1992, chucking his KGB career, Putin
accepted Sobchak's offer of a full-time job at Smolny, the city
hall, becoming head of the St. Petersburg mayor's office External
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence officer turned public figure in St.
Petersburg _ it was news. And Putin practically never turned down
journalists' requests for interviews either. True, Putin's comments
were not particularly popular with readers. In print, he had the
reputation of being articulate but vague.
</P>
<P>
   Some rather cynical journalists dubbed him ``the Smolny gray
eminence.'' In St. Petersburg law-enforcement structures he was
nicknamed ``Stasi.'' Ill-wishers called him simply ``the KGB man,''
and everyone instantly recognized the reference.
</P>
<P>
   It was of course Sobchak who introduced Putin to big-time
politics. They first met on the way to Vasilyevsky Island and in
the mid-1970s, Professor Sobchak was teaching law at the University
where Putin was an undergraduate. Yet they did not become really
close until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who
recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person. Over the
10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation: He
followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to
more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla
Pugacheva, who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks, even though
Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin's
knowledge. Sobchak, who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed
his opinion about the people around him, seemed to trust Putin
absolutely, saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, during a rebellion by the deputies after
President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament, a contingent of
combat tanks stormed the building. In that atmosphere of chaos,
Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's
orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak's election campaign and
also sued Alexander Belyayev, who was then the chairman of the
Legislative Assembly. At the height of a gubernatorial election
campaign, he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate
abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks. Belyayev
had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Sobchak's defeat in the gubernatorial election, Putin
flatly refused to work with the new team, saying that ``it would
look like an act of treachery.'' Sobchak's recent triumphant return
from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin's
increased clout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, only a short while ago it was rumored in St.
Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor. Yet,
responding to my question about the likelihood, Sobchak said that
Putin's potential was much bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he
always acted in an admirably manly style: ``If he was friends with
someone, that was great luck, but those he was down on were in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when moving into a new office, Putin never initiated
any redecoration jobs, which never failed to stun some of the
bureaucrats. Thus in St. Petersburg, when he first entered Putin's
office, Sergei Tkachev, the office's former occupant just appointed
chairman of the Smolny External Relations Committee, could not hold
back his astonishment: ``Why didn't he have the furniture changed
at least?''
</P>
<P>
   Putin liked meeting with his friends at a suburban dacha which,
incidentally, burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not
been rebuilt. His wife with two daughters immediately followed her
husband to Moscow. Putin's parents are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in St. Petersburg, Putin has just a handful of friends, and
also his wife's relatives. And of course, the Neva River, the
Mariinsky Opera House and Vasilyevsky Island too.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin is a hero to anyone it is to the military. By his
edict, the defense budget will now have more money for guns and
less for nuclear bombs. At a government cabinet session on Jan. 27,
Putin said defense spending this year will be 50 percent higher
than last year. A bigger defense budget, he stressed, was a
``conscious choice,'' not related to the recent events in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here runs deeper and it has to do with the fact
that the military has been underfunded for many years in a row,
which has led to negative consequences for the country's defense
capability,'' Putin summed up. He is the first Russian leader in
recent years to state bluntly that Russia intends to put more money
into weapons production and its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Putin's habit to carefully select the venue and
timing for such statements, his address at the cabinet session was
a well-calculated move that clearly had a specific target audience
_ above all, the Russian armed forces, who remain desperate for
support, and the outside world, which is concerned more about the
security of Russian nuclear stockpiles than about tanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years, the defense production and
arms-procurement program has been approved in January. Previously,
neither the Defense Ministry, which places production orders, nor
the defense production enterprises knew what to produce, or in what
volumes, until summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, 80 percent of all funds was spent on the
Strategic Nuclear Forces, with conventional weapons programs _
given the chronic underfunding of the defense sector _ getting just
a pittance. This year, according to Ilya Klebanov, vice premier in
charge of the military-industrial complex, 30 percent of the
defense budget will be spent on the nuclear forces while the
remaining 70 percent, on conventional weapons systems. Considerable
sums will be spent on R&AMP;D projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin denies the new defense budget is linked to the
war in Chechnya, there is a link. The war has apparently affected
the military's kitty. After the outbreak of the second military
campaign in Chechnya, the state disbursed, as a matter of urgency,
an extra 4 billion rubles for arms procurement programs and
immediately raised the question of increasing the share of defense
spending in the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   True, the government has yet to find the money _ not just on
paper. Before the operation in Chechnya began, the defense sector
received only 46 percent of the earmarked funding, whereas by the
end of last year this figure had grown to 86 percent, which is an
all-time record in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene. For the

Russia could be a person born in a capital city _ in Putin's case,

<P>
   I recently gave a live interview to Radio Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Callers one after another asked the same questions: What's
happening? What kind of person is Vladimir Putin? Has Russia turned
to some kind of ``hereditary autocracy,'' or is there still a
chance to restart the democratic process? How come everything has
been decided for us? Will Putin face any serious challengers in the
March 26 elections?
</P>
<P>
   It persuaded me that the people need a democratic option; they
are in a quandary. They are being asked to support Putin even
though he is a blank slate in terms of his social and economic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's departure _ that is, his abrupt resignation on New
Year's Eve _ was not quite voluntary. One could say it was a
necessary step in the endeavor to ``hand over power to a reliable
man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was up to Yeltsin, of course, to take the final decision. But
his Kremlin entourage _ the bunch of relatives, political
associates, oligarchs and other hangers-on _ was pressuring him to
step down before the end of the year. They wanted to ride the wave
of Putin's popularity in hopes of perpetuating their own
opportunities for enrichment and power. Thus, the existence of
Acting President Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I support Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister, for president. I believe that now and for the next four
years he would be the best choice for Russia _ not Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has tremendous experience and proven ability. After
replacing Sergei Kiriyenko in September '98, with the economy in
drastic disarray, he governed firmly and democratically. Even then,
Primakov was able to unite and lead the people for the sake of the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I believe that a party of Social Democrats would
coalesce around Primakov. It would have grassroots appeal, growing
over time mostly from Russia's regions, which still keep the
country going. This party could become a serious political
contender by the time Russia holds its next parliamentary and
presidential elections four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of Yeltsin's policies is truly disastrous. They
have condemned 80 percent of the Russian people to life at the edge
of poverty. Russia has been humiliated and corrupted while its
courts are powerless. The industrial base that took decades to
build, as well as our education and health-care systems, are
decimated.
</P>
<P>
   It was conspicuous that Putin's first step was to pardon
Yeltsin. He issued a decree on ``guarantees'' to the former
president that is essentially unconstitutional. It grants Yeltsin
immunity from criminal or administrative responsibility and even
from being interrogated in the course of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that we were returning to the times of
Soviet-style uncontested elections. During Yeltsin's
administration, and now Putin's too, decisions are being made by a
small group of power-hungry individuals for whom ``anything goes.''
Putin's promoters are looking for a ``blitzkrieg'' presidential
election campaign, with no time for anyone to seriously explain or
discuss the issues crucial to the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A long, rambling article Putin published weeks ago, ``Russia on
the Threshold of a New Millennium,'' does little to explain his
views. It reads more like an eclectic hodgepodge of slogans and
bromides than a concrete program of action. Actually, Grigory
Yavlinsky, one of the West's favorite liberal reformers, was right
to call today's Kremlin with its new leader a ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   To be blunt: Will Putin be able to sever the umbilical cord that
ties him to people like the media magnate Boris Berezovsky and
others whose power amounts to a virtual stranglehold over the
Russian political process?
</P>
<P>
   According to the bosses of the Unity Party, which was hastily
knocked together to drum up support for Putin, their candidate is a
shoo-in. No one, including Putin, however, should expect automatic
support or routine praise.
</P>
<P>
   The people already sense they are being deprived of any
influence on the course of events, of a chance to decide the
country's future. But Russia cannot succeed unless we give politics
back to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Surely it must be obvious to all that a lack of competition in
the political arena makes no sense in modern society; moreover, it
is a dangerous illusion. It is folly for Putin's allies to be
trumpeting up their mood of triumph, creating a sense of
all-but-universal approval.
</P>
<P>
   We are still far from a genuinely democratic system, but I agree
with those _ including Putin! _ who say that Russia will not return
to totalitarianism. Nor will there be a return to confrontation
with the West, despite the fact that the leading Western nations
have not yet matched their positive rhetoric with a proper respect
for Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is elected in March, Russia's new president will offer
no ``free gifts'' to anyone. I am sure that Russia will be ready
for, and serious about, cooperating in good faith with all nations.
</P>
<P>
   Our partners need to understand that the time of Russia's
foreign-policy impotence is becoming a thing of the past. Frankly,
we have so far seen more understanding of this from the East than
from the West. Russia, like any country, has its national interests
with which others have to reckon.
</P>
<P>
   The most intelligent and responsible candidate _ and to my mind,
that is Primakov _ will heed what those interests are and what the
people of Russia expect of him.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We knew her first from her grief.
 &HT;    The sight of Kadiatou Diallo stepping from a police van last
February in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, seeing the
place where police officers had killed her unarmed son and
helplessly crying, ``Amadou, Amadou,'' until she collapsed in the
arms of other West African Muslim women in traditional robes, was a
haunting spectacle, replayed endlessly on television.
 &HT;    Her grief attached poignancy to what until that moment had
simply horrified: the unbelievable fusillade of bullets mistakenly
aimed at this particular dark-skinned man.
 &HT;    It let the world know that this victim was beloved, would be
missed. It focused our horror, unease and anger in the person of
one small mother from a tiny nation in Africa to whom New York had
done such a grievous wrong.
 &HT;    Next we knew her because, in short order, she moved out of the
hotel room the city had found for her and into one arranged for her
by the Rev. Al Sharpton, and then further asserted her independence
by refusing to meet with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
 &HT;    In a flurry of interviews over six days in the United States _
and always with Sharpton _ she assailed the injustice of the
killing with apparently spontaneous lines like, ``Amadou's blood
will feed the battle for justice for everyone.''
 &HT;    Her efforts helped to crystallize an inchoate anger with the
police into a protest movement that would eventually result in the
Sharpton-orchestrated arrests at police headquarters of nearly
1,200 people, including David Dinkins, the former mayor; Kweisi
Mfume, the head of the NAACP; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the actress
Susan Sarandon; and several members of New York's congressional
delegation _ the worst crisis of the Giuliani administration.
 &HT;    Kadi Diallo returned to Africa with her son's body, Sharpton and
a large contingent of reporters, who sent images of her loss around
the world. Six weeks later, Sharpton flew her back to New York: The
four policemen who had shot her son were being indicted on charges
of second-degree murder.
 &HT;    Following the arraignment, she began, with her son's father _
her ex-husband _ what was planned to be a 16-city tour of the
United States organized by Sharpton to decry police brutality.
 &HT;    In the meantime, her son's estate hired the O.J. Simpson ``dream
team'' of Johnnie Cochran, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld to pursue
a civil claim against the city that could net millions of dollars,
despite Amadou's near destitution. (Compensation in such a suit is
usually based partly on lost future earnings.)
 &HT;    And then, finally, in what appeared to be a further expression
of her poise and self-possession, this untutored mother from Guinea
fired the dream team and, after a round of very public
disagreements with her ex-husband over control of her son's estate,
in August hired a white, noncelebrity lawyer to pursue her claims.
 &HT;    ``From Grieving Mother to Forceful Celebrity,'' a New York Times
article was headlined back in April. By the end of summer, Kadi
Diallo was trying to go back to grieving mother, to bring some
closure to a healing process she had barely begun.
 &HT;    She patched things up with her ex-husband. She settled their
three remaining children near relatives on the East Coast, where
they would be close to her but insulated from the media zoo. She
distanced herself from Sharpton. And she awaited the trial that
might finally shed some light on what happened that night in front
of 1157 Wheeler Ave., in the Bronx.
 &HT;    Then came the surprise announcement of Dec. 16. The trial was
being moved to Albany. ``The public clamor'' over the case,
according to an appeals court, made a fair trial in the Bronx
impossible. Sharpton called, and she climbed into a car _ it was
time for another news conference.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Diallo story can, in some ways, be told by its headlines:
``Cops Blast Unarmed Man''; ``1,000 Rally to Condemn Shooting of
Unarmed Man by Police''; ``A Mother Arrives From Africa to Mourn
Her Slain Son''; ``Slain Man's Mother Rejects Mayor's Aid'';
``Battle-Tested Sharpton Slips Into Familiar Role''; ``Diallo Dead,
Cops Look for Dirt''; ``Amadou Lied in His Claim for Asylum'';
``Cardinal Holds a Meeting With Parents of Diallo''; ``Diallo's Mom
Boots Dream Team''; ``Diallo's Parents Feuding Over Estate That
Could Be Worth Millions''; ``Diallo Dad Appeals to Ex-Wife for
Unity.''
 &HT;    They convey the Tom Wolfe-ian nature of the story, its tragedy
and circuslike aspects. Most ordinary people caught up in this kind
of frenzy go in energized but emerge at the end disheveled,
embittered, spent.
 &HT;    Kadiatou Diallo, in her quiet dignity, shows every sign of being
different _ a player almost preternaturally prepared to handle the
insanity, a woman who, having been used for a few months by the
media and politicians, seems to have learned enough now to use them
right back.
 &HT;    She comes from the Guinean village of Labe, the fourth of nine
children born to a prominent local family. In the archives of many
newspapers her name is misspelled ``Kadiadou,'' because one of the
first reporters she talked to, she says, misheard her, and thought
her name ended like her son's. She liked that, the melding of
Amadou's name with her own.
 &HT;    Her father, she says, was unusual, insisting on the importance
of education not just for his sons but also for his daughters,
perhaps owing to his having an outspoken wife.
 &HT;    Even as a girl she was a beauty. When she was 14, a trader from
a nearby village asked her father for her hand in marriage. Her
father said he couldn't answer for Kadi: ``Go and talk to my
daughter first,'' he told Saikou Diallo, 30, a man who already had
a wife and two children. ``I don't want to give you any hope before
you do.''
 &HT;    Kadi was unsure but willing. She is proud now that her father
insisted that as a condition of marriage she be allowed to continue
her education.
 &HT;    Amadou, the first of their four children, was born two years
later, when she was 16. ``I was very young, and I thought I was too
young to keep him,'' she told Newsday. ``At night, I woke up to see
if he was there.''
 &HT;    As a boy, Amadou developed a lisp. His mispronunciation of her
name became a treasured nickname. ``Tatatou,'' he called her.
 &HT;    By then the family was living in neighboring Liberia, where
Saikou had a trading business. After a coup in 1980, they returned
to Guinea to escape the instability. But Saikou found that the
socialism of President Sekou Toure made life hard for a
businessman. He took his family to Togo.
 &HT;    They returned to Guinea in 1984 when the president died, and
before long moved to Thailand. Saikou had mainly been trading in
gold and gems and, Kadi says, had a large store of low-quality
Guinean rubies. A company in Thailand told him they had a heat
treatment for the gems that could increase their quality.
 &HT;    But Saikou ended up losing a lot of money and wanted to move to
Singapore. Tired of constantly moving the family, Kadi refused to
go and Saikou threatened to leave.
 &HT;    ``Maybe he was thinking I would come back,'' she said. ``Divorce
is like a threat to the woman, to have more control _ because only
a small number of women can survive alone. Women are very
disadvantaged in Africa.''
 &HT;    But she would not be dissuaded, and the marriage ended. ``I was
determined to support myself and live on my own.''
 &HT;    Having learned her husband's business, she began to trade gems
in Bangkok, although she seldom wore jewelry herself. ``The
valuable stones, I sold them. I believe in turning the money
around, buying and selling.''
 &HT;    Before long she moved her four children back to Conakry, the
capital of Guinea. Through connections in the mining industry she
ended up the highly paid representative of an Australian company
interested in opening a gold mine. She went to the office every
day, helping to arrange the needed permits and permissions.
 &HT;    Amadou, who had earned a degree in computer science from a
college in Bangkok, left on a tourist visa for the United States in
September 1996. ``He told me he wanted to realize his dream'' of
working in computers or electronics, Kadi said, ``because he had
seen me struggle to bring the children up and wanted to help me.
His plan was to come back and assume his place as head of the
family.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The call from New York came when it was barely light on the
morning of Feb. 4. On the other end of the line was Abdul Karim,
Amadou's cousin.
 &HT;    Kadi's younger sister picked up the phone. She knew something
was wrong when Abdul insisted on talking to Oury, Kadi's brother,
``because in our tradition,'' Kadi explained, ``you cannot tell the
woman bad news directly.''
 &HT;    At the time, she was at the house of Sankarela Diallo, a young
journalist and trader she had married two months earlier. (Diallo
is a common name in Guinea.) Kadi's sister demanded to be told what
had happened. Abdul would not tell her and hung up.
 &HT;    ``My sister called me immediately,'' Kadi told me. ``She said,
'There was a call from New York _ our cousin, Abdul.' Knowing the
time difference, I said, 'If someone called this time from New York
and it's not Amadou, then it's about him.' I was thinking he was
sick, maybe in the hospital, or maybe a car hit him or something. I
was afraid to say I think he died, but, you know, I knew, that
instant. ...''
 &HT;    Kadi began to weep as she told this story. The phone rang a lot
that night, she said. ``People would ask me, 'Have you heard the
news?' and I would say, 'No!' And they would hang up. Many times!
 &HT;    ``And once I hung up the phone and started crying, and my
daughter, Laouratou, she held me until I had the courage to call
one of them back, a man. And I said, 'I believe in God _ tell me,
did my son die?' And he said, 'Yes.'''
 &HT;    It wasn't until about 4 p.m. that Kadi learned how. ``My second
son, Ibrahim, he was reading the paper, and I saw he was looking
down, and I said, 'What happened?' And he said, 'Nothing, Mom.'
Because we teach men not to cry. But Ibrahim was crying. He was
trying to be strong, but he could not believe it.'' Then Ibrahim,
16, told her that the police had shot Amadou.
 &HT;    ``They didn't tell me how many bullets, because all the family
wanted to protect me from the shock. But little by little I found
out. Our Australian investor came in the evening, and he said, 'I'm
sorry, but they shot him many times.' And I screamed, 'Why didn't
you tell me?' Because the bullets and everything, they tried to
minimize. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'but they shot him many times,
Kadi, too many times.' And I told him: 'You must tell me. How
many?'
 &HT;    ``He said, 'It's 41 bullets.'''
 &HT;    It took two more days for Kadi to get plane tickets and visas
for herself, her new husband and her uncle. They arrived at John F.
Kennedy airport midday on Tuesday, Feb. 9, and were involved in
politics before they stepped off the plane. The Guinean government
had called its diplomats in New York, who were to transport Kadi's
party to Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador wanted to take me, but the city pulled me into
their own van. They said they are responsible for our security.''
This was the same city government whose security forces had killed
her son.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador told me, 'Don't panic.' But I was already
panicked! I didn't expect that. I wanted to go to the Bronx before
the hotel,'' she said, and they acceded to her wish.
 &HT;    Just two days before, a thousand demonstrators, led by Sharpton,
gathered in front of the house on Wheeler Avenue. The arrival of
Kadiatou Diallo came as a complete surprise and must have seemed
like a gift from heaven.
 &HT;    ``Justice,'' she said, when she finally emerged from her son's
apartment, ``must be done.''

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Last fall, the New York State Education Department released the
results of a fourth-grade math test and eighth-grade math and
language tests.
 &HT;    It will come as no surprise to hear that the numbers for
students in New York City were dreadful. About two-thirds of city
eighth graders failed the English language arts test, and about
three-quarters failed in math; half the fourth graders failed the
math test.
 &HT;    The results provided fuel for those who felt that New York City
schools are underfinanced, that the city uses too many uncertified
teachers, that academic standards are low, that junior high schools
are neglected and that the tests themselves are unfair.
 &HT;    There's some merit in all these notions. What was not said,
however, was the obvious. The city districts that performed poorly,
like those that performed well, scored almost exactly as the
socioeconomic status of the children in them would have predicted.
 &HT;    You could have predicted the fourth-grade test scores of all but
one of the city's 32 districts merely by knowing the percentage of
students in a given district who qualified for a free lunch. Only a
few dozen of the city's 675 elementary schools scored well despite
high poverty rates. In other words, good schools aren't doing that
much good, and bad schools aren't doing that much harm.
 &HT;    This is the case in virtually every big city in the country.
Though over the past 35 years we have poured billions of dollars
into inner-city schools, and though we have fiddled with
practically everything you could think to fiddle with, we have done
almost nothing to raise the trajectory of ghetto children. This is
a fact, but it is one of those painful facts that it seems better
to ignore.
 &HT;    Why say anything that could discourage the children, parents and
teachers who so desperately need encouragement? Why give aid and
comfort to the opponents of high standards? After all, we know that
some schools succeed where others fail. We know that some reforms
work better than others.
 &HT;    In a recently published book, ``Choosing Equality,'' Joseph P.
Viteritti, a professor of public policy at New York University,
describes the failure of one innovation after another before
embarking on a defense of the one reform he believes in, school
choice.
 &HT;    Or perhaps, if the answer isn't choice, it's something else.
Surely there must be some way of making a difference in the lives
of poor children.
 &HT;    Indeed, you can't spend much time in the schools and not believe
in the efficacy of reform. In the past few years, I have visited
dozens of schools, almost all of them serving inner-city children
and most of them exemplary in one way or another.
 &HT;    I have been to charter schools where concerned parents and
educators have wrested control of the classrooms from ineffective
bureaucracies, and also to schools with effective leaders and
schools with traditional curricula and schools with ``less is
more'' curricula and schools with ``multiple intelligences''
teaching styles.
 &HT;    The good news is that we know more about what works than we did
even a decade ago. Should what is left of the ideological fog
surrounding education evaporate, we might even agree on a better
mousetrap.
 &HT;    But how much better? How powerful can this one institution be in
the face of the kind of disadvantages that so many ghetto children
bring with them to the schoolhouse door, and return to at home?
 &HT;    In ``An American Imperative,'' a minutely detailed study of
educational inequality published in 1995, Scott Miller, a scholar
now affiliated with the College Board, wrote that while ``some
strategies for investing resources in disadvantaged children are
substantially more productive than others ... there is little
evidence that any existing strategy can close more than a fraction
of the overall achievement gap'' separating children with low
socioeconomic status from their wealthier, largely suburban
counterparts.
 &HT;    The idea that school, by itself, cannot cure poverty is hardly
astonishing, but it is amazing how much of our political discourse
is implicitly predicated on the notion that it can.
 &HT;    The national debate over entrenched poverty virtually ended with
welfare reform. We now speak of the inner-city poor as if they were
a remote tribe that has not yet been exposed to the miracle of the
marketplace.
 &HT;    In November, President Clinton was able to announce his
antipoverty initiative jointly with Speaker Dennis Hastert because
the plan was so vague and modest _ it came down to encouraging
private investment in the inner cities _ that the GOP was happy to
sign off on it.
 &HT;    But the same congressional Republicans who oppose on principal
virtually all federal programs focused on the urban poor also voted
to add $2 billion to Clinton's request for Title I, the main source
of federal funds for schools in high-poverty areas.
 &HT;    George W. Bush has come out in favor of increased spending by
the federal Department of Education. And in recent years
conservatives have come to play a critical role in the debate over
inner-city schools. Indeed, school reform is the one type of social
engineering with which conservatives feel comfortable.
 &HT;    Although education is fundamentally a local issue, and national
politicians can do very little about it, we will probably hear a
great deal more about the schools as we enter the primary season
and the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Bush is running as a ``compassionate conservative,'' which is to
say that he cares about the poor and will not simply consign them
to the whim of the marketplace. What this means in practice,
however, is that he believes in school reform.
 &HT;    Last fall, Bush seemed to be visiting an inner-city school every
week. In his speeches he returns constantly to the virtues of
market-driven school reforms like vouchers and charter schools, as
well as to the need for rigorous academic standards for
high-poverty schools.
 &HT;    Al Gore takes a very different view of the matter _ although he,
like Bush, thinks education is the main answer to poverty. Gore is
in favor of high standards _ if any national figure isn't, he
hasn't stuck his head up yet _ but he also wants to spend more
money to fix crumbling school buildings and to hire more teachers
to decrease class size.
 &HT;    The Democrats say that the current system can be made to work
with the right incentives, while Republicans think the system has
to be forced to change through competition. Though largely agreeing
with Gore, Bill Bradley has at least begun to create a platform
that places school reform within the context of broader antipoverty
policies.
 &HT;    But no candidate can, it appears, afford to reckon with the
seemingly intractable nature of inner-city poverty. It is hard to
think of a more satisfying solution to poverty than education.
School reform involves relatively little money and no large-scale
initiatives, asks practically nothing of the nonpoor and is
accompanied by the ennobling sensation that comes from expressing
faith in the capacity of the poor to overcome disadvantage by
themselves.
 &HT;    Conversely, the idea that schools by themselves can't cure
poverty not only sounds like an un-American vote of no confidence
in our capacity for self-transformation but also seems to flirt
with the racialist theories expressed by Charles Murray and Richard
Herrnstein, who argued in ``The Bell Curve'' that educational
inequality is rooted in biological inequality.
 &HT;    An alternative explanation, of course, is that educational
inequality is rooted in economic problems and social pathologies
too deep to be overcome by school alone.
 &HT;    And if that's true, of course, then there's every reason to
think about the limits of school, and to think about the other
institutions we might have to mobilize to solve the problem. We
might even ask ourselves whether there isn't something disingenuous
and self-serving in our professed faith in the omnipotence of
school.
 &HT;    The idea that bad schools perpetuate poverty, and that good
schools can go a long way toward curing it, is quite new and, like
most current ideas about entrenched poverty, dates to the civil
rights era.
 &HT;    One provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act mandated the
publication of a survey ``concerning the lack of availability of
educational opportunities for individuals by reason of race, color,
religion or national origin in public educational institutions.''
 &HT;    The sociologist James Coleman was asked to head up the survey
project. The implicit assumption behind the survey, an assumption
that Coleman said at the time he shared, was that black children
were failing because the segregated schools they attended were
grossly underfinanced.
 &HT;    Coleman found that black students were, in fact, highly
segregated, but he also concluded that resources like school
libraries and laboratories were distributed more equally than was
widely believed and, far more startling, that ``differences in
school facilities and curriculum, which are the major variables by
which attempts are made to improve schools, are so little related
to achievement levels of students that, with few exceptions, their
effect fails to appear even in a survey of this magnitude.''
 &HT;    Coleman found that everything schools did accounted for only 5
percent to 35 percent of the variation in students' academic
performances, though he did find that the figures for disadvantaged
students were at the higher end of the scale.
 &HT;    He concluded that ``the inequalities imposed on children by
their home, neighborhood and peer environment are carried along to
become the inequalities with which they confront adult life at the
end of school.''
 &HT;    This was, if true, astonishing and deeply unsettling news.
Nobody believes in school the way Americans do, and no one is more
tantalized by its transformative powers.
 &HT;    School is central to the American myth of self-transcendence,
whether it's Thomas Jefferson's seedbed of the republican spirit,
or the one-room schoolhouse that propelled Abe Lincoln out of
frontier backwardness, or those teeming junior high schools in
Brooklyn that served as the melting pot for three generations of
children from Russia and Italy and Ireland.
 &HT;    In the national myth _ and of course not only in myth _ school
has the miraculous power of leveling inequalities even as it lifts
everyone. And by the time Coleman came along we had come to expect
far more of school than we ever had before, because we were firmly
entrenched in a meritocratic culture in which the most important
rewards were decided by school success.
 &HT;    Coleman's argument that schools essentially passed along
inequality was simply unacceptable, and largely ignored.
 &HT;    In the 1960s, the nation embarked upon a vast and utterly
unprecedented national experiment in the use of schooling to
alleviate poverty. Of all Washington's undertakings, the most
popular, and the most romantic, was the Head Start program for
impoverished preschool-age children, which continues to this day to
be thought of as the one Great Society program that really worked.
 &HT;    Head Start began in 1965, and President Johnson immediately fell
in love with the imagery of little children playing with scissors
and glue. He ramped the program up within the first year from $18
million to $50 million to $150 million, and he bragged that Head
Start was raising children's IQ scores 10 points.
 &HT;    Researchers have known from the virtual outset of the program
that Head Start had no effect at all on IQ scores.
 &HT;    And although beneficiaries were somewhat less likely than
nonbeneficiaries to be left back, or placed in special-education
classes, whatever gains children made on test scores faded out
within a year or two.
 &HT;    A 1985 study by the Department of Health and Human Services
concluded that ``in the long run, cognitive and socioemotional test
scores of former Head Start students do not remain superior to
those of disadvantaged students who did not attend Head Start.''
 &HT;    A 1995 study found no difference between siblings who did and
did not attend Head Start.
 &HT;    It was also in 1965 that Congress passed Title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provided federal
funds to local school districts with high concentrations of
impoverished students. Title I now reaches 10 million children,
including one in every five first graders.
 &HT;    Over the years about $100 billion has been dispensed through the
program. The annual budget is now $7.7 billion, though Congress
just voted to increase th e amount to $9.9 billion.
 &HT;    Until the law was amended in 1994, most school districts used
their Title I money to offer additional instruction, mostly in
reading, to students who were falling behind. In effect, students
took an extra half-hour class in reading every day, generally using
the same methods that had already failed.
 &HT;    The Title I results are even more unequivocal than those for
Head Start. A 1997 study conducted for the Department of Education
concluded that ``there were no differences in growth'' between
students who did and did not receive Title I assistance.
 &HT;    Finally, it was in the late 1960s and early '70's that
desegregation moved decisively from the courts to the schools.
Throughout the South, where Jim Crow had reigned, desegregation was
a matter of simple justice.
 &HT;    But in the North and Midwest, where whites as well as blacks had
to be bused, and often a very long way, it was critical to
demonstrate a significant benefit to black students to justify the
disruption and discontent.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court had been persuaded by the views of the
psychologist Kenneth Clark that desegregation could help black
children overcome the stigma of inferiority conferred by
segregation.
 &HT;    Coleman had, in fact, found an ``integration effect,'' which he
explained by suggesting that black students in largely white
schools experienced ``a greater sense of control'' over their own
destinies than students in segregated schools. But most subsequent
studies found that the effect was only a modest one.
 &HT;    A 1975 survey of the best-designed studies of integration's
effects found that more than half disclosed ``no significant
difference'' between segregated and nonsegregated black students.
 &HT;    The Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks concluded in his 1972
book, ``Inequality,'' that desegregation could close the academic
gap by no more than 10 to 20 percent _ which struck him as too
small an effect to trump the issue of parental preference.
 &HT;    Over the past two decades, desegregation has faded as a remedy
in part because many parents, including black parents, do not feel
that the disruption is worth the gain. Head Start, Title I and a
host of other programs have gone a long way toward proving that
money does not buy educational equality.
 &HT;    Although the premise of many a crusading volume, including
Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage Inequalities,'' is that ghetto schools
have been allowed to rot, many of the most catastrophically failing
school districts, like Newark's, spend far more money per student
than do middle-class communities nearby.
 &HT;    Labor economists have had a field day proving that school
spending is not correlated with school achievement. And that
desegregation never had nearly the academic effect its advocates
hoped for shows that equality of educational opportunity is now
much more elusive than it once seemed to be.
 &HT;    Since we don't know how much school can be made to matter, we
should work to reform schools as if there were no limit to their
powers to compensate for disadvantage. But we also have to reckon
with how modest the accomplishments of reform have been, especially
with regard to the gap between white students and poor (though not
necessarily poor) black students.
 &HT;    Although black students now earn high-school diplomas at
virtually the same rate as whites _ an extraordinary achievement in
itself _ they are enrolling in, and graduating from, college at a
much lower rate. Despite significant gains, blacks are still
scoring about 200 points below whites on College Boards.
 &HT;    And despite improvements in reading scores, the average black
17-year-old is reading at a 13-year-old level. According to one
study, the racial gap in language scores approximately doubles
between the time a black student enters school and the time she
leaves.
 &HT;    There is reason to believe that schools can make some kind of
difference, but right now they are not making nearly enough.

 &HT;    Until the law was amended in 1994, most school districts used
their Title I money to offer additional instruction, mostly in
reading, to students who were falling behind. In effect, students
took an extra half-hour class in reading every day, generally using
the same methods that had already failed.
 &HT;    The Title I results are even more unequivocal than those for
Head Start. A 1997 study conducted for the Department of Education
concluded that ``there were no differences in growth'' between
students who did and did not receive Title I assistance.
 &HT;    Finally, it was in the late 1960s and early '70's that
desegregation moved decisively from the courts to the schools.
Throughout the South, where Jim Crow had reigned, desegregation was
a matter of simple justice.
 &HT;    But in the North and Midwest, where whites as well as blacks had
to be bused, and often a very long way, it was critical to
demonstrate a significant benefit to black students to justify the
disruption and discontent.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court had been persuaded by the views of the
psychologist Kenneth Clark that desegregation could help black
children overcome the stigma of inferiority conferred by
segregation.
 &HT;    Coleman had, in fact, found an ``integration effect,'' which he
explained by suggesting that black students in largely white
schools experienced ``a greater sense of control'' over their own
destinies than students in segregated schools. But most subsequent
studies found that the effect was only a modest one.
 &HT;    A 1975 survey of the best-designed studies of integration's
effects found that more than half disclosed ``no significant
difference'' between segregated and nonsegregated black students.
 &HT;    The Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks concluded in his 1972
book, ``Inequality,'' that desegregation could close the academic
gap by no more than 10 to 20 percent _ which struck him as too
small an effect to trump the issue of parental preference.
 &HT;    Over the past two decades, desegregation has faded as a remedy
in part because many parents, including black parents, do not feel
that the disruption is worth the gain. Head Start, Title I and a
host of other programs have gone a long way toward proving that
money does not buy educational equality.
 &HT;    Although the premise of many a crusading volume, including
Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage Inequalities,'' is that ghetto schools
have been allowed to rot, many of the most catastrophically failing
school districts, like Newark's, spend far more money per student
than do middle-class communities nearby.
 &HT;    Labor economists have had a field day proving that school
spending is not correlated with school achievement. And that
desegregation never had nearly the academic effect its advocates
hoped for shows that equality of educational opportunity is now
much more elusive than it once seemed to be.
 &HT;    Since we don't know how much school can be made to matter, we
should work to reform schools as if there were no limit to their
powers to compensate for disadvantage. But we also have to reckon
with how modest the accomplishments of reform have been, especially
with regard to the gap between white students and poor (though not
necessarily poor) black students.
 &HT;    Although black students now earn high-school diplomas at
virtually the same rate as whites _ an extraordinary achievement in
itself _ they are enrolling in, and graduating from, college at a
much lower rate. Despite significant gains, blacks are still
scoring about 200 points below whites on College Boards.
 &HT;    And despite improvements in reading scores, the average black
17-year-old is reading at a 13-year-old level. According to one
study, the racial gap in language scores approximately doubles
between the time a black student enters school and the time she
leaves.
 &HT;    There is reason to believe that schools can make some kind of
difference, but right now they are not making nearly enough.

 &HT;    Any organization reflects its leader, as Al Gore says, and for
most of last year his presidential campaign was the outward sign of
an inward turmoil.
 &HT;    At the beginning of 1999, he was certain to stroll to the
Democratic nomination.
 &HT;    Who would have predicted that, before the year was out, he would
change campaign managers and chiefs of staff, replace his pollsters
and his admen, truck his headquarters from Washington to Nashville
and begin the year 2000 worried he would have less cash on hand
after the New Hampshire primary than Bill Bradley, the challenger
he once dismissed?
 &HT;    Though born and bred for higher office and schooled by Bill
Clinton for seven years in the getting and holding of the
presidency, Gore was unprepared to run for the job to a degree
baffling to some of his advisers.
 &HT;    This past year _ particularly the past four months _ has
provided a bracing political education for a man who had no clue
how much he needed it.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like the experience that most of us have in
getting older,'' the vice president told me during a rare
appearance in his West Wing office, a few days before Christmas.
``You look back at a previous point in your life and find it
difficult to believe how little you knew. I look back now at the
beginning of the year, while the impeachment trial was about to
begin and incoming rounds were landing on the White House roof
every 30 seconds, and I can't believe that I decided to put the
campaign on K Street.'' He roared with laughter. ``You know ...
HELLO?''
 &HT;    That Gore is still talking in detail about that education is
evidence that it remains under way. The early, very public
incompetence of his campaign created a political problem that he is
still struggling to solve. It lent weight to Democrats' central
concern about him, that he lacked the political wherewithal to beat
an impressive Republican candidate.
 &HT;    To combat the relentlessly negative reviews of his campaign,
Gore has been forced to make the quality of his campaigning central
to his candidacy, to ballyhoo the move of his headquarters to
Nashville, for example, while Bradley kept on talking about health
care or child poverty and his advisers remained silently behind
their curtains.
 &HT;    This has repeatedly returned Gore to the same shaky ground _ his
political ability _ while lending heft to a related doubt about
him: that he is a programmable man guided more by tactics than
beliefs. Gore's problem, in short, has been less alpha or beta than
meta.
 &HT;    It's a peculiar problem, for what Gore has been learning this
past year is how to be a politician _ which is, of course, the job
description of a candidate. Unfortunately for Gore, however, it is
a dirty word. But what is so wicked about a politician politicking?
This year, candidates and reporters are condemning politics and
praising ``authenticity.''
 &HT;    Antipolitics has been with us for some time now. Authenticity is
this campaign's variant, a kind of characterological shorthand for
everything politics allegedly is not _ honest, deep, real. But
those who tout authenticity are making an almost useless
distinction, at least as far as campaigning goes.
 &HT;    If authenticity is what the people want (and, help me here, when
was it that they clamored for fakery?), then it is a political act
to give it to them. Was it ``authentic'' for Bradley as a senator
to study Elvis Presley movies in hopes of honing his communication
skills? He was looking to change himself to appeal to people, the
essence of inauthenticity.
 &HT;    On the other hand, he was hoping to appeal to people in order to
lead them, the essence of good politics.
 &HT;    The phony divide between authenticity and politicking was
captured by the tumult earlier this month over John McCain's
letters pressuring the FCC to speed up a decision important to a
donor. Captain Campaign Reform suddenly looked like just another
politician.
 &HT;    Yes, by all means take the excessive money out of politics; but
don't take the politics out, to paraphrase Clinton. In policing the
bureaucracy on behalf of his constituents, including donors, McCain
was being who he is, an authentic politician. Put another way, he
was doing his job.
 &HT;    Gore's chief problem is that deep down he suspects it is
dishonorable to be a politician, and this can make him a bad one.
He reminds me a bit of some second-generation auto dealers, the
expensively educated sons of self-made men who balk at the tactics
of the family business they know so intimately.
 &HT;    ``He doesn't really like politics,'' one of Gore's closest aides
told me. ``He holds it in disdain.'' But he is gradually coming to
terms with his outer politician.
 &HT;    As with the move to Nashville, campaign gestures that were
entirely political _ gestures that Gore feared would be derided as
entirely political _ have had political effects that have reminded
him what is so great about politics: It connects candidates with
voters.
 &HT;    This was illustrated by his challenge to Bradley that they
forego political advertising and hold plenty of debates instead.
Pundits immediately dismissed the proposal as a political gimmick.
They were right that it was a gimmick. They were wrong to dismiss
it.
 &HT;    Gore was led, by political considerations, to suggest a reform
that would have elevated the discussion and released some of the
money pressure. His offer left Bradley in the position of defending
30-second commercials as a more effective means of communication.
Which is the more cynical _ or if you prefer, ``political'' _
position? Who cares?
 &HT;    As a politician, Gore is making progress. Man, message and
political machine mesh more smoothly now than four months ago. The
changes in each did not come at once, but they occurred over
roughly the same time _ just before and after Gore shifted his
headquarters to Nashville in October _ and they reinforced one
another.
 &HT;    A new team of loyal advisers, his own competitive nature and a
rediscovery of his competence at face-to-face politicking have
probably given him enough confidence and focus to win the
Democratic nomination, barring any egregious blunders.
 &HT;    Before small groups this fall and winter, Gore has displayed a
mastery of intricate matters, a knack for explaining them and an
agile sense of humor. He has also become a better debater, finally
swallowing his aggravation with Clinton and expressing some pride
in the work they did together _ managing to take credit for Clinton
administration policies without embracing, or trashing, Clinton the
man.
 &HT;    Gore has been relearning what it is to seek votes for himself,
and in this quest he has been aided not by soul-searching but by
pros who never lose sleep about whether some tactic is too
political.
 &HT;    Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of some longtime Tennessee
volunteers and young staff members, though, I found little burning
passion for Gore among his advisers. He is too familiar and too
lacking in charisma, and too many of his aides have seen too many
candidates.
 &HT;    They say that he is no natural politician, for all his
confidence in his own political acumen. But this is not to say his
aides are not dedicated to electing him. While they may not marvel
at his magnetism or vision, his advisers talk with deep respect of
his decency, policy judgment and commitment to public service. If
this is not the Clinton crusade of 1992, it is also not the Clinton
advertising firm of 1996.
 &HT;    The move to Nashville, which could have been a disaster, has
produced a leaner, more spirited team. Junior staff members go out
for beers with one another at night, rather than with college pals
in Washington.
 &HT;    Without other familiar distractions, they come into the office
on weekends and go to work. This group will build up a lot more
passion if the race becomes a contest between Gore and Bush, rather
than two centrist Democrats whose dislike for each other has
concealed how little difference there is between them politically.
 &HT;    It has been widely reported that Karenna Gore Schiff, his
daughter, and Naomi Wolf, the writer and Gore consultant, had urged
the vice president to distance himself from the president. This is
true. But it understates the sway that this theory already held,
and holds, among his staff members. It is campaign orthodoxy. This
has led the campaign to play down Gore's impressive work in the
Clinton administration in favor of his prior work.
 &HT;    ``It's not what matters so much in this election,'' Karenna Gore
Schiff said of the last seven years. ``What matters is who the
candidates are and what they're going to do, and my dad's
experience goes pretty far back. It goes back to 1976, not 1992.''
 &HT;    Personally, Gore remains resentful of Clinton and angry at him
for enmeshing him in his scandals, his associates say. But his
efforts to distance himself are driven more by a political
calculation that voters still see him as Clinton's yes man, rather
than as a leader _ in fact, a ``fighter'' _ in his own right, and
theirs.
 &HT;    Gore and Clinton still talk by telephone two or three times a
week. But when I asked Gore if he had ever consulted Clinton about
the campaign, he immediately said no. ``He's a skilled
politician,'' Gore said, ``and from time to time in our
conversations he will offer some advice.''
 &HT;    There are two possibilities here: Either Gore is fibbing, in
which case he still feels obliged to exaggerate his personal
distance from Clinton, or in fact the gap is quite significant, and
despite the galaxy of advisers he has consulted, he chooses to
overlook the Democrat who knows best how to run both as a
challenger and as an incumbent.
 &HT;    For his part, Clinton misses Gore's advice, presidential aides
say. Clinton trusted Gore to tell the truth and Gore was able to
use sarcasm to puncture Clinton's self-pitying or bombastic moods.
 &HT;    But Gore's advisers believe that the vice president had to
separate himself from Clinton because he is, in the campaign's
formulation, ``famous but unknown.''
 &HT;    The campaign found, for example, that most voters did not know
that Gore had ever been anything but a politician. They had to
sharpen Gore's biography and weave it into his standard stump
speech. They zeroed in on dramatic points in Gore's own life and
also the lives of his parents.
 &HT;    Gore had spoken about all these matters, intermittently and
sometimes movingly, for years. Now he was meshing them in a tight
triad of parables that would give a narrative edge to his standard
stump speech and to the populist theme that would define Gore's
career: that he was a fighter against special interests, as one
senior Gore strategist put it, ``representing the people against
THEM.''
 &HT;    Television audiences have not been thoroughly impressed,
however, and this may be one of the reasons why he continues to lag
as many as 10 points behind George W. Bush nationally. Somehow, for
all his credentials and experience, Gore comes off seeming like
less than the sum of his parts.
 &HT;    In debate, the vice president has been reluctant to take risks.
When he has, the result has been damaging, as when he foolishly
declared that in appointing Joint Chiefs of Staff he would make
support for gays in the military a litmus test. That comment
yielded yet another ``hastily assembled press conference,'' as
reporters invariably call them, which is something of a Gore
signature.
 &HT;    Often, Gore seems to be trying too hard. Discussing affirmative
action in a town-hall-style debate in Manchester in mid-December,
Gore made a telling point, observing that the host had evidently
failed to invite many blacks.
 &HT;    But then he went too far: ``Are there any?'' he asked, looking
around and starting to point. ``There's one _ one in _ in back
there.''
 &HT;    Though he has grown more comfortable with each debate, Gore
still tends to fall back on catapulting jagged speech chunks
through the air. His performances recall his 1996 debate with Jack
Kemp, when in his answers he repeatedly chanted a mantra
(``Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment'') as though
the television audience were being sleep-taught.
 &HT;    After that debate, my grandmother, a believer in Clinton and
Gore, left a pained message on my answering machine: ``Does he
think I am stupid?''
 &HT;    This year, ``I want to fight for you'' is proving to be the
patronizing mantra.
 &HT;    Gore knows better. ``These techniques inevitably encourage
inauthenticity in a politician's message,'' he wrote of the dangers
of sound bites, polling and ``personality skills'' in his 1992 best
seller, ``Earth in the Balance.'' ``Why present genuine ideas and
true character if artificial ones are more effective in the
marketplace of power.''
 &HT;    When I read some of Gore's words back to him, he told me that he
was no longer so concerned about political manipulation, because
the audience has grown as sophisticated as the candidates and their
consultants.
 &HT;    ``And what has resulted is that only one thing really works, and
that is what's real,'' he said. ``There may be people who are
skilled enough and smart enough to use these personality tools to
shape their image and affect and appear to be something they're
not. I'm not one of them.''
 &HT;    Exactly so. But what is real still needs politics to be
expressed.
 &HT;    Gore's attempts to reach TV audiences often reek of the
greasepaint he rightly scorns. As he picks at Bradley, he looks
political, and that may hurt his chances with the independents and
moderates who, paradoxically, are the very people who are most
likely to share his disdain for politics.
 &HT;    They might be more impressed if he showed the side of himself
that privately deflects operatives' suggestions with the arch
question, ``Isn't that awfully political?''
 &HT;    Bradley so far has bested Gore largely on style points. His ease
in public, his seeming candor and his apparent disregard for
old-school maneuvering have managed to make Gore seem
simultaneously clumsy and slick. Gore may lack a common touch or
patrician grace, yet he has learned, in meeting with voters away
from the television cameras, that he can make a style of substance.
 &HT;    In that setting, he communicates without contempt for the
process or the people who take it seriously, as they should. He has
to learn to take that skill on the air. He will need it in the
downtime between the primaries and the Democratic convention,
should he get that far. He will need it in the general election;
and he will need it to govern.
 &HT;    Before Gore can hope to seem like less of a politician, he will
have to become more of one.

experience goes pretty far back. It goes back to 1976, not 1992.''
 &HT;    Personally, Gore remains resentful of Clinton and angry at him
for enmeshing him in his scandals, his associates say. But his
efforts to distance himself are driven more by a political
calculation that voters still see him as Clinton's yes man, rather
than as a leader _ in fact, a ``fighter'' _ in his own right, and
theirs.
 &HT;    Gore and Clinton still talk by telephone two or three times a
week. But when I asked Gore if he had ever consulted Clinton about
the campaign, he immediately said no. ``He's a skilled
politician,'' Gore said, ``and from time to time in our
conversations he will offer some advice.''
 &HT;    There are two possibilities here: Either Gore is fibbing, in
which case he still feels obliged to exaggerate his personal
distance from Clinton, or in fact the gap is quite significant, and
despite the galaxy of advisers he has consulted, he chooses to
overlook the Democrat who knows best how to run both as a
challenger and as an incumbent.
 &HT;    For his part, Clinton misses Gore's advice, presidential aides
say. Clinton trusted Gore to tell the truth and Gore was able to
use sarcasm to puncture Clinton's self-pitying or bombastic moods.
 &HT;    But Gore's advisers believe that the vice president had to
separate himself from Clinton because he is, in the campaign's
formulation, ``famous but unknown.''
 &HT;    The campaign found, for example, that most voters did not know
that Gore had ever been anything but a politician. They had to
sharpen Gore's biography and weave it into his standard stump
speech. They zeroed in on dramatic points in Gore's own life and
also the lives of his parents.
 &HT;    Gore had spoken about all these matters, intermittently and
sometimes movingly, for years. Now he was meshing them in a tight
triad of parables that would give a narrative edge to his standard
stump speech and to the populist theme that would define Gore's
career: that he was a fighter against special interests, as one
senior Gore strategist put it, ``representing the people against
THEM.''
 &HT;    Television audiences have not been thoroughly impressed,
however, and this may be one of the reasons why he continues to lag
as many as 10 points behind George W. Bush nationally. Somehow, for
all his credentials and experience, Gore comes off seeming like
less than the sum of his parts.
 &HT;    In debate, the vice president has been reluctant to take risks.
When he has, the result has been damaging, as when he foolishly
declared that in appointing Joint Chiefs of Staff he would make
support for gays in the military a litmus test. That comment
yielded yet another ``hastily assembled press conference,'' as
reporters invariably call them, which is something of a Gore
signature.
 &HT;    Often, Gore seems to be trying too hard. Discussing affirmative
action in a town-hall-style debate in Manchester in mid-December,
Gore made a telling point, observing that the host had evidently
failed to invite many blacks.
 &HT;    But then he went too far: ``Are there any?'' he asked, looking
around and starting to point. ``There's one _ one in _ in back
there.''
 &HT;    Though he has grown more comfortable with each debate, Gore
still tends to fall back on catapulting jagged speech chunks
through the air. His performances recall his 1996 debate with Jack
Kemp, when in his answers he repeatedly chanted a mantra
(``Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment'') as though
the television audience were being sleep-taught.
 &HT;    After that debate, my grandmother, a believer in Clinton and
Gore, left a pained message on my answering machine: ``Does he
think I am stupid?''
 &HT;    This year, ``I want to fight for you'' is proving to be the
patronizing mantra.
 &HT;    Gore knows better. ``These techniques inevitably encourage
inauthenticity in a politician's message,'' he wrote of the dangers
of sound bites, polling and ``personality skills'' in his 1992 best
seller, ``Earth in the Balance.'' ``Why present genuine ideas and
true character if artificial ones are more effective in the
marketplace of power.''
 &HT;    When I read some of Gore's words back to him, he told me that he
was no longer so concerned about political manipulation, because
the audience has grown as sophisticated as the candidates and their
consultants.
 &HT;    ``And what has resulted is that only one thing really works, and
that is what's real,'' he said. ``There may be people who are
skilled enough and smart enough to use these personality tools to
shape their image and affect and appear to be something they're
not. I'm not one of them.''
 &HT;    Exactly so. But what is real still needs politics to be
expressed.
 &HT;    Gore's attempts to reach TV audiences often reek of the
greasepaint he rightly scorns. As he picks at Bradley, he looks
political, and that may hurt his chances with the independents and
moderates who, paradoxically, are the very people who are most
likely to share his disdain for politics.
 &HT;    They might be more impressed if he showed the side of himself
that privately deflects operatives' suggestions with the arch
question, ``Isn't that awfully political?''
 &HT;    Bradley so far has bested Gore largely on style points. His ease
in public, his seeming candor and his apparent disregard for
old-school maneuvering have managed to make Gore seem
simultaneously clumsy and slick. Gore may lack a common touch or
patrician grace, yet he has learned, in meeting with voters away
from the television cameras, that he can make a style of substance.
 &HT;    In that setting, he communicates without contempt for the
process or the people who take it seriously, as they should. He has
to learn to take that skill on the air. He will need it in the
downtime between the primaries and the Democratic convention,
should he get that far. He will need it in the general election;
and he will need it to govern.
 &HT;    Before Gore can hope to seem like less of a politician, he will
have to become more of one.

 By STEPHEN S. HALL  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Almost every weekday morning, usually before 10:30, an overnight
delivery truck with an unusual cargo negotiates the hilly streets
on the outskirts of Worcester, Mass., and comes to a halt in front
of a brick-and-tinted-glass building called Biotech Three.
 &HT;    The courier disappears into the building with one or two large
gray containers and drops them off at a small company called
Advanced Cell Technology.
 &HT;    The gray cases look like toolboxes, but they are actually
sophisticated shipping containers, commonly used for transporting
materials used in animal-breeding work. They contain the starting
material for a series of experiments that may completely rewrite
the tables of human longevity. Or they may be remembered only for
being among the most ethically troubling scientific endeavors of
our times.
 &HT;    Inside the cases are hundreds of cow eggs _ big, plump and
beautifully rotund oocytes, as they're technically known _ each one
painstakingly plucked the day before from the ovaries of cows
slaughtered in Iowa. They are doused with a marinade of enzymes
that prime them for imminent fertilization and then sealed in small
plastic test tubes before being shipped overnight to Worcester.
 &HT;    At Advanced Cell, the eggs will be stripped of their DNA,
deliberately fused with human cells and fooled into thinking that
fertilization has occurred, in the fervent commercial hope that
some sort of an embryo might result.
 &HT;    Experimenting with embryos created from two different species _
to say nothing of engaging in a form of human cloning _ is an
enterprise fraught with scientific and social uncertainty. Indeed,
Congress forbids the National Institutes of Health to finance any
research involving human embryos.
 &HT;    So it's natural to wonder why a small, largely unknown and
understaffed biotech company would risk public scorn and ethical
outrage to perform such research.
 &HT;    One possible reason is to gain publicity, as a number of
skeptics have been eager to suggest. But according to Michael D.
West, the dreamy-eyed 46-year-old entrepreneur who heads A.C.T.,
the answer is the scientific chase for what he calls ``the mother
of all cells _ the embryonic stem cell.''
 &HT;    The embryonic stem cell is an almost mythically powerful and
versatile human cell, fleetingly present during the earliest days
of embryonal development. This one cell has the potential _ the
genetic blueprint and the biological know-how _ to morph into any
cell, any tissue, any organ in the human body.
 &HT;    For example, with the proper biochemical coaxing, it can turn
into heart muscle, which could replace tissue damaged by a heart
attack. Or into brain cells, which could be used to treat
Parkinson's disease. Or into retinal cells, which could be used to
restore failing vision.
 &HT;    Imagine, in short, a cell so protean and potent that it could
theoretically generate an infinite supply of replaceable body parts
_ organ and skin, sinew and bone, blood and brain _ to knit the
tatters of disease, injury or old age.
 &HT;    Imagine further that, with the use of controversial technologies
such as cloning, you might one day donate a snippet of your own
skin, allowing scientists to harvest stem cells that theoretically
would become a self-generated and limitless supply of transplant
tissue _ tissue that would make a perfect immunological match with
you because, after all, it is you.
 &HT;    These ideas have not only been imagined; patents and licensing
agreements are already in place. In December '99 Science magazine
dubbed stem-cell technology the ``breakthrough of the year.''
 &HT;    In spite of this promise, the scientific, commercial and ethical
landscapes that intersect with these fascinating cells have been
shaped, even turned upside down, by the right-to-life debate
because in order to obtain human embryonic stem cells by currently
available technology, you must destroy a human embryo.
 &HT;    Because of the congressional ban on financing of this research,
many scientists now find themselves in the awkward position of
possibly losing their jobs if they try to use human stem cells to
devise new treatments for many common diseases.
 &HT;    The ban on NIH financing has also had the collateral effect of
relegating the technology to the private sector, where embryo
research can proceed unencumbered. But the fact that so much of
this controversial research now occurs in the private sector means
that public discussion has become constrained.
 &HT;    On Dec. 2 the NIH issued long-awaited guidelines explaining the
rules by which the agency would finance human-stem-cell research.
The 60-day comment period ended on Jan. 31, and the agency hopes to
begin soliciting grant proposals from university researchers
sometime this summer.
 &HT;    However, Rep. Jay Dickey, a Republican from Arkansas who has
blocked NIH financing for embryo research since 1995, has already
vowed to outlaw federally financed stem-cell research this spring,
either through legislation or legal action. Sen. Arlen Specter,
meanwhile, who is entranced by the medical possibilities, has
promised to introduce a bill explicitly allowing federal financing
for the research.
 &HT;    In many ways, West is the shadow impresario of the field. As
founder of Geron Corp., one of this decade's most closely watched
biotechnology companies, and now as president and CEO of Advanced
Cell Technology, West has achieved remarkable success as a kind of
merchant of immortality, selling the idea that stem cells and
related technologies might someday completely revise the tables of
average human life span.
 &HT;    And he is so convinced of the promise of stem cells that he is
happy to foster, if not force, a national discussion of its
controversial technology.
 &HT;    In a recent issue of the journal Nature Medicine, for example,
West, Jose Cibelli, vice president of research at A.C.T., and their
colleague Robert Lanza argued the case for human therapeutic
cloning because stem-cell research is so promising.
 &HT;    ``Does a blastocyst,'' they wrote, ``warrant the same rights and
reverence as that accorded a living soul _ a parent, a child or a
partner _ who might die because we failed to move the moral line?''
 &HT;    And that is what West is trying to do at this touchy juncture of
the stem-cell wars _ with this company, in these experiments, in an
ethical debate that has seemed too arcane and complicated to
attract much public attention to date.
 &HT;    West is putting his shoulder to the moral line that forbids
embryo research and is trying to force some sort of social
reckoning. The degree to which he and others succeed or fail may
well determine if stem cells have a chance to live up to their
promise as medicine or remain too hot to handle in the current
political climate.
 &HT;    He'll talk for hours about saving endangered species through
cloning, or the possibility of cloning pets, or why it makes more
economic and ethical sense to pay $1 for a cow egg than $2,000 to
surgically obtain a single human egg.
 &HT;    Yet his laid-back, soft-spoken demeanor belies the soul of a
headstrong provocateur; indeed, West promises to be an impassioned
voice in this debate.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of the problem we have in trying to develop
these new technologies for medicine is people's knee-jerk reaction
to words like 'fetal' and 'embryo,''' he says. ``You know, you use
the word 'fetal' and people just go completely irrational.''
 &HT;    Of course, until we learn how to direct the fate of human
embryonic stem cells _ learn how to tell them, for example, that
we'd like them to become a new liver or glistening white bone _
their enormous promise still remains under Nature's lock and key.
 &HT;    Many scientists believe it will take at least 10 years before we
learn how to program the development of cells that could be
transplanted into humans, and probably many more before we learn
how to coax stem cells into creating something as grand and complex
as a liver or a kidney.
 &HT;    But let's say some version of the science will be in practice by
the year 2011, when the first of the baby boomers turn 65. And
let's say the technology of stem cells will be complemented by
promissory notes redeemed in related fields of gerontological
science.
 &HT;    What might the menu of spare parts look like?
 &HT;    The first step in creating those spare parts _ which could be
used not only for the aged but also for anyone in need _ might well
be the donation by the patient of a biopsy sample, which could be
quickly cloned, thus creating an early embryo, which would produce
stem cells in a week or so.
 &HT;    Every cell and every tissue derived from those stem cells would
be a perfect immunological match, which would immediately
circumvent the big stumbling block of current transplant medicine:
matching tissue.
 &HT;    At that point, it simply becomes a matter of matching the
ailment to the right cell type. Researchers speak of creating nerve
cells to treat spinal-cord injuries, stroke and Alzheimer's
disease; glial cells for multiple sclerosis; pancreatic islet cells
to treat diabetes; muscle cells for muscular dystrophy;
chondrocytes for arthritis; hepatocytes for cholesterol metabolism;
endothelial vessels to grow new blood vessels to replace vessels
clogged by fat and plaque. There are more than 200 different cell
types in the body, and stem cells can theoretically be nudged to
form each one.
 &HT;    If these cells are souped up, as has been proposed, with an
enzyme that maintains its cellular youthfulness, we're talking not
only about replacement parts, but also about parts that never grow
old.
 &HT;    What might the world of stem-cell medicine look like? For one
thing, every place in the developed world might look a lot more
like Florida. Although the maximum attainable human life span is
now approximately 120 years, only about 65,000 Americans have
currently reached the age of 100.
 &HT;    A century from now, however, with new medical technologies in
place, the Census Bureau predicts there will be 5.3 million people
living to the age of 100 and perhaps much longer. To hear the
optimists talk, there'll be much longer waits for tennis courts and
tee times.
 &HT;    There are a lot of touchier issues, however, on the immediate
horizon: creating embryos for research purposes, combining
biological material from different species and performing
nuclear-transfer experiments involving adult human cells _ also
known as cloning.
 &HT;    All three are being pursued in a single line of research at
Advanced Cell Technology, but the procedures and work there are so
matter-of-fact that you'd never guess this type of experiment was
the focus of wildly fearful predictions only a few years ago.
 &HT;    Indeed, in 1997, when scientists at the Roslin Institute in
Scotland announced the cloning of Dolly the sheep, there was a lot
of fevered speculation about the possibility of cloning human
beings. It was generally dismissed as both a distant and
undesirable proposition, but the sudden appeal of embryonic stem
cells has provided a surprisingly urgent medical justification for
moving the technology of human cloning closer to reality.
 &HT;    In the case of A.C.T.'s experiments, the cow egg is being tested
as a way to ``reprogram,'' or reset, the adult DNA back to a
pristine state resembling the moment of fertilization. In these
experiments, the egg comes from a cow but the adult DNA comes from
human donors.
 &HT;    It's the human DNA, West believes, that orchestrates subsequent
embryonic development. The technical term for this type of
experiment is ``nuclear transfer,'' but West prefers a more
transparent phrase _ ``human therapeutic cloning.'' That modifier
``therapeutic'' signals that A.C.T. is not in the business of
making babies, just embryos to get stem cells.
 &HT;    The experiments at A.C.T. are conducted in a long, dark, narrow
room in the middle of the lab. The lights are low to allow
technicians to view the cells through microscopes, poking, turning
and prodding them with micromanipulation devices.
 &HT;    On the day I visit, K.C. Cunniff, 26, her blond hair spilling
out over a white lab coat, begins by vacuuming all of the cow's
genetic material from the egg cells, one after another, for more
than an hour.
 &HT;    She deftly maneuvers one pipette to hold a round, plump egg cell
in place. (The cow eggs are preferred because they are inexpensive
and easier to use than either pig or primate oocytes.) Cunniff
turns the egg, which had previously been stained with a fluorescing
dye, as if rotating a ball in her hand, until she sees a telltale
blue-green speck of DNA. Using her other hand, she nudges a sharp,
hollow needle up against the surface of the egg.
 &HT;    With a precise thrust, she enters the egg, sucks out the DNA and
withdraws the needle, all in a matter of seconds. ``Very quick,''
she says matter-of-factly. In, suction, out. Next egg. In, suction,
out.
 &HT;    As Cunniff moves another cow egg into position, Nancy Sawyer
gazes at the TV monitor and makes a sound like ``Unk!'' as the
needle punctures the egg. ``That's so cool,'' she whispers of the
image.
 &HT;    Seen on the monitor, the image has a primal iconic beauty, like
a dim grainy photograph of a distant planet. On each moonlike
oocyte, one isolated lunar mare glows with an eerie greenish blue,
betraying the location of genetic material that will soon be
suctioned away.
 &HT;    At a nearby microscope, Sawyer, 24, performs the next step.
Human skin cells, known as fibroblasts, have been provided by an
anonymous donor. The human cells dot the screen like so many lumpy,
transparent potatoes, much smaller than the egg cells.
 &HT;    Sawyer loads them into a hollow needle, immobilizes a cow egg
with suction and, with gentle pressure, inserts the needle tip just
under the rind of the egg. With a squeeze of her hand, a single
human skin cell, with its unique payload of human DNA, plops into
the egg of a creature that moos. Sawyer even manages to maneuver
her needle tip to literally tuck the hole closed.
 &HT;    After stuffing every cow egg with its little spud of human DNA,
Sawyer prepares the next step. She gives the cells a zap of 120
volts. The jolt of electricity effectively fuses man and beast into
a single biological fate.
 &HT;    After one final step, this ... this thing will believe it has
been fertilized and, if all goes well, begin cleaving, or dividing,
in the bubbling, momentous arithmetic of life lifting off the pad:
2 cells, 4 cells, 8 cells, 16 cells, 32 cells _ blastocyst!
 &HT;    The odds are extremely long that any of the 100 or so cell
fusions will result in a blastocyst, the hollow ball of cells that
appear about a week after fertilization and, in a normal embryo,
are destined to become the placenta.
 &HT;    But if that ball of cells should form, a separate group of cells
known as the inner cell mass assembles against one inside wall of
the blastocyst, like bats huddling on the ceiling of a cave, and
this is where the embryonic stem cells will appear.
 &HT;    Indeed, getting a blastocyst is just the first hurdle _ can the
scientists isolate the stem cells and keep them alive in a test
tube? And will they truly act like human embryonic stem cells?
 &HT;    Once formed, the stem cells exist only briefly before they begin
to differentiate into more specialized tissues _ there one moment
and gone the next, transients vanishing into the great biology of
becoming.
 &HT;    ``If I'm lucky,'' says Jose Cibelli, the Argentine research
scientist at A.C.T., ``I'll get one blastocyst. That's how low the
efficiency is.''
 &HT;    Before leaving Worcester, I ask Cibelli when he will know if any
blastocysts have formed. He says he doesn't expect to see anything
before nine or 10 days.
 &HT;    So on Christmas Eve, I sent an e-mail to him, asking about the
status of the cells I'd seen fused. The day after Christmas he
wrote back to report that the nuclear-transfer units had
``developed at the 'predictable' rate,'' while declining to specify
exactly what that was.
 &HT;    As soon as new techniques were in place, he continued, Advanced
Cell Technology would report the results in a peer-reviewed
journal.
 &HT;    It is Cibelli whose cow-human nuclear-transfer experiments made
news last year, prompting right-to-life pickets to show up outside
Biotech Three, marching around in cow masks.
 &HT;    President Clinton was moved to call the work ``deeply
troubling.'' Clinton asked his National Bioethics Advisory
Commission to prepare a report on stem-cell research and the
commission hastily convened hearings in January 1999 in Washington.
 &HT;    And who should turn up, uninvited, to make an unscheduled
presentation before the panel but West.
 &HT;    ``I read an editorial by an individual who wrote that science
should stop so that ethics can catch up,'' West told the national
commission that day. His ambition, he said, was ``to communicate to
people in public policy and in biomedical ethics, so that, simply,
ethics can walk hand in hand with science.''
 &HT;    Ethics and modern biology, however, have rarely walked hand in
hand, and stem-cell research has added new complexities to the
relationship.
 &HT;    As Congress prepares to debate the merits of stem-cell research
in the coming months, we will undoubtedly hear rosy visions of the
future of medicine with stem cells _ as well as the contorted
political logic that suggests that research on human embryos and
cross-species nuclear-transfer experiments are permissible in the
private sector, but morally indefensible in the public sector.
 &HT;    There is a lot of scientific research and a lot of heated
political debate to come. And how we resolve the ethical
conversations we're in the midst of having over stem cells will
have a lot to say about whether we'll have a chance of reaching
that future at all.

would become a self-generated and limitless supply of transplant
tissue _ tissue that would make a perfect immunological match with
you because, after all, it is you.
 &HT;    These ideas have not only been imagined; patents and licensing
agreements are already in place. In December '99 Science magazine
dubbed stem-cell technology the ``breakthrough of the year.''
 &HT;    In spite of this promise, the scientific, commercial and ethical
landscapes that intersect with these fascinating cells have been
shaped, even turned upside down, by the right-to-life debate
because in order to obtain human embryonic stem cells by currently
available technology, you must destroy a human embryo.
 &HT;    Because of the congressional ban on financing of this research,
many scientists now find themselves in the awkward position of
possibly losing their jobs if they try to use human stem cells to
devise new treatments for many common diseases.
 &HT;    The ban on NIH financing has also had the collateral effect of
relegating the technology to the private sector, where embryo
research can proceed unencumbered. But the fact that so much of
this controversial research now occurs in the private sector means
that public discussion has become constrained.
 &HT;    On Dec. 2 the NIH issued long-awaited guidelines explaining the
rules by which the agency would finance human-stem-cell research.
The 60-day comment period ended on Jan. 31, and the agency hopes to
begin soliciting grant proposals from university researchers
sometime this summer.
 &HT;    However, Rep. Jay Dickey, a Republican from Arkansas who has
blocked NIH financing for embryo research since 1995, has already
vowed to outlaw federally financed stem-cell research this spring,
either through legislation or legal action. Sen. Arlen Specter,
meanwhile, who is entranced by the medical possibilities, has
promised to introduce a bill explicitly allowing federal financing
for the research.
 &HT;    In many ways, West is the shadow impresario of the field. As
founder of Geron Corp., one of this decade's most closely watched
biotechnology companies, and now as president and CEO of Advanced
Cell Technology, West has achieved remarkable success as a kind of
merchant of immortality, selling the idea that stem cells and
related technologies might someday completely revise the tables of
average human life span.
 &HT;    And he is so convinced of the promise of stem cells that he is
happy to foster, if not force, a national discussion of its
controversial technology.
 &HT;    In a recent issue of the journal Nature Medicine, for example,
West, Jose Cibelli, vice president of research at A.C.T., and their
colleague Robert Lanza argued the case for human therapeutic
cloning because stem-cell research is so promising.
 &HT;    ``Does a blastocyst,'' they wrote, ``warrant the same rights and
reverence as that accorded a living soul _ a parent, a child or a
partner _ who might die because we failed to move the moral line?''
 &HT;    And that is what West is trying to do at this touchy juncture of
the stem-cell wars _ with this company, in these experiments, in an
ethical debate that has seemed too arcane and complicated to
attract much public attention to date.
 &HT;    West is putting his shoulder to the moral line that forbids
embryo research and is trying to force some sort of social
reckoning. The degree to which he and others succeed or fail may
well determine if stem cells have a chance to live up to their
promise as medicine or remain too hot to handle in the current
political climate.
 &HT;    He'll talk for hours about saving endangered species through
cloning, or the possibility of cloning pets, or why it makes more
economic and ethical sense to pay $1 for a cow egg than $2,000 to
surgically obtain a single human egg.
 &HT;    Yet his laid-back, soft-spoken demeanor belies the soul of a
headstrong provocateur; indeed, West promises to be an impassioned
voice in this debate.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of the problem we have in trying to develop
these new technologies for medicine is people's knee-jerk reaction
to words like 'fetal' and 'embryo,''' he says. ``You know, you use
the word 'fetal' and people just go completely irrational.''
 &HT;    Of course, until we learn how to direct the fate of human
embryonic stem cells _ learn how to tell them, for example, that
we'd like them to become a new liver or glistening white bone _
their enormous promise still remains under Nature's lock and key.
 &HT;    Many scientists believe it will take at least 10 years before we
learn how to program the development of cells that could be
transplanted into humans, and probably many more before we learn
how to coax stem cells into creating something as grand and complex
as a liver or a kidney.
 &HT;    But let's say some version of the science will be in practice by
the year 2011, when the first of the baby boomers turn 65. And
let's say the technology of stem cells will be complemented by
promissory notes redeemed in related fields of gerontological
science.
 &HT;    What might the menu of spare parts look like?
 &HT;    The first step in creating those spare parts _ which could be
used not only for the aged but also for anyone in need _ might well
be the donation by the patient of a biopsy sample, which could be
quickly cloned, thus creating an early embryo, which would produce
stem cells in a week or so.
 &HT;    Every cell and every tissue derived from those stem cells would
be a perfect immunological match, which would immediately
circumvent the big stumbling block of current transplant medicine:
matching tissue.
 &HT;    At that point, it simply becomes a matter of matching the
ailment to the right cell type. Researchers speak of creating nerve
cells to treat spinal-cord injuries, stroke and Alzheimer's
disease; glial cells for multiple sclerosis; pancreatic islet cells
to treat diabetes; muscle cells for muscular dystrophy;
chondrocytes for arthritis; hepatocytes for cholesterol metabolism;
endothelial vessels to grow new blood vessels to replace vessels
clogged by fat and plaque. There are more than 200 different cell
types in the body, and stem cells can theoretically be nudged to
form each one.
 &HT;    If these cells are souped up, as has been proposed, with an
enzyme that maintains its cellular youthfulness, we're talking not
only about replacement parts, but also about parts that never grow
old.
 &HT;    What might the world of stem-cell medicine look like? For one
thing, every place in the developed world might look a lot more
like Florida. Although the maximum attainable human life span is
now approximately 120 years, only about 65,000 Americans have
currently reached the age of 100.
 &HT;    A century from now, however, with new medical technologies in
place, the Census Bureau predicts there will be 5.3 million people
living to the age of 100 and perhaps much longer. To hear the
optimists talk, there'll be much longer waits for tennis courts and
tee times.
 &HT;    There are a lot of touchier issues, however, on the immediate
horizon: creating embryos for research purposes, combining
biological material from different species and performing
nuclear-transfer experiments involving adult human cells _ also
known as cloning.
 &HT;    All three are being pursued in a single line of research at
Advanced Cell Technology, but the procedures and work there are so
matter-of-fact that you'd never guess this type of experiment was
the focus of wildly fearful predictions only a few years ago.
 &HT;    Indeed, in 1997, when scientists at the Roslin Institute in
Scotland announced the cloning of Dolly the sheep, there was a lot
of fevered speculation about the possibility of cloning human
beings. It was generally dismissed as both a distant and
undesirable proposition, but the sudden appeal of embryonic stem
cells has provided a surprisingly urgent medical justification for
moving the technology of human cloning closer to reality.
 &HT;    In the case of A.C.T.'s experiments, the cow egg is being tested
as a way to ``reprogram,'' or reset, the adult DNA back to a
pristine state resembling the moment of fertilization. In these
experiments, the egg comes from a cow but the adult DNA comes from
human donors.
 &HT;    It's the human DNA, West believes, that orchestrates subsequent
embryonic development. The technical term for this type of
experiment is ``nuclear transfer,'' but West prefers a more
transparent phrase _ ``human therapeutic cloning.'' That modifier
``therapeutic'' signals that A.C.T. is not in the business of
making babies, just embryos to get stem cells.
 &HT;    The experiments at A.C.T. are conducted in a long, dark, narrow
room in the middle of the lab. The lights are low to allow
technicians to view the cells through microscopes, poking, turning
and prodding them with micromanipulation devices.
 &HT;    On the day I visit, K.C. Cunniff, 26, her blond hair spilling
out over a white lab coat, begins by vacuuming all of the cow's
genetic material from the egg cells, one after another, for more
than an hour.
 &HT;    She deftly maneuvers one pipette to hold a round, plump egg cell
in place. (The cow eggs are preferred because they are inexpensive
and easier to use than either pig or primate oocytes.) Cunniff
turns the egg, which had previously been stained with a fluorescing
dye, as if rotating a ball in her hand, until she sees a telltale
blue-green speck of DNA. Using her other hand, she nudges a sharp,
hollow needle up against the surface of the egg.
 &HT;    With a precise thrust, she enters the egg, sucks out the DNA and
withdraws the needle, all in a matter of seconds. ``Very quick,''
she says matter-of-factly. In, suction, out. Next egg. In, suction,
out.
 &HT;    As Cunniff moves another cow egg into position, Nancy Sawyer
gazes at the TV monitor and makes a sound like ``Unk!'' as the
needle punctures the egg. ``That's so cool,'' she whispers of the
image.
 &HT;    Seen on the monitor, the image has a primal iconic beauty, like
a dim grainy photograph of a distant planet. On each moonlike
oocyte, one isolated lunar mare glows with an eerie greenish blue,
betraying the location of genetic material that will soon be
suctioned away.
 &HT;    At a nearby microscope, Sawyer, 24, performs the next step.
Human skin cells, known as fibroblasts, have been provided by an
anonymous donor. The human cells dot the screen like so many lumpy,
transparent potatoes, much smaller than the egg cells.
 &HT;    Sawyer loads them into a hollow needle, immobilizes a cow egg
with suction and, with gentle pressure, inserts the needle tip just
under the rind of the egg. With a squeeze of her hand, a single
human skin cell, with its unique payload of human DNA, plops into
the egg of a creature that moos. Sawyer even manages to maneuver
her needle tip to literally tuck the hole closed.
 &HT;    After stuffing every cow egg with its little spud of human DNA,
Sawyer prepares the next step. She gives the cells a zap of 120
volts. The jolt of electricity effectively fuses man and beast into
a single biological fate.
 &HT;    After one final step, this ... this thing will believe it has
been fertilized and, if all goes well, begin cleaving, or dividing,
in the bubbling, momentous arithmetic of life lifting off the pad:
2 cells, 4 cells, 8 cells, 16 cells, 32 cells _ blastocyst!
 &HT;    The odds are extremely long that any of the 100 or so cell
fusions will result in a blastocyst, the hollow ball of cells that
appear about a week after fertilization and, in a normal embryo,
are destined to become the placenta.
 &HT;    But if that ball of cells should form, a separate group of cells
known as the inner cell mass assembles against one inside wall of
the blastocyst, like bats huddling on the ceiling of a cave, and
this is where the embryonic stem cells will appear.
 &HT;    Indeed, getting a blastocyst is just the first hurdle _ can the
scientists isolate the stem cells and keep them alive in a test
tube? And will they truly act like human embryonic stem cells?
 &HT;    Once formed, the stem cells exist only briefly before they begin
to differentiate into more specialized tissues _ there one moment
and gone the next, transients vanishing into the great biology of
becoming.
 &HT;    ``If I'm lucky,'' says Jose Cibelli, the Argentine research
scientist at A.C.T., ``I'll get one blastocyst. That's how low the
efficiency is.''
 &HT;    Before leaving Worcester, I ask Cibelli when he will know if any
blastocysts have formed. He says he doesn't expect to see anything
before nine or 10 days.
 &HT;    So on Christmas Eve, I sent an e-mail to him, asking about the
status of the cells I'd seen fused. The day after Christmas he
wrote back to report that the nuclear-transfer units had
``developed at the 'predictable' rate,'' while declining to specify
exactly what that was.
 &HT;    As soon as new techniques were in place, he continued, Advanced
Cell Technology would report the results in a peer-reviewed
journal.
 &HT;    It is Cibelli whose cow-human nuclear-transfer experiments made
news last year, prompting right-to-life pickets to show up outside
Biotech Three, marching around in cow masks.
 &HT;    President Clinton was moved to call the work ``deeply
troubling.'' Clinton asked his National Bioethics Advisory
Commission to prepare a report on stem-cell research and the
commission hastily convened hearings in January 1999 in Washington.
 &HT;    And who should turn up, uninvited, to make an unscheduled
presentation before the panel but West.
 &HT;    ``I read an editorial by an individual who wrote that science
should stop so that ethics can catch up,'' West told the national
commission that day. His ambition, he said, was ``to communicate to
people in public policy and in biomedical ethics, so that, simply,
ethics can walk hand in hand with science.''
 &HT;    Ethics and modern biology, however, have rarely walked hand in
hand, and stem-cell research has added new complexities to the
relationship.
 &HT;    As Congress prepares to debate the merits of stem-cell research
in the coming months, we will undoubtedly hear rosy visions of the
future of medicine with stem cells _ as well as the contorted
political logic that suggests that research on human embryos and
cross-species nuclear-transfer experiments are permissible in the
private sector, but morally indefensible in the public sector.
 &HT;    There is a lot of scientific research and a lot of heated
political debate to come. And how we resolve the ethical
conversations we're in the midst of having over stem cells will
have a lot to say about whether we'll have a chance of reaching
that future at all.

 By A.O. SCOTT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Once, homesick in Paris, a city that takes movies as seriously
as it takes itself, I saw ``Annie Hall'' at a packed theater.
 &HT;    Filing out afterward, I endured the contemptuous stares of the
rest of the audience because I had dared to laugh out loud at a
movie they found brilliant and important but not especially funny.
 &HT;    A few years later, at a well-appointed multiscreen theater in
Sarajevo, I sat with a raucous crowd watching Walter Hill's
``Streets of Fire,'' an unsung masterpiece about rival rock 'n'
roll motorcycle gangs who wield shotguns and firebombs in the
burned-out neighborhoods of a nameless American city.
 &HT;    My companions understood the movie, a demented, allegorical
updating of a classic B western _ with songs by the Blasters and Ry
Cooder _ to be a more or less naturalistic rendering of life in the
urban USA. (In retrospect, it looks more like a surreal premonition
of what their own lives were to become.)
 &HT;    Similarly, a few days later, when we went to see ``Witness,''
several of them assumed that Pennsylvania Amish country was a
magical land populated by mythical creatures, like the Munchkins of
Oz.
 &HT;    My point is not to poke fun at the Sarajevans' ignorance of the
realities of American social life. It can hardly, after all, have
matched my own ignorance about life in Yugoslavia, which at the
time (the mid-1980s) struck me as placid and hospitable and a cheap
place to travel.
 &HT;    My point is that while the products of American media _ a phrase
that may be even more tautological than, as Francois Truffaut
noted, ``American cinema'' _ may be washing up in every hamlet,
village and nomad's tent in the world, the way people choose to
understand them varies from place to place.
 &HT;    This is not just a matter of varying local interpretations of
Hollywood movies. In much of Africa, where American companies hold
monopolies over the distribution and exhibition of movies, it is
virtually impossible for audiences to see an African-made film on
the big screen.
 &HT;    But we should not therefore assume that African audiences have
been neatly assimilated into what some critics like to call the
global media monoculture.
 &HT;    In northern Nigeria, according to Faye Ginsburg, a professor of
anthropology at New York University, there is fervent demand for
Bollywood musicals, which are distributed by Lebanese businessmen.
Inspired by the romantic plots of those films, fans make and
circulate pamphlets.
 &HT;    In Ghana, some of the most popular entertainment consists of
low-budget horror movies, often incorporating traditional folkloric
and religious themes, that are shot on video and shown in makeshift
theaters.
 &HT;    And on television, resistance to American media hegemony has
even more faces, including Aboriginal producers on Australia's
indigenous television, the Inuit-produced programs that link
together the far-flung villages of Nunavut and the grown man in the
bumblebee suit whose predicaments are a staple of Mexican
broadcasting.
 &HT;    This bee's cartoon double occasionally turns up on that most
American of television shows, ``The Simpsons.'' Bart and Lisa, who
greet the bloody exploits of Itchy and Scratchy with howls of
laughter, are nonplussed by this striped figure, with his piteous
cries of ``No me gusta'' and ``Ay, que lastima!''
 &HT;    Bart Simpson himself is, of course, one of the half-dozen most
recognizable people in the world _ a living (or at least highly
animated) symbol of American pop-cultural triumphalism, and it is
his seigniorial prerogative simply to change the channel when
confronted with something he just doesn't get.
 &HT;    But at least one of the flesh-and-blood agents of the new media
empire may have, if you will, something of a bee in his bonnet
regarding the difficulties of cross-cultural programming.
 &HT;    In a CNN panel discussion that was shown back in the twilight of
a simpler, more innocent media age _ that is, a few weeks ago _
Gerald Levin, still merely CEO of Time Warner, observed that
``American television does not sell well outside the United States
anymore.''
 &HT;    It is a particularly remarkable development, since, like
American movies, American television programs boast much higher
production values than their foreign counterparts. The hegemony of
the Hollywood blockbuster has crippled the once-vibrant film
industries of a number of countries, where the capital to float
$200 million ocean liners is simply not available.
 &HT;    But a foam-rubber bee suit, the disco lights and spangled
costumes of an Italian variety show or the sparse furnishings of an
Egyptian soap-opera set cost less than a state-of-the-art fake
emergency room _ or even an episode's worth of Calista Flockhart's
tiny business suits. And that fact doesn't seem to diminish the
appeal of those shows to their intended audiences.
 &HT;    Television, much more than cinema, is a quintessentially
American medium: We invented it and we still do it best. And the
American style of distribution _ commercial, 24-hour, multichannel
_ is rapidly displacing the state-controlled public service model
that has been the norm in most countries.
 &HT;    So it may seem paradoxical that television, perhaps the first
truly global medium, turns out to be the one most responsive to the
whims of local viewers.
 &HT;    But the hegemony of American-style broadcasting has undermined
the dominance of American programming. The means of production are
cheaper and more widely accessible than ever, and more channels
mean a wider array of choices for viewers and programmers alike.
 &HT;    That's not to suggest that the opening of a global free market
in entertainment has created a utopia of unfettered choice and
individual expression. As any cable subscriber knows, more
programming does not necessarily mean better programming. Much of
what's on television, whatever its scale or country of origin, is
garbage.
 &HT;    I don't mean this judgmentally, but descriptively. And people
may just prefer the familiar stink of home-grown garbage.
 &HT;    Of course, even as disparate cultures can sample, and
appreciate, one another's stupidity, each one remains stupid in its
own way, and nobody's stupidity is inherently superior to anybody
else's. The fly in the ointment of the megamedia machine is that
ineffable quantity called taste _ bad taste, to be precise _ for
which there is, axiomatically, no accounting, not even by the CEOs
of a giant corporation.
 &HT;    In the global village, we are all village idiots, watching our
reflections in a box.

 &HT;    Television, much more than cinema, is a quintessentially
American medium: We invented it and we still do it best. And the
American style of distribution _ commercial, 24-hour, multichannel
_ is rapidly displacing the state-controlled public service model
that has been the norm in most countries.
 &HT;    So it may seem paradoxical that television, perhaps the first
truly global medium, turns out to be the one most responsive to the
whims of local viewers.
 &HT;    But the hegemony of American-style broadcasting has undermined
the dominance of American programming. The means of production are
cheaper and more widely accessible than ever, and more channels
mean a wider array of choices for viewers and programmers alike.
 &HT;    That's not to suggest that the opening of a global free market
in entertainment has created a utopia of unfettered choice and
individual expression. As any cable subscriber knows, more
programming does not necessarily mean better programming. Much of
what's on television, whatever its scale or country of origin, is
garbage.
 &HT;    I don't mean this judgmentally, but descriptively. And people
may just prefer the familiar stink of home-grown garbage.
 &HT;    Of course, even as disparate cultures can sample, and
appreciate, one another's stupidity, each one remains stupid in its
own way, and nobody's stupidity is inherently superior to anybody
else's. The fly in the ointment of the megamedia machine is that
ineffable quantity called taste _ bad taste, to be precise _ for
which there is, axiomatically, no accounting, not even by the CEOs
of a giant corporation.
 &HT;    In the global village, we are all village idiots, watching our
reflections in a box.

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi was among the featured
entertainers at the annual winter bash for Congress and the press.
Her assigned humor topic was to explain why she wasn't running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, addressing the audience of 1,000 diners Wednesday night,
responded to the challenge question: ``I haven't come to that
conclusion yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the story of the late Hugo Black, an Alabama politician
and future U.S. Supreme Court justice who told his wife that some
people were urging him to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are those people?'' Mrs. Black asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' Black replied, according to Pelosi, who joked: ``Some of
those same people are urging me to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi wryly related that one of her daughters had ``crossed
over.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that doesn't mean she's become a Republican, Pelosi
continued. ``She has joined the media,'' the congresswoman
continued, referring to her youngest daughter, Alexandra, who is
now working in television news.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to her assigned theme of why she isn't running for
president, Pelosi explained that the president was only the second
most respected person in town. ``After all, there's Michael
Jordan,'' former NBA superstar who's recently taken a management
job with the Washington Wizards, the local NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi drew a distinction between being president and running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in public office wants to be president,'' she said.
But few are willing to put up with the rigors of running for the
job, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi also took a shot at President Clinton's long-winded State
of the Union speech. She told a tale about how Hillary Clinton was
showing her husband their new neighborhood in Chappaqua, N.Y., when
suddenly a Secret Service agent ran up to the car and rapped on the
window, saying her husband had fallen out of the car two blocks
back.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, the first lady said, according to Pelosi, I thought
I'd lost my hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The master of ceremonies introduced Pelosi as a candidate for
majority whip in the House, the No. 3 leadership post. Her
candidacy assumes that the Democrats will regain control of the
House in the November election, triggering a shuffle of the
Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Four other members of Congress who tried their hand at stand-up
comedy were Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Rep. Marcy Kaptur,
D-Ohio, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The 56th annual Congressional Dinner was sponsored by the
Washington Press Club Foundation, the heir to the former Women's
National Press Club, founded in 1919 when women were barred from
membership at the National Press Club. In 1970 the women's club
changed its name to the Washington Press Club and invited men to
become members. That led the NPC in 1971 to allow women in. Several
years later the WPC disbanded.

(COMMENTARY: `BUSH CAN'T WIN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds, in lede, CORRECTS to William Henry Harrison sted Benjamin)  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Henry (The Great Compromiser) Clay was all set
to get the Whig nomination to challenge President Martin Van Buren.
Thurlow Weed, a New York political boss in 1840, came up with a
strategy to undermine Clay's wide support among Whigs. His
sorrowful message: ``Clay can't win.'' It worked, and the Whigs
went on to defeat the sitting president with William Henry Harrison
and not Henry Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, practical politicians have used ``electability'' as
the touchstone. And throughout last year, George W. Bush's
nomination had the aura of inevitability because polls showed him
trouncing Al Gore, his likely opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sen. John McCain crushed Bush by a historic margin in
the Republican primary in New Hampshire, we see the end of the
inevitability of the former front-runner's nomination. A coronation
at the GOP Philadelphia convention has become both evitable and
exorable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican primary on Feb. 19 in South Carolina,
independent voters will again be allowed to cast ballots for
McCain; that's the same system that made his landslide possible in
New Hampshire. This time, because Carolina Democrats won't have a
primary that day, McCain won't have to compete with Bill Bradley
for swing voters. He'll get the great majority of them.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the maverick McCain will also get enough
of South Carolina's regular Republicans to overcome Bush's 20-point
lead. The GOP leadership there, now panicking at voter interest in
campaign finance reform, is going all out to build another South
Carolina ``fire wall'' to rescue their establishment from the
horror of a McCain upset.
</P>
<P>
   How can McCain attract to his side those conservative Republican
voters who so dearly want a winner in the fall that they are
willing to swallow the springtime swing rightward of a natural
moderate like Bush? That's where Thurlow Weed's ``can't win''
strategy comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Focus not on the nomination, goes this argument to the GOP rank
and file, but on the general election. Who is more likely to defeat
the Democratic opposition, Bush or McCain?
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic nominee is the underdog Bradley, the New
Hampshire results provide the answer: independents given a choice
between Bradley and McCain overwhelmingly preferred McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats choose Al Gore to be their nominee, which
Republican is likeliest to defeat him? South Carolina's answer to
that question of presumed electability (no matter if the answer is
ultimately right or wrong) should determine who will be the
Republican standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's backers must make the case that only their man can
defeat Gore. Their job is to persuade primary voters that Bush _ no
matter how propped up by his beloved parents and blessed regularly
by the evangelist Pat Robertson _ ``can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Least important reason first: Bush's impossibly high poll
ratings of last year against the Clinton-tainted Gore (on which
much of his nomination inevitability was based) have eroded
radically. National polls no longer show Bush to be an easy winner
over Gore, and will narrow further in time.
</P>
<P>
   More important, nobody knows if Bush can coolly turn aside
vilification _ from charges of financial favoritism to smears about
drug and alcohol abuse _ sure to come at him from the Democratic
camp. Piously cluck-clucking about ``negative campaigning,'' as we
have recently seen with Bradley, is no effective defense. (McCain
can take whatever mud is heaved his way; there is no shortcoming to
which he has not already cheerfully confessed.)
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bush if nominated would have to hastily reinvent himself
as a moderate, after having moved tax-cuttingly right; but McCain
is solidly positioned to take the center, which would ensure his
victory in November while saving the House for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The most persuasive reason: a post-Bradley Gore would savage
Bush in debate, out-detailing and out-cornballing him at will;
whereas McCain's depth of experience and personality would put the
crusher on Gore's candidacy. Tacit admission of McCain's debating
superiority comes from Bush himself, who refuses to go one-on-one
with his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain cannot personally put forward a ``Bush can't
win'' argument. That calls for the likes of a modern Thurlow Weed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   How does actor put on his boxing shorts? One leg at a time _
just like a real fighter.
</P>
<P>
   How do you train an actor for a role as a boxer? Work on the
fundamentals, then train him hard and pray for a knockout _ just
like you would a real fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference is that you're hoping the magic will be on
the screen instead of in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But any actor who expects to play Ali of Liston in the movies is
likely to find himself working like a dog in some secluded, sweaty
gym in the San Fernando Valley or downtown L.A. where Oscar
nominations and Juilliard training don't add up to a pile of
sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Terry Claybon, who spent 18 months training Denzel
Washington to play Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Denzel had had all types of personal trainers over the
years, so I didn't know what it was going to be like to work with
him,'' said Carter. ``When he came in, he said, `I don't know
anything. Start me from ground one. I want to learn how to fight
like a professional.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was exactly what I wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybon, along with a handful of fight-movie trainers have been
busy lately. In addition to ``Hurricane'' and Ron Shelton's ``Play
It To The Bone,'' which are in theaters now, there has been a
recent spate of television and film boxing projects, including two
TV biographies of Muhammad Ali. ``Knockout,'' featuring Maria
Conchita Alonso, opens today in theaters, and Karyn Kusama's
``Girlfight,'' about a high school senior who embarks on an amateur
boxing career, shared the grand jury prize at the just-completed
Sundance Film Festival. Separate feature film versions of a Sonny
Liston and Muhammad Ali biographies are also in the works. In ``The
Price of Glory,'' opening March 31, Jimmy Smits stars as a former
boxer who trains his three sons to be champion fighters.
</P>
<P>
   All of these need realistic-looking fight scenes with actors who
can pull it off. Enter a Claybon, Jimmy Nickerson, Benny Urquidez
or Darrell Foster. What these fight choreographers and trainers
have in common is that they're confident, sometimes arrogant,
telling you who they've trained and what they've accomplished in
and out of the ring. They'll never admit to being starstruck. A
client, they'll tell you, is a client.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at each:
</P>
<P>
   TERRY CLAYBON: After retiring from boxing after a career that
included 39 amateur fights, three golden glove championships and an
undefeated professional record, Claybon wasn't itching to return to
a 9-to-5 job. At the Hollywood Boxing Gym, where he is an
instructor and co-owner, Claybon teaches classes and claims he can
pass on his skills to anyone. Of course it helps if you come in
with the skills of Denzel Washington who, his trainer said, might
have had a career in the ring had that been his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had started training as a fighter at the time he was
starting off in acting, you could have flipped a coin,'' said
Claybon, who also trained the fighters for ``Knockout.'' ``He has
very fast hands and an unbelievable right.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybon and Washington worked more than a year together studying
tapes of Rubin Carter's fights. Working out two hours a day, five
days a week during that period, Washington lost more than 40 pounds
_ all for a movie that has relatively few boxing scenes.
</P>
<P>
   As he frequently does with his trainees, Claybon stresses
defense. ``To make it real, you have to have defense,'' he said.
And by teaching defense, Claybon also helps provide his trainee
with the confidence that he can avoid being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can choreograph a scene to be just like a fight,'' said
Claybon, ``the punches will be so close, but he won't be glove shy
because he has the security of having defense.''
</P>
<P>
   While Claybon handled the moves and conditioning, Washington
took care of everything else: the attitude and confidence that he
could step into the ring and knock out any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Denzel, I was always telling him, `when you get on the
set, your first take, this is your world championship fight,'
Claybon said. ``Believe me, the very first time he was on the set
to shoot the scene, the tension ... I've been in world championship
fights ... and the tension between him and me was like `hey, we're
going to go for a rumble. There's going to be a battle.'''
</P>
<P>
   JIMMY NICKERSON: He'll modestly tell you, ``It could have been
anybody.'' Maybe producer Irwin Winkler and director Martin
Scorsese could have picked any skilled fighter to add some realism
to their now landmark 1980 boxing film ``Raging Bull.'' But they
selected Nickerson, a professional stuntman and former amateur
fighter from Pittsburgh whom Winkler had tabbed to work with
Sylvester Stallone on the first two ``Rocky'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raging Bull'' _ which featured an Oscar-winning Robert DeNiro
as Jake LaMotta _ became a critical smash, renowned for its
realism, and it put Nickerson on the fight film map. Since then _
with the exception of ``The Hurricane,'' _ Nickerson has worked on
a film biography of every famed boxer you can think of. Most
recently he trained Terrence Howard and Steve Harris for ``King of
the World,'' the ABC version of the Muhammad Ali story.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his trainees end up sweating it out at the Ten Goose Gym
in Van Nuys, where Nickerson likes to work. His routines are
carefully choreographed and, as ``Raging Bull'' demonstrates,
unfailingly realistic. But he won't sacrifice an actor's safety for
the sake of reality. If a filmmaker actually wants his performers
to feel an authentic blow, then count this trainer out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've proven to everybody in the past and I've shown on tape
that real punches don't work as well as my movie punches,'' said
Nickerson. ``I've walked away from shows where an actor has said,
`I just want to get hit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Then you don't need me. I don't know what else to
tell you.' If the guy breaks his nose, we have to sit in a hotel
room for two weeks waiting for it to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   BENNY ``THE JET'' URQUIDEZ: His trainees will stretch and ache
and work like crazy. But before they do, they have to answer a
deceptively simple question from Urquidez: ``Do you believe I can
help you get to where you need to be?
</P>
<P>
   ``If if comes out of their mouth, `yes,' I'll say `you've got a
working relationship,''' said Urquidez, a world champion kickboxer
in five weight divisions. ``If they say it verbally, we bond to a
hypnotic state of mind where I can get them to every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds new agey, but Urquidez _ nicknamed ``the jet'' for his
flying, spinning kicks _ likes to get into his fighters' minds, to
have his actors ``paint me a picture'' of what they're feeling or
envisioning. It helps the process of transformation, Urquidez said,
of an actor into a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In David Ramsey, Urquidez had an eager pupil. The actor, who
plays Ali in an upcoming Fox TV movie, had a background in martial
arts and was able to develop both a physical and psychological
connection with his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I can't teach you the rhythms. It's already in
you,''' Urquidez said. ``All I have to do is just bring it out in a
way that you can present it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Ramsey said, ``It sounds kind of cosmic, kind of spiritual,
and it is. Expressing yourself through fighting is very cosmic and
spiritual. Ali is a dancer who made this incredible art form
beautiful. So there was a lot of trust I placed in Benny, to learn
what does it mean to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ramsey's preparation wasn't all spiritual. The actor
talks about stretching and aching the likes of which he had never
before experienced. Between the five day a week workouts, the
stretching, running, sit-ups and carbohydrate restrictions, Ramsey
was ripping too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, ``Damn, Ali never looked this good,''' Ramsey said
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   DARRELL FOSTER: ``Fighting is not a game,'' Foster were tell you
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Ving Rhames learned that lesson while training to play Sonny
Liston. Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas learned by being on
the receiving end of a few errant punches in the early stages of
``Play it to the Bone'' training.
</P>
<P>
   And 7-year-old Spencer Breslin, co-star of an upcoming untitled
Bruce Willis film being directed by Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon'')
learned by hearing the words from the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to explain to him to stop playfighting in the street,
and if anybody on the set wanted to box around, to tell them his
coach told him he can't do that,'' said Darrell Foster, 40, trainer
to Rhames, Banderas, Harrelson and now Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Foster spars with his clients, runs with them, and puts himself
through every move, crunch or stretch that he makes them do. In
return, he asks that his trainees _ actors and athletes alike _
respect the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which they do. Chi McBride, who has lost 50 pounds in the past
year, expects to drop several more training with Foster to play a
training-reluctant heavyweight champ who teaches Breslin's
character to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are obsessive-compulsive by nature, and I think Darrell
appeals to that aspect of an actor's personality,'' a
sweat-drenched McBride said following a workout with Foster in
Santa Monica.,
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm actually doing all this,'' and here McBride raises his
voice in comic outrage so that Foster, across the room, will hear
him, ``slave driving, unmerciful training _ I must be a masochist _
to play a boxer who doesn't want to train!''
</P>
<P>
   A semi-pro boxer with 150 victories in 152 decisions, Foster was
former champion Sugar Ray Leonard's conditioning coach during much
of the 1970s. He had trained with Rhames for more than a year on
the as yet unmade Liston project when he was recommended to ``Play
It'' writer/director Ron Shelton. For that film, Foster was the
trainer and fight choreographer, and even took a role as the
referee in the climactic bout between Harrelson and Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   On location in Las Vegas, the three men stayed up late into the
night talking about boxing and acting. They would sleep in the
trailer and be up at 5 a.m. running in the desert.

   ``These are two actors who, many weeks before, had never put on
a pair of boxing gloves,'' said Foster. ``They didn't have a
fighter to carry them. They only had each other,'' he said,
downplaying his role.

<P>
   Well, and their trainer ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they had me,'' he admitted. ``They had me as the
referee.'' &QL;

``Fighting is the one sport people identify with life,'' says Ray
``Boom Boom'' Mancini. 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for authenticity in a fight scene? Watch the feet, says
Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who did a great job, who moved like a fighter, was Jon
Voight in `The Champ,''' said Mancini, a former lightweight
champion, now an actor and a producer. ``His movement. That's what
I was impressed with. The feet are what I watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his Santa Monica-based Boom Boom Productions, Mancini
looks to produce films and develop roles for himself. He recently
played the lead in a remake of ``Body and Soul'' for The Movie
Channel. A 1985 TV movie about his life, ``Heart of a Champion''
starred Doug McKeon and Robert Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Body and Soul,'' starring John Garfield, remains
one of Mancini's favorite fight pictures, primarily for its
depiction of the business side of the fight game. ``It's about how
you get seduced by success,'' he said. ``Good guys get caught up in
it. They're calling you champ on the way in and chump on the way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at an Italian restaurant near his offices, the
colorful and opinionated Mancini shared his thoughts on fights,
movies and fight movies:
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Hurricane'': ``Denzel Washington gives an Academy
Award-winning performance. Knowing the real story so well, I know
the movie is slanted. So how much do you buy the rest of it?''
</P>
<P>
   On the much-rumored prospect of Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali
in a feature film: ``He's a wonderful performer, but it's hard to
think of the guy who sings `Gettin' Jiggy With It' playing Muhammad
Ali. I don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most realistic fight scenes on screen: ```Raging Bull.'
Ask anyone. If you're asking what's the fight movie they
!ital!enjoyed most, most people would say `Rocky,' but if you want
realism, `Raging Bull.' Nobody had ever seen that before, the
close-ups of the action, the sweat flying off.''
</P>
<P>
   On the glut of fight films and TV projects: ``People live
vicariously through fighters. Fighting is the one sport people
identify as a parallel with life. People take their knocks and
bruises figuratively and literally. In the sport, it's literally,
but in life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Knockout,'' a film about female boxers opening today: ``I
don't want to see it. It's a novelty. I don't want to see it not
because I'm chauvinistic. I was raised to think of women in a
certain way, and I do. I don't want to see a woman get smacked
around. I don't want to see a woman bleed.'' &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And you thought the days of characters uttering the phrase ``let
your light shine'' outside Hallmark city limits were behind us. No
such luck.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the significant advice a mother gives her
9-year-old daughter, Belle, in ``Knockout,'' director Lorenzo
Doumani's clunky film about pursuing one's dreams. Belle the
impressionable daughter grows up to be Belle the beautiful boxer, a
``knockout'' who _ get it? _ knocks people out.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter, more insightful film explores what a woman goes
through when she penetrates a male-dominated sport. But
``Knockout,'' written by Mark Stevens and Doumani, is neither smart
nor deep. It's a watered-down ``Rocky'' with a predictable plot and
bone-crunchingly stupid dialogue that probably should have been a
cable TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we really learn about Belle (played as an adult
by newcomer Sophia Adella Hernandez) is she (BEGIN ITAL)needs(END
ITAL) to fight. Why? Presumably because her father (Tony Plana)
used to box before giving up a career as a golden gloves champ to
become a cop. He made this sacrifice at the request of Belle's
mother (Maria Conchita Alonso, in a cameo) who, in addition to her
``let your light shine'' advice, also concludes ``we shouldn't have
to give up the thing we love to be with the one we love.'' Which
isn't Belle's problem: Her boyfriend Mario (Eduardo Yanez) is her
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's ring quest is also spurred by seeing her pugilistic best
friend Sandra (Gina La Plana) get seriously roughed up by Tanya
``The Terminator'' Tessaro (Fredia Gibbs). You don't need the
Psychic Friends Hotline to guess Belle and the Terminator are
destined for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Plana has a couple of real moments, and the usually excellent
Paul Winfield sleepwalks through a role as a wheelchair-dependent
promoter. It's too early for a verdict on Hernandez's acting chops,
since, despite all her screen time, she's given surprisingly little
to work with. However, she certainly looks like she belongs in the
ring, and the fight scenes are convincing.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie feels false in so many other ways. Despite all the
talk about ``getting off the streets'' and away from gangs, East
L.A. isn't portrayed as dangerous. Our only indication that Belle,
her father and Mario have ``escaped'' a worse fate is a showdown
between the cops and a couple of kids carrying automatic weapons
that look like they're off the shelf of Toys R Us. And Belle?
Before plunging into the fight game, she's teaching aerobics at a
seniors center. How dangerous is that?
</P>
<P>
   The fault is primarily the script's, which can't deliver its
up-from-the-streets premise. Doumani may have envisioned his
heroine as ``Rocky.'' In ``Knockout,'' she comes across as little
more than a gimmick with a decent right hook. &QL;

&HT;     ILLUSIONS OF SAFETY BEHIND THE WHEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What is it about airplanes? They scare the hell
out of us, and even though we're often told they're safer than
cars, we never believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Flying is magic, something humans did in dreams long before the
Wright brothers. When the magic fails, very bad things happen, very
fast, to very many people.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks driving is magic. Most people think they're in
control. After all, they're solidly anchored to the ground by about
12 square inches of rubber moving at 70 mph. They think bad things
can't happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, I had heard statistics about how driving is
more dangerous than flying, but never quite believed them.
</P>
<P>
   We look at wrecked cars on the evening news, and it doesn't have
anywhere near the fascination of watching Coast Guard boats
circling for hours through a slick of jet fuel and bits of an
airliner.
</P>
<P>
   According to University of Southern California sociology
professor Barry Glassner, the author of ``The Culture of Fear: Why
Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things,'' there have been about
13,000 airline fatalities since 1914, the dawn of the airliner.
That's about a third the number of people killed on American roads
in one year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no comfort in those statistics for those who knew
someone on Alaska Airlines Flight 261 heading home from vacation.
</P>
<P>
   According to National Transportation Safety Board statistics,
during the last 15 years the worst year for airline safety was
1993, when there was 0.918 major crashes per million aircraft hours
flown. The best year was 1998, when there were zero major crashes
per million hours flown.
</P>
<P>
   There is no comfort in those statistics for the friends and
family of 88 people who lost their lives in an instant in the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   We in the news media offer no comfort for friends and family of
crash victims either.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, television reporters and cameramen pursued
relatives of victims of the crash of Flight 261 as they left the
airport in grief. The reporters pursued the bereaved all the way to
the parking garage elevators, despite pleas for them to show some
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   This is disgraceful. The reporters' object, of course, was to
get film and go on the air to pull on heartstrings with all the
fake compassion they could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday evening, I was on the road, flipping between radio
reports of the crash of Flight 261 and the traffic reports.
Northbound U.S. 101 was at a dead stop for two hours because of a
five-car crash near the Tiburon exit.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were injured in the crash, one of them critically.
After a struggle, highway patrol officers arrested a nude man
smoking a cigar on suspicion of driving under the influence of the
hallucinogen PCP.
</P>
<P>
   Naked motorists on PCP. That's just one example of what we face
every day on the rain-slicked roads. Even though it was a
particularly bizarre traffic accident, we accept it as part of the
price we pay for the freedom to get in the car and drive.
</P>
<P>
   We expect _ nay, demand _ perfection from airliners, though.
That has had the effect of making airline travel safer, which in
turn has made airline crashes more shocking.
</P>
<P>
   There's no use comparing car crashes with airliner crashes.
Fast-moving metal on the highway doesn't instill an abstract fear
in Americans the way feeling a plane leap off a runway does. Car
crashes are concrete and understandable.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago an 18-wheeler changed lanes on Interstate 80
right into my wife's Honda CRX. He wasn't aware her car was there
until the hub of his right front wheel ground a hole in her
driver's side door, slowing down his truck.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt. It was an everyday accident, a lost and tired
driver unable to see a tiny car. Drivers kept roaring by as fast
and dangerously as usual.
</P>
<P>
   We still haven't traded in that little car for a bigger, safer
one. Yet when I drove that same stretch of Interstate 80 to get to
Oakland Airport recently, I didn't think of getting crushed by an
18-wheeler. I worried about flying.
</P>
<P>
   We all worry about flying, and no amount of statistics can
overcome the sight of Coast Guard boats bobbing amid debris and jet
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor families, having to watch that,'' said a woman as I
was coming to work the day after.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to say but best wishes to the family and friends
of those lost with Alaska Airlines Flight 261. It comforts us to do
so, even if it is not much comfort to them.
</P>

EVERYBODY LOVES MICHAEL MCDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even hit-making singer Michael McDonald himself was surprised
when he was informed there would be a tribute concert in his honor
at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, possessor of one of pop's most recognizable voices,
had hits with the Doobie Brothers (``What a Fool Believes,''
``Minute by Minute,'' ``Takin' It to the Streets''), acclaimed solo
records (``On My Own,'' ``Sweet Freedom,'' ``I Keep Forgettin''')
and has guested on discs by Quincy Jones, Steely Dan, Patti
LaBelle, Kenny Loggins and many more.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shrine Friday night, McDonald will receive a lifetime
achievement award from the Yamaha musical instrument company for 25
years of music spanning many genres at a star-studded concert
featuring Ray Charles, Loggins, Steve Winwood and LaBelle.
Actor-performer and longtime McDonald pal Jeff Bridges will host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frankly surprised and, of course, flattered because
there's a million more contemporary record-selling acts I would've
thought of first for such an honor,'' McDonald, 47, said.
</P>
<P>
   A five-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and
keyboardist, McDonald struck gold in the latter half of the '70s as
singer and keyboardist for the Doobies, helping to redefine the
sound of what was formerly a straight-ahead rock 'n' roll band.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's soulful falsetto and gospel-inflected instrumental
style led the Doobies to the top of the charts with a mellow and
universally popular pop-r&AMP;b sound.
</P>
<P>
   After the Doobies disbanded in 1980, McDonald went further in
the r&AMP;b direction as a solo artist, dueting with leading soul
singers (with LaBelle he scored a No. 1 hit with ``On My Own'') and
establishing a jazz-lite style that kick-started the
adult-contemporary radio format.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists at Friday's show include the Doobies, Boz Scaggs,
Patti Austin, Alan Parsons, Christopher Cross, James Ingram, David
Pack (Ambrosia), Toto, Billy Dean, SheDaisy and the Wilkinsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup was kept secret from me for a long time,'' McDonald
said. ``But then they started asking me about songs I played on,
and when it got to that point, it started to become apparent to me
who was going to be on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yamaha/NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants)
Millennium Concert benefits four charities that further music
education. Limited tickets are available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charities are an important part of it for me,'' McDonald
said. ``Music education is dying out in the U.S., and all the arts
are endangered. They take such a back seat from a governmental and
educational standpoint. It's a proven theory that music is so much
a part of our innate nature (rather) than simply a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald recently launched a label with Bridges and
musician/studio designer Chris Pelonis. The company, Ramp Records,
will issue McDonald's new ``Blue Obsession'' album, largely
produced by Tommy Sims (co-writer of Eric Clapton's Grammy-winning
``Change the World''), on Feb. 21, the same date Bridges' musical
debut, ``Be Here Soon,'' is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff and I started as buddies and wound up making music
together,'' said McDonald, who lives in Nashville. ``In the midst
of being involved in his album, we decided to start a label. That
was the best of our options, given the changing climate and
atmosphere in the music business. So we decided to take a stab at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who plans to tour this summer, says his forthcoming
album is ``probably my most r&AMP;b-sounding record to date. It's the
best record I've done, but, of course, I would say that.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who enjoyed a long relationship with Warner Bros.
Records, said he's hopeful the music industry will eventually
reinvent itself once the Internet and alternate forms of sales and
distribution make substantial inroads with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting,'' he said. ``There's been a dire need
for this industry to reinvent itself, and hopefully everyone will
land on their feet. I don't have any hatred for the major labels. I
had a great relationship with Warners for a lot of years. But as
with all industries, any industry that needs to grow must reinvent
itself. And artists are seeing the opportunity to wield a certain
amount of influence mainly because they have the one thing this
industry needs the most _ content.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
What: ``Tribute Concert to Michael McDonald.'' &QL; 
Where: Shrine Auditorium, 665 W. Jefferson Blvd., Los Angeles. &QL; 
When: 7:30 p.m. Friday. &QL; 
Tickets: $25. &QL;

&HT;     SECURITY FORCES ON ALERT FOR WINTER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Security along the Canadian border is being
tightened as police and counterterrorism SWAT teams move into Lake
Placid for the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the heightened law enforcement presence is
precautionary because thousands of spectators and more than 500
athletes from around the world will arrive in the Olympic village
starting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no perceptible (terrorist) threat to the Goodwill
Games yet, which isn't to say that one may not arise,'' said Maj.
William Warburton of the New York State Police. ``But we've planned
for all kinds of security contingencies. ... We're staying alert.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Police are bringing troopers from other areas of the
New York to beef up patrols during the four-day event, which begins
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, FBI and State Police SWAT teams will be stationed
at a command post near the village outskirts. A counterterrorism
FBI unit in Washington, D.C., has been tracking any potential
threats to the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That threat assessment will continue right through the
games,'' Warburton said.
</P>
<P>
   Louie F. Allen, special agent in charge of the FBI's Albany
field office, said the FBI has worked at previous Goodwill Games.
This is the first Winter Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning we were going to be there because we
classify that as an FBI special event because a number of people
are going to be there from outside the country,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   At Canadian-border entry points, U.S. Customs agents already are
on alert. Much of the agents' work will be to get athletes across
the border swiftly, said Tim Meshinelli, assistant port director
for U.S. Customs in Champlain.
</P>
<P>
   As they did for the 1980 Olympic Winter Games here, numerous
athletes and spectators are expected to drive into Lake Placid from
Canada. A biathlete bringing a high-powered rifle across the border
for a competition might normally result in a bureaucratic delay.
But Meshinelli said agents have reviewed applicable tariff laws so
athletes with proper credentials will be processed quickly at the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the security end of it, our people have been
briefed,'' Meshinelli said. ``They are aware and certainly are in
that (high-security) mode based on what they've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Border security was heightened two months ago amid concerns
about terrorism tied to New Year's celebrations. The alert followed
the Dec. 19 arrest of a Canadian woman and an Algerian man at a
Vermont border crossing. The two were driving a car that
bomb-sniffing dogs indicated may have once carried explosives, and
the woman, Lucia Garofalo, has been linked to what federal
prosecutors have described as a terrorist group operating in Europe
and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   For the games, several U.S. Border Patrol agents will be in Lake
Placid. Agents also will be deployed at isolated locations along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be logical to assume they increase security at the
points of entry,'' said Border Patrol Assistant Chief Mark Henry.
``It would also be logical to assume (any terrorists) are not going
to come through points of entry, but through the woods. ... We
believe we're prepared.''

FEARFUL WOMEN APT TO AVOID THE SLOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Mercer loves to ski, except for those moments when fear
sneaks up and leaves her paralyzed, riveted to the slope. She
seldom falls despite learning just a year ago, but neither is she
inclined to take risks. She enjoys gentle cruising and is eager to
perfect her technique, but is skeptical at best about ever wanting
to ski the difficult, steep black-diamond trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of trapped at this (novice) level,'' said Mercer, a
46-year-old fitness instructor. ``I'll do a blue (intermediate run)
with the guidance of an instructor, but go back later with my
husband and say, `I can't do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ask what she's afraid of and she replies: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa has company.
</P>
<P>
   For the 40 percent of all skiers who are women, fear may be the
No. 1 issue. Whether more cautious by nature, unconditioned to
taking risks or simply stuck on the wrong equipment, say
specialists, women are much more likely than men to psyche
themselves out of becoming better skiers and, consequently, of
getting as much pleasure from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear can be conquered, sometimes quickly, by
understanding some of the many contradictions inherent to the sport
that seem to bedevil women more than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men don't understand our fear. They're always like, what are
you afraid of,'' said Kim Reichhelm, a former member of the US Ski
Team and two-time World Extreme Skiing champion who runs women's
programs in Crested Butte, Colo. While women are thinking, ``I have
my job, I have my kids, I have all these other responsibilities and
pressures; I can't afford to get hurt,'' she said, men take the
attitude, ``If I break my leg, I break my leg. I'll worry about
that later.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony, she said, is that because so many women rarely push
themselves beyond their comfort zones, they hold themselves back
from making the breakthroughs that will lead to becoming better
skiers, which leads to more confidence, which leads to less fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you never fall, it's going to be very hard to improve
because you're always skiing within your limits,'' Reichhelm
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, said instructor Ashley Fischer, is the specter of
regression. ``If they don't expand the comfort zone, it will
shrink,'' said Fischer, who runs the women's program at Sugarbush,
``so they find themselves taking the same lift and skiing the same
trails over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the fear was not there originally, but stems from a bad
experience. ``Women get talked into something they can't handle and
then have a horrifying experience,'' said Reichhelm. Explained Pam
McAfee, co-director of the Women's Turn program at Sunday River,
it's one thing to push the envelope; another to rip it to shreds.
``Yes, we want to press the perimeter and once in a while we want
to step a little out of it,'' she said, ``but we don't want to step
way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Men, meanwhile, may be just as afraid but react in a way that
doesn't interfere with their enjoyment of the sport. ``Instead of
either talking about it or pausing or not going down that run, men
will tend to go ahead and ski, so it doesn't look as though they're
afraid,'' said Dr. Patty Simmons, a psychiatrist who has worked
with Fischer on women's programs. ``From childhood, men are
encouraged to face their fears head on and just launch into it, and
I think that's what you see on the slopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, on the other hand, are more likely to stand at the top of
a challenging slope and strategize about how best to get down.
They're also more apt to concentrate on acquiring the proper skills
before venturing to the top of that slope in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are often more technically correct in skiing than men
because we have to be,'' said Claudia Carbone, author of
``WomenSki,'' first published in 1994. ``We can't just muscle our
way through a turn. If men screw up, they can just use their
muscles to save themselves, but we have to know how to do it
correctly. We know we can't fake it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, for some women, the root of the problem may lie not
in their heads at all but, rather, right at their feet. In skiing,
equipment that is fitted and tuned perfectly is critical: boots
that are too big or cut too high, or skis too long or stiff with
dull edges, will translate to a lack of control, which quickly
becomes fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a car with bald tires,'' said Carbone, who has been
skiing for more than 40 years and advocates custom-fitted
equipment, especially boots, even for beginners. ``A lot of women
will ski in their husband's hand-me-downs or their brother's boots.
What is that commercial for the hair? `I'm worth it?' They should
take that attitude. If I'm going to do it well and safely and have
confidence while I'm doing it, I'm going to need to go to the
basics, and the basics are equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ways to minimize fear:
</P>
<P>
   --Take lessons. Fear is not a character flaw: once you know how
to stop and turn quickly on a variety of conditions, you will have
less reason to be afraid. Ask to learn some ``survival skills''
such as the side-slip, which can get you down almost anything onto
which you might accidentally stray.
</P>
<P>
   --Accept the fact that you're going to have to relinquish
control to gain control. There's a phase of the turn ``where you
just have to let it go,'' said Fischer. ``It's OK, as long as you
know how to pull it out.'' That's where the lessons come in.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't expect too much of yourself. Acquiring skills is the
first step; practicing them is the next. ``You've got to get out
there and put in the miles,'' said Reichhelm. ``You need to do them
over and over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't blindly follow a companion, especially one with more
experience, around the mountain. Bring your own trail map and know
which lifts and runs are open so you can get yourself out of
situations you don't want to be in. ``It's a huge boost in
self-confidence not to be led around,'' said Reichhelm.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be afraid to ask mountain employees for help. Say ``I'm
thinking of going from here to there but I don't want to get thrown
on a black diamond,'' suggested McAfee. ``They'll give you a minute
to help you out.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be aware of changing conditions. What on Saturday morning was
a sweetly-groomed blue might by Sunday afternoon have become an
icy, moguled black.
</P>
<P>
   --Pick the right time emotionally to try something new. Carbone
calls the combination ``fantastic'' and ``familiarity'': on a day
when conditions are good and you're feeling great, that's the time
to become familiar with a new run or circumstance (steeps, moguls,
ice, speed) that usually causes your stomach to churn and palms to
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't cede the buying and maintaining of your equipment to
someone else. ``It's kind of like we are with cars,'' said Carbone.
``We kind of defer to men to make the decisions. That's a huge
mistake. You're the one standing on those skis.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't underestimate your ability. If you're a woman, you're
probably a better skier than you think you are; if you're a man,
the opposite is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't get down on yourself. A bad turn, bad run, bad day does
not make for a bad person. ``When I talk about fear, I tell women
fear is good,'' said Reichhelm. ``We need fear to keep us alive.
Don't get mad at yourself for being afraid: you need to figure out
what you're afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be honest with yourself about what you want out of skiing.
``Some women won't be happy until they're skiing black diamonds,''
said Simmons. ``Other women are paying lip service to it'' because
they're trying to live up to someone else's expectations. ``Rather
than give them formulas, I encourage them to do some
self-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   If that means you don't want to be like the guys who fall like
ragdolls down the slopes leaving a yard sale of equipment behind
them, only to jump up and pump their fists in glee (``Did you see
that, I ate it so bad''), is that really so bad?
</P>
<P>
   As McAfee put it: Rather than being more fearful than men,
``women might just be a little wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

WOODS SETS HIS SIGHTS ON GOLF'S LEGENDARY PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Winding through the press room like a
confused motorist on 17 Mile Drive, the hushed whispers go in every
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing nine at Poppy Hills,'' but the report is met with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's up hitting balls at the range.''
</P>
<P>
   More skepticism, for another report offers, ``He's over at
Cypress to get away from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion, for no one can be in three places at once. It just
isn't possible. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that you said wasn't quite possible he has pretty
much done,'' said Davis Love, discussing the topic _ Tiger Woods _
that dominates the PGA Tour these days.
</P>
<P>
   Like winning every week? Love was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember saying to my brother last year, `Do you realize if
(he) wins these last three tournaments (Disney, Tour Championship,
and American Express) how much money he is going to make?' My
brother said, `He can't possibly win the last three tournaments.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we were riding back (from Spain, where Woods won the
American Express) and I remember saying: `There goes $3 million
right there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Everything that you said wasn't quite possible he has
pretty much done.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Those three wins came on the heels of his win at the NEC
Invitational. So when Woods began the 2000 season with a stirring
playoff victory over Ernie Els at the Mercedes Championship, he
achieved something that had not been done in nearly half a century:
win five straight PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   The names Woods chases with this streak (Byron Nelson, 11
straight wins in 1945; Ben Hogan, six straight in 1948) are
monuments in the sport, but Woods will have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more important to you guys, something to write
about,'' he said to a media horde that has arrived in full force
for this weekend's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, which begins
this morning. ``To be honest with you, I still don't really
consider it six, because it's all over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just counting that I've won this year and trying to win
two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Semantics, shemantics. Woods can deflect talk of the streak, but
not this: Going back to a European event in Germany last May, the
Deutsch Bank, Woods has teed it up in 13 tournaments sanctioned by
either the US or European PGA Tour and won nine of them. Toss in a
couple of wins in unofficial tournaments (the World Cup of Golf,
the PGA Grand Slam) and the reality comes into focus that, streak
or no streak, Woods has developed into a force of incredible
proportions in a sport that has always preached great depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has impacted all of us,'' said Love.
</P>
<P>
   On and off the course, it seems, for Woods has developed into
such a massive personality that he dwarfs other stars around him.
Here at the AT&AMP;T, for example, there has been very little commotion
as the cancellations have filtered in.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murray, a cult figure at this tournament, chose instead to
play the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic two weeks ago. Jack Lemmon, one
of the few who bridge the era of the beloved Bing Crosby, is
recovering from surgery. Michael Douglas, Samuel L. Jackson,
William Devane, and James Woods aren't here, either.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Then Michael Jordan phoned in his regrets. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Jordan withdrawal is being viewed as somewhat
symbolic, as if confirming that the world sports stage has been
passed on to Woods. Although no one dares suggest Jordan is no
longer a hugely marketable name, it is not a stretch to call Woods
a more powerful one. The transition is hard to dismiss: Jordan was,
Woods is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get 15 to 30 calls a day, on average,'' said Mark Steinberg,
Woods's agent at International Management Group. ``People asking
for Tiger. Can he come here? Can he do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Enough offers that Woods could be kept busy every waking moment,
but it is important to weigh endorsements that fit his image. An
image, Steinberg said, that is an easy sell because, ``What you see
is what you get. He's a tremendous gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Published money figures that no one is rushing to refute lend
support to the notion Woods is about to surpass Jordan as the
world's most marketable athlete. In 1999, just his third full
season as a professional golfer, Woods earned $50 million, of which
close to $40 million came from endorsements. That is well behind
the $69 million earned by Jordan, but with a new deal from General
Motors ($30 million for five years) added to his stable and Nike in
line to re-up (as much as $90 million for five years), Woods will
be closer to $69 million than $50 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the financial worth that he means to those riding
his wave of incredible success. ``He is worth 10,000 fans at every
tournament he plays. Bottom line,'' said one tournament director.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers look at his television value, because Woods in
contention means many more viewers. When Woods and Els went
head-to-head at the season-opening Mercedes Championship, it became
the most-watched golf telecast in cable history, garnering a 3.5
rating on ESPN. Not that it moved into Super Bowl territory, but it
serves as a subtle reminder that the blockbuster TV deal the PGA
Tour entered into was signed just weeks after Woods's historic romp
at the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That TV money indirectly has gone to players, who, even if they
secretly are jealous of his success, cannot deny that Woods has
meant more money in their pockets. Purses are routinely $3 million.
So much more money has become available since Woods's arrival,
winning is no longer a necessity if you want to get rich. Being in
the top 25 will do just fine, thank you, a fact that extends to
even the game's superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, for example, went winless with just six top-10
finishes in 1999, but earned $1,722,681, more than he made in 1996
when he triumphed four times.
</P>
<P>
   Love also went winless in 1999, but that misery can be soothed
by the fact that he raked in $2,475,328 _ more than double what he
earned in 1992 when he won twice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if winning is not essential to a healthy bank account, it is
for the competitive soul that beats in Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what competitor likes finishing second,'' said
Woods. ``I've never liked it. I don't understand why people are
satisfied with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Woods's competitors _ at least while he's been on this
frightening roll _ have had no choice. Such is the ferocity of his
spirit, the scope of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aware of the streak, but that isn't what motivates him,''
said Butch Harmon, the swing coach who has instructed Woods since
being introduced to him seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There exists in Woods a burning desire to be the best who ever
played the game, said Harmon, which means one thing in pro golf:
surpass those feats put up by Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Two US Amateur titles? Woods did Nicklaus one better, winning in
1994-96. Cross that off the list of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen professional majors? OK, he's well short, having won
the 1997 Masters and last summer's PGA Championship. But keep in
mind he is just 24 years old, and history tells us he is on
schedule. In his first 71 professional tournaments, Woods won 16
times, including two majors; Nicklaus's numbers over that time
frame were 14 and three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to be great,'' said Harmon, ``but he has
far surpassed my expectations.'' It's mostly, said the teacher,
because Woods is ``such a great student. He learns quickly. He
listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Example: In the afterglow of that Masters win, Harmon said he
knew things had to change. The coach talked of a more compact
swing, better distance control, hitting more greens. Hogan's swing,
said Harmon: ``Study it.''
</P>
<P>
   So for two years Woods retooled a swing and never came close to
his Masters magic. He won the Western Open in July 1997, then
didn't win again until May of the next year, which happened to be
his only win in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The ``slump'' proved that he wasn't so dominating, said the
critics, though they failed to acknowledge that the ``slump''
consisted of two seconds, two thirds, and three other top-10
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Woods. ``I know you guys looked at me like I was
crazy in '98, saying that I was better (then) than in '97, but it
was true. I was making progress. I was improving in a lot of
aspects of my game, and it finally came together last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the expense of some pretty good players, a fact that should
not be discounted. In his current streak, though three of the
events have had limited fields, Woods has outplayed Mickelson, Els,
Love, Miguel Angel Jimenez, and Els again.
</P>
<P>
   Go back and look at two of his first three wins _ playoff
victories head-to-head with Love and Tom Lehman _ and you get a
measure of why his thirst for pressure is never questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my first four playoffs, and I was dreading them,'' said
Love, again searching to answer just how it is that Woods has
turned this PGA Tour into his own personal agenda. ``He probably
looks forward to them, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of his incredible wealth and unmatched golfing skills,
Woods has an engaging side to him, which he isn't afraid to let
shine through. He said his pairing with Jordan here fell through
because ``he's got a job now and can't get off work, even though he
is the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Then toward the conclusion of Wednesday's practice round, Woods
agreed to some fun with playing partner Mark Calcavecchia. The
final hole would be alternate shot with the caddies as partners, a
$100 bet.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th hole at Pebble Beach is arguably the most famous tee
shot in golf, for you must start the ball out over a Pacific Ocean
that offers a continuous roar of waves.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia's caddie hit first and launched it perfectly,
adding that much pressure onto Steve Williams, Woods's caddie. With
his player hoisting jokes in his direction, Williams tried to get
it over in a hurry and his swing produced a low screamer that hit
thick rough next to a red stake. An unplayable lie, just 85 yards
off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   With 458 yards to go, hitting his team's second shot, Woods
laughed. ``Man, I'm in trouble now.''
</P>
<P>
   He crushed a 3-wood to get his team back in play, but Williams
pushed the next shot into thick rough right of the green. Hitting
his team's fourth shot, Woods nearly holed out a soft lob, a shot
that led Williams to roar, ``I've got a partner,'' as the ball came
to rest a foot from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Woods laughed, even though he had lost the one-hole
match. No matter, for it didn't count for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the streak. No matter what Woods says.

HOW TO USE THE SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spending by the federal government has been growing at roughly 5
percent a year. Federal revenues have been growing almost twice as
fast. The result is a budget surplus estimated at $170 billion this
year _ and as much as $4 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   This geyser of cash has awakened something unheard in America
for generations: serious talk of erasing the nation's public debt.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV ad now airing in South Carolina, George W. Bush says his
economic plan ``reserves $2 trillion of the surplus to protect and
strengthen Social Security and pay down the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   During his State of the Union speech, Bill Clinton announced, to
wild applause, ``We are doing something that would have seemed
unimaginable seven years ago. We are actually paying down the
national debt. If we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt
entirely in 13 years and make America det-free for the first time
since Andrew Jackson was president.''
</P>
<P>
   And in New Hampshire the other day, there was this from John
McCain: ``In town hall after town hall, people have stood up _
these are working-class families that come to these town meetings _
they say, `Senator, why don't we pay down the debt? We have an
obligation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Do we? An obligation to service the debt, yes. But to eliminate
it?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there would some measure of moral satisfaction in
lightening the financial load future taxpayers will have to bear.
Retiring some or all of the debt today means that our children will
owe less interest on that debt tomorrow. Reducing the national debt
by $100 billion next year, for example, would reduce annual
interest payments by as much as $6 billion. Not a bad little
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly the biggest bang we can get for the budget-surplus
buck.
</P>
<P>
   The number that matters most when assessing debt is not the
dollar amount, but how big the indebtedness looms in the overall
financial picture. Is a $150,000 mortgage a crushing obligation?
Yes, if the borrower makes only $25,000 a year; not at all, if he
makes $100,000. Likewise the national debt. In 1993, the debt stood
at nearly 50 percent of GDP. Today it is closer to 35 percent. So
long as Washington doesn't return to deficit spending, the burden
our children inherit will keep shrinking _ even if we retire none
of the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The faster the economy grows, the lighter the debt becomes. And
there lies the key to spending the surplus. Use $100 billion to pay
down debt, and the reward is $6 billion a year in interest savings.
Use $100 billion to eliminate the death tax _ or to cut marginal
tax rates across the board _ or to replace the Internal Revenue
Code with a flat-rate ``postcard'' tax _ and the reward is far
greater. The right tax cuts, says Daniel Mitchell of the Heritage
Foundation (to whom I am indebted for the numbers in this column),
would spur an additional 10-15 percent of growth over the next
decade _ as much as $1 trillion of new wealth added to the US
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, let the surplus be used to reform Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next seven decades, the Social Security Administration
says it will have to pay out $20 trillion more than it will take
in. That is a staggering unfunded liability, six times the size of
the national debt. If you're concerned about future generations,
this is the debt that should keep you up at night. Treasury
obligations can easily be rolled over; as old T-bills and savings
bonds are paid, new ones can always be sold. But Social Security
debt isn't so simple. As millions of Baby Boomers head into
retirement, their pensions will have to be paid with actual dollars
_ dollars the government won't have. When that day comes, either
Social Security will go bankrupt, or taxes will skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to prevent this train wreck is to get Social
Security out of the government's hands. It should be converted from
what it is now _ a pay-as-you-go Ponzi scheme _ into a genuine
investment plan. Workers would put a portion of their earnings into
private accounts that they, not Washington, would control. Because
these would be real investments, with real earnings and real
compounding, the rate of return would be far higher than anything
Social Security offers. Employees would be able to look forward to
vastly improved retirement benefits _ and the government would no
longer have the obligation of supporting them in old age.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing Social Security in this way has been bruited about
for years. The great stumbling block was always the transition
costs. During the shift from the old system to the new, who would
protect current retirees and older workers? What would happen to
their benefits as less and less money flowed into the Social
Security Administration? Thanks to the budget surplus, it is now
possible to assure them: Nothing would happen to their benefits.
They would be fully protected.
</P>
<P>
   Using the surplus to finance the move to a private Social
Security system would pay dividends in many ways. It would boost
retirement income. It would increase the national savings rate. It
would end the ruinous upward creep of payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Over and above everything else, it would solve America's real
debt crisis: the massive unfunded Social Security liability that is
lurking around the corner. Paying down the national debt has an
undeniable appeal. But that's not the debt that menaces our kids.

Jackie McLean/``Nature Boy'' (Blue Note)
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quartet date of standards played in swinging style, ``Nature
Boy'' finds veteran alto saxophonist McLean teamed up with such
dependable old hands as drummer Billy Higgins, pianist Cedar Walton
and longtime trio bassist David Williams. Now into his fourth
decade as a leader, McLean still delivers passionate music in the
post-bop tradition and this disc finds him in a more relaxed mood
than other recent sessions. The collection opens with a mid-tempo
``You Don't Know What Love Is,'' moving on with an introspective
take on the title track, highlighted by McLean's spirited solo.
Although the track list is almost overly familiar _ ``Smoke Gets in
Your Eyes,'' ``What Is This Thing Called Love?'' ``I Can't Get
Started'' _ the players invest the material with surprise and
personality. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
D'Angelo/``Voodoo'' (Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   The eagerly anticipated sophomore set from sinewy urban soul
star D'Angelo has been delayed and rescheduled so many times you
almost wonder if someone put a bona fide hex on the project.
Definitely worth the wait and easily one of the most compelling r&AMP;b
albums in a long time, the 14-track ``Voodoo'' is a neo-soul
classic, a stirring mix of funk and hip-hop in that resonant,
easy-to-love style of Lauryn Hill. Recorded at Jimi Hendrix's old
Electric Lady studio in Greenwich Village, the record was clearly
inspired by the '60s guitar great, along with the spirits of early
Prince, Stevie Wonder (whose Fender Rhodes piano from the ``Talking
Book'' sessions was used), Marvin Gay and James Brown. The
groove-thick atmosphere lives up to the Hendrix-tinted album title
and a spare, earthy vibe pervades all corners, including a
slow-burning cover of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit ``Feel Like Makin'
Love.'' A low-lights beauty. 4 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Tina Turner/``Twenty Four Seven'' (Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a memorable album for the flamboyant rock
'n' soul diva who recently turned 60. Sadly, ``Private Dancer''
it's not. Again, it's a problem of material. Turner invests all
tracks here with trademark full-throttle passion but she's working
with lackluster songs. Although Turner has dubbed the album a form
of modern gospel music, the tunes are rarely memorable or
compelling. A voice that could turn the Jerry's menu into a
foot-stomping raveup shouldn't be singing such piffle as ``Talk to
My Heart'' and ``Without You,'' two of the lesser cuts on display.
Better luck next time. 2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Fela Kuti/``The Best Best Best of Fela Kuti'' (Universal/Barclay)
</P>
<P>
   At last those Universal Records dollars are bearing fruit. The
label's ambitious and long-awaited Kuti reissue project is under
way, and the first item off the presses is this excellent two-disc
anthology of some of the Nigerian Afrobeat legend's greatest and
hardest-to-find material. It's all here _ from the great
``Shakara,'' a jazz-tinged funk workout about a street
confrontation, and the equally brilliant ``Zombie'' to ``Coffin for
Head of State,'' the late Kuti's fiery condemnation of Nigeria's
former ruling party. Whether you care about politics or not, Kuti's
great grooves and the fine playing of his sprawling jazz-funk
ensemble will have you voting for this highly recommended
compilation. 4 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Amel Larrieux/``Infinite Possibilities'' (Epic/550 Music)
</P>
<P>
   As siren for New York's progressive r&AMP;b outfit Groove Theory a
few years back, Larrieux attracted attention for a voice that could
go from silky to gutsy in the space of a couple of lines. Using
hip-hop, funk beats and flashes of world-beat influences, her first
solo effort paints warm, infectious pictures. Perhaps the most
promising track is ``Down,'' a jazzy groove Larrieux puts across in
a husky lower register. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Michael Brecker/``Time Is of the Essence'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Long admired as a studio musician and guest player, Brecker has
finally come up with an album that matches his prodigious talents
on the tenor sax. Brecker has never sounded so loose and funky as
he does on ``Time's'' nine new compositions, and his liberation as
a player must, in part, be attributed to the presence of guitarist
Pat Metheny and organist Larry Goldings. Together with a revolving
trio of drummers (including Elvin Jones), the band creates vibrant,
straight-ahead jazz that is unpredictable without being
self-indulgent. An inspired effort, easily Brecker's best work as a
leader. 4 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Sarah Chang, Wolfgang Sawallisch; Concerto for Violin and Orchestra
in D Minor Op. 8, and Sonata for Violin and Piano in E Flat Op. 18
by Richard Strauss (EMI Classics)
</P>
<P>
   This recording of two early, rarely performed works by Strauss
affords a fascinating study of the interplay between the
still-young composer's rapidly expanding musical vocabulary and
Chang's own beautifully lithesome, still-ripening solo work. By far
the more accomplished and subtle of these pieces is the violin
sonata, an elegantly rounded chamber work that echoes the bright,
chromatic exclamations of Strauss' ``Don Juan'' period (circa
1888). Chang and pianist Wolfgang Sawallisch (who also conducts the
violin concerto) suavely convey the composer's youthful ambition
and amazing structural confidence, particularly in a finale that
contains flashes of the fiery modernist yet to come. Op. 8, written
when Strauss was but 17, heaps dramatic notions and concise
mini-melodies like new-mown hay before settling into the achingly
pensive middle movement, followed by the high-spirited romanticism
of the rondo finale. A rewarding if not exactly indispensable disc.
2 1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson &QR; 
 &QL; 
Chet Baker, John Barry, Chris Botti/``Playing by Heart'' (Decca)
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart,'' for those who don't remember (and that
would include just about everybody) was a little-seen ensemble film
that came and went this time last year. This album figures to have
a longer shelf life since composer Barry, working with pop/jazz
trumpeter Botti, has delivered a moody, expressive score that's
perfect for late-night listening. The album includes three prime
Baker cuts from his outstanding 1955 Paris sessions, and,
predictably, they overshadow the other music here. (Check out
``Chet in Paris, Vol. 2'' for the full program.) Still, Barry has
written some beautiful, melancholy music here, and fans of the
late, great Baker will undoubtedly appreciate this tribute. 3

IT WAS ALL DONE WITH MUSIC AND MAHOGANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Camille Saint-Saens, a 15th-century Norman carved
mantelpiece and an Amish-trained cabinetmaker have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, these three elements came together to produce
a huge carved mahogany cabinet, an entertainment center that
promises to be an heirloom someday.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when Paul and Valerie Gilman, who live in a
castle-like house in Gloucester, Mass., complete with moats, called
cabinetmaker Michael Turkoc to see what he could do to build an
entertainment center, an eight-foot piece that would fit into the
Italianate castle, and house a TV, stereo, and the usual
components, including speakers, without looking out of place.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilmans wanted something Italianate, or maybe a white
cabinet in French provincial. So, said Turkoc, ``I offered them
something French.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gilmans showed me the house, and when I saw that
15th-century mantelpiece, which was originally a headboard, I
flipped,'' said Turkoc. What better design than one that is alreay
in the house? ``I touched the piece and said, `This is it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to make something beautiful, and this was my
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkoc, a partner in Artisans in Wood &AMP; Design of Rockport,
Mass., went back to his shop, a roomy, comfortable workplace with a
minimum of power tools (remember, he's Amish trained, from Ohio),
and an enviable collection of wood chisels. He even has a couple of
skew chisels, ones that cut at an angle, that he fashioned from old
tie rods.
</P>
<P>
   Turkoc took lots of pictures of the old mantelpiece, with plans
to carve something similar, or at least similar in spirit. He
touched that old mantelpiece, again.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got stuck. The muse abandoned him. It happens to all
artists, one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   Until . . . Until one day he was listening to WCRB, and Ray
Brown, one of the friendly announcers on that classical music
station, played Saint-Saens' ``Rhapsody D'Auverne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried a little,'' said Turkoc, ``but I was also thrilled,
and had the design in two hours.'' While that did not take long, he
worked with templates for 100 hours before cutting wood.
</P>
<P>
   The design is Norman, with a non-Norman breakfront style (the
middle sticks out in front of the ends), large, solid, and
masculine, but with feminine touches in French curves at the ends.
And, an interesting addition, eight large bun feet. They make it
easy to stabilize the big piece on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The sides and top are plain, but accented by those French
curves. Another nice touch is the low height of the cabinet,
reducing its massiveness and allowing anyone reasonably tall to see
the incredibly smooth top with the ever-so-deep finish of eight
coats of lacquer without standing on tiptoe. Other surfaces have
five to eight coats of lacquer, which provide not only a pleasant
glow but also just the right color of the mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   Turkoc started out by buying a huge piece of wood from Holt &AMP;
Bugbee of Tewksbury. He thinks the old Norman mantelpiece is walnut
or French pear, both too rare to find the large piece he needed for
the sides. So, he opted for mahogany; besides, he had 600 board
feet of mahogany in the shop, and mahogany is more readily
available.
</P>
<P>
   That big slab of mahogany was 4 3/8 inches thick, 24 inches wide
and 9 1/2 feet long, and made fine sides.
</P>
<P>
   It was the doors _ one double and two singles, that provided the
challenge to Turkoc to create carvings similar to those on the
ancient mantelpiece.
</P>
<P>
   He came through, chiseling great slabs off the mahogany, even
using a router to get larger amounts off, continuing with a little
finer work with a Dremel tool, and ending up with hand chiseling
with the chisel marks showing, the only way carving like this will
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkoc did a lot of sanding, but not on the flat part of the
panels.
</P>
<P>
   This carving technique left highlights on the panel, just as it
did 500 years ago on the mantelpiece. There are no overlays or
tacked-on or glued-on moldings or decor.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet is eight feet long and very heavy, so Turkoc built
it in several parts for easy transportation.
</P>
<P>
   One modern concession to the cabinetry is the use of speaker
cloth to cover the speakers. They are set in doors that can be
lifted off, and offer little resistance to sound transmission. What
if the doors shrink and start to rattle? ``We'll tackle that when
it happens, if it happens'' said Turkoc.
</P>
<P>
   While Turkoc used contemporary joinery techniques, he used a
very old technique in mounting the panels in their frames. They are
dry mounted, without glue, and float in the frames. This keeps them
from cracking when they expand and contract.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the panels in the mantelpiece were mounted, and they
have served well, uncracked in 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   So that is how Saint-Saens, the Norman mantelpiece, and an
Amish-trained cabinetmaker combined to produce a cabinet as sublime
as the music it holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite understand how music relates to cabinetmaking,
but in my case it does,'' said Turkoc.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he was making a cabinet for a music maker.
</P>
<P>
   And you ought to hear that Saint-Saens Rhapsody coming from the
speakers in Michael Turkoc's rhapsody in mahogany.
</P>

WHAT WE SEE IS WHAT WE GET 
</HEADLINE>

 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the universe has a slogan, it goes ``Pay attention, stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have at one time or another come across the old adage
that what you pay attention to shapes your character, and limits or
expands your capacity to be fully human. I could point to a myriad
examples, but I think it makes more sense for each of you to take a
few moments to wonder: Out of the millions of events taking place
on this planet every day, what do you choose to focus on?
</P>
<P>
   But I recently learned something even more astounding about the
degree to which we are capable of paying careful attention. It
doesn't only shape one's inner landscape; it reveals very different
aspects of external reality to different people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, my friend Lynn and I took our first trip together. We
spent six days in Belize, which is the closest I have ever gotten
to the Garden of Eden. We traveled on our own, and a series of
seemingly random impulses led us to a fairly inaccessible area in a
part of the country near the border with Guatemala, where we stayed
with a Mayan family. One morning, the eldest son equipped Lynn and
me and several other Americans staying at the Crystal Paradise
Resort with paddles and canoes and dropped us off at a spot on the
Macal River. Jeronie pointed in the direction of a town called San
Ignacio, 9 miles away, where he said he hoped to see us again.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, we were on our own.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and I did notice a few brightly colored birds when we were
not concentrating on staying afloat through short but somewhat
scary stretches of rapids. There were three canoes in all. The one
in the lead was our least favorite because we had discovered at
dinner the night before that its occupant was an avid hunter who
owned nine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and I knew we were in a jungle because there were vines,
strange sounds, unfamiliar smells, and oversize office plants all
around, but I was disappointed. Lynn likes flora. I'd come for the
fauna.
</P>
<P>
   John, our sharp-sighted hunter, was the only one of us who saw
the family of otters near some logs and led us to a place where we
could watch the parents trying to restrain a kid who wanted to show
off. I would not have seen the otters in a million years. John also
sighted the iguanas midway up the trees, every one of them a
strange coral color because the males had donned erotic finery for
the mating season. He anticipated the struggle for dominance
between two 4-foot-long specimens that sent both of them plummeting
30 feet to the ground. By paddling his canoe under an oddly shaped
overhang, he set off a flurry of bats we would never have been
aware of otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   I spend a lot of time in nature myself, but I never realized
before this trip that I am nearly blind. I couldn't see the
extremely talkative parrot in the foliage outside our room until
one of the Mayan children led me directly to the right tree and
pointed. I scanned branches where everyone else was watching spider
monkeys, and couldn't pick them out until one of them leaped into
the air. If I had not been accompanied by people whose acuity of
vision astounded me, I swear I would have returned from vacation
asserting as fact that the only visible wild animals in Belize were
the coatimundi that begged for chips at Mayan ruins. I can imagine
myself insisting that most were too deep in the jungle to see.
</P>
<P>
   When you don't pay attention, whole aspects of reality actually
cease to exist. This can happen individually. It can shape whole
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   I've been wondering if this realization has a wider application
_ in matters of divinity, for example. I am positive I would have
noticed if a burning bush had spoken to me or a river parted so
that I could pass through, but there are few if any miracles that
spectacular these days. Still, I wonder. What if the spirit is
whispering to me and I'm not listening carefully enough? What if
some sacred force is clearly active in my life, but I ignore it
because I'm too preoccupied with something else?
</P>
<P>
   What else in this world am I incapable of seeing?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be ironic if love, or wholeness, or meaning, or
happiness, or friendship, or abundance, or whatever else our heart
most passionately desires were smack dab right here in the middle
of everything and most of us hadn't a clue because, like tourists
set down in an unfamiliar setting of incredible beauty, we were
busily, madly, blindly paddling down the river of life, oblivious?

EXIT POLL PACT: SACRED DUTY OR CHARADE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite all the primary day excitement, the streets of
Manchester, N.H., seemed normal Tuesday with citizens casually
going about their business. The scene was much different, however,
at the Holiday Inn, where journalists were congregating like hungry
locusts at a wheat field.
</P>
<P>
   In that insular world _ where gossip, speculation, and the
occasional news tidbit are the legal tender _ the afternoon buzz
built to a crescendo. The exit polls showed John McCain on his way
to a stunning win. Once reporters trade those numbers among
themselves, there's a powerful urge to share them with the public.
Yet, there is general agreement that news outlets should wait until
the polls close before giving away the results, which means keeping
the news to themselves for a few more hours.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's New York Times and Washington Post documented the TV
pundits and newsmen who successfully walked the exit poll tightrope
by hinting at the McCain romp without directly spilling the beans.
But the online publication, Slate magazine, (slate.msn.com) proudly
posted McCain's 19-point lead in the exit polls on Tuesday
afternoon, announcing it had shattered the ``exit-poll taboo'' and
proving that cyberspace has clearly emerged as journalism's newest
ethical battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the business to disseminate information, not to withold
it because somebody might use it `incorrectly' by staying home and
not voting because their candidate has lost (or won),'' wrote Slate
deupty editor Jack Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stencel, editor of the ``On Politics'' section of the
Washington Post Web Site (www.washingtonpost.com), says that exit
polls are tailor-made for cyberspace ``simply because online
journalism craves data...Whether it's exit polls or gossip, there
seems to be a real debate going on in our business about the whole
gatekeeping role the media plays. Even in the bottomless hole of
the Internet, you have to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been true for ages that the moment the exit polls come
out, almost everybody in the journalism world has those numbers.''
says Doug Bailey, founder of the new politics Web site
www.freedomchannel.com. ``But it's inevitable in the online world,
which doesn't follow all the accepted rules of journalism, that the
new journalism says `go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly dovetails with Shafer's attitude. He views the
exit poll embargo as a paternalistic charade, an acting job
perpetrated by big media mandarins that deserves to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an elite that knew (the scope of McCain's victory),
but somehow they felt they had to keep that secret from the
public,'' he scoffs. In the old media world, such gatekeeping
practices might have succeeded, he says. But in the new world of
dot coms and digital media, ``anybody can poach on anybody. It's
sort of `dog eat dog' and `cat eat mouse' all over the media
universe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Few observers would argue that point, but some disagreed with
Slate's decision to reveal the poll numbers. Among the responses
posted on the Web zine's site Wednesday was one message that states
simply, ``you lack intregrity.'' Another accused Shafer of
``spouting the same arrogant line the media has used for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project For Excellence in
Journalism, describes Shafer's argument that he is in the
information dissemination business as ``the mechanistic approach:
`I just tell the truth, I just pass along. I don't make decisions.'
''
</P>
<P>
   While perhaps trying to display its new media disdain for such
traditions as the embargo, Rosenstiel argues that Slate fell into
the old media's trap of justifying a controversial action with a
kneejerk response.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning this whole debate is the question of whether
witholding exit poll results serves a broader civic purpose by
avoiding the possiblity of influencing election day traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't make a whole lot of difference,'' says
Rosenstiel. ``The research shows that it actually does not impact
turnout.'' Nevertheless, he remains convinced that the current
embargo is probably a good idea, if only because the media don't
need any more enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the of the public kind of hates us, why would
we do things that would demonstate a kind of arrogance toward the
civic procedures,'' that journalism should support? he says. ``Even
if the research can't definitively prove we're hurting democracy,
the burden of proof should be on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Crawford, editor of The Hotline political newsletter,
echoes the same sentiments. ``The only virtue (of the embargo) is
not influencing the electorate,'' he says. ``It's hard to see
evidence that that's significant, but (breaking the embargo) seems
wrong. I would never do it. It's uncool. I really do think this is
something we should keep sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the powerful impulses in much of the burgeoning online
world is that nothing is sacred. That's what Slate decided
Wednesday, cockily challenging the traditional media to do
something about it.

SIGNS POINT TO MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's No. 1? Strange question to be asking about college
football teams in February. But Wednesday it had some meaning.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``National Letter of Intent Day.'' In New England,
it didn't mean all that much if you weren't a Boston College fan or
didn't follow some Division 1-A program from long distance.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the South, all around the Midwest, down in the
Southwest, and out on the West Coast, it was headline stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which recruiting guru you believed _ and there are
lots of them _ Texas, Penn State, Miami, or Florida had the No. 1
recruiting class Wednesday after they received official commitments
from the various blue-chip athletes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Miami may not have won the Big East race last season, but the
Hurricanes and coach Butch Davis took the conference recruiting
honors in a landside, far outdistancing runners-up Virginia Tech,
Syracuse, and Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news for the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? They might have finished third in their own state,
since Florida and Florida State also had top-10 recruiting classes.
</P>
<P>
   But like some elections that need recounts, the final tallies
are not in. Wednesday was only the first day that recruits could
officially commit to a school in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the player regarded by many as the best prep player
in the country, D.J. Williams, a 6-foot-1-inch, 230-pound
linebacker from Concord, Calif., was hedging his bets as he decided
between Miami, California, and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent a lot of time and energy recruiting Williams, and
felt the 'Canes still had the inside track on Williams. But until a
school's fax machine buzzes with Williams's signature, nothing is
official.
</P>
<P>
   So precarious is the balance of power in recruiting that one
player, such as Williams, could vault Miami from somewhere in the
bottom half of the top 10 to the top five, and even No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lemming, who is as respected as anyone in the business,
ranked Florida No. 1 and Tennessee No. 2 using simple logic.
``Florida signed more top 100 players than anyone else,'' said
Lemming, who also had Alabama, Florida State, and Texas in his top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Some others had Texas No. 1, which would make Longhorns coach
Mack Brown 2 for 2 in top recruiting classes in his two years in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part: Brown must coach that talent and get
them to produce on the field.
</P>
<P>
   If you go by position, the balance of power is fairly well
spread out. Assuming Williams commits to Miami, the Hurricanes
would have the top linebacker in the country.
</P>
<P>
   --Safety O.J. Owens, a 6-0, 190-pound speedster from New London,
N.C., committed to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   --Wide receiver B.J. Johnson, a 6-0, 180-pound wide receiver
from Grand Prairie, Texas, signed with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   --Quarterback Brock Berlin, a 6-2, 202-pound prospect from
Shreveport, La., committed early to Florida. In fact, he's already
enrolled at school and will participate in spring practice with the
Gators.
</P>
<P>
   --Kwame Harris, regarded as the best offensive lineman in the
country, committed early as well. The 6-7 tackle form Newark, Del.,
is going to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   --The best running back? Arguably it's Willis McGahee, from
Miami Central, who is staying home and playing with the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   So it went as the commitments kept coming in and coaches
announced how delighted they were with their recruiting classes.
</P>
<P>
   As well they should be.
</P>
<P>
   It's February, after all, and hope springs eternal for the haves
and the have-nots of college football.

WILLIAM GIBSON RETURNS TO ``THE X-FILES'' 
</HEADLINE>

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of a montage
including author William Gibson and the cast of ``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Just as his characters crave to transcend the flesh, William
Gibson yearns to transcend his status as a living legend.
 &HT;    The author of the ground-breaking ``Neuromancer'' trilogy _
``Neuromancer'' (Ace Books, 1984), ``Count Zero'' (Ace, 1986) and
``Mona Lisa Overdrive'' (Ace, 1988) _ swears that he is not the
godfather of cyberpunk. And virtually no one believes him.
 &HT;    ``Even in the early 1980s, it just seemed to be one of those
weird journalistic feedback loops,'' Gibson says by telephone from
his home in Vancouver, B.C. ``Someone coined a term, and it sounded
good.''
 &HT;    At the very least, however, Gibson ranks as a prophet of the
Internet. His vivid tales depict computer universes run amok,
artificial intelligences giving humankind a run for its money and
virtual reality before the phrase existed. They're violent, sexy,
forward-thinking and scary as hell.
 &HT;    Gibson also has tried his hand at writing for the big screen,
enduring a ``fairly traumatic'' ordeal with the incoherent 1995
thriller ``Johnny Mnemonic.'' Far better was his small-screen
experience with ``Kill Switch,'' an acclaimed fifth-season episode
of ``The X-Files.''
 &HT;    So popular was that episode _ and so pleased was Gibson with the
finished product _ that he agreed to a return engagement. In the
Chris Carter-directed ``First Person Shooter,'' airing Feb. 27,
Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) contend with
a lusty, busty and bloodthirsty cyberbabe (Krista Allen) who
appears to be slaying the human players of a soon-to-be-released
video game.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to trap a couple of women in the purest and most
exaggerated testosterone nightmare we could come up with,'' says
Gibson, who co-wrote the hour-long episode with ``Kill Switch''
partner Tom Maddox. ``This is the id's revenge on the boytoy.
 &HT;    ``I like it that the monster is kind of an id figure _ it's sort
of the impossible boy's fantasy of what a woman should be,'' he
says. ``I also liked the sense of big e-bucks that flows through
the episode, the chance of making a zillion bucks on a lucky IPO.''
 &HT;    Gibson thinks there's as much difference between film and
television as there is between the written word and the screen of
either size. Further, he considers writing prose fiction to be an
entirely different art form from writing for the screen.
 &HT;    ``It's like music and sculpture,'' he says. ``They're both
creative activities, but they're just so different.
 &HT;    ``I don't think screenplays are artifacts in the way that novels
are,'' the author says. ``A screenplay is a process, it's evidence
of a process. But it's really nothing in itself.
 &HT;    ``I can never judge what will eventually appear on screen on the
basis of a screenplay,'' he adds. ``I've read scripts I disliked
but liked the movie when I saw it, and they hadn't changed a
word.''
 &HT;    Many moviegoers assumed that Gibson was involved in the making
of last year's blockbuster ``The Matrix.'' Given the film's
hypnotic visuals, A.I. villains and sleek costumes, the confusion
was understandable, but Gibson had nothing to do with the
production.
 &HT;    ``Before I saw it, I assumed it would have all too much to do
with me,'' Gibson says. ``A good friend of mine finally dragged me
kicking and screaming to see it, and I really liked it. Upon
reflection, it probably didn't have all that much to do with me.
 &HT;    ``I thought they digested my work very, very thoroughly, and the
work of a couple of other writers,'' he adds. ``In some ways it was
more like a Philip K. Dick story than a William Gibson story.
 &HT;    ``It was also a remarkably good-hearted movie, which I hadn't
expected at all.''
 &HT;    Gibson's latest novel, ``All Tomorrow's Parties'' (Putnam,
1999), arrived in bookstores in November. The post-Millennium
adventure revisits Colin Laney, a character last seen in the Gibson
best-seller ``Idoru'' (Putnam, 1996).
 &HT;    ``By and large the reaction was very positive,'' the author
says. ``Once my books are published I just let them go. I'm already
thinking about the next one.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll read `All Tomorrow's Parties' in a couple of years,
and then I'll see what I did.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, Gibson hopes to write more ``X-Files'' episodes
_ assuming, of course, that the series continues for another
season, contrary to current reports.
 &HT;    As for the big screen, the film rights to ``Count Zero'' and
``Mona Lisa Overdrive'' are ``sold and sitting somewhere,'' he
says. A big-screen version of ``Neuromancer'' seems likely to
emerge eventually, ``but it's too early to talk about.''
 &HT;    As the plug is pulled on this conversation, Gibson muses on the
defining aspects of the fictional cyberspace firmament he helped
establish.
 &HT;    ``I think it derives its strength from providing us with a
metaphor for what we're actually experiencing daily,'' he says.
``In a funny way, what the concept of V.R. did was to give everyone
a really convenient handle for where we live and contemporary
media.
 &HT;    ``It's not really about the future. It's about the present.''

 &HT;     STUDY SAYS SUVs DISTORT DRIVERS' PERCEPTIONS  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ When it comes to cars, perception is everything,
and few autos on the road scream status like the sleek, stark sport
utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But perceptions can lie. A new study on the psychology of
transportation suggests that because SUV drivers sit higher from
the ground, they have the dangerous illusion of driving slower than
they really are.
</P>
<P>
   The differences can be stark: a person driving a Lincoln
Navigator going 60 mph feels the same sense of speed a Honda Civic
driver has at 40 mph, according to a mathematical formula developed
by Ron Noel of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data suggests that SUV drivers underestimate their
speed,'' said Noel, assistant director of RPI's Mind and Machines
Lab and assistant professor of philosophy, psychology and cognitive
science. ``Second of all, when it comes to cornering, it shows they
would take the corners too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be presented at the Design of Information Systems
2000 conference in New York City this August, is hardly the SUV's
first brush with controversy. Previous studies, however, have
focused on the impact of SUVs on smaller vehicles, rather than
driver perception.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
estimated that 2,000 people who died in 1996 when their cars
collided with an SUV would have survived had they crashed with
another car, even one as heavy as an SUV. A second federal study
showed that colliding with a light truck (a category including
SUVs, pickups and minivans) produced far more injury and death than
colliding with another car.
</P>
<P>
   Noel's study uses a relatively new field _ ``telepresence,''
which he describes as ``being there without being there.''
Telepresence measures people's subjective responses to real
situations.
</P>
<P>
   In this study, ``real'' meant much smaller than SUV scale. Noel
filmed a toy train going at top-speed of 3.5 mph, with cameras
attached at heights of 2, 1.5 and 1 inch above the ground. In each
case, the train went the same speed, but the subjective eye
revealed unexpected contrasts: a crawl at 2 inches, average speed
at 1.5 and a runaway train at 1.
</P>
<P>
   From his work with small toys, Noel developed a mathematical
model that could apply to vehicles of any size.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a paradox,'' he said. ``You'd expect the
higher up you are, the more you'd feel like you'd tip over going
fast. But the truth is, the closer you are to the ground, the
faster you think you're going. So when you turn, you know to slow
down to avoid tipping over.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel mused that SUV drivers' perceptions may be inherently
flawed. Statistics tend to bear him out: The traffic safety
administration showed last year that SUVs have 98 rollover deaths
per million, compared to 44 fatalities per million for all other
light vehicle types.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Tatchio, director of safety public affairs for the Ford
Motor Co., a major producer of SUVs, had little to say about Noel's
research. ``I'm really surprised to hear it,'' she said. ``But I
think we'd have to do a lot more research to say anything
conclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel, a former Jeep Cherokee driver, also was surprised by the
findings. ``There's something a little perverse to it,'' he said.
``It tells us not to trust our own perceptions.''

THIS ODD COUPLE NEEDS A DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some couples confuse you and make you wonder, ``How do
(itals)they(unitals) ever manage to stay together?'' But in the
case of Antoine Walker and Rick Pitino, the answer to the question
is simple: the NBA salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Mo Vaughn has parted ways with Dan Duquette and John
Harrington, Walker-Pitino is easily the tensest union in Boston pro
sports. At times, relationships can be summarized with words. Not
with these guys; a heart monitor would be more appropriate. Is
there frenzied activity on the screen? Or are we on the verge of
flatlining?
</P>
<P>
   Life truly is not fair, because if it were, the salary cap would
be tossed out of the equation and these two would be granted what
they both deserve: a break from each other. A permanent break. It
is no one's fault. The truth is that they are not now, and may
never be, a good fit for one another. They do an amazing job of
defending one another publicly. But it was just a little more than
two weeks ago, following a home loss to Vancouver, when they
disagreed _ again _ and had an ugly confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Are there no-fault divorces in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Pitino are both smart men. They have to realize that
if they remain employees of the Celtics, they will certainly
disagree again. Just as they did two weeks ago when they argued
over who is responsible for the team's uneven play. Just as they
did last summer when they argued about conditioning. Just as they
did in the summer of 1998 when they disagreed on how a player is to
spend his summer vacation. Just as they did in the spring of '98
when they argued after a game in which Walker had scored 43 points.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that Walker and Pitino might be the last two
people to acknowledge that they may never be winners together
again. Their familiar chorus is that they won a national
championship at Kentucky nearly four years ago, when the then
19-year-old Walker was far less mature, so why wouldn't they be
able to repeat now? But other people in the organization have at
least questioned the captain's ability to lead his team to the
playoffs, not to mention a championship.
</P>
<P>
   As the NBA lockout ended last year and teams were permitted to
sign players such as Walker to $71 million contracts, there was
some resistance among the Celtics' decision-makers. At least one of
them did not believe that Walker should be signed before the
season. The theory then was that he should be allowed to play out
the season, become a free agent, and then see what his worth would
be on the open market. (The Celtics would still be able to give him
more money than anyone else.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Pitino didn't share that opinion and signed the
6-foot-9-inch forward to the richest contract in Celtics history.
And so now the two are, for better or worse, contractually bound to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Pitino gave the Walker-Pitino Monitor a jolt.
Responding to yet another Walker trade rumor, the Celtics president
and coach said he would not trade his captain unless Michael Jordan
were included in the deal. I find that hard to believe. Forget
about Michael Jordan. If Pitino could get Michael Finley in a deal
he'd probably do it. And since we're playing the name game, I'm
sure he'd like guys named Shaquille, Kobe, Grant, Kevin, Gary, and
Tim, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino doesn't necessarily have history on his side when it
comes to quashing trade rumors. This is the same man who said he
would not trade Ron Mercer and Chauncey Billups, and that he would
take his own life before separating from Bruce Bowen. So, will he
trade Walker? I don't know. But if he plans to fulfill the
remainder of his coaching contract, he should try like hell to do
it if he cares about peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Let me make myself clear here: I do not believe that a top
player and a head coach have to like each other to be successful.
They don't even have to respect each other. What they must have is
a similar philosophy of what it takes to win. To me, that's
one-third of the problem between these two. All you have to do is
analyze their clashes to find the root of their ideological
separation.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, they cannot agree on what kind of player Walker
should be. If that were the only problem, and it isn't, I would
volunteer to be their arbiter, pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is a 6-9 power forward who happens to have good _ not
great _ ballhandling skills. He cannot play point guard. He has
made 27 percent of his 3-point attempts, so he is not a 3-point
shooter. The fact that he has already attempted 172 3s should be an
embarassment to him and Pitino. He is quicker than most power
forwards and can easily snake around most of them (see Shawn Kemp)
for easy points. It boggles the mind that the Celtics' offense
calls for him to be so far away from the hoop so frequently.
</P>
<P>
   It would also help Pitino and Walker immensely if there were an
accomplished veteran on the roster, someone such as Terry Cummings
or Rick Mahorn. As the Patriots learned this season, you cannot
measure the locker room impact of thoughtful pros who can still
contribute, even if their best days are behind them. The Celtics'
most senior veterans are Pervis Ellison and Dana Barros. Pitino has
all but dismissed the former and doesn't rely enough on the
expertise of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   One issue, though, is inescapable. The coach and the player are
this city's odd couple. Not odd as in eccentric, but odd as in not
professionally compatible. One of them will have to leave the
other. And when that happens, both of them will be happier men
because of it.

LAWYER SEEKS JUSTICE FOR ALL _ EVEN ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A floppy-eared dog takes the stand, fingers his collar
for air and with a knowing guilt eyes Exhibit A: a chewed-up shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The caption: ``Coming soon to a courtroom near you . . . The
burgeoning field of animal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon lampoons Steven Wise's life's work yet it's one of
his favorites. And if the Needham lawyer succeeds in persuading
courts to grant animals the same legal rights as people, what now
seems farcical could become a fact of legal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's easy to make fun of what I do,'' says Wise, who
doesn't discount the prospect of animals actually testifying in
courtrooms. ``It's a good thing, though, I have a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the longtime animal-rights activist it's no laughing
matter. Neither is it for Harvard Law School. Long a fringe
subject, Wise has begun lecturing Harvard law students on
animal-rights law.
</P>
<P>
   Wise and attorneys from around the country have recently set out
to expand existing laws that protect animals from cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Through lawsuits and scholarship drawing on scientific
developments that show animals have far higher levels of cognition
than previously thought, the lawyers are trying to raze the legal
wall distinguishing people from animals. Unlike people, animals are
now considered property and have no rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the animal-rights movement has made progress in the past
decade. In 1994, all but six states considered cruelty to animals a
misdemeanor and punished it with small fines and short jail
sentences. Today, at least 27 states consider the violations
felonies and set fines as high as $100,000 and prison terms as long
as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the animal-law movement, which include people in the
pharmaceutical industry and livestock groups, often deride animal
law as the brainchild of tree-hugging, fur-loathing vegetarians.
They worry that serious legal reforms could wreak havoc on courts,
jeopardize medical tests that use animals, and set dangerous
precedents that could lead to legal limits on everything from
plucking fruit off trees to breathing in bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is not so much that a class is being offered; it's
just the implications of what is being taught,'' said Kay Johnson,
vice president of the Animal Industry Foundation, a national
livestock and poultry group. ``It could be very dangerous to open
loopholes allowing people to sue on behalf of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Johnson and other critics'
</P>
<P>
   concerns, animal law is an increasingly popular class. About a
dozen law schools offer classes in animal law, including the
University of Vermont, Georgetown University, and the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Student interest in this subject has brought it to the
forefront of our attention,'' said Alan Ray, assistant dean for
academic affairs at Harvard Law School. ``The scholarship in this
area has been growing in the last few years and students took an
active role in researching background on faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   The students starting Wise's class are not in for an effortless
elective, either.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old professor, who has taught animal law at Vermont
Law School and Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine, has prepared an
eight-page syllabus that will compel students to consider
everything from what it means to be an animal to why humans deserve
moral rights while ``non-human'' animals don't.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, a former president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund who
published last month ``Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for
Animals,'' will also take his students through the mounting animal
case law, which include recent court victories such as a federal
appeals court decision in 1998 to give a zoo visitor the right to
sue so chimpanzees are not left alone in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   Rummaging through stacks of journal and newspaper articles in
his book-lined basement, as his cat, Alice, paws across his
shoulders, Wise explains how he plans to persuade courts to bolster
animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Before pushing the boundary with dolphins, dogs and cats, he
hopes courts will accept his arguments that chimpanzees should have
rights to bodily integrity and liberty, meaning it would violate
the law to restrict their movement or conduct tests on primates.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he hopes courts will ban such practices as required
euthanasia for dogs biting people and other severe reprisals
against wayward pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not trifling issues,'' he said. ``People care about
animals. Pets are often considered family. There is still a lot of
work to do.''

ENERGETIC AIDE PROVIED A TIMELY BOOST FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ As Vice President Al Gore emerged victorious in
New Hampshire, his success was due in no small part to a scrapper
from Dorchester with a gravel-rough voice and a superstitious view
of the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, top officials in the Gore campaign _ and even the vice
president himself _ credit Michael J. Whouley with Gore's sizable
win in the Iowa caucuses as well as the turnaround of a troubled
candidacy here. Both states are essential proving grounds on the
road to clinching the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``His assignment was Iowa and New Hampshire,'' Gore said,
sitting at the breakfast counter of the River View Cafe in Milford,
sipping coffee during an interview last weekend. ``You know, if you
assign somebody those two tasks, you've got to have somebody who is
completely and totally reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore credited Whouley with the Iowa win. Now he's bound to get
some credit for the New Hampshire win, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so incredibly focused that when he sets out for the
achievement of a particular objective, book it,'' Gore said.
``Don't waste any further time worrying about whether or not that
objective will be reached. If he says he's aimed at it and he's
going to do it, just book it, it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whouley, 40, got his political start in 1979, running Ward 15 in
Dorchester for Joseph Timilty's campaign against Kevin White, the
Boston mayor. Since that time, he has run two statewide field
operations for Senator John F. Kerry; he ran three states for
Michael S. Dukakis during the 1988 presidential race; he served as
Bill Clinton's national field director during the 1992 general
election; and he was Gore's campaign manager in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he's on leave from his Boston public-strategies firm,
Dewey Square Associates, where he represents AT&AMP;T, Northwest
Airlines, and Save the Harbor/Save the Bay, among others.
</P>
<P>
   This past year may stand as out as his most tumultuous. On Aug.
18, he and his wife, Sally Kerans, the former Danvers state
representative, moved to Washington with their daughter, Nora, 4,
and newborn son, Peter, so Whouley could work on the Gore campaign.
Six weeks later, the vice president announced he was moving his
headquarters to Nashville. Whouley has been shuttling between
Nashville, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Washington ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Sept. 5 when the real earthquake hit: A Boston
Globe/WBZ poll unexpectedly showed Gore in a dead heat with Bill
Bradley in New Hampshire, catching the campaign off guard. Gore's
campaign chairman, Tony Coehlo, dispatched Whouley to New Hampshire
to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whouley sort of said, `Houston, we have a problem,' ''
recalled Carter Eskew, Gore's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Whouley began meeting with Gore's top supporters here, including
Joe Keefe and Chris Dermer, as well as Nick Baldick, the state
director. They poured out their misgivings about a campaign that
was treating New Hampshire as if it were California or New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt he wasn't really known up here, and he wasn't
connecting with people,'' Keefe said of Gore, who at one time
stayed behind rope lines, always had royal blue drapery for a
backdrop, and never met a podium he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   It was Whouley's idea to cut Gore free of his script, depositing
him in front of undecided voters and answering any and all
questions for as long as it took. The ``open meetings'' were a hit,
and Gore said he intends to continue them after leaving New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cite the date Michael Whouley took over as the date
our comeback began,'' Keefe said, praising Whouley for insisting
that Gore engage in the one-on-one, Main Street type of campaigning
that New Hampshire voters expect.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiously smoking a cigarette behind Mary Ann's Diner here while
Gore was inside campaigning on Sunday, Whouley brushed off all
kudos. He said he considers the very idea of an article about him
``bad karma'' for the campaign. And he lauds Baldick, Governor
Jeanne Shaheen, Keefe, and too many others to name for making
Gore's candidacy here competitive once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't rocket science,'' Whouley said. ``It was what the
folks in New Hampshire had been asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also problems in Iowa, where an aura of complacency
had set in. Sensing an opening, Bradley poured $2 million into
television advertising there, while spending twice as many days
campaigning there as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Whouley moved in full time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his energy was spent persuading others not to believe
polls that showed Gore easily beating Bradley and lecturing on the
difficulty of motivating voters to go to a caucus and talk, rather
than to a polling place to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told people by the end of the caucuses I didn't want to talk
to him anymore because he's depressing me,'' Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore beat Bradley in Iowa by 28 percentage points,
and Whouley returned to New Hampshire, where he continued to
caution against irrational exuberance in light of numerous polls
giving Gore the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of Irish superstition,'' he said, explaining his
approach to campaigns. ``No matter where you are, you should wake
up in the morning like you're five points behind, and if you work
real hard, you can pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Whouley can return to his family in Washington _ he's been
away since Jan. 2 _ and await his next assignment.

 2000 NISSAN FRONTIER CREW CAB: TIME FOR A CHANGE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an example of how fast things are changing in the auto
industry, you have to go only as far as the new Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Models that once had a showroom life of five years _ or seven
for many trucks _ are now evolving in about half that time.
Nissan's Frontier pickup trucks, particularly its four-door Crew
Cab, are glaring examples.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier, rigid framed and rough riding, was introduced in
1997. Last year, the Crew Cab, the first compact pickup with four
full doors and a real back seat, came to market. Already, Nissan
has acknowledged, the line has to be overhauled. Things are
changing that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan had hoped to get to 2004 with the Frontier platform but
now it's looking for a remake by 2002, and if they want to stay
competitive in a pickup market that has become a caldron of change,
they'd better make that date.
</P>
<P>
   The platform has been leapfrogged, its engine _ 170 horses from
a V6 _ is too weak in a market where power sells, and others _
Dodge Dakota, Toyota Tundra, Ford F150 SuperCab _ have blown by the
Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier Crew Cab is a competent truck, but that's not good
enough anymore. And that's too bad, because stepping out first with
the four-door concept was cutting edge at the time. But it
unfortunately melded that four-door cab, and a tiny bed, with
outdated technology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, other trucks offer far more power, more comfort, a better
ride, and much larger beds.
</P>
<P>
   What does work in Nissan's Xterra _ going retro as a basic SUV _
doesn't work in its truck, which competes in a category where
consumers want truck capabilities coupled with car-like comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the motor. One-hundred-seventy horsepower out
of a V6 is simply not enough _ and it only got 17 miles per gallon
in a week of driving. Nissan makes a truly great V6 that cranks out
222 horsepower and puts it in the Maxima. This truck could use an
engine like that.
</P>
<P>
   It's got decent torque at low RPMs _ up to around 1,600 _ but
the curve flattens fast after that. It'll get your load or your
trailer rolling nicely from a start, but leave you chugging up any
steep grades.
</P>
<P>
   That roar you hear from the engine as you climb? It's not the
comforting rumble of power. It's the sound of an engine working too
hard as the four-speed automatic downshifts to maintain speed.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is still a basic box, square in a day of round, smooth
corners. The bed is only 54.7 inches long. Try carrying lumber in
that. A good option is a bed extender (about $225).
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it doesn't get much better.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is decent room in the rear for three adults, and
though the rear doors are a bit narrow, getting in and out is not
the chore it can be in some trucks with rear seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the seats aren't comfortable. The front buckets are flat and
don't offer much support.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments look cheap and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   I understand this is a truck, and Nissan is trying to sell it at
a good price ($17,000 to upward of $21,000), but folks are looking
for more than utility these days, and when it comes to trucks,
they'll pay extra for comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at a good price they offer ABS, air conditioning, full
carpets, a sliding rear window, and a center console with sliding
armrest. But it's all only a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota learned _ after the T100 _ that people want more and so
produced the Tundra, a V8 that is whisper smooth and rolling off
showroom floors as fast as it can be built, even at $5,000 or more
above the Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier Crew Cab is available in both two-wheel- and
four-wheel-drive (I tested the two-wheel version) and puts both
models on the rigid 4WD frame.
</P>
<P>
   For suspension, it's got double wishbone, shocks and stabilizer
bar up front, a rigid axle with multileaf springs and stabilizer at
the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan says this is meant to give it a car-like ride. I say it
rides like a truck. On frost heaves and ridged cement stretches of
highway, the empty bed did a skip-to-ma-loo all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has a fine history in producing trucks, all the way back
to when they were called Datsun. In 1959, they introduced the first
compact pickup in America. In 1975, it was the first long-bed
pickup. Two years later, they made some room behind the front seat
and rolled out the first King Cab. In 1999 it was the four-door,
compact pickup.
</P>
<P>
   But Nissan is a company that got either cautious or stagnant or
both, and today it is in the midst of trying to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   They've said they are looking for a fast makeover of three
models, the Altima, the wonderful Maxima, which has been criticized
only for its looks, and the Frontier series.
</P>
<P>
   And like Toyota, they have a full-size V8 pickup in their
sights, scheduled for the 2003 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is capable of building fine cars and trucks, and if
you're a loyalist, I say give them some time to bounce back from a
less-than-glistening time of design and development.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The bar that runs beneath the driver's seat, which you can
feel every time you hit a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The overall cab design is very nice, offering easy access and
lots of room in a compact truck.

SEEING OPPORTUNITY IN FILENE'S BASEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Value City Department Stores Inc., the Ohio-based retailer that
may be ready to announce a deal to buy ailing Filene's Basement
Corp., has enjoyed recent success by repositioning itself as a sort
of hybrid _ a store that is part Wal-Mart, part deparment store,
and part what Filene's Basement was in its heyday, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to give the best value on quality merchandise
to our middle-class customers,'' said a Value City spokesman who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor a Filene's Basement spokeswoman would comment on
the imminence of a possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we have not reached a deal with Value City or
anyone else,'' said Nancy Sterling of Filene's Basement, which has
been in bankruptcy protection since August.
</P>
<P>
   Value City traces its roots to a store founded by the
Schottenstein family in 1909. For much of its history, the retailer
stayed close to its home in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But since becoming a public company in 1991 _ the Schottenstein
family continues to own a majority interest and Jay L.
Schottenstein serves as Value City's chairman and chief executive _
the company has expanded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most retailers, which cluster stores within a small
geography, Value City presides over a fairly far-flung empire for a
regional retailer with $1.67 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Value City operates two chains that together have about 160
stores in more than 15 states. Besides the department store chain,
there's a chain known as DSW Shoe Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   To plug holes in a company map that stretches from Missouri to
New Jersey and even to Massachusetts in DSW's case, Value City has
been aggressively pursuing an acquisition strategy of buying small
chains on the cheap and folding them into the Value City empire,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But Value City could be ``interested in something that will give
them an immediate entree into a new market'' for less money than it
would cost to open new stores, said analyst Jeffrey S. Stein of
McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Value City is very ``opportunistic,'' always on the prowl ``for
the best deals,'' said chairman Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz &AMP;
Associates Inc., a New York retail consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunism may be part of the Schottenstein family philosophy.
The family also has ties to firms that sometimes buy the inventory
of retailers going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Value City's Department Stores are mostly free-standing big-box
stores with a footprint of about 87,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are nearly 60 DSW Shoe Warehouse stores, including
one in Framingham, Mass.. These roughly 25,000-square-foot stores
are comparable in size to some Filene's Basement satellite stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a separate business, the Schottenstein family also operates a
chain of Value City Furniture stores.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Value City Department Stores has viewed an
acquisition as a ``real estate transaction,'' said analyst Stein.
In other words, the nameplate of the acquired store often
disappears and management is replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But a Filene's Basement deal, if it happens, could be different
story, partly because in the last few years Value City has tried to
become more fashion-conscious, something Filene's Basement once
excelled at.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Filene's Basement name is so well-known in New
England, a possible deal could have Value City retaining the
Basement name and some of its management as well as opening some
new Filene's Basement stores, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Value City hasn't always been known for fashion. For much of the
early and mid-1990s, Value City tried to ``out Wal-Mart Wal-Mart,''
and it lost some of its focus, said Davidowitz.
</P>
<P>
   To improve performance, Value City brought in a new management
team just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, most of Value City's apparel department was crammed
with no-name merchandise. Now Value City offers a much broader
selection of branded goods at low prices, the retail formula that
Filene's Basement pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has now evolved into a sort of hybrid, Davidowitz
said. It's partly a discount store similar to Wal-Mart. There's
some resemblance to a department store and also to an offprice
store, such as Filene's Basement that sells department store brand
names at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   This ``unique'' one-stop-shopping mix allows Value City to
differentiate itself from the competition, Davidowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Value City also sells home furnishings and sporting
goods, the biggest chunk of its sales comes from apparel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in the New York Post, Value City also has
expressed some interest in Loehmann's Inc. In many ways, Loehmann's
is similar to Filene's Basement. Both offer fashionable brand-name
clothing at lower prices. Both are operating in bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's also is known for fashion, but primarily for women's
fashion. Filene's Basement is known for fashion both in women's and
men's clothing, and that may be one reason Value City may find the
Basement more attractive, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, uniting Filene's Basement's fashion flair to Value
City's greater size and strong management team could make the Ohio
retailer even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   For the most recent quarter Value City reported, profits nearly
doubled to $7.7 million. Sales increased 23.7 percent to $441.3
million. For the month of January, sales at stores open more than a
year were up 20 percent. And since the new management team took
over, Value City's stock price has nearly doubled, up 9/16
Wednesday to close at 15 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Said analyst Stein: ``They really execute well.''

BANK'S VENTURES ARE ADVENTUROUS, IT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The stock market loves the venture capital business. How else
do you explain the incredible values attached to companies like
CMGI and Internet Capital Group, both of which invest in Internet
start-ups?
</P>
<P>
   But take that same venture business, stick it inside a
commercial bank, and investors lose interest fast.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. has been trying to change the market's
attitude. For the past month, Chase has been talking about its
private equity business, a blend of venture capital and buyout
deals, which is far and away the biggest one like it in the banking
world. Boiled down to basics, the Chase argument goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great unappreciated business here. You guys all
think we are a boring old-economy company, but the truth is we are
big players in the cool new economy. Our stock price should reflect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, FleetBoston Financial is saying ``Us too.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to private equity, FleetBoston is not in the same
league as Chase. The New York bank has a $7 billion portfolio,
compared to FleetBoston's $2.5 billion. But according to analysts,
FleetBoston is a strong player in the next rank of banks, which
includes Wells Fargo and Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of underlying value there that is not reflected
in their stock,'' Andrew Collins, an analyst at ING Barings, said
of FleetBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the operation came to the bank through last year's
merger with BankBoston. BancBoston Capital has been in the private
equity business since 1959, practically the Pleistocene Age for
this industry. The bank invests its own money in exchange for
ownership stakes in new and emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio has plenty of ``old economy'' holdings, but last
year more than 25 percent of the $800 million the bank invested
went into ``new economy'' companies in health care,
telecommunications, and Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   As of September, the bank's Internet holdings included Internet
Capital Group, Allaire, Viant, and Silknet Software. The stock
prices of Allaire and Viant are up sixfold since their initial
public offerings; Silknet is up tenfold; Internet Capital Group,
almost twentyfold.
</P>
<P>
   As a venture investor, the bank bought shares in all those
companies at a fraction of the IPO prices. BancBoston Capital's
president, Rick Fritz, won't say how much the bank made on any one
deal. But ``last year was our best year ever, by any measure you
use,'' he readily conceded.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston earned $212 million in the private equity business
in 1999. On top of that, the bank says it's sitting on more than $1
billion of unrealized gains in its portfolio. In other words, over
time, as the bank sells its holdings, those earnings should make
their way to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``BancBoston Capital is one of the best, no question,'' said
Steven Galanate, publisher of Private Equity Analyst, a Wellesley
newsletter. Galante likes the fact that the bank's portfolio is
diversified by industry and geopgraphy. This year, the bank expects
to invest $300 million in Europe. Over time, it also expects to
increase its investments in South America, where the old Bank of
Boston is a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Chase's publicity campaign, FleetBoston is starting
to toot its own horn a bit. At a recent Salomon Smith Barney
conference, bank executives talked about their ``new economy''
credentials, pointing to earnings from private equity, investment
bank Robertson Stephens, discount broker Quick &AMP; Reilly, and loans
to emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't have a dot-com behind our name there is a
sense that we have missed out on the new economy. Quite the
opposite is true,'' said Gene McQuade, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, talk isn't necessarily cheap. Since it began
boosting its venture business, Chase's stock price has climbed
smartly. Over the same time, FleetBoston's stock price hasn't
climbed at all. It sells for a distinctly ``old economy'' multiple
of 10 times earnings. FleetBoston has a market value of about $28
billion, roughly the same as CMGI's. FleetBoston earned over $2
billion last year; CMGI lost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture businesses at the banks are ridiculously
undervalued, compared to their pure-play competitors,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even analysts who are less enthusiastic than Collins say
FleetBoston deserves better. ``I don't think they are getting the
bang for the buck that they should,'' said Tom Finucane, of John
Hancock's Regional Bank Fund.
</P>
<P>
   McQuade doesn't expect Wall Street to change its mind overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the frustrations all of us have who work within
large corporate shells,'' he said. ``The challenge we have is to
get people to understand exactly how we participate in the new
economy.''

A CHEMISTRY LESSON WITH GARRY MARSHALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Rob Lowman's weekly video column. Note ITALICS below) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who ever would've thought that a romantic-comedy about a
Hollywood hooker and a corporate raider would work? Not only work,
but turn out to be a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds preposterous on the surface. But Garry Marshall, who
directed the 1990 hit ``Pretty Woman,'' starring Julia Roberts and
Richard Gere, and paired them again in last summer's smash
``Runaway Bride,'' has the formula _ chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say my great direction, or a great script ...
but I think casting is really what makes a great romantic comedy,''
says the gregarious Marshall. ``If the two stars have chemistry,
you can shoot it many different ways, but if the two stars don't
have chemistry, they can take their clothes off, run around naked,
and people won't stay (to watch).''
</P>
<P>
   Both films are now out on DVD editions that contain commentary
from the director, who has a list of TV credits _ including
``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' _ too long to mention, as well as having
directed a number of other films. (His underappreciated ``The
Flamingo Kid'' recently came out on DVD, too.)
</P>
<P>
   And while Marshall points out that tension is also important to
a romantic comedy (``It's all about kissing _ or almost kissing''),
he knows which element he'd choose among direction, script or
stars. ``I'd say get the stars. They don't even have to be stars.
When Richard and Julia were making `Pretty Woman,' they weren't big
stars, like `Runaway Bride' stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, begs the question of what he saw in Roberts to
cast her. At the time, the actress had been in ``Steel Magnolias''
and ``Mystic Pizza'' but was hardly a star.
</P>

   ``I was screen-testing her with a bunch of other girls, and I
thought she was very special. I liked her personally,'' says
Marshall. ``She made me laugh, but I couldn't get it (on screen).
So I tested her with a very funny actor named Charles Grodin. And I
told her that this guy is going to be funnier than the other
actors, and he's not going to stick to the script, so see if you
can hold your own. And that's when I first saw her do things that I
had never seen her do, and I knew how to capture it (on film), and
that made her very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   And that chemistry thing? Marshall says he took Roberts to New
York to meet Gere. ``It was just the three of us, and I saw that
there was something going on that could be captured on film.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's instincts proved right _ millions of box-office
dollars over.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing them back together for ``Runaway Bride'' was a
different story. The chemistry was there, but directing busy, big
stars is different, Marshall admits. ``But I thought our
relationship was the same between `action' and `cut.'''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he tried to do in ``Runaway Bride'' was exploit
Roberts' comic abilities. ``I told her, `You didn't run and jump
much in `Notting Hill.' Let's go back to some of the physical stuff
you used to do ...' I thought that people would like to see that
again from her. Dragging the kid up the aisle, everyone pooh-poohed
except her and me ... but it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that even suave Gere wanted to do physical humor. So
they devised a scene where Gere would run crazily across an open
field because his character was afraid of snakes.
</P>
<P>
   But ever the wag, Marshall asked Gere first, ``Did you ever run

<P>
   SUVs and ABS, refrigerators and washing machines, clutches and
skid control, gloves and gouging, speed limits, fun, and flattery.
You hit me with everything but the kitchen sink in your most recent
letters and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Provocation can be productive. Insults can be illuminating.
Banter is best. Here's to rounded repartee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why don't you just come out and admit that you hate SUVs?
Today's article was ridiculous. SUVs are top heavy . . . no
kidding. They don't handle like cars . . . wow, what a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   A. Got to admit, you nailed me on that one. I hate SUVs. But I
wonder, if all this is so obvious, why do so many people insist on
driving them as if they were not top heavy and as if they perform
like low-slung cars?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It is clear from your first few columns this year that you
love SUVs and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   A. Got to admit, you nailed me on that one. I love SUVs. In
truth, many of them are fine vehicles _ my family cars are a
Chevrolet Suburban and a Toyota Tundra pickup truck. SUVs have
their proper uses; trucks have their proper uses. As with any
vehicle, it's who is behind the wheel that matters most. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say you hope that ``someday, somewhere, I see a trooper
pull over a car on the highway because the driver was going so slow
(55 or 65 in the passing lane) and impeding the normal flow of
traffic. Do you understand what you are saying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I am saying that sometimes common sense ought to prevail
over letter of the law. If an entire highway is flowing at 70-75
miles an hour, and someone gets into the passing lane and
single-handedly tries to enforce the law, that person is a yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please stick to your grocery list, 10 top washing machines,
10 top refrigerators, 10 top garbage disposals _ you get my drift?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, my Florida buddy, who keeps suggesting that I don't know
anything about cars. What, too much time on your hands from sunrise
until that Early Bird Special at Denny's? Maybe we can compromise.
After all, Sears once made motorcycles, International Harvester
made refrigerators, and the new Saab has a refrigerated glove
compartment. I see a kitchen appliance/automotive triathalon in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say that you base your reviews of cars on what sort of
driver the car is intended for. You should provide considered and
expert advice, not mouth what people want to hear or to make an
advertising point.
</P>
<P>
   A. As far as I am concerned, considered and expert advice takes
into account both the intent for which a car is designed and the
type of driver who might buy that car. Advertising is a whole other
part of this newspaper, and while I will listen to readers complain
about what I write, the folks in advertising get a deaf ear from me
in that regard. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am old enough to remember the panning of the VW Bug by many
automobile writers, including, to its everlasting shame, Consumer
Reports.
</P>
<P>
   A. I like old Bugs. But try to imagine this today: A new car is
introduced. It has a front end that is nothing more than hollow box
that crumples on impact. Inside that box is a tank full of
gasoline. It has a steering column that is a spear in front-end
collisions. Now, try to sell it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I agree with your review on the Volkswagen Eurovan. It can't
compete with better vans being made. Why don't they just build a
minivan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Volkswagen is considering just that _ bringing back a
nostalgic version of the Microbus. But they've got to overcome one
serious design problem: how to keep that distinctive flat nose and
still pass modern head-on crash tests. My guess is they will do it.
Look what they did with the New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I still consider the glove box to be an anachronism. How many
decades has it been since anyone has seen a pair of gloves in a
glove box?
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree. Let's see if we can't come up with a better name for
that hole in the dash. Stuffbox? Thingholder? Reader input welcome
here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I don't like auto writers who get so jaded they overemphasize
``fun'' in cars, which effectively translates to turbo-charged
engines and low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   A. I was jaded long before I got this job, but I do consider
``fun'' to be a factor that many people consider when buying a car.
Still, it doesn't have to mean big power and high-performance
tires. Three of the most ``fun'' cars I drove last year: the Ford
Focus, the Mazda Miata, and the Xterra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was surprised by your comments on SUV price gouging. If
consumers are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars extra for
a gussied-up truck, that's their problem.
</P>
<P>
   A. True, it's their problem. But long range goodwill is wasted
by dealers who gouge folks $3,000-$10,000 for a car and those same
folks see their neighbors buying the same car a year later at true
cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We almost purchased a Nissan Xterra, but when we went back to
finally buy we were told that the price that had been written down
was ``incorrect'' and it suddenly was $2,000 higher.
</P>
<P>
   A. And how would you have felt had you paid that extra $2,000
and found out your neighbor got it elsewhere at MSRP? Bet that
would be your last Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of you wrote to say that I have mentioned ``skid
control'' in reviews of certain cars and some wondered if it helps
you steer. Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Skid control does not ``steer'' you through a turn. Instead, it
applies front and rear brakes, individually, to reduce the rotation
of some tires while letting others gain speed. This controls yaw
and keeps one corner of your vehicle from trying to get ahead of
another. Computers do the work, you just drive.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent question is whether ABS can stop a car as
quickly as a system that locks up all four brakes and keeps them
that way until it comes to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   There's a swap going on. Straight ahead on a dry road, four
wheels locked up will stop a car faster than ABS, which modulates
braking from wheel-to-wheel so that no wheel locks. Seldom are you
doing an emergency stop under perfect conditions, so the trade-off
_ a slight bit of stopping distance for far more control _ is well
worth it. You can steer a car while its ABS brakes are jammed on;
without ABS, you are steering a log.

BLACK PLANET: Facing Race During an NBA Season 
By David Shields 
Crown, 223 pp. $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talented writers have followed a big-time basketball team
through a single season before _ David Halberstam and John
Feinstein come to mind _ but surely none has produced a more
bizarre eyewitness account than David Shields has, in his often
tortured, occasionally hilarious chronicle of the Seattle
Supersonics during the 1994-95 NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   In a book that purports to say profound things about
professional sports and racial consciousness in America, and
sometimes succeeds in doing so, Shields ends up saying a good deal
more _ perhaps more than anyone wants to know _ about his own
tortured psyche, the depths of his obsessive fandom, his fawning
over athletes as self-involved as he is, the burden of his white
man's guilt, the view from the NBA cheap seats, and Shields' sex
life with his wife, an accounting of which takes ``hoop dreams''
into what one can only hope are previously uncharted waters. If
you're a basketball fan, beware: This book is at once sillier and
more serious than any 10 other hoop books you're likely to run
across. A cult classic in search of a cult.
</P>
<P>
   During the season in question, the Sonics, led by guard Gary
Payton and forward Shawn Kemp, posted a record of 57-25 and lost to
the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. For most
fans, end of story. What happened on the court, however, is almost
incidental to what Shields, a novelist and professor at the
University of Washington, aims to get at through his diary of the
team's fortunes. His deeper concern _ the whole conceit of the
book, in fact _ is what white fans think about black athletes, and
vice-versa (envy, scorn, arrogance). It is a topic to which Shields
brings a degree of self-consciousness that, while admirable for its
candor, often reads like a parody of pop psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Shields began the season by applying for regular press
credentials _ and was rebuffed by team management, on the
not-unreasonable grounds that he is not really covering the team
for any entity other than for himself. Forced to buy a pair of
season tickets, he spent much of the season dueling with the
Sonics' PR department _ now he has a pressbox seat, now he doesn't
_ while desperately trying to sell his unused tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, a trash-talking guard on his way to NBA stardom, became
the author's idol and substitute ID as the season unfolded, much as
footballer Frank Gifford did for the narrator of Frederick Exley's
novel ``A Fan's Notes.'' ``Utterly narcissistic,'' as Shields
lovingly describes him, Payton with his flashy style of play and
sharp tongue off the court ``force(d) the racial subtext out in the
open'' while creating, in Shields' mind, anyway, ``a very strong,
very strange, utterly hallucinatory bond'' with the author himself.
No doubt very strange to Payton, anyway, who never gave Shields the
time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Refused all interview requests by other Sonics as well, Shields
gamely hung in there, building his narrative almost entirely out of
found objects. Snippets of sports-talk shows, bits of postgame
radio analysis, game stories from the local newspapers,
conversations overheard in the supermarket and post office _ all
become grist for Shields's racial mill. His take on basketball and
race seemingly boils down to a few points: that society is obsessed
with black-white issues, whether it admits that or not; that every
reference to skin color, however innocuous, merely scratches the
surface of America's festering racial anxiety; and that power and
sexual potency are the two principal subtexts to the racial
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, he writes, is ``a place where, without ever
acknowledging it _ and because it's never acknowledged, it's that
much more potent and telling _ white fans and black players enact
and quietly explode virtually every racial issue and tension in the
culture at large. Race, the league's taboo topic, is the league's
true subject.'' Taboo topic? Not if you read other authors on the
subject of NBA basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Shields asks, ``Is race on my brain, or am I screwed
up? Or is it on everyone else's brain, and am I just taking
notes?''
</P>
<P>
   Readers are free to draw their own conclusions _ ``Black
Planet'' is a book that will either grab you or leave you lusting
for old Celtics-Lakers highlight tapes _ but Shields's note-taking
is idiosyncratic, to say the least. He and his wife do not just
watch the Super Bowl telecast, for instance, they ``watch ourselves
watch the Super Bowl.'' Such an observation poses the question:
What was the over/under on self-referential questions in the
Shields household during the three-hour broadcast?

MP3.COM'S COOL NEW SERVICE THREATENS MUSIC INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Michael Robertson. With his prep-school sartorial style and
his eager aura, he looks like he's selling chances for the senior
class raffle at, say, Deerfield Academy. But Robertson is pitching
something else entirely. The CEO of the Internet start-up MP3.com
is promising to drag the music business _ and anyone who will hear
his spiel _ into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so cool,'' he begins, ``it's going to blow you away.''
He borrows a CD (the Foo Fighters's ``The Color and the Shape'')
and pops it into my computer. One click of the mouse and _ voila! _
the music is instantly available in his on-line music account at
MP3.com. He can listen to it on any computer with Internet access,
any time, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's very cool, much faster and more readily accessible
than other systems that allow you to store digital music files
(called MP3s) on line. You can also purchase CDs from on-line music
vendors and receive a virtual copy in your MP3.com account days
before the CD itself actually arrives on your doorstep. Here's how
it works: MP3.com has compiled a library of 45,000 CDs; when you
purchase a CD or place your own CD into the system, it gives you
access to their digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one little problem with the Foo Fighters episode.
And what would that be, Mr. Robertson? ``It is piracy,'' Robertson,
32, says, his usually determined voice rising to an almost
evangelical roar. ``People are copying CDs like crazy out there.
The question is: How do you create a system that is as secure as
possible?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is the question (no doubt the Foo Fighters would
agree). It's also the focus of a copyright infringement lawsuit
filed against MP3.com last week by the Recording Industry
Association of America and the major record labels. For the past
year, the association has had litigation fever, trying to use the
courts to stop the inevitable spread of digital music distribution
over the Internet. It hasn't had much luck, and legal experts
contend that the music industry group doesn't have much chance of
winning this latest lawsuit, either.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just a case of the musclebound music industry
behemoths taking on the scrawny techno-geeks. (MP3.com went public
last year, and despite losses of $36 million in 1999, the company
is worth almost $2 billion on the stock exchange.) The MP3.com
situation is brewing as the $40 billion music business is
struggling to redefine itself in the midst of unprecedented change.
Upstarts like MP3.com are using new technologies to market and
distribute music on the Internet, tapping into territory recently
controlled by the major record companies. At first, the majors
attempted to stop the rate of change by suing these new start-ups,
but that hasn't worked. Now in addition to filing suit, the big
guys are running around playing catchup, trying to figure out how
to adapt to the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, in fact, is the driving force behind the recent
merger mania in the music business. The America Online-Time Warner
marriage is a no-brainer for the entertainment conglomerate, which
was flailing about trying to create a presence in cyberspace. Time
Warner _ and its subsidiary, Warner Music _ can provide what's
called ``content'' for AOL's subscription base. Likewise, Time
Warner's recent marriage with EMI Group gives the combined company
a gigantic music catalogue _ as in, Madonna meets the Beach Boys.
Internet companies are starving for content, and the two struggling
companies are aiming to gain more clout by joining forces.
</P>
<P>
   One former industry insider isn't impressed. ``They're just
circling their wagons,'' says Al Teller, a former record company
executive who is founder of the Internet music start-up, Atomic
Pop. ``They can all combine into one big major, but this revolution
is going to happen and they're not going to be able to control it.
They may control a huge catalogue, but they're never going to
control the individual artist.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they're not ready to join the revolution, they can still
try to postpone it. ``There is a legitimate fear of piracy, but
there is also a fear of being rendered obsolete,'' says Mark
Lemley, a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``They're afraid of being left out of the loop, and what
they should really be doing is coming up with their own ways of
distributing music on line.''
</P>
<P>
   And MP3.com's ``very cool'' service may foreshadow be the future
of the music industry. It's free  &UR; today &LR; , but Robertson is hoping
to turn it into a subscription service some day. Consumers will pay
for music the same way they pay for cable television, and as the
technology develops, it will be ubiquitious. `` &UR; Today &LR;  it's the PC,
but  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  it's your Palm Pilot, your cell phone, your watch,''
he says, holding his wristwatch to his ear like a digital Dick
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Robertson is a visionary: Former industry insiders
who have launched Internet music ventures agree that the old ways
of music distribution (as in record stores) are doomed to become
obsolete. But there's that little piracy problem. Marc Geiger, a
founder of Lollapalooza who is now CEO of the Internet start-up
Artistdirect.com, has long championed the concept of a subscription
service like the one Robertson is offering. ``It's an exciting
idea, but you can't just screw the artist. You can't just screw the
industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But MP3.com has, in fact, taken some steps to prevent piracy.
Users can only listen to the music on a computer; they can't
download it to a portable MP3 player. Also, all user accounts are
protected by passwords; no two users can listen to the same account
at the same time. And you must either purchase a new CD or have an
actual physical copy of one (as opposed to a computer file) to add
the music to your account. But we saw what happened with the Foo
Fighters CD, didn't we? What's to stop the kids in the dorm from
passing one CD around to every room on the hall?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, answers Robertson. That's not his problem. ``Piracy
happens all the time.'' And he operates at Internet speed: He's not
about to wait for the plodding recording industry to come up with
some failproof security system to protect artists. ``We are
building the railroad system to run the music,'' he says. ``We
don't own the music. We don't own the rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the recording industry's point. But legal
experts contend that the industry would have to sue all the
individuals who violate the copyright law, not the company that
provides the conduit to make it possible. ``These lawsuits are
futile,'' says Lemley. ``They're not going to stop the music from
going on line.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the dilemma. Everybody's right, and everybody's
wrong. Companies like MP3.com (and another fledgling start-up
called Napster.com) are forcing change by launching music
distribution systems that challenge the status quo, yet they're not
exactly protecting artists' rights, despite their protestations to
the contrary. And the record industry folks say they are the
champions of artists' rights, even as they use whatever means
possible to protect the power that enables them to milk profits out
of the artists they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like an industry in need of an overhaul? You
bet. But the only thing certain is that change is inevitable.
``There will be events that push this revolution forward, and some
of them of them are going to be ugly,'' says Geiger. So what's the
motto of this revolution? Liberty, egality, piracy? Or give MP3 a
chance?

PRIME TIME FOR LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ There are no live penguins at the Jacob Javits
Center. Not like the Linux trade show in San Jose last August,
where a hapless pair of flightless birds was forced to stroll among
badly dressed software developers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the big time _ the first LinuxWorld Expo ever held in
Manhattan. So there were a few more suits and ties, and a
statistically significant uptick in the number of spokesmodels on
the show floor. The sort of thing that happens in an industry that
has begun attracting investment dollars by the billions.
</P>
<P>
   LinuxWorld is still a small show, taking up only a fraction of
the Javits Center. But crammed into that space is just about every
major corporation in the computer industry, except Microsoft Corp.
And nobody seems to miss it _ quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   There's vehement anti-Microsoft sentiment here; even users of
Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines aren't quite so hostile.
No surprise, really. For all its recent success, Apple is still a
niche player with designs on a mere sliver of the computer market.
But as for the goals of the Linux boosters _ well, one of the
booths here sells T-shirts with the motto, ``Total World
Domination.'' These guys figure there's only one company on earth
with the power and the desire to thwart that ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust suit against Microsoft has bought the
Linux loyalists some time. When the Linux boom began in earnest
last year, Microsoft was sweltering under the spotlight. The
company didn't dare crush Linux, as it probably could have. And
judging from the products on display here at Javits, Microsoft will
never have that opportunity again.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at IBM Corp. Here's the world's biggest computer
company, a firm that has made Internet commerce the core of its
business strategy. And now they've put the guy who led the charge,
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, in charge of IBM's Linux strategy. You
think the company's serious about Linux? Me too.
</P>
<P>
   And to prove it, IBM announced a flurry of significant moves. It
has ported its ViaVoice speech recognition software to Linux, so
users will be able to talk to IBM machines. It's giving away Linux
versions of its DB2 database software and Lotus Domino server
software to programmers, so they can use it as a basis for new
Linux applications. IBM's also setting up collaboration with
independent Linux programmers to create software that'll let Linux
run better on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel Corp., along with IBM and computer hardware
makers like VA Linux Systems, are hard at work making sure that
Linux will run on the next generation of Intel processors, due out
later this year. The chips have a ridiculous name _ Itanium _ but
they're expected to offer a major step up in performance from
today's Pentiums.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Intel officials would be sharing Itanium design
secrets only with Microsoft, and perhaps a few hardware vendors
like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. But there they were at LinuxWorld,
briefing any geek who cared to listen, and passing out free copies
of Linux software tuned to run on Itanium, so programmers could
start learning how to write code for the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   A delightful theme underlies all this activity. Suddenly, the
world's biggest computer firms are desperate to make nice with a
feisty international community of independent programmers. Linus
Torvalds, who founded the community by writing the Linux software
kernel, marvels at the spectacle. ``It's funny to see how worried
some of these big companies are about being viewed badly by the
community,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, perhaps, but eminently sensible. The rise of Linux has
taught the industry titans that thousands of people will cheerfully
write world-class software for free. Many do it because they need
to solve some problem on their company's computer system. Others
just do it because they want to. Both these groups of benign
hackers will share their genius with the world, at no charge. They
don't even mind when Linux companies like Red Hat Software Inc. run
up a $16 billion market capitalization by reselling the work they
did for free.
</P>
<P>
   No, all the geeks want is to write good code, and to be treated
with respect. Microsoft has a problem in both departments. So the
geeks have gravitated to Linux, and now most of the Fortune 500 is
joining them. Will Microsoft see the light? Frankly, at this point,
it doesn't matter.

MILDEW MAKES ITS MARK ON ROOF SHINGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. All the shingles on my roof and on the roofs of many houses
in the Hampton Roads, Va., area are stained by a dark substance,
flowing down from near the peak to the gutter. I noticed this about
a year ago, and it appears to be getting worse. Just about all
roofs show this stain, regardless of the color of the shingle,
except those of my next-door neighbor and two neighbors across the
street; their shingles are not stained. What is the stain, and how
can I clean it off?
</P>
<P>
   EDWARD WILUSZ, Chesapeake, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's an old story, with an old remedy. The black or dark
streaks on your roof shingles are mold, also called mildew, which
grows on any warm, damp surface. But I am stumped as to why there
are no stains on your neighbors' roofs. Suffice it to say that they
lucked out; the rest of you did not.
</P>
<P>
   To kill this mold and get rid of the streaks, try painting them
with a solution of 1 part household bleach and 3 parts water. If
this does not clean the shingles, the stains are not mold but dirt,
and can be cleaned by washing with a strong solution of Spic and
Span and water. The stains are more obvious on a light roof. They
are also more common in the South, where heat and moisture promote
the growth of mold. But other parts of the country that get a
reasonable amount of rain each year are not immune from the stains.
</P>
<P>
   If the stains clean up with the bleach-and-water solution, you
can keep them away by installing a zinc strip near the ridge, under
the next-to-highest row of shingles, with about 2 inches showing.
Rainwater runs down over this zinc strip, picks up minute particles
of the mold-inhibiting metal, and spreads them over the roof.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy these strips in lumber stores. If yours doesn't
carry them, two brands are Shingle Shield, made by Chicago
Metallic, 800-638-5192; and Z-Stop, made by WESPAC of Seattle,
206-244-4013.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My antique bronze pot is 5 inches high and 6 inches wide,
with two dragons on the edge of the bowl. It is a real antique,
from the 14th century. A year ago, blue spots appeared on the
bronze, and later turned white. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   DAVE LIPKE, Brewster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The blue spots indicate oxidation of copper in the bronze, or
possibly cobalt, which might be a part of the bronze alloy. I don't
know why they turned white; lime might be the cause, or it might
simply be another step in the oxidation process. Before doing
anything about the spots, I suggest you contact a conservator at
the Museum of Fine Arts. The museum has a marvelous collection of
bronzes, so there should be someone there who can help you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The fiberglass or vinyl bottom of my 12-year-old shower stall
used to be white, but now it's gray, dark gray, black, and white.
I've tried several tub-tile cleaners, chlorine, and scrubbing, with
little improvement. Is it too old for keeping clean, or is there
something I haven't tried?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY SCHIRALDI, Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, try straight household bleach (wear skin and
eye protection when working with bleach); I know you said you tried
chlorine, but it is worth trying again, straight. The cleaners you
used were appropriate, but you may not have used them correctly.
Put on the cleaner, let it sit on the surface for five minutes or
longer, then scrub and rinse. You want the cleaner to do its work
of dissolving the dirt before it is scrubbed away.
</P>
<P>
   One of these cleaners may help, too: Simple Green, Clean Shower,
or Soft Scrub with bleach. And here is a homemade trick to try:
Smear on Ivory shampoo, liberally, let it sit for as long as you
like, and scrub and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's an Armstrong product called New Beginning that
is designed for vinyl floors. It's an extra-strength cleaner and
wax remover, and it just might work on your tired shower floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My backyard is only 7 feet deep and sunless, facing north. It
is hosed daily to clean up after our dog, and it develops a green
coating from the dampness. Other than buying a power washer, what
will get that slimy, smelly coating off?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. L. PELLA, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. I must assume your backyard has some kind of paving, such as
brick or stone. Power washing is your best bet, and I highly
recommend it as fast and easy.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't do that, or don't want to, make a solution of 1
part household bleach and 1 part water. Apply this to the yard, and
it will attack the green stuff, which is algae, related to seaweed.
As you apply the bleach, you must scrub the algae with a bristle
brush, because it will not yield readily to the bleach solution. If
you do this once, and the green stuff returns, more bleach and
water should remove it without further scrubbing. Wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, once you get it all cleaned up, paint vinegar on the
pavement and in any joints. This could deter the algae for a while.
</P>

A CAT-ALYST FOR SOLVING FENG SHUI WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a new book, ``Feng Shui for You and Your Cat.'' It's not
a parody, like ``Why Cats Paint'' or ``Dancing With Cats.'' The
author, Alison Daniels, is serious.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels is described on the book's jacket as a regular
contributor to The Art of Feng Shui, a monthly magazine. ``She is
also a cat owner and lover,'' according to this minibiography, ``so
this book is an ideal combination of two of her favorite
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a stroke of marketing genius. Feng shui and cats. With
scores of cute cat photographs. It's a project made in publishing
heaven, if such a place exists anymore. If only they could have
managed to work in Harry Potter, diet and/or fitness, and maybe
golf, they'd have the bestseller to end all bestsellers. ``Golf
Your Way to Fat-Free Fitness the Feng Shui Way with Harry Potter's
Cat''?
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui, (pronounced ``fung shway''), is the ancient art of
balancing the flow of natural energies to create more harmonious
environments. It has flourished in China for at least 4,000 years,
except from 1949 to 1976, when it was outlawed by Chairman Mao. If
feng shui survived the Cultural Revolution then perhaps it may be
able to survive its cultural exploitation in the West, where lately
I've seen it applied to everything from cosmetics to kitchen
appliances to romance to _ no kidding _ colonic irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   But back to ``Feng Shui for You and Your Cat.''
</P>
<P>
   People spend years studying feng shui. It's a complicated art.
And it's a thriving business. You can spend money engaging a feng
shui expert to come to your home and advise you about how to
improve the flow of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, according to Daniels at least, you can consult your cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a helpful cat in your house there is no need to hire a
feng shui expert,'' Daniels writes. ``Your cat is a natural
practitioner of feng shui, so use her innate skills to make it work
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   In its most basic form, Daniels says, feng shui involves
moderating energy which is too sluggish (si chi) or too fast-moving
(sha chi) and freeing up healthy energy (sheng chi).
</P>
<P>
   Got that? No? Don't worry, because your cat understands. All you
have to do is follow her around the house and take note of where
she likes to spend her time. According to Daniels, cats are
naturally drawn to areas of negative energy so they can try to
counter, or at least neutralize, its influence.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you may assume your cat likes to hang out in the
bottom of your closet because it's dark and quiet. But you'd be
wrong. Your cat has located an area of stale energy in the bottom
of your closet and is working to dispel it. Your cat is trying to
tell you that it's time to take drastic action to improve the
energy flow in your closet.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels adds, somewhat gratuitously, that the cat cannot
actually help you clean out your closet, ``only bring attention to
areas that need sorting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Does your cat climb the curtains? You may assume she's playing,
or indulging her destructive impulses but, Daniels writes, she's
actually counteracting the straight lines of the curtains that
speed up the flow of chi. She's telling you that you need curtains
that can be looped back to form an undulating line that slows down
the flow of energy in the room. Good kitty!
</P>
<P>
   Does your cat wind around your legs when you're trying to cook?
Or sit in the middle of the kitchen floor? You probably assume
she's hungry. She's not. She's working to lower the high energy
level in your kitchen, calming the sha chi. The next time you're
fixing dinner and you trip over your cat, thank her. Then ask her,
nicely, to go practice her feng shui in another room.

INTERNET IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although computers are supposed to make it easier to manage
large quantities of information, lately I've been running into
problems because I am not very good at memorizing user-names and
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   This ironic little conundrum is the result of poor planning on
the part of the Internet's designers and the burgeoning world of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to do just about anything interesting on the Internet
today, sooner or later some company is going to ask you to create a
user-name and a password. The user-name is supposed to identify
you. The password, meanwhile, is used for authentication.
</P>
<P>
   Using both an identifier and authenticator is a lot more secure
than just using an identifier. You can call my bank on Martha's
Vineyard, for example, and if you give them my Social Security
number, they will give you my account balance. If you know my
Social Security number, then you must be me. Unfortunately, having
just one layer of screening is one of the reasons there have been
so many cases of identity theft in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Things are considerably better on the Internet. User-names are
widely known _ they are part of e-mail addresses, after all _ so
the Internet's early designers realized that it would be a good
idea to give each user a password in addition. If you keep your
password secret, the theory goes, then nobody can use your account
or access your private data.
</P>
<P>
   Simple user-name and password security works pretty well. In
fact, it works so well that many people now have a plethora of
user-names and passwords that they need to recall on a daily basis.
For example, there is a user-name and password that I need to
access my Windows 98 laptop computer. My Internet service provider
also assigns me user-name and password. My AOL account has another
user-name and password, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Good passwords, we are told time and time again, should be hard
to guess. But they also should be easy to remember. One thing that
is particularly annoying about today's plethora of passwords is
that many companies use different rules for what makes an
acceptable password. Some require a combination of letters, digits
and symbols. Others require letters and digits, but prohibit the
use of symbols. Some particularly obnoxious Web sites require that
I use both upper-case and lower-case letters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding numbers and symbols makes a password harder to crack.
These days, bad guys don't actually guess passwords. Instead, they
use dictionary attacks _ that is, they try every word in the
dictionary, forward, backward, and with the digits 0 through 9
added at both the beginning and end. You actually can download
software from the Internet that will try to break into a Web-based
account using this approach. With a cable modem, you can try
perhaps 20 passwords a second; bad guys can try 12.1 million
passwords in a week. Words that aren't in the dictionary, multiple
digits, and symbols foil the attack.
</P>
<P>
   People use different strategies for coping with the large number
of user-names and passwords that they are forced to remember. Some
use the same user-name and password everywhere. This is generally a
mistake: if somebody untrustworthy discovers your user-name and
password, they can cause a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another common approach is to use the same user-name at every
site, but to use a password that depends on the site's Web address.
For example, a person might use the password ``yahoo4533'' at Yahoo
Calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another approach is to have a low-security password that's
used on most Internet sites, and then to have a series of
high-security passwords for the sites that actually involve money.
</P>
<P>
   A more secure approach is to use a different password at every
Web site, and to store the passwords themselves in an encrypted
vault. One of the very best Windows 95 programs in this category is
Counterpane System's Password Safe, which you can download for free
from the company's Web site,
http://www.counterpane.com/passsafe.html. Password Safe will
remember a different user-name/password combination for every
service you visit.
</P>
<P>
   When you first start up the program, you provide an encryption
pass-phrase that is used to scramble the passwords you save. After
you store a password, it will just show the services' names and
your user-name; double-click on the entry and it copies the
password to the clipboard. Once copied, you can paste the password
into a Web form or application program by simply typing control-V.
Even if somebody is sitting next to you, they won't see your
password. Password Safe hides the password, but if you need to see
it, you can make it appear by clicking another button.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0 also can store passwords in an
encrypted area called the Protected Storage System Provider. While
this system is convenient, it isn't as secure as Password Safe,
since it uses weak encryption.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easy to lose your password with Internet Explorer,
since you can't actually see the list of passwords that have been
memorized. For this reason, even if you have Internet Explorer
memorize your passwords, you still might want to use Password Safe
to store a second copy of your critical information.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, user-names and passwords might be replaced by
smart cards. Your personal information is stored on a credit card
with a tiny chip rather than on your desktop computer's hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   But since PCs today aren't being sold with smart-card readers,
widespread adoption of this technology is still years away. And
smart cards have competitors as well. One particularly intriguing
matchbook-sized device is sold by Rainbow Technologies. Called the
iKey, it works like a smart card but plugs into a computer's
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port. You can find out more about it
at www.rainbow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the future, one thing is sure: we're going
to be stuck with user-names and passwords for a long time.

MEETING YOUR CAREGIVER HALFWAY 
</HEADLINE>

 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents with infants in day care can be our own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, we want more than anything for our baby to be
happy, not just safe, and we know that only happens if he has a
close bond with the caregiver. But the thought (not to mention
sight) of him smiling and cooing in her arms can make our skin
crawl. Jealous, guilty, and threatened, we unwittingly withhold
information, which leads to diminished care.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the last thing in the world we want.
</P>
<P>
   There are some parents who never work their way out of this box.
For those who do, the key lies in one word: partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Just as day-care parents typically see themselves vis-a-vis
their provider in one of three ways _ employer, friend, or partner
_ providers see themselves as savior, teacher, or partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal is if both come into the relationship as partners,''
says early childhood educator Marilou Hyson. She is head of
professional development for the National Association for the
Education of Young Children, which accredits high-quality early
childhood programs, including infant/toddler care.
</P>
<P>
   For parents, this means taming our jealousy. Luckily, there's
reassuring research that infants can form attachments to more than
one person without being confused about who their parents are. But
Hyson also encourages parents to acknowledge our feelings to
ourselves and to our caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents don't even realize they're jealous. A clue that you
are is if you feel increasingly inadequate or defensive. When you
come to pick up your infant at the end of the day and she cries and
clings to the caregiver, do you think to yourself, ``My baby loves
her more''? That's a normal human reaction, but it can cross the
border into insecurity if you aren't quickly able to tell yourself
she's crying because she's remembering you and is relieved to see
you, says Hyson.
</P>
<P>
   It only makes matters worse, of course, if the caregiver says,
``Gee, she didn't cry all day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an insensitive provider, says Hyson. Rather than let your
feelings build, she recommends saying something immediately: ``I
want to work together to make this the best possible experience for
Danny. I'm glad he's taken to you but I have to admit, sometimes it
makes me jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect a caring, empathetic response, whether your provider is
in family day care, works at a center, or lives in your house.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who shames or chides you (``You are being a little
immature''); who takes the baby in the morning and turns her back
on you; or who tells you in words and actions ``Only I know what's
best'' clearly is not functioning as a supportive partner, says
educator Mary Ann Anthony. As director of the child care division
for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of Boston, she oversees
the care of 150 infants.
</P>
<P>
   What you should hear, she says, are things like ``It must be so
hard to see him in my arms''; ``I'll try to be sensitive to that'';
``If you call a dozen times a day, it's OK!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents' needs
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to parents is so important that at the NAEYC annual
conference late last year in New Orleans, day-care director Cindy
Lea told a standing-room seminar of 300 providers, ``Caregivers who
work with infants need to be as sensitive to parents' needs as they
are to babies'.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea, who is director of the McKendree United Methodist Church
Day Care in Nashville, elaborates in an interview: ``No parents
should feel a caregiver has an attitude or that she's judging you.
That gets in the way of a partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in a visit to prospective programs there are tip-offs
that a caregiver doesn't plan to be a partner, says early childhood
educator Lillian Sugarman of Zero to Three: National Center for
Infants, Toddlers and Families. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --You can't drop in unannounced. Under the guise of ``It makes
the baby cry,'' this policy smacks of ``We know best.''
</P>
<P>
   --All babies are on the same schedule for naps, feeding, or
changing. ``That tells you a center values convenience more than
child development,'' says Sugarman. ``(Under 14 months) babies
can't be pushed into group schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, these are reasons not to choose a program. But even
when you feel you've chosen the perfect place, sooner or later
something will bother you. Sugarman says cultural differences,
especially about food, are a common source of irritation, often
simply because parents didn't think to share them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's different foods at home, suddenly you see a baby
refusing to eat at the center,'' she says. In a good partnership, a
teacher won't just comment that he's not eating but takes it one
step further: ``Does he eat at home? What do you feed him?'' Then,
she says, it's up to the two of you together to find a way to
bridge the gap. ``Many centers won't let parents send in food. But
perhaps a parent can teach them to prepare something the baby will
eat,'' says Sugarman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Communication
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While it's up to parents to speak up, Anthony places ultimate
responsibility on the caregiver ``to create opportunity and a sense
of comfort.'' It starts on the first day by acknowledging parents'
importance and encouraging them to share information. Then, when an
issue comes up, there's a foundation for communication. Lea offers
examples of how this can play out:
</P>
<P>
   --An environmentally conscious family told her center they
wanted to use only cloth diapers. Teachers agreed. After the baby
soaked through his diaper two days in a row during nap, however,
the teacher decided to use disposables for the nap only. At pickup,
she blurted to the mom, ``I had this brainstorm'' and told her the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The parent was upset and rightly so, says Lea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks to who's in charge, it's about power,'' she says.
``If the teacher had said, `Here's a problem, what can we do?' the
parent might have come to the same conclusion.'' As it was, the
teacher apologized and the mom went along with her solution.
</P>
<P>
   --A mother was unhappy to find her infant on a blanket on the
floor with other babies. ``She was from a culture where babies are
swaddled and held at all times,'' says Lea. Once she explained this
to the teacher, there was a respectful dialogue. ``The staff
couldn't do that 100 percent of the time, but they offered to do
their best and she was satisfied,'' says Lea.
</P>
<P>
   --A baby at her center recently was ready for finger feeding. He
was using a spoon at home so his parents were happy to have him do
that at day care. When the mom came to visit, however, says Lea,
``she was appalled that the baby had applesauce in his eyebrows and
hair. She didn't have to say anything: It was obvious how
uncomfortable she was.'' The teacher quickly went to her side: ``I
can see this mess is more than you expected!''
</P>
<P>
   The mom nodded. ``I want him to learn to feed himself, but not
like this,'' she said. A compromise was reached: He could use a
spoon, but a teacher would guide his hand and wipe his face.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whom to talk to
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you're uneasy about, your baby's caregiver is the first
person to talk to. If you're worried a teacher will react angrily
and take it out on your baby, that's a sign of a serious lack of
trust, and that alone is reason to talk to the director, says Lea.
Also talk to a director if you feel a teacher isn't responsive.
``Don't expect every request to be implemented, but expect it to be
treated with respect and importance,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Any parent who feels uneasy also wonders how to judge when it's
time to leave a center. This is when reality and theory don't
always converge. ``There are times when you tolerate something less
than ideal because it's convenient or because there's nothing
better,'' says Anthony. She says it's one thing if the fit between
you and the provider isn't terrific, but unease about your child's
care is never appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Hyson tells parents, ``No center will be exactly what you want,
so be clear about what your bottom-line issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from safety, issues that would prompt her or Sugarman to
leave a caregiver revolve around healthy infant development: A
provider who doesn't talk to or read to a baby, or puts babies in
front of the TV; whose policy is to let a baby cry for more than
five minutes; who yells or scolds ``You naughty baby! I just
changed your diaper!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality infant day care is never about blame, either of the
child or parent. It's about respect and trust,'' says Anthony. Lea
always reminds her caregivers, ``It takes two to share.''
</P>
<P>
   With caregivers that sensitive, a parent could never be her own
worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DAY CARE DO'S AND DON'T'S FOR PARENTS &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Expect a caregiver, including a family provider or nanny, to
honor your schedule for weaning or introducing solid foods.
</P>
<P>
   --When you ask, ``What can I expect when my baby cries?'' here
are responses you want to hear: ``We respond as quickly as we can;
our ratio allows for a provider to attend to any crying baby within
three minutes; we try to learn each baby's cry.'' Also, look for
cribs to be close enough together so a provider can be holding one
crying baby and patting another one's back.
</P>
<P>
   --If you want your child to be bilingual, don't go to a
monolingual program and expect special attention.
</P>
<P>
   --The first time something minor bothers you, make a mental
note; the second time, tell the teacher; the third time, remind
her; the fourth time, go to the director. If it's something major,
go to the director sooner.
</P>
<P>
   --Language to use with a teacher: ``I was uncomfortable
yesterday when this happened . . .''; ``Can we talk about . . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Language to expect her to use with you: ``I don't know if this
is working for us; let me tell you what we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   --High staff turnover (six months or less) is bad for infant
development.
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure to give your caregiver positive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red flags &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No day care will ever be exactly what you want, so compromise is
always important. But there also are some bottom-line issues. Here
are things you don't want to see:
</P>
<P>
   --Babies in front of the TV
</P>
<P>
   --Yelling or scolding
</P>
<P>
   --A ban on unannounced visits
</P>
<P>
   --Regimented group schedules for babies under 14 months
</P>
<P>
   --Babies left unattended

 MARIA TROZZI HELPS EDUCATE CHILDREN ABOUT DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two little boys collide on hanging rings at an elementary school
playground.
</P>
<P>
   One boy gets up. The other doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The boy on the ground dies several hours later.
</P>
<P>
   How will classmates of this 7-year-old boy cope with such an
unexpected and incomprehensible loss? After all, lots of children
get hurt on playgrounds _ scratched knees, sprained ankles. But
they don't die.
</P>
<P>
   How will the community respond? Where will they turn for help?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is to call Maria Trozzi, 50, director of the Good
Grief Program at Boston Medical Center and author of the recently
published ``Talking With Children About Loss: Words, Strategies,
and Wisdom to Help Children Cope with Death, Divorce, and Other
Difficult Times.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Superintendent Mary Grassa O'Neill did the day
second-grader Sam Cichello was fatally injured on the playground of
the Tucker School in Milton, Mass. last fall. The next evening,
more than 300 parents gathered in the school gym to hear Trozzi
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria was brilliant,'' says Grassa O'Neill. ``She was so
uplifting, so solid in her advice and so positive. She gave
everyone an age-appropriate vocabulary _ `A person doesn't pass on,
he dies. Children fall every day on playgrounds so what happened
here is very, very rare . . . I know because I'm an older person
and I've never heard of this happening.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi, who has a husband and two daughters, is a former math
teacher and Junior League volunteer who thinks of herself as an
educator, not a grief counselor. She's been counseling since 1996,
when Good Grief moved from its original home in the Judge Baker
Children's Center, a mental health facility affiliated with
Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting with parents and teachers must be done as soon as
possible after a death,'' Trozzi says. ``Young children are
egocentric, so they need to be assured that what happened is not
going to `happen to me.' Kids also must be empowered with enough
concrete information to understand exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And most important, every loss leaves in its wake the
opportunity for growth. Therefore, it is a time for children to
master coping skills that will give them the resilience to get
through future losses and rejections. ``I can't prevent a
tragedy,'' she says, ``but I can give parents and teachers the
information they need during a crisis. And I do it in a very upbeat
way. That's my signature.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does in her book and in her travels around the country
is demystify a grieving process that moves from understanding the
death itself to being able to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   If Trozzi had her way, a Good Grief program would be in place in
every school, day-care center, hospital, and social service agency
nationwide, assuring that the proper caregivers are in place before
a tragedy occurs. Children need familiar and trusted adults around
them during times of loss, she says, not grief counselors who are
strangers to them.
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi, who earned a master's degree in counseling from Boston
University, is also involved with The Circle, a comprehensive
grief-support group for children ages 5 to 13 that meets weekly.
She's received a three-year grant from Columbia Presbyterian
Babies' and Children's Hospital in New York to develop a
bereavement program for hospital professionals working with acutely
ill children and their families. Next month, the Boston Theological
Institute will honor her with its annual award for people who make
significant contributions in the field of bereavement and loss. And
she's become nationally known (she was contacted and went to
Columbine High School after the massacre) through seminars given
with Dr. T. Berry Brazelton of Boston, the renowned pediatrician
and author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria is a remarkable person and always wins every audience
over with her directness and valuable information,'' says
Brazelton.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chief of pediatrics at Boston University
School of Medicine, calls Trozzi ``a natural leader, very
charismatic and thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   She also helps staff members at Boston Medical Center when a
child in their care dies. ``Maria is helping our doctors understand
and share the feelings they hold around the death of a child and
thus preventing permanent barriers,'' Zuckerman says.
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi divides the mourning process into four tasks, originally
defined by her mentor and the creator of the Good Grief program,
the late Dr. Sandra Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The first task is understanding what happened to the person who
died and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children can't feel the pain of grief unless they have an
honest understanding about what it means to die,'' says Trozzi.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa did not pass on or go away or go to heaven, and the dog
did not go to sleep. Grandpa and the dog died, which means the body
stopped working, like a machine that can't be fixed. Angels did not
come down and swoop Grandpa away _ a concept that can frighten a
young child and prevent him or her from falling asleep at night.
However, Grandpa's spirit can be in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we explain the physical cause of death, we can add our
beliefs about the spirit and the afterlife,'' says Trozzi.
</P>
<P>
   The second task is grieving or experiencing the painful feelings
associated with death and loss. Children grieve in spurts, Trozzi
writes, ``because they have a limited capacity for tolerating
ambivalent feelings and a lower threshold for psychological pain.''
Later they will mourn anew, regrieve the early loss of a mother,
for example, when they marry or have children or reach the age of
the mother when she died.
</P>
<P>
   The third task is commemorating a death and understanding the
rituals involved. The fourth task is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Children must be able to find an inner place for the person they
have lost. Caregivers can help them find this inner connection by
encouraging them to talk about the person who has died, share
memories, and cherish mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids block or inhibit the heartache accompanying a loss,
they are more likely to endure persistent psychological or physical
symptoms,'' Trozzi writes.
</P>
<P>
   The writer William Styron, she notes, attributes his
incapacitating bouts with depression to ``incomplete grief'' over
the death of his mother when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he uncovered the root of his sadness,'' writes Trozzi,
``Styron endured profound mental anguish, used alcohol to excess .
. . and contemplated suicide.'' Once he understood the reasons for
his depression, ``he was able to work through his grief and manage
his feelings in a positive way, which included sharing his
experience with us'' in his 1990 autobiographical book, ``Darkness
Visible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of her book, Trozzi covers other losses, such
as divorce, growing up in a household with a mentally or physically
disabled parent or sibling, moving to another state, not making the
football team or cheerleading squad, or breaking up with a
girlfriend. She also devotes a chapter to stigmatic deaths from
AIDS, suicide, alcohol, and criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi dedicates her book to her brother, Frank, who began to
suffer unexplained seizures when he was 12 that left him with
mental and physical impairments. His illness had a profound effect
on the family, but Trozzi, who was 8 at the time, did not address
her own powerful emotions until her father died when she was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Trozzi's childhood and adolescence, her household
seemed to revolve around Frank and ``his pills, his erratic
behavior, and his seizures.'' She knew her parents had, in a way,
lost the son who was a promising athlete and student. Upon her
father's death, she understood that she had lost the big brother
she once idolized and had buried her feelings of sadness, worry,
jealousy, embarrassment, and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had great coping skills,'' she says, ``but I never was truly
in touch with the darker side of my life.''

STAYING `FRIENDS': LISA KUDROW'S DOUBLE LIFE ON THE BIG AND SMALL
SCREENS

entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Lisa Kudrow in
a scene from ``Hanging Up.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I will never desert my `Friends,''' Lisa Kudrow promises.
 &HT;    The star of NBC's hit series admits that she and the rest of the
show's key cast members are fighting for new contracts after their
current arrangements run out later this year. But the slender
actress denies published stories that she'll quit the television
show which made her a star in order to pursue big-screen
opportunities.
 &HT;    ``We've all made a promise to each other,'' she says. ``The six
of us will continue. No one person will jump. There will either be
none of us leaving or all of us leaving _ either no more `Friends'
or another season with all of us on it.''
 &HT;    Wearing a brown leather jacket over a gray silk blouse and tight
black pants, Kudrow has come to Beverly Hills' Four Seasons Hotel
to talk about her role opposite Meg Ryan and Diane Keaton in the
comedy/drama ``Hanging Up,'' which will open Feb. 18. But the
``Friends'' gossip won't be ignored.
 &HT;    It's been rumored that Kudrow and David Schwimmer will be the
first to walk away. Intensive negotiations have been going on for
the past few weeks as Kudrow, Schwimmer and co-stars Jennifer
Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry
have made it clear that they want a lot more than their current
$125,000 per episode to continue.
 &HT;    After all, NBC pays the cast members on its other long-running
hit, ``ER,'' roughly double that _ not to mention an occasional $1
million bonus.
 &HT;    But the 36-year-old Kudrow, who plays the show's flaky massage
therapist Phoebe Buffay, insists she's concerned about more than
just a fatter pay check.
 &HT;    ``We've just finished a fantastic season, and we need assurances
from the producers that the quality of the show will continue to be
topnotch,'' she says. ``If we are going to end, then we want it to
be on a high note. We'd hate for them to come to us and say,
`Please leave _ the show is embarrassing.'
 &HT;    ``So we want to know that the stories will continue to be the
best in Hollywood and that everyone on the show stays happy.''
 &HT;    Over the course of the series, the producers have brought in new
characters and famous faces such as supermodel Elle MacPherson, Tom
Selleck and Reese Witherspoon. But Kudrow thinks that such stunts
are actually counterproductive.
 &HT;    ``We've learned it's not as much fun when they bring in someone
new to fall in love with one of us,'' she says. ``Fans really just
want the story lines to revolve around the six of us.
 &HT;    ``I hope that in some future episode the writers don't try and
match Phoebe with Joey,'' she adds. ``It's about the only
combination we haven't had.''
 &HT;    Industry insiders believe that the ``Friends'' cast will get
what they're looking for.
 &HT;    ``Right now we're getting `Friends' for bargain-basement
rates,'' one NBC executive admitted recently, ``and so no one wants
to lose them. Now it all boils down to how much extra money they're
willing to settle for.''
 &HT;    Of the actors, Kudrow holds the best bargaining chips, because
she's had the most success on the big screen, scoring with ``Romy
and Michelle's High School Reunion'' (l997), ``The Opposite of
Sex'' (l998) and _ as shrink Billy Crystal's wife _ ``Analyze
This'' (l999).
 &HT;    Cox Arquette has had hits with the ``Scream'' movies, but their
male co-stars have not done so well, with their films generally
heading straight to video.
 &HT;    Actually, Kudrow says, her biggest incentive to move on is the
strain which television's demanding schedule, coupled with her
movie commitments, puts on her family life. She and husband Michael
Stern, a French advertising executive, have a 2-year-old son,
Julian Murray.
 &HT;    ``If we sign new deals,'' Kudrow says, ``it'll mean that I'll
work 11 months of the year, and it's what I'll have to live with.
But if we all decide that we don't want to come back, it'll be fine
with me and I'll just get on with my life.''
 &HT;    Julian got an early introduction to show business on the set of
``Hanging Up,'' in which Kudrow plays a struggling television
soap-opera actress who is also the bubble-headed younger sister of
Ryan and Keaton.
 &HT;    ``I was able to bring Julian to the set with me and spend time
with him in the morning and again at the end of the day,'' she
says. ``I know the bottom line is that, no matter how much I'm
working, I'm better off than most women in America who work and
have kids they don't see all day.
 &HT;    ``I worry about the future,'' she adds, ``when my son is in
school, and whether I have to take him out of school if I go off on
location. It's something I'll decide when it comes along.''
 &HT;    The movie is based on a book by Delia Ephron, and draws on
Ephron's own experiences with her ailing father (Walter Matthau),
who is depicted in the movie as an eccentric boozer.
 &HT;    Like her character, Kudrow was the youngest of three children,
living with her family in the suburbs of Los Angeles. But she says
her relationship with her father, a doctor, was much different from
her ``Hanging Up'' character's.
 &HT;    ``I had a very special relationship with my father, who has just
retired,'' she recalls. ``I was six and eight years younger than my
brother and sister, and was the apple of my father's eye. But,
because I was so young, they often left me out of things and
overprotected me, which wasn't altogether a bad thing.''
 &HT;    Kudrow and Ryan bonded during the making of the film, and the
veteran actress enthuses over Kudrow's potential for film stardom.
 &HT;    ``Lisa is like great jazz,'' Ryan says. ``You never know how
she's going to pull off her ideas, then something in the chemistry
of her brain turns a line into a little jewel. It's been wonderful
to be around somebody with that talent and expertise.''
 &HT;    When they weren't in front of the cameras, producer Bill
Robinson recalls, the two actresses sat in the dressing room with
their makeup woman, playing around with a ouija board in hope of
contacting spirits.
 &HT;    ``Some of the questions Meg and Lisa asked the board were about
bringing kids up,'' he says. ``Some were about how much Lisa should
ask for in negotiating for a new `Friends' contract.''
 &HT;    Kudrow can be forgiven for her ambivalence about continuing
``Friends.'' After all, she's got plenty more on her plate.
 &HT;    Later this year, for example, she'll be seen in another
big-budget film, ``Numbers,'' directed by that other Ephron,
Delia's sister Nora.
 &HT;    ``It's set in the early '80s,'' Kudrow says. ``I'm a Lotto ball
girl, and John Travolta is a weatherman who tries to fix the
Pennsylvania state lottery.''
 &HT;    Somewhere along the way, Kudrow adds, she'd like to have another
baby.
 &HT;    ``But at the moment there just isn't time,'' she says. ``So
we'll just wait and see.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Theirs is a shrink-wrapped existence in which the house
often rocks gently, the wind off the ocean rakes the walls, and
anyone with an ounce of sense adds an extra heater or two during
times like these. Just who would want to live like this? ``The kind
of person who likes to take a cold shower,'' replies Pat Gately,
marina manager of Boston Boat Yard &AMP; Marina in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Should she care to venture outside her snug office, Gately can
count 22 boats that are serving as year-round homes to their
owners. And they're not alone. About 160 vessels housing
``liveaboards'' are tied up at a half-dozen marinas in Boston's
inner harbor. These are boating's voluntary left-behinds, the folks
who refuse to abandon their boats from October to May in favor of a
cozy house in the suburbs, or who decline to sail southward in
order to spend winter in a toastier port.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the North Atlantic is literally at their doorstep as
they hunker down in a wide variety of dwellings that range in size
from cramped 22-foot sailboats to relatively palatial 70-foot
powerboats. Says Ilya Goldberg, who lives year-round in East Boston
on a 40-foot sailboat with his wife, Cathy Wolkow: ``It may be a
small boat you live in, but you've got a large backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Liveaboards in warmer climes have a kind of boat-bum image as
well-tanned ne'er-do-wells and gypsies in Top-Siders. And even the
marinas of Boston Harbor, like many neighborhoods on land, contain
their characters, serious drinkers, and perennial searchers who are
passing the winter here before slipping off to someplace else. As
one local liveaboard points out, the lifestyle seems to hold
particular short-term appeal for recently divorced men.
</P>
<P>
   But peek inside one of these boats during the winter _ after
stepping through a door cut in the heat-shrunk clear plastic that
many owners use for insulation and protection the elements _ and
you'll find, say, an attorney, a medical student, a secretary, a
software developer, a research scientist, a temp, an airline pilot,
and an ironworker. The large majority of local liveaboards, who
range in age from their 20s to their 60s, commute daily to
honest-to-God jobs, often reaching them via the MBTA Inner Harbor
Ferry Service. They also, of course, share a love of boats,
although not necessarily of moving boats: Several sheepishly admit
that they haven't piloted their vessels in years except to annually
move them, come winter, from a dock with a view to a dock that
offers a shorter walk to land.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly few ways of life in New England offer a sharper
contrast between February and August. At Constitution Marina in
Charlestown, the residents of ``E-hood'' _ meaning the summer
socializers of E dock _ are long gone. So are their deck chairs,
grills, and margarita parties. There's no sunset chatter, no
moonlight cruises. During the short, hard days of winter,
liveaboards tend to see no more of each other than a gloved wave on
the way to or from work. Many of the folks who remain on their
boats murmur that, to tell the truth, they're glad to see the
crowds go. ``To a certain extent, it's like living on Cape Cod and
saying goodbye and good riddance to the summer people,'' says Bob
Navin, who lives aboard the 41-foot sailboat Mena at Constitution
Marina with his wife, Dot. ``But, of course, you're happy to see
them come back in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a lifestyle in which three's a crowd. (At
Constitution Marina, 92 winter liveaboards dwell on 68 boats, an
average of fewer than 1.4 people per vessel.) If you're going to
spend winter on your boat in Boston Harbor, some of the activities
you should perhaps enjoy _ besides making repairs _ are the ones at
which other liveaboards claim expertise: reading, renting videos,
dominos, cribbage, Scrabble, and ordering takeout pizza. And don't
expect your home to be a popular destination for your land-loving
friends _ except, of course, on New Year's Eve, when fireworks
light up the harbor sky. ``I just don't have many visitors in the
winter,'' confesses Michael Dimitruk, who resides alone aboard the
52-foot sloop Enchante in Shipyard Quarters marina in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   Few people attempt to raise kids on boats here. Rindy and Andrew
Stangel, who live at Constitution Marina aboard the 36-foot
powerboat Sigrid B with their 13-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, are
an exception. ``It's really about the same as raising a daughter on
land, although learning to walk was interesting,'' Rindy Stangel
muses. ``The big difference is, you're much closer to your child on
a boat. She's right there. Sometimes that's great. Sometimes it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Elizabeth, a seventh grader at Boston Latin School
who often sleeps on the Sigrid B's deck during the summer, claims
her life isn't really much different from her friends'. She's got
her own bedroom, plenty of Marilyn Manson music, a Sony
Playstation, a guitar, and a stash of ``Goosebumps'' books.
``Sometimes I like it here, because nobody bothers me,'' she says.
``Sometimes I'm bored.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, living year-round aboard a boat in Boston can seem
just as idyllic as the names of some of the vessels themselves _
What a Life, for instance, or As Time Goes By. Televisions, VCRs,
stereos, microwave ovens, propane stoves, and laptop computers are
common. Hoses bring fresh water, while telephone lines connect to
the outside world. ``This is no different than sitting in the
living room of a condo, is it?'' asks Lois Darby, who lives aboard
the comfortable, thickly carpeted, 44-foot, two-bedroom motor yacht
Her Weigh with her husband, David, at Shipyard Quarters. Answer:
No, not if you discount the occasional bobbing caused by the wakes
of passing boats.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, almost all liveaboards augment their heating
systems with, say, electric space heaters or even small
diesel-fired furnaces. (Fuel for the latter must be hauled by hand.
And when their diesel furnace quit on Christmas Eve, Goldberg and
Wolkow had to drive it to Rhode Island for repair.) On very cold
days _ hello, Winter of 2000 _ the hoses that bring water sometimes
freeze. So do interior pipes. Occasionally the boats draw so much
power for their supplemental heating that they trip marina circuit
breakers and their electricity goes out. And there are lesser
inconveniences, such as a distinct lack of closet space and having
to use marina showers, laundry facilities, and toilets if your boat
isn't fully equipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first did this, I said to my husband, `I don't want to
camp out,' '' Rindy Stangel says. ``But sometimes it seems like
that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   (Docked boats are required to discharge their raw sewage into
either pump-out boats or shoreside facilities. The consensus among
local liveaboards is that more of them do it than used to, but that
the procedure is by no means universal and that some sewage is
dumped into the water.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sweetnam, who lives in East Boston in a two-story houseboat
_ actually a housebarge, since it has no engine _ with his wife,
Ann, likens living atop the water to the Longfellow poem about the
little girl with the curl: When she was good she was very, very
good, but when she was bad she was horrid. ``Sooner or later,
something's going to break or something's going to freeze'' is
Sweetnam's theory. ``And it's going to be hard to work on. If you
live in a house, you can put up a ladder. But you can't put a
ladder up to a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The word most often used when the necessary traits of
liveaboards are discussed is ``self-sufficiency.'' Pat Gately of
Boston Boat Yard &AMP; Marine characterizes liveaboards as loners, and
points out that they can get particularly cranky with one another
as the winter wears on. Ironically, they're also folks who are
eager to lend a hose clamp in an emergency or to keep an eye on a
neighbor's empty boat for a few days. ``They're always very willing
to help each other if a line breaks or something,'' Gately says.
``When something goes wrong, they rally 'round.''
</P>
<P>
   For many liveaboards, staying the winter is a matter of pride.
Cold? Ice? Snow? ``The same snow that falls on us falls on you,''
declares feisty Elliot Hammerman, 63, a widower who lives by
himself on a 44-foot powerboat in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a liveaboard why he or she prefers year-round dockside
living, and you'll usually get a mixed bag of answers. Some cite
economics. Indeed, boats tend to offer a cheaper life than
waterfront homes, although they're no bargain when you take living
area into account. (See chart, page XX . For people like Mike Dunn,
who lives at Constitution Marina on the Jalan Jalan with his
girlfriend, Alison Moran, being a liveaboard is the only way he can
afford a 41-foot sailboat. ``I'd never be able to own this boat and
a house at the same time,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Others, of course, simply can't get enough of the water. ``I
just hate being inland,'' offers Bruce Laughon, who is spending his
13th winter at Constitution Marina aboard the 42-foot sailboat
Major Chord with his wife, Karen. ``When I get to Brookline, I get
nervous.'' Besides, inland living doesn't offer panoramic skyline
views spiced with sightings of mergansers, cormorants, swans, and
the occasional harbor seal. Arthur Carey and Elaine Ridings, who
live near the Laughons aboard the houseboat Travesty, say they go
through 100 loaves of bread a week feeding waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   Carey is one of many liveaboards who like to describe the
principal advantage of their lifestyle this way: ``If you don't
like your neighbors, you can move.'' Liveaboards talk a lot about
having the freedom to come and go as they please, even though many
of them have been parked in the same waters for years. ``You feel
you can cast off your lines and leave and never come back,'' Ilya
Goldberg explains, adding with a smile: ``Not that you ever do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But many dream of it. The Laughons, both retired, say they plan
to leave Boston permanently and set sail for Curacao in July. The
Darbys, who are grandparents, talk of taking off for the Bahamas
within a few years. The Navins, who are approaching retirement age,
say they'd eventually like to keep their boat in Boston during the
summers and use it down south during the winters. (Dunn and Moran,
both in their mid-30s, have a different plan, however: They're
saving to buy a house.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the inner harbor's 160 liveaboard boats bob in
the icy water and sway in the frigid wind. Life below decks isn't
impossible, but it's no day at the beach, either. Predicts Bob
Navin as he sits in the main salon of the Mena in the company of
three different types of heating systems: ``We'll have fewer people
living here next winter, I'll guarantee that.''

BROWSING THE WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the winning horse on Derby Day, a single American antique
emerges each January as the iconographic center of a frenzied swirl
of activity. This star is taken to heart as the most treasured
object among the many thousands for sale at the citywide shows and
auctions that run during the 10-day Winter Antiques Show, which
ended here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This year's buzz centered on a 20-pound oak cube from Salem that
more closely resembled the cute little R2-D2 of ``Star Wars'' in
stature than it did last year's more traditional star of the
antique wars, a 9-foot mahogany highboy crafted in Colonial Newport
for a Cambridge minister, and sold at Sotheby's for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dark, squat, and less than 17 inches tall, the little Pope
Valuables Cabinet awaited its new home directly under the
auctioneer's podium at Christie's in Rockefeller Center Jan. 21.
There were plenty of empty chairs, but observers stood three rows
deep in the back, the better to watch the bidding when Lot 111 came
up. The higher the numbers, the smaller the nod, and being able to
figure out who is actually bidding is a source of pride among
spectators at big-time auctions.
</P>
<P>
   They craned their necks when bidding began at $400,000 and
proceeded swiftly to $950,000. There it paused until a new bidder
broke the million-dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
   This was hallowed ground in furniture circles. Only 23 pieces
had ever broken this barrier. So auctioneer John Hays's voice
abruptly shifted from brisk professional enthusiasm to a hushed
monotone as bidders rhythmically volleyed back and forth, $100,000
on each nod. At $2.4 million, a record price for 17th-century
furniture from any country, the Pope Valuables Cabinet went to Dean
Lahikainen, curator of Decorative Arts at the Peabody Essex Museum
in, of all places, Salem.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet was the oldest piece of American furniture many
observers had ever seen at auction, and it exuded its own sturdy
charisma. It had survived wilderness, witch trials, and 11
generations in one family without falling prey to a single
handyman's repair efforts or coat of shellack.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its integration of American history and art, it's the
most exciting object we've ever had here,'' marveled Hays, the
Boston-born director of American furniture at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers embellishing its front referred to 1679,
commemorating the wedding of the original owners, Joseph and
Bathsheba Pope of Salem Village (now Danvers), and it also bore
their initials.
</P>
<P>
   It contained interior draws to hold deeds and jewelry. Humble by
today's standards, it was the height of embellishment in its era,
with spindles, carved S-scrolls, a central starburst, and surviving
touches of red paint as proof of prosperity and refinement in the
face of primitive isolation and dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and superstition were also threats. Both Joseph and
Bathsheba were Quakers whose parents had been persecuted for their
faith. And yet the Popes themselves became accusers during the
Salem witch trials, which began in 1692.
</P>
<P>
   According to detailed records, Bathsheba Pope was often taken
with fits that she blamed on the supposed witches. She cried out
during the trial of accused witch Martha Corey and, believing
herself to be under Corey's spell, attacked her. First she threw
her muff, but after it missed its target, she removed her shoe and
successfully struck Corey in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Pope testified against John Proctor, popularized as the
leading role in Arthur Miller's ``The Crucible,'' saying Proctor
had offered to perform an exorcism of the ``Divell'' in exchange
for another man's Indian slave. Hays theorized that the Popes, as
members of a suspect sect, may have sought to avoid becoming
targets themselves by joining ranks with the persecutors. Both
Proctor and Corey were hanged.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet continued as a witness to history when it descended
along family lines to Cornelius Henry DeLamater of New York City,
who built the metal-plated USS Monitor. After it destroyed the
Confederacy's wooden ship the UCS Merrimack in the Civil War's most
famous naval battle, DeLamater's foundry thrived on the publicity
and he built an estate on Long Island where the cabinet remained
for almost a century.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was inherited by a boatyard worker on Cape Cod and
his sister, a New Hampshire teacher (they wish to remain
anonymous). It had been in their grandmother's hallway, where it
was referred to as ``The Franklin Cabinet'' though no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, they took it to a local historical society for
appraisal. Informed it was from the Pilgrim Century, as
antiquarians call the 1600s, they made a dogged project of tracing
their family genealogy to find the original owners, using the
on-line Mormon Church archives, which have made genealogical
detective work possible for anyone with a home computer. Bathsheba
Pope was, it turned out, an aunt of Benjamin Franklin's.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding the cabinet was too valuable to insure, they
commissioned a copy for themselves and sent the original to
Christie's for auction. No one knew what it would fetch. Three
similar cabinets by Salem maker James Symonds survive, but all are
in museums.
</P>
<P>
   However, Christie's was impressed enough to give the cabinet its
own separate catalog, and, as it turned out, the whispered
expectations of the magic million-dollar mark were exceeded. The
last time a high-quality piece of furniture from the 1600s was
auctioned was way back in 1986, when Sotheby's sold an Essex County
carved oak armchair for $528,000.
</P>
<P>
   After all the excitement of the auction, the little cabinet was
going home. According to Peabody Essex executive director Dan
Monroe, it will soon be on public display.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While age before beauty was the byword at the big auctions, the
Hirschl &AMP; Adler Galleries at 21 E. 70th St. was featuring some
relatively ``new'' Boston pieces.
</P>
<P>
   President Stuart P. Feld has organized what may be the first
exhibition solely devoted to the Boston decorative arts between
1810 and 1840. ``Boston in the Age of Neo-Classicism'' is scheduled
to run through Saturday. It contains light fixtures, silver, and
many fine pieces of furniture from the era, including an 1815
neoclassical rosewood card table on a lyre base with gilt brass toe
caps, casters, and brass inlay lyre ``strings.'' Also especially
handsome is a mahogany armchair with scrolled arms. As a proud
young democracy, Americans were emulating the motifs of classical
Greece, the world's first democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Augmented with Boston paintings from the period, the exhibit
boasts a first-rate catalog written by noted scholar Page Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Feld has been the leading champion of this neglected period,
when Boston decorative arts were generally low on innovation but
high on craftsmanship because they catered to a discriminating but
very homogeneous ruling class of English descent. As a New York
visitor observed of Boston at the time, ``All these people are of
one race. They behave like members of one family, whereas with us a
crowd is an assembly of all the nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Feld began collecting neoclassical Boston furnishings when he
was a Harvard graduate student in the late 1950s and neoclassic
style was even more out of favor. ``I had an active social life and
I was in and out of many of the great houses of Beacon Hill, but I
saw very little of it there. It was in places like in Magnolia,
Manchester, Gloucester, and Essex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still a period that people are struggling with. I
had a customer who said, `This is what I want to buy. But I'm told
that if I'm going to be serious, I have to collect older
furniture.' ''

 NEW YORK: ... older furniture.' ''

<P>
   The auctions and shows of Americana week in New York are built
around the 10-day run of the 46-year-old Winter Antiques Show,
which draws dealers from Europe and the United States, and patrons
from the nation's social elite. Philanthropist Teresa Heinz, wife
of Senator John Kerry, and American Express president Kenneth I.
Chenault served as this year's honorary cochairpersons.
</P>
<P>
   Since Historic Deerfield was featured three years ago, the show
has proven to be such a great attention-getter for small historical
societies that some 30 are now in negotiations to take part as
well.
</P>
<P>
   This year it was the Nantucket Historical Association's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors entering the ornate gothic Seventh Regiment Armory
(which brings to mind Memorial Hall in Cambridge) were greeted by
photos from the HNA's collection of 45,000 images and displays of
70 Nantucket items. These ranged from the diary of a captain's wife
who accompanied her husband on a five-year whaling voyage to a
portrait of African-American leader Absalom F. Boston (1785-1855),
the first captain of an all-black whaling crew and the man behind
desegregating the Nantucket school system in 1846.
</P>
<P>
   The curators also posted the lyrics of ``The Nantucket Girl's
Song'' (``For a clever sailor husband is so seldom at his home /
That a wife can spend the dollars with a will that's all her
own'').
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just like it,'' explained Aimee E. Newell, curator of
collections. ``Nantucket whalers were away at sea so much that the
island bred some very independent women.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending money, and supporting the East Side House Settlement,
were all part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenneth W. Rendell Gallery of Madison Avenue featured a
portfolio of 15 letters by Albert Einstein for a cool million, but
a better bargain was a Boston petition from the early 1700s asking
Queen Anne for protection for the Massachusetts fishing fleet from
French military boats. Sold for a mere $8,500 at Guthman Americana
of Westport, it contained many signatures of the city's early
residents, including John Corey and Jeremy Dummer, America's first
silversmiths.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne E. Pratt continued the Nantucket theme with a display of
lightship baskets woven to while away the hours by these floating
lighthouse keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Monitor popped up again at Hyland Granby Antiques of Hyannis
Port, which had a case of ceremonial swords presented by the
citizens of Boston to Lieutenant Louis Napoleon Stodder, who was

   To a nonhunter, big money for duck decoys can sound a little
goofy. I prefer diamond jewelry myself. But a brief visit to the
Jan. 22-23 auction of the world's best decoy collection at
Sotheby's found collectors flocking and prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   A uniquely American folk art made to attract game for hunters
(some decoys are riddled with bullets), duck decoys have enjoyed a
spectacular rise in value. A 1917 decoy by Elmer Crowell, an East
Harwich cranberry farmer and market gunner who hunted waterfowl to
sell the meat, shattered records. Crowell himself sold many of his
carved and painted wooden birds at the turn of the century for $2
apiece, and 50 years ago they could still be bought for $50. The
$684,500 paid for Crowell's ``sleeping Canadian goose'' (a
demonstration decoy that never went near the water) by an anonymous
buyer represented by Boston dealer Stephen B. O'Brien Jr. more than
doubled the previous decoy record of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The goose was one of several hundred decoys in the collection of
Texan James M. McCleery, which sold for a total of $11 million,
twice the presale estimate. A pathologist who enjoyed falconry and
duck hunting as a youth but was confined to a wheelchair in his 20s
by transverse spinal myelitus, McCleery refocused his passion on
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out the best and when he fell in love with one he
wouldn't rest until he had bagged it. He left the collecting world
shaking its head when he paid $10,500 for a long-billed curlew
decoy in 1973, when other hobbiests were paying three figures for
decoys. Last week that curlew sold for $354,500. Though McCleery
died last January, he's still making people shake their head.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the right reasons, the European Union has done the wrong
thing over Austria. Wrong, unnecessary and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, the EU has told one of its
member states how it should conduct its internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of democracy, we have told the Austrians that they
cannot even consider inviting a party that commands 27 percent of
the popular vote into a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of freedom, we have told them that Big Brother
Europe does not permit them to think certain thoughts or cast
certain votes.
</P>
<P>
   However odious Jorg Haider and his party may be (and the man is
a hateful opportunist), this is a dreadful mistake. A philosophical
mistake; and a tactical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   We are not in the 1930s, as the French foreign minister, Hubert
Vedrine, remarked on Monday, before he drew the wrong conclusions
from his own remark.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has a political, economic, social and institutional
stability that it did not have 70 years ago. The far right is a
menace that should be combated by all legitimate political means.
The far right is not an overwhelming threat. There is no need for
hysterical suspension of political wisdom and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union should know its democratic limitations and be
more confident of its own latent power. In the early 21st century,
the European institutions, the European treaties, and the
integration of the European economies erect practical barriers to
the implementation of far-right policies.
</P>
<P>
   Any government in the European Union that tried to enforce
policies of racial hatred, market protection or suppression of
democracy would fall foul of specific European laws and rules. It
would pay a price, in terms of gradual political and economic
exclusion, which would make its own democratic survival doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   An EU statement reminding Austria of these facts would have been
a sensible and legitimate response to the coalition negotiations
between the Christian Democrats and Haider's ``Freedom party.''
</P>
<P>
   We could _ and should _ have said that Austria had a perfect
right to choose its own democratic government. But we could have
warned that any Haider-inspired lapse in its commitment to free
trade, free movement for all European people (and races) and free
speech would be dealt with, severely, within EU law. This would
have been a measured warning from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have tried to bully the Austrians from a position of
weakness. We are telling them that we hold a right of moral veto
over whom they elect and which parties enter their coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   If the Austrians allow Haider's far-right party into power, we
will not talk to their ambassadors, except on ``technical matters''
(in other words on those issues on which we may have something to
lose ourselves).
</P>
<P>
   We will treat them as a pariah nation, like Iran or Iraq (albeit
one that continues to sit in the EU Council of Ministers in
Brussels).
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in EU law, or precedent, to justify such an
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   When Silvio Berlusconi formed a populist right-wing government
in Italy in 1994-5, there were two far-right parties in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A few ministers from other countries refused to shake hands in
Brussels with ministers from the frankly racist Northern League and
the once overtly fascist National Alliance. But there were no
formal EU threats or sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's government soon collapsed, precisely because it was
unable to square the tedious, complex realities of modern political
and economic life with its simple campaign slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Northern League has all but disappeared as a
credible political force, while the National Alliance has been
sucked further into the Europhile, democratic, conservative
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   On this precedent, the best way to check Haider's rise might be
to allow his party to be confronted by the limitations and the
compromises of power.
</P>
<P>
   This may, admittedly, be an oversimplification. All EU countries
(thankfully) are different. In Italy there is an overwhelming
consensus in favor of Europe that does not (yet) exist in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the spectacle of the EU bullying
``little Austria'' when it declined to bully big sister Italy can
only help Haider. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the shrewdest thinkers on European politics, Daniel
Cohn-Bendit, a German who represents France in the European
Parliament (arguably the only genuinely European politician) said
last week: ``If Haider's party joins the government, it would
create a bad smell around Austria but, in truth, nothing much in
Austrian policy would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the EU is seen to try to keep his party out of government,
Haider will get over 40 percent in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma _ to demonize and exclude or to absorb into the
political mainstream _ has faced every European country where there
has been a serious far-right movement over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   It has faced the Germans, the French, the Italians and the
Belgians. The experience is different and inconclusive in each
country. In Germany, the weak and divided far right was demonized
(for obvious historical reasons) and rapidly subsided. In Italy, it
was co-opted and rapidly subsided.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves France and Belgium, the two countries which _ not
coincidentally _ have taken the strongest lead within the EU for
the rustication of Haiderism.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of the mainstream parties in Paris and
Brussels, Haider is a domestic political issue. If his party is
accepted into power in Vienna, it will weaken their arguments
against cooperating with the National Front (and Bruno Megret's
breakaway National Movement) in France and the Vlaams Blok in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jean-Marie Le Pen first became a serious threat in 1984,
the mainstream French parties have tried vilification and
demonization; they have even tried cooperation with the National
Front (at a local level).
</P>
<P>
   Both left and traditional right have tried, cynically, playing
off the NF against their mainstream opposition. Nothing much
worked. The National Front continued to rise until, last year, its
own internal demons blew it apart.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, the extreme Flemish nationalist Vlaams Blok (and its
weaker Francophone doppelganger) are ostracized by all other
parties. They remain a baleful power in a divided land. They will
continue to be so until the linguistic problem _ but also problems
of jobs and popular contempt for mainstream politicians _ are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   What neither the Belgian nor the French respectable parties have
done is banned the far-right parties as unconstitutional or
undemocratic. If they are unwilling _ tactically or morally _ to
take such a step at home, why do they feel justified in declaring
Haider's odious Austrian Freedom Party beyond the pale in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   The far right feeds on brute prejudice; but it also feeds on
unemployment, political corruption and the arrogance and
obfuscation of the perpetual ruling classes of some European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Defeating the European far right must begin with more prosperity
and jobs (some progress already there) and a more open and
accountable political culture (some, limited, progress there). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to be deeply concerned about the rise of
Haiderism in Austria. The other EU countries had a right, and duty,
to react in a measured way. But direct democracy remains, legally
and morally, the preserve of the member states.
</P>
<P>
   The EU does not (yet) have direct popular support and
accountability _ nor the legal basis _ to interfere in the internal
politics of its members.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian people's party (the Christian Democrats) are wrong
to consider a coalition with Jorg Haider. The Christian Democrats
may hope to swallow Haider; he hopes to swallow them.
</P>
<P>
   The EU should crack down harshly on any act of such a government
that breaks European Union laws or principles.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it is for the Austrian people, and for
democratically elected Austrian politicians, to decide who sits in
an Austrian government. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ A few short months ago, President Hafez Assad of Syria
and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel were cloaking each other in
words of honor. Trust, strength, courage. American ``peacemakers''
cooed like children.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Israeli dead are being brought home from Lebanon
again, their allies destroyed daily, their bombs falling again
around the Lebanese hill villages east of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   And Tishrin, the Syrian government newspaper that has always
praised President Assad's ``strategic choice'' of peace has joined
the chorus of Jewish Holocaust deniers.
</P>
<P>
   The three Israeli troops, a major and two corporals, killed in a
Hezbollah ambush on Monday provoked the usual demands by soldiers'
mothers for an immediate withdrawal from Lebanon _ which is also,
of course, the demand of Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But the extraordinary editorial in Tishrin seemed designed to
infuriate Israel which, according to the paper, had convened the
Stockholm Holocaust conference to further Jewish ``lies'' about the
Holocaust in the face of ``credible'' voices which questioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Among these voices, Tishrin announced, was the British historian
David Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does Israel insist on bringing up this alleged Holocaust
policy?'' Mohamed Kheir al-Wadi, the editor, wrote. ``I believe
Israel and the Zionist organizations have two aims: the first is to
receive more money from Germany and other western establishments on
the pretext of compensation for the Holocaust. The second aim is to
benefit from the myth of the Holocaust and accuse anyone opposed to
Zionism and its expansionist policies of anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Zionism, al-Wadi added, ``invents stories about the Holocaust
and exaggerates them to astronomical levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said that the article did
not deserve a response although U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called it ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Syria has long denied the facts of the Jewish genocide,
allowing its own defense minister to run a publishing house which
has printed an Arabic edition of that hoary old forgery, ``The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion.''
</P>
<P>
   When a French academic who has questioned the figure of six
million Jewish dead visited Damascus two years ago, he was warmly
embraced by the foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara _ who last month
conducted peace talks with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians, it seems, believe the Israelis are betraying their
original offer of a retreat from the occupied Golan Heights by
demanding a peace treaty before withdrawal _ the trap into which
PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat fell.
</P>
<P>
   And when Syria is upset, it gets very angry indeed. Hence its
dismissal of Barak's appeal for Syrian restraint on Hezbollah _
though Israel offered no restraint on its own proxy South Lebanon
Army militia. Hence the continued guerrilla attacks in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Syria was the location for much of the world's first
genocide, the mass murder of one and a half million Armenians by
the Turks in 1915. Syria does not deny this Holocaust, but Turkey
does _ in exactly the same words used by the Syrians about the
Jewish Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish ambassador to Israel says that ``the myth of the
Armenian Holocaust was created... with the hope that the Armenians
could be rewarded for their `sufferings.''' Al-Wadi says the
``myth'' of the Jewish Holocaust was ``to receive more money... on
the pretext of compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   No mention from al-Wadi of a certain Grand Mufti of Jerusalem
who urged Hitler to prevent the Jews of Europe from reaching
Palestine. Nor from the Turkish ambassador is there a squeak about
Turkey's refusal to join the Allied war against Nazi Germany. &QL;

 &HT;    NEXT ISSUE FOR JERUSALEM: How to resolve the disputed city?
 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   ABU DIS, West Bank _ The hulking, unfinished building in this
Arab neighborhood holds mysteries that could help make peace.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what is it for, and just what city is it in?
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million shell, built by the Palestinian Authority, is
called an economic studies center. But inside, it has a two-tiered
auditorium that would make a perfect legislative chamber for, say,
a Palestinian capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   It has a view of the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock Mosque,
smack in the center of Jerusalem. But, the construction was allowed
because it is just over the city line, on West Bank land under
partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   If peace requires, however, this building could be in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the map, the line is very thick,'' jokes project engineer
Hussam Musa. ``So, the whole building could be in Jerusalem or it
could be in the West Bank, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The building is the centerpiece of one plan for settling the
dispute over Jerusalem. Let the Palestinians put their capital
here, the idea goes, and call the city by the Arabic name for
Jerusalem, ``Al Quds'' _ the ``Holy.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and cautiously this month, negotiators are reviewing
these types of options.
</P>
<P>
   They have kept their talks secret. Leaks of concessions by
either side could send their respective publics into a fury that
would set back the whole process. Recent months have seen trial
balloons floated by minor officials and meetings of academics,
exploring possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines of the Oslo peace process are approaching. The
outline of a deal for Jerusalem and other remaining major issues is
due this month and a final deal is due in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 13 deadline will almost surely be missed. But, the
activity hints at the possibility of a peaceful solution for what
many have long considered an unsolvable problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that Jerusalem will be a real impediment,''
said Israeli Minister of Justice Yossi Beilin, who helped conceive
the Abu Dis proposal. ``There are about 107 solutions for
Jerusalem. I'm sure that one of them will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The plans offer a variety of schemes. Some suggest giving Arab
neighborhoods local control, but keeping them formally under
Israeli sovereignty. Some place the ancient, walled Old City of
Jerusalem under international administration. Some cede land, along
with authority, to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as the Abu Dis plan, are backed by some Israelis as
the so-called ``expand and share'' concept: Widen Jerusalem's
boundaries, then give parts away.
</P>
<P>
   That approach likely won't work with Palestinians, most of whom
aren't willing to base their national dreams on the ``thick line''
of a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is not a building. Jerusalem is all its holy
sites,'' says 52-year-old Palestinian metalworker Abu Khaled
Aloush. ``If the generation of today cannot liberate Jerusalem,
they will accept what is offered sadly and the coming generation
will liberate it.''
</P>
<P>
   If any plan is accepted, it will have to negotiate the seemingly
irreconcilable positions the two sides have staked out. It will
also likely take a change in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other facets of the peace negotiations, the question of
Jerusalem is not just a security matter that can be solved by
guards and fences.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis and Palestinians, Jerusalem is a religious focal
point and a cultural touchstone, as well as a political symbol.
Palestinians say there can be no peace until they have part of
Jerusalem. Israelis say all of Jerusalem is theirs forever.
</P>
<P>
   The city's ancient center, the Old City, is home to the site
where two sacred Jewish temples were built and destroyed before 70
A.D. Jews pray now at the sacred Western Wall near the temple site.
</P>
<P>
   That site itself is now home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, where the
Muslim prophet Mohammed prayed before he is believed to have
ascended to heaven from a spot nearby, now under the Dome of the
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat stresses Jerusalem as the
fulfillment of the national dream. Most Palestinian offices and
stores hang pictures of the dome.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Jerusalem's approximately 600,000 people are
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has controlled the western half of Jerusalem since the
1948 war. When the United Nations proposed making it an
international city in 1949, the Israelis decided to firm up their
claim by placing their government there, instead of in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, they have called it their ``eternal capital.'' In
1967, they captured the rest of the city from the Jordanians and it
became commonly called the ``eternal, undivided, capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli pollster Hanoch Smith said that about 85 percent of
Israelis favor keeping Jerusalem completely under Israeli control.
But, he said that majority may soften if a specific plan is offered
and peace is the reward.
</P>
<P>
   The minority has been trying to lay the groundwork for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, 10 Israelis endorsed a joint statement with
Palestinians, Egyptians and Jordanians calling for a shared city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that there is really no hope for
Palestinian-Israeli peace if the rights of the Palestinians in
Jerusalem are not recognized,'' said Shimon Shamir, a member of the
group who has served as Israel's ambassador to Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir notes that Israelis used to refuse to deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, but now they do. They used to
have a large majority against a Palestinian state, now the country
is split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a member of Israel's Likud Party, long opposed to
sovereignty for Palestinians in Jerusalem, said he could accept an
Abu Dis-type solution.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament Member Michael Eitan said a government center in Abu
Dis would give Palestinians proximity to Jerusalem without actually
giving them a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly rebuked by others in his party. They said the
plan would endanger the safety of Israelis who, over the years,
have wedged their way between Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible mistake,'' said Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert. ``This is an invitation for almost inevitable
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   For those supporting a Jerusalem compromise, the important thing
was that it was being debated.

&HT;     AWAITING JUSTICE FROM AL SHARPTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Rev. Al Sharpton was saying one of the cops
publicly apologized to the Diallo family. That's fine. But more
than an apology is required.
</P>
<P>
   What are we going to do _ open the jail, let everybody express
regrets and send them home?
</P>
<P>
   This was Tuesday night at Ristorante Pagliacci. Sharpton was
addressing the leftish Robert F. Kennedy Democratic Club. The topic
was the shooting death of an innocent, unarmed man by four New York
City police officers who are on trial for murder at the Albany
County Courthouse, a few blocks away. Sharpton was at his best _
funny, perceptive. He was right, too. Apologies don't restore
lives. They can help, though.
</P>
<P>
   I raised my hand and asked him, ``When are you going to
apologize to Steve Pagones?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't deserve an apology,'' Sharpton snapped back.
Sharpton said he'd believed a 15-year-old girl. He'd acted in good
faith, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   What does he think today of Steve Pagones' involvement in the
Tawana Brawley case? That's when the facade cracked. Sharpton
flatly refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, this guy addressed a flock of jailbirds at
Riker's Island, the biggest New York City jail. Sharpton pleaded
with these kids _ and that's who Rikers inmates tend to be,
minority kids facing a stacked deck. Life is God's most precious
gift, Sharpton told them. Don't create it carelessly. Don't throw
it away on junk and jive. Be men. They were wise words.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is a uniquely gifted man _ bright, articulate and
shrewd. At the same time, his career as one of the country's
leading spokesmen for the powerless and the oppressed suffers from
root rot. That's the Tawana Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the girl went to
visit a boyfriend in prison and stayed away three days. When she
came home, she told her parents that she'd been abducted and raped
by white guys. She was pretty sure they were cops.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Alton Maddox and Vernon Mason, New York City lawyers, and
Sharpton, who served as the public voice of the Brawley family and
its legal team. Before long, this crowd was accusing Pagones, a
young Dutchess County assistant district attorney, of kidnapping
and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Although a grand jury found that Brawley had concocted her
story, Sharpton, Mason and Maddox wouldn't recant their baseless
slander against Pagones. They dared him to sue. Finally, fearing
that neither he nor his family would ever really be safe until he
cleared his name, Pagones did just that.
</P>
<P>
   A civil jury awarded Pagones a judgment of several hundred
thousand dollars. Mason and Maddox, by then barred from the
practice of law, didn't have the money, and Sharpton wasn't about
to come up with it. All Pagones really wanted, though, was
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three would admit that Pagones had been wronged.
None would do the fair and decent thing on behalf of a man who'd
committed no sin against Tawana Brawley or anybody else.
Ultimately, Pagones lost his government job for pursuing the case.
Then his wife left him, fearful for the safety of their children if
the family stayed together.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sharpton defends the false accusation that literally
ruined the life of an honorable man who'd done no wrong. No matter
what else he has done or will do, good or bad, Sharpton always must
be judged by that shameless denial of justice. Jane Fonda went to
Hanoi. George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door. Al Sharpton
clings to a fallacious, demonstrably evil charge.
</P>
<P>
   That will be Sharpton's lifelong burden unless he decides,
finally, to set it down, recant the false accusation and get right
with the truth. He won't, though. Sharpton lacks the charity,
integrity and character to grant justice to Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharpton trains his demonstrators to chant, no justice, no
peace.
</P>

 &HT;    IN FIGHTING AGAINST CHECHEN REBELS, KIDS BECOME RUSSIA'S WAR
VICTIMS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Feb. 6 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yusup Magomedov woke up feeling a bit stir-crazy.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, the lanky, sandy-haired teen-ager had been
cooped up with his mother and three sisters in their two-room
wooden house in the village of Novi Sharoi, about 20 miles from the
Chechen capital Grozny. The village elders had closed school,
fearing the Russian warplanes that screeched overhead on their
bombing runs of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But that October morning, Yusup begged his mother to let him go
outside to play soccer with his friends. While cautious, Leila
Magomedov also was determined not to allow the fighting to
completely disrupt her family's routine. So, with a crisp morning
sun streaming through the kitchen window, she swallowed a feeling
of dread and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, an explosion rocked the town
square where Yusup and his friends had gone to play. The Russian
artillery shell killed seven children immediately and wounded 14
others, including Yusup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, laying in a bed in a crowded hospital room in Moscow, Yusup
is a bit stir-crazy again, restless with all the undirected energy
of a 14-year-old. But he won't be pleading with his mother again to
go outside to play soccer. He no longer has legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army says its four-month old offensive in Chechnya
is aimed at eliminating terrorists and bandits. The Kremlin not
only denies targeting civilians in the war but also insists it is
protecting civilians like Yusup and his family, and providing
adequate medical care and other humanitarian assistance to the
200,000 Chechens uprooted by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities will not say whether the shell that tore up
Yusup's legs on Oct. 23 was an accident or part of a planned strike
on Novi Sharoi.
</P>
<P>
   But the army has been accused of other attacks on civilians. On
Oct. 21, Russian jets bombed the central food market in downtown
Grozny. On Nov. 1, Russian jets strafed a Red Cross convoy carrying
aid workers and wounded civilians from the front-lines to refugee
camps in neighboring Ingushetia. The latter attack killed 27.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, while visiting
Russia last week, joined the chorus of international criticism of
Russia's conduct of the war against separatists in its rebellious
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there has been an incredible amount of misery
injected upon the civilian population of Chechnya,'' she said last
Monday at the start of three days of talks with Russian officials
in Moscow. ``There has been excessive force used and civilians have
been, I think, indiscriminately targeted in a way that has
broadened and widened the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Yusup, U.S. condemnations of Russia's military
tactics in Chechnya are a case of too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I awoke and everything was covered in blood,'' he recalled
last week from a hospital bed here in the Russian capital, as he
wrapped his slender fingers around the angry pink stumps where his
knees used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After the blast, relatives and neighbors rushed him, his mom and
the other wounded children to the nearest hospital in the town of
Urus Martin, 15 minutes away, leaving his three sisters behind in
the care of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The exhausted doctors, already overwhelmed by wounded, told
Yusup's mother they had no anesthesia or electricity to perform an
operation to save her son's legs.
</P>
<P>
   She had one chance, they said. If she could make it in 24 hours
to Sleptsovsk, the major border crossing between Chechnya and
Ingushetia and the location of the region's largest hospital, there
was hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Oct. 23 was the day the Russians stepped up air raids
against rebel strongholds in Grozny and elsewhere in central
Chechnya, near Urus Martin. Russian authorities also had shut the
Sleptsovsk border crossing, trapping non-combatants in a war zone,
a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, Leila and Yusup cowered in the basement as Russian
bombs rained down around Urus Martin. Gangrene set in to Yusup's
shredded legs, forcing doctors sharing the hiding place to amputate
them with a kitchen knife. just above the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Yusup slipped in and out of consciousness, with doctors once
even pronouncing him dead. But the soft-spoken boy wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, Leila made a dash for the border in a borrowed car
and succeeded in getting to the refugee hospital in Sleptsovsk.
There, doctors operated on him, cleaning his wounds and saving what
remained of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   His 14th birthday was spent in the hospital, where he learned
for the first time that his best friend Sultan had been killed in
the Oct. 23 attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was all too much, and finally, he cried, Leila recalled. ``I
asked him if it was because of the pain. 'No,' he said. 'It's
because of everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Yusup recuperated, the doctors told Leila that if her son
was ever going to walk again, he would need yet a third operation,
one available only in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Big problems still stood in the way. First, the two had no money
to fly the 1,000 miles to Moscow or to pay for the cost of the
hospital stay. Second, Leila hadn't seen her three daughters in
almost one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my son die, come back to life, and I was worried
sick about where my girls were,'' Leila said, tears welling in her
tired eyes. ``A mother shouldn't have to make the choice of leaving
some children to save another.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian journalist rescued her from at least one horrible
plight. Vera Kuznetsova contacted acquaintances at the Russian
Health Ministry and through them, found Moscow doctors willing to
operate on Yusup's legs so he could be fitted with prostheses and
allow the two to stay in a rehabilitation clinic free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Yusup is settled in a wing of the Central Russian Republic
Children's' Hospital on the southern edge of Moscow, learning to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fragile, jerky process as his awkward teen-age body
climbs from a wheelchair and balances on the robot-colored metal
sticks. With all the resilience of someone who believes he has seen
the worst, Yusup views the challenge as part of another great
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys (physical therapists) say I gotta take it easy,'' he
says. ``They warned me it would be painful when I took my first
step. But when I did it, I laughed and said this is nothing
compared to the pain I've felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, minds mend at a different pace than bodies. A
psychologist meets with Yusup and his mother each week to talk
about their nightmare. While Yusup talks easily of his ordeal, he
secretly worries that his mother is having a more difficult time
coping than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Out of earshot of her son, Leila allows some pessimism about a
war no counselor can settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and these rebels will fight ... until we are all dead.
They won't sit together (in peace talks) by themselves. They need
to be pushed. It doesn't look like the United States is going to
push them together so who knows what will happen,'' she says,
wearily brushing a wan piece of hair that has fallen across her
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my neighbors are all sick and hurting. We don't need
independence, We need peace,'' Leila added.
</P>
<P>
   What unsettles Yusup most is not knowing if the rest of his
family has survived. He says he doesn't know when he is going home,
let alone what home will look like when the war ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say it, but I miss my sisters,'' he said.
``And our cow Sida, she's quite a star. The whole village used to
feed her. I hope they're feeding her while we're gone.''

 &HT;    IN FIGHTING AGAINST CHECHEN REBELS, KIDS BECOME RUSSIA'S WAR
VICTIMS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yusup Magomedov woke up feeling a bit stir-crazy.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, the lanky, sandy-haired teen-ager had been
cooped up with his mother and three sisters in their two-room
wooden house in the village of Novi Sharoi, about 20 miles from the
Chechen capital Grozny. The village elders had closed school,
fearing the Russian warplanes that screeched overhead on their
bombing runs of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But that October morning, Yusup begged his mother to let him go
outside to play soccer with his friends. While cautious, Leila
Magomedov also was determined not to allow the fighting to
completely disrupt her family's routine. So, with a crisp morning
sun streaming through the kitchen window, she swallowed a feeling
of dread and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, an explosion rocked the town
square where Yusup and his friends had gone to play. The Russian
artillery shell killed seven children immediately and wounded 14
others, including Yusup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, laying in a bed in a crowded hospital room in Moscow, Yusup
is a bit stir-crazy again, restless with all the undirected energy
of a 14-year-old. But he won't be pleading with his mother again to
go outside to play soccer. He no longer has legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army says its four-month old offensive in Chechnya
is aimed at eliminating terrorists and bandits. The Kremlin not
only denies targeting civilians in the war but also insists it is
protecting civilians like Yusup and his family, and providing
adequate medical care and other humanitarian assistance to the
200,000 Chechens uprooted by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities will not say whether the shell that tore up
Yusup's legs on Oct. 23 was an accident or part of a planned strike
on Novi Sharoi.
</P>
<P>
   But the army has been accused of other attacks on civilians. On
Oct. 21, Russian jets bombed the central food market in downtown
Grozny. On Nov. 1, Russian jets strafed a Red Cross convoy carrying
aid workers and wounded civilians from the front-lines to refugee
camps in neighboring Ingushetia. The latter attack killed 27.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, while visiting
Russia last week, joined the chorus of international criticism of
Russia's conduct of the war against separatists in its rebellious
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that there has been an incredible amount of misery
injected upon the civilian population of Chechnya,'' she said last
Monday at the start of three days of talks with Russian officials
in Moscow. ``There has been excessive force used and civilians have
been, I think, indiscriminately targeted in a way that has
broadened and widened the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Yusup, U.S. condemnations of Russia's military
tactics in Chechnya are a case of too little, too late.

reported Thursday he had

primary victory Tuesday as he had in his entire campaign up to
then. The flood of online money means McCain won't have to wait to

<P>
   VODAFONE-MANNESMANN (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Two of Europe's
wireless giants, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain and Mannesmann of
Germany agree to a cross-border combination that would have been
unthinkable just a year ago. The deal _ worth at least $180
billion, the biggest corporate deal ever, topping the $165 billion
deal between AOL and Time Warner _ is the starkest illustration yet
of how far Europe has come in terms of embracing an open, regional
economy and the new technologies that are revolutionizing
communications. Vodafone, which only acquired AirTouch of
California about a year ago, will control the new company, and its
executive Chris Gent, will be chief executive. Mannesmann, which
had fought a hostile bid from Vodafone for more than two months,
ends up getting a slightly larger stake than proposed earlier. By
Edmund L. Andrews and Andrew Ross Sorkin.

   VODAFONE-DUSSELDORF (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Dusseldorf, once a
gritty steel town, has transformed itself into a symbol of the
emerging new Germany economy, in large part because of Mannesmann.
Why this deal illustrates Europe's latest transformation: its
economy is undergoing a wave of takeovers that have crossed borders
and have come without political intervention, and is increasingly
being driven by wireless technology and the Internet.

SHARON STONE STRETCHES IN `SIMPATICO'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Stone wants to play doctor. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, she flings herself onto a couch at the Meridian
Hotel in Beverly Hills, crosses the very substantial part of her
long legs left uncovered by her short, tight skirt, and begins
impersonating a severe headcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past three weeks, since I've seen you last, doctor
...,'' Stone begins in a mock-sincere voice. Her female assistant
giggles.
</P>
<P>
   OK Sharon, we'll show that we're a good sport. So tell us about
your father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was'' _ Stone pauses for dramatic effect _ ``well,
my father was one of the Rockettes.'' Huh. Must be where she got
those gams.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as suddenly, Sharon Stone is thoughtful, forthright,
insightful.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has turned to Sam Shepard, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright whose 1994 drama ``Simpatico'' has
recently been released as a feature film starring Stone, Nick
Nolte, Jeff Bridges and Albert Finney. After opening in December,
just under the Oscar-qualifying wire, the film will move into wider
distribution this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Stone plays the distaff side of a shattered love
triangle, whose now middle-age participants have been struggling to
come to terms with a crime they committed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stone professes great admiration for Shepard, the prolific
author-actor (``The Right Stuff'') whose lyrical, laconic style has
contributed to one of the most substantial and acclaimed bodies of
work in postwar American literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think Sam Shepard is just tops,'' Stone says,
``because he's articulate, he's highly intelligent, yet he
approaches the work from an emotional point of view. He does
deeply, devastatingly dramatic work with hilarious jokes all
through it. But they're not yuk-yuk jokes. They're jokes that
reflect the underbelly of our humanity. So they're ironic and
revealing simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like, well, Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more enigmatic screen presences in Hollywood these
days, Stone is a performer who offers more in person than sometimes
meets the eye, though what meets the eye is by no means offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she caught the  &UR; i &LR; ndustry's attention with her
hair-raising, midriff-baring performance as Arnold Schwarzenegger's
treacherous wife in Paul Verhoeven's ``Total Recall'' (1990), Stone
has made the most of her seductive persona in movies like
``Sliver,'' ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the glossy perfection of her appearance may have limited her
career in other ways. Like many actors blessed with exceptional
cheek bones and low body-fat ratios, Stone has worked hard to be
judged by her acting ability, seeking out such mettle-testing roles
as a divine spirit in Albert Brooks' comedy ``The Muse,'' a plucky
parent in the inspirational children's fantasy ``The Mighty''
(which she also executive produced) and, most memorably, a grasping
gangster's moll in Martin Scorsese's violent Las Vegas melodrama
``Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   While asking Stone to look truly terrible in a movie is a bit
like asking the Hollywood sign to spell out ``Peoria,'' her stock
as an actress seems to go up whenever she de-glamorizes herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' has the potential to extend that streak by casting
Stone as Rosie, the dissatisfied, boozing wife of Lyle Carter
(Bridges), a millionaire Kentucky thoroughbred race-horse breeder
and owner. It's the kind of small, juicy character role that gets
studio publicists working overtime to stir up Best Supporting
Actress pre-Oscar buzz.
</P>
<P>
   It also has Stone's collaborators speaking admiringly of her
performance as a gutsy, forward-looking career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon is obviously at a point in her life where her future is
going to be as a character actress, and I think a really wonderful
character actress actually,'' says Matthew Warchus, the young,
much-feted British stage director who helmed ``Simpatico'' and
co-wrote its screenplay. ``And this was a sort of great bridging
role into that new acting for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Warchus' reimagining of Shepard's bittersweet tragi-omedy
expands the narrative scope of the play while pruning some of its
philosopical ideas into more manageable form and eliminating some
of its stage mechanics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie flashes back and forth across 25 years to
Cucamonga, Calif., we learn that Rosie, Carter and their estranged
friend Vinnie (Nolte), now a deluded barfly, once took part in a
scam to swap fast race horses for slower ones and bet against the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   When the trio subsequently blackmailed a race track commissioner
(Finney) who'd uncovered the scam, they unleashed a sequence of
events that wrecked their friendship and left each of them with
painful scars that now must be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone's screen time is relatively brief, compared with
that of her co-stars, her two big scenes are emotionally intense
and tightly compacted. They required the actress to plumb
psychological depths as deep as any in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really took sky-diving into the deep end of the pool to do
it for me, like it did for `Casino,''' she says. ``I got really
wacky, like I did on `Casino.' I think I'm very difficult to be
around when I play these people, because I can't shake them, but
I'm not not myself, you know? I'm still me. And so I feel
emotionally unwell the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ah yes, Ms. Stone, you have vat ve in ze psychoanalytic world
refer to as `wackophobia.' Not to vorry, is very common thing here
in L.A. Take two screenplays und call me in ze morning.)
</P>
<P>
   Seriously though _ when she gets this way, does Stone give fair
warning to those around her so they can be prepared, or just get
out of the way?
</P>
<P>
   Stone is frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I learned my lesson on `Casino,''' she says. ``Now I go
in (and) I put my team together _ not the whole (film) crew, but
the people I work with directly: hair, makeup, wardrobe, the
director's assistant, the production assistant, the people that are
just going to be right on me _ and say, `I have no ability to
maintain any sort of gracious social behavior. I'm going to be
weird. I might be mean. I'm sorry, in advance. Please know that
anything I do that's inappropriate is a result of my working toward
this character and I just don't have time to worry about the other
things. I won't be able to do both. I'm not good enough. So this is
what it is. Are we all in agreement?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get on with it, and then at the end I sit everybody
back down together, thank them, apologize for anything I've done
that is bizarre or hurtful or was not thoughtful at the time, and
thank them for helping me bring something dangerous to the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stone says, it was Warchus' remarkable
self-assurance as a first-time feature film director, and their
warm personal rapport, that freed her to concentrate on the role's
extreme demands.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Stone was fascinated to learn that Warchus' father
is an Episcopalian priest who performs exorcisms. From there she
and Warchus formed the idea of treating her part as an exorcism of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that exorcism took place both on-screen and
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the movie last night and it's about the third
time I've seen it,'' Stone recalls. ``And suddenly there was a
certain point ... (when) I thought, `I'm not the girl in the tight
dress. I'm not that girl.' And I had that moment of pause. And I
thought, `Fabulous! This is great.' Because I !ital!was that girl.
I was the girl in the bikini in the Coppertone ad. To me this is
like a dream, that I've actually learned my job and get to do this
really wonderful stuff. It's just, you know, what a life!''
</P>
<P>
   No need for a doctor in the house, thank you. Sharon Stone is
doing just fine.

COLOR THIS MONITOR KAPUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR  EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have a color problem with my monitor. The
screen turns a medium shade of pink. Tech support suggested I use
the demagnetizer, which I dutifully did. The screen trembled for a
few seconds, but the problem is still there. I can occasionally
make it go away by whapping the monitor on the side. _ Pink Lady
</P>
<P>
   Dear Pink: At last! Somebody who understands the true nature of
computers. The only thing these little beasties understand is pure,
brute force. My own computer trembles in fear at the sight of a
clenched fist, and my monitor breaks out in a cold sweat if I so
much as frown in its general direction. They know from cruel
experience they'd better not fail me.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a poke at your monitor may be extremely satisfying, and
it may even appear to fix things for a while, but there's an
underlying problem that's not being addressed: There's an
electronic thingie deep inside that's either going bad or not
functioning the way it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The ``demagnetizer'' _ actually a degausser _ is supposed to get
rid of any stray magnetic fields distorting the paths of electrons
on their merry way to lighting up screen phosphors in the right
combinations to make all those pretty colors. That sort of thing
usually shows up as random blotches of color on the screen. If
everything turns uniformly pink, that's not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the problem is with the guns that spit out those
electrons or the gadgets that control them, and that runs into
money.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could put the thing in the shop, but get an
estimate, because you'll probably spend as much getting it fixed as
it would take to buy a new monitor. I think I'd start shopping for
a new one. Of course, I have virtually unlimited disposable income.
Or at least the credit card goons haven't caught up with me yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: We purchased the game .MDNM/Rogue Spear.MDNM/
and have found that our S3 Trio video card is not capable of
keeping up with the graphics, so the game crashes or freezes. What
would you suggest? _ Spearless
</P>
<P>
   Dear Spearless: How about going back to Pong? You won't like the
real answer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm assuming, of course, you've already checked for a software
patch or solution at www.redstorm.com, the publisher's site.
According to what I read there, the only S3 card that .MDNM/Rogue
Spear.MDNM/ supports is the Savage3D. You could always try
downloading the latest Trio drivers from www.s3.com to see if it
makes any difference. It probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   You have to read the fine print on game boxes very carefully
these days. Most new stuff requires 3D acceleration plus a ton of
memory to give you decent gameplay. Even the games that play under
DirectX, where software does some of the graphics and animation
work, may require a 3D video card to do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say which model Trio you have, but I'm guessing it's
a middle-of-the-road workhorse, not a gaming card. You could get an
inexpensive add-on accelerator, but it'll take up another slot in
your computer, and the 3D rendering may leave you wishing you
hadn't tried to solve the problem so cheaply. For a hundred bucks
or less, though, you can get something like a Voodoo 3 2000, which
will do an adequate job with most games. If you're a gaming maniac,
the best cards go for around $300, but try explaining that to your
spouse.
</P>
<P>

spouse, just several angry creditors. Send your Chapter 7 advice to

   PHOENIX _ In Arizona politics, everybody has a favorite John
McCain story. One of them goes like this.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, having just moved to the state to begin his political
career, McCain was engaged in a bitter race for a seat in Congress.
One of his opponents called his ex-wife, fishing for dirt about the
candidate. When he heard of this, McCain cornered the man at a
gathering and told him: ``I want you to know that, campaign aside,
politics aside, you ever do anything like that again, anything
against a person in my family, I will personally beat the (crap)
out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's temper is much in the news these days. It all
began in Arizona, where the governor, Jane Hull, has bucked
tradition by endorsing George W. Bush rather than the senator from
her own state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull told an interviewer that her relationship with McCain
was ``not particularly warm,'' and recounted the several times she
had felt the lash of his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, a withering editorial appeared in the Arizona
Republic (a paper that has often sparred with the senator) which
noted how often he had called reporters ``liars'' and ``idiots''
and concluded by asking ``whether McCain has the temperament, and
the political approach and skills, we want in the next president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A volcanic temper is hardly uncommon in American politics, let
alone among American presidents (the present incumbent has had
plenty of beet-red moments). Yet it poses a sizeable problem for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Following his stunning victory this week in the New Hampshire
primary, he is now widely seen as the most formidable challenger to
Bush; but it is not good to be trailing Bush in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's primary, on Feb. 22, is essential to McCain's hope of
ambushing the Texas governor early in the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, a candidate can usually rely on a
primary victory in his home state. Yet Arizona is anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, over the past decade the state has drawn in a
great influx of immigrants from California and the East Coast. The
local football team, the Arizona Cardinals, often finds the
cheering in its own stadium louder for the other side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is discovering that having an Arizona address is not
necessarily a seal of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Larger forces may also be contributing to his troubles.
According to Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University, the national news media now dominate politics,
rendering a local advantage virtually irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Arizonans form their political opinions by
watching the same news programs as the rest of America, and
statewide polling largely mirrors polling for the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the troubling political implications of a close race in
Arizona, there are also serious financial considerations. McCain
will now have to devote precious money just to secure a victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a name known throughout the state and three landslide
Senate victories under his belt, he will need to spend far less in
Arizona than he has devoted to New Hampshire and South Carolina
(the other early primary on which he rests his hopes); yet even a
moderately costly Arizona campaign could drain his coffers for what
comes afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull's endorsement of Bush was probably for political
rather than personal reasons. A moderate Republican with a lot of
Democratic support, she is cut from much the same ideological cloth
as Bush, and the two have worked closely together on policy
concerning the border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may her preferences make much difference. Voters who turn
out at the primaries tend to be more conservative than the general
electorate, so the centrist Mrs. Hull may do little to enlarge
Bush's base of support.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he has enlisted the help of a network of Arizona
politicians, including the popular speaker of the state's House, to
strengthen his position with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He still has plenty of fans there, some of whom even appreciate
his temper. As Mark Spitzer, an Arizona state senator, says, ``You
damn well know where you stand with the guy.'' &QL;

 2000 NISSAN FRONTIER CREW CAB: TIME FOR A CHANGE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an example of how fast things are changing in the auto
industry, you have to go only as far as the new Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Models that once had a showroom life of five years _ or seven
for many trucks _ are now evolving in about half that time.
Nissan's Frontier pickup trucks, particularly its four-door Crew
Cab, are glaring examples.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier, rigid framed and rough riding, was introduced in
1997. Last year, the Crew Cab, the first compact pickup with four
full doors and a real back seat, came to market. Already, Nissan
has acknowledged, the line has to be overhauled. Things are
changing that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan had hoped to get to 2004 with the Frontier platform but
now it's looking for a remake by 2002, and if they want to stay
competitive in a pickup market that has become a caldron of change,
they'd better make that date.
</P>
<P>
   The platform has been leapfrogged, its engine _ 170 horses from
a V6 _ is too weak in a market where power sells, and others _
Dodge Dakota, Toyota Tundra, Ford F150 SuperCab _ have blown by the
Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier Crew Cab is a competent truck, but that's not good
enough anymore. And that's too bad, because stepping out first with
the four-door concept was cutting edge at the time. But it
unfortunately melded that four-door cab, and a tiny bed, with
outdated technology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, other trucks offer far more power, more comfort, a better
ride, and much larger beds.
</P>
<P>
   What does work in Nissan's Xterra _ going retro as a basic SUV _
doesn't work in its truck, which competes in a category where
consumers want truck capabilities coupled with car-like comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the motor. One-hundred-seventy horsepower out
of a V6 is simply not enough _ and it only got 17 miles per gallon
in a week of driving. Nissan makes a truly great V6 that cranks out
222 horsepower and puts it in the Maxima. This truck could use an
engine like that.
</P>
<P>
   It's got decent torque at low RPMs _ up to around 1,600 _ but
the curve flattens fast after that. It'll get your load or your
trailer rolling nicely from a start, but leave you chugging up any
steep grades.
</P>
<P>
   That roar you hear from the engine as you climb? It's not the
comforting rumble of power. It's the sound of an engine working too
hard as the four-speed automatic downshifts to maintain speed.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is still a basic box, square in a day of round, smooth
corners. The bed is only 54.7 inches long. Try carrying lumber in
that. A good option is a bed extender (about $225).
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it doesn't get much better.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is decent room in the rear for three adults, and
though the rear doors are a bit narrow, getting in and out is not
the chore it can be in some trucks with rear seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the seats aren't comfortable. The front buckets are flat and
don't offer much support.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments look cheap and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   I understand this is a truck, and Nissan is trying to sell it at
a good price ($17,000 to upward of $21,000), but folks are looking
for more than utility these days, and when it comes to trucks,
they'll pay extra for comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at a good price they offer ABS, air conditioning, full
carpets, a sliding rear window, and a center console with sliding
armrest. But it's all only a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota learned _ after the T100 _ that people want more and so
produced the Tundra, a V8 that is whisper smooth and rolling off
showroom floors as fast as it can be built, even at $5,000 or more
above the Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier Crew Cab is available in both two-wheel- and
four-wheel-drive (I tested the two-wheel version) and puts both
models on the rigid 4WD frame.
</P>
<P>
   For suspension, it's got double wishbone, shocks and stabilizer
bar up front, a rigid axle with multileaf springs and stabilizer at
the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan says this is meant to give it a car-like ride. I say it
rides like a truck. On frost heaves and ridged cement stretches of
highway, the empty bed did a skip-to-ma-loo all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has a fine history in producing trucks, all the way back
to when they were called Datsun. In 1959, they introduced the first
compact pickup in America. In 1975, it was the first long-bed
pickup. Two years later, they made some room behind the front seat
and rolled out the first King Cab. In 1999 it was the four-door,
compact pickup.
</P>
<P>
   But Nissan is a company that got either cautious or stagnant or
both, and today it is in the midst of trying to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   They've said they are looking for a fast makeover of three
models, the Altima, the wonderful Maxima, which has been criticized
only for its looks, and the Frontier series.
</P>
<P>
   And like Toyota, they have a full-size V8 pickup in their
sights, scheduled for the 2003 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is capable of building fine cars and trucks, and if
you're a loyalist, I say give them some time to bounce back from a
less-than-glistening time of design and development.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The bar that runs beneath the driver's seat, which you can
feel every time you hit a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The overall cab design is very nice, offering easy access and
lots of room in a compact truck.

READERS HAVE THEIR SAY _ AND HOW!

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVs and ABS, refrigerators and washing machines, clutches and
skid control, gloves and gouging, speed limits, fun, and flattery.
You hit me with everything but the kitchen sink in your most recent
letters and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Provocation can be productive. Insults can be illuminating.
Banter is best. Here's to rounded repartee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why don't you just come out and admit that you hate SUVs?
Today's article was ridiculous. SUVs are top heavy . . . no
kidding. They don't handle like cars . . . wow, what a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   A. Got to admit, you nailed me on that one. I hate SUVs. But I
wonder, if all this is so obvious, why do so many people insist on
driving them as if they were not top heavy and as if they perform
like low-slung cars?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It is clear from your first few columns this year that you
love SUVs and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   A. Got to admit, you nailed me on that one. I love SUVs. In
truth, many of them are fine vehicles _ my family cars are a
Chevrolet Suburban and a Toyota Tundra pickup truck. SUVs have
their proper uses; trucks have their proper uses. As with any
vehicle, it's who is behind the wheel that matters most. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say you hope that ``someday, somewhere, I see a trooper
pull over a car on the highway because the driver was going so slow
(55 or 65 in the passing lane) and impeding the normal flow of
traffic. Do you understand what you are saying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I am saying that sometimes common sense ought to prevail
over letter of the law. If an entire highway is flowing at 70-75
miles an hour, and someone gets into the passing lane and
single-handedly tries to enforce the law, that person is a yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please stick to your grocery list, 10 top washing machines,
10 top refrigerators, 10 top garbage disposals _ you get my drift?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, my Florida buddy, who keeps suggesting that I don't know
anything about cars. What, too much time on your hands from sunrise
until that Early Bird Special at Denny's? Maybe we can compromise.
After all, Sears once made motorcycles, International Harvester
made refrigerators, and the new Saab has a refrigerated glove
compartment. I see a kitchen appliance/automotive triathalon in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say that you base your reviews of cars on what sort of
driver the car is intended for. You should provide considered and
expert advice, not mouth what people want to hear or to make an
advertising point.
</P>
<P>
   A. As far as I am concerned, considered and expert advice takes
into account both the intent for which a car is designed and the
type of driver who might buy that car. Advertising is a whole other
part of this newspaper, and while I will listen to readers complain
about what I write, the folks in advertising get a deaf ear from me
in that regard. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am old enough to remember the panning of the VW Bug by many
automobile writers, including, to its everlasting shame, Consumer
Reports.
</P>
<P>
   A. I like old Bugs. But try to imagine this today: A new car is
introduced. It has a front end that is nothing more than hollow box
that crumples on impact. Inside that box is a tank full of
gasoline. It has a steering column that is a spear in front-end
collisions. Now, try to sell it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I agree with your review on the Volkswagen Eurovan. It can't
compete with better vans being made. Why don't they just build a
minivan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Volkswagen is considering just that _ bringing back a
nostalgic version of the Microbus. But they've got to overcome one
serious design problem: how to keep that distinctive flat nose and
still pass modern head-on crash tests. My guess is they will do it.
Look what they did with the New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I still consider the glove box to be an anachronism. How many
decades has it been since anyone has seen a pair of gloves in a
glove box?
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree. Let's see if we can't come up with a better name for
that hole in the dash. Stuffbox? Thingholder? Reader input welcome
here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I don't like auto writers who get so jaded they overemphasize
``fun'' in cars, which effectively translates to turbo-charged
engines and low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   A. I was jaded long before I got this job, but I do consider
``fun'' to be a factor that many people consider when buying a car.
Still, it doesn't have to mean big power and high-performance
tires. Three of the most ``fun'' cars I drove last year: the Ford
Focus, the Mazda Miata, and the Xterra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was surprised by your comments on SUV price gouging. If
consumers are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars extra for
a gussied-up truck, that's their problem.
</P>
<P>
   A. True, it's their problem. But long range goodwill is wasted
by dealers who gouge folks $3,000-$10,000 for a car and those same
folks see their neighbors buying the same car a year later at true
cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We almost purchased a Nissan Xterra, but when we went back to
finally buy we were told that the price that had been written down
was ``incorrect'' and it suddenly was $2,000 higher.
</P>
<P>
   A. And how would you have felt had you paid that extra $2,000
and found out your neighbor got it elsewhere at MSRP? Bet that
would be your last Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of you wrote to say that I have mentioned ``skid
control'' in reviews of certain cars and some wondered if it helps
you steer. Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Skid control does not ``steer'' you through a turn. Instead, it
applies front and rear brakes, individually, to reduce the rotation
of some tires while letting others gain speed. This controls yaw
and keeps one corner of your vehicle from trying to get ahead of
another. Computers do the work, you just drive.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent question is whether ABS can stop a car as
quickly as a system that locks up all four brakes and keeps them
that way until it comes to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   There's a swap going on. Straight ahead on a dry road, four
wheels locked up will stop a car faster than ABS, which modulates
braking from wheel-to-wheel so that no wheel locks. Seldom are you
doing an emergency stop under perfect conditions, so the trade-off
_ a slight bit of stopping distance for far more control _ is well
worth it. You can steer a car while its ABS brakes are jammed on;
without ABS, you are steering a log.

&HT;     GREAT NUT MIXES WITHOUT THE CANDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget those salted peanut and cereal concoctions, the nut mixes
of the new millennium use pungent herbs and spices and leave out
fillers like cereal and candy.
</P>
<P>
   They're trendy and tasteful, showing up in gourmet catalogs and
wine bars. And, most importantly, they can be made at home leaving
out preservatives that may be found in commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Making nut mixes is relatively easy. You just need a jellyroll
pan, the nuts of your choosing, some spices, and some oil or butter
to hold it all together.
</P>
<P>
   A jellyroll pan, which is nothing more than a cookie sheet with
one-inch-high sides, is essential equipment for making nut mixes
and comes in handy for toasting nuts as well. The sides of the pan
prevent the nuts from slipping onto the oven floor when you put the
pan in and take it out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, purchase nuts that are shelled, peeled and
unsalted. Nut peels tend to be bitter, so you want to avoid them
whenever possible. Salt adds flavor and quite likely will throw off
the delicate balancing act between the taste of the nuts and the
spices if there is too much of it around. For the same reason, some
nut mix recipes call for unsalted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Some health-food and grocery stores sell nuts in bulk. These are
usually less expensive than prepackaged nuts and, since they sell
each type from a separate bin, you have the advantage of being able
to buy just the nuts you like.
</P>
<P>
   Toasting brings out the flavor of nuts, and this step is usually
achieved by baking the nuts after they've been coated with
seasoning. However, in some recipes, like the one for Curried Nuts,
the mixture is dried instead of baked. If you have the time, you
can enhance this recipe by toasting the nuts before they are
coated.
</P>
<P>
   Simply place the nuts on a jellyroll pan and place in a
325-degree oven until they become lightly browned and fragrant,
about 10 minutes. Stir every few minutes to prevent the nuts from
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Store nut mixes in airtight containers in a cool, dark, dry
place.

   &UR; VODAFONE-MANNESMANN &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   VODAFONE-MANNESMANN (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Two of Europe's
wireless giants, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain and Mannesmann of
Germany agree to a cross-border combination that would have been
unthinkable just a year ago. The deal _ worth at least $180
billion, the biggest corporate deal ever, topping the $165 billion
deal between AOL and Time Warner _ is the starkest illustration yet
of how far Europe has come in terms of embracing an open, regional
economy and the new technologies that are revolutionizing
communications. Vodafone, which only acquired AirTouch of
California about a year ago, will control the new company, and its
executive Chris Gent, will be chief executive. Mannesmann, which
had fought a hostile bid from Vodafone for more than two months,
ends up getting a slightly larger stake than proposed earlier. By
Edmund L. Andrews and Andrew Ross Sorkin.

SHARON STONE STRETCHES IN `SIMPATICO'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: minor edits throughout. Note ITALICS below) 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Stone wants to play doctor. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, she flings herself onto a couch at the Meridian
Hotel in Beverly Hills, crosses the very substantial part of her
long legs left uncovered by her short, tight skirt, and begins
impersonating a severe headcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past three weeks, since I've seen you last, doctor
...,'' Stone begins in a mock-sincere voice. Her female assistant
giggles.
</P>
<P>
   OK Sharon, we'll show that we're a good sport. So tell us about
your father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was'' _ Stone pauses for dramatic effect _ ``well,
my father was one of the Rockettes.'' Huh. Must be where she got
those gams.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as suddenly, Sharon Stone is thoughtful, forthright,
insightful.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has turned to Sam Shepard, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright whose 1994 drama ``Simpatico'' has
recently been released as a feature film starring Stone, Nick
Nolte, Jeff Bridges and Albert Finney. After opening in December,
just under the Oscar-qualifying wire, the film will move into wider
distribution this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Stone plays the distaff side of a shattered love
triangle, whose now middle-age participants have been struggling to
come to terms with a crime they committed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stone professes great admiration for Shepard, the prolific
author-actor (``The Right Stuff'') whose lyrical, laconic style has
contributed to one of the most substantial and acclaimed bodies of
work in postwar American literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think Sam Shepard is just tops,'' Stone says,
``because he's articulate, he's highly intelligent, yet he
approaches the work from an emotional point of view. He does
deeply, devastatingly dramatic work with hilarious jokes all
through it. But they're not yuk-yuk jokes. They're jokes that
reflect the underbelly of our humanity. So they're ironic and
revealing simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like, well, Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more enigmatic screen presences in Hollywood these
days, Stone is a performer who offers more in person than sometimes
meets the eye, though what meets the eye is by no means offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she caught the  &UR; i &LR; ndustry's attention with her
hair-raising, midriff-baring performance as Arnold Schwarzenegger's
treacherous wife in Paul Verhoeven's ``Total Recall'' (1990), Stone
has made the most of her seductive persona in movies like
``Sliver,'' ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the glossy perfection of her appearance may have limited her
career in other ways. Like many actors blessed with exceptional
cheek bones and low body-fat ratios, Stone has worked hard to be
judged by her acting ability, seeking out such mettle-testing roles
as a divine spirit in Albert Brooks' comedy ``The Muse,'' a plucky
parent in the inspirational children's fantasy ``The Mighty''
(which she also executive produced) and, most memorably, a grasping
gangster's moll in Martin Scorsese's violent Las Vegas melodrama
``Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   While asking Stone to look truly terrible in a movie is a bit
like asking the Hollywood sign to spell out ``Peoria,'' her stock
as an actress seems to go up whenever she de-glamorizes herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' has the potential to extend that streak by casting
Stone as Rosie, the dissatisfied, boozing wife of Lyle Carter
(Bridges), a millionaire Kentucky thoroughbred race-horse breeder
and owner. It's the kind of small, juicy character role that gets
studio publicists working overtime to stir up Best Supporting
Actress pre-Oscar buzz.
</P>
<P>
   It also has Stone's collaborators speaking admiringly of her
performance as a gutsy, forward-looking career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon is obviously at a point in her life where her future is
going to be as a character actress, and I think a really wonderful
character actress actually,'' says Matthew Warchus, the young,
much-feted British stage director who helmed ``Simpatico'' and
co-wrote its screenplay. ``And this was a sort of great bridging
role into that new acting for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Warchus' reimagining of Shepard's bittersweet tragicomedy
expands the narrative scope of the play while pruning some of its
philosopical ideas into more manageable form and eliminating some
of its stage mechanics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie flashes back and forth across 25 years to
Cucamonga, Calif., we learn that Rosie, Carter and their estranged
friend Vinnie (Nolte), now a deluded barfly, once took part in a
scam to swap fast race horses for slower ones and bet against the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   When the trio subsequently blackmailed a race track commissioner
(Finney) who'd uncovered the scam, they unleashed a sequence of
events that wrecked their friendship and left each of them with
painful scars that now must be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone's screen time is relatively brief, compared with
that of her co-stars, her two big scenes are emotionally intense
and tightly compacted. They required the actress to plumb
psychological depths as deep as any in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really took sky-diving into the deep end of the pool to do
it for me, like it did for `Casino,''' she says. ``I got really
wacky, like I did on `Casino.' I think I'm very difficult to be
around when I play these people, because I can't shake them, but
I'm not not myself, you know? I'm still me. And so I feel
emotionally unwell the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ah yes, Ms. Stone, you have vat ve in ze psychoanalytic world
refer to as `wackophobia.' Not to vorry, is very common thing here
in L.A. Take two screenplays und call me in ze morning.)
</P>
<P>
   Seriously though _ when she gets this way, does Stone give fair
warning to those around her so they can be prepared, or just get
out of the way?
</P>
<P>
   Stone is frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I learned my lesson on `Casino,''' she says. ``Now I go
in (and) I put my team together _ not the whole (film) crew, but
the people I work with directly: hair, makeup, wardrobe, the
director's assistant, the production assistant, the people that are
just going to be right on me _ and say, `I have no ability to
maintain any sort of gracious social behavior. I'm going to be
weird. I might be mean. I'm sorry, in advance. Please know that
anything I do that's inappropriate is a result of my working toward
this character, and I just don't have time to worry about the other
things. I won't be able to do both. I'm not good enough. So this is
what it is. Are we all in agreement?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get on with it, and then at the end I sit everybody
back down together, thank them, apologize for anything I've done
that is bizarre or hurtful or was not thoughtful at the time, and
thank them for helping me bring something dangerous to the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stone says, it was Warchus' remarkable
self-assurance as a first-time feature film director, and their
warm personal rapport, that freed her to concentrate on the role's
extreme demands.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Stone was fascinated to learn that Warchus' father
is an Episcopal priest who performs exorcisms. From there, she and
Warchus formed the idea of treating her part as an exorcism of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that exorcism took place both on-screen and
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the movie last night, and it's about the third
time I've seen it,'' Stone recalls. ``And suddenly there was a
certain point ... (when) I thought, `I'm not the girl in the tight
dress. I'm not that girl.' And I had that moment of pause. And I
thought, `Fabulous! This is great.' Because I (BEGIN ITAL)was(END
ITAL) that girl. I was the girl in the bikini in the Coppertone ad.
To me this is like a dream, that I've actually learned my job and
get to do this really wonderful stuff. It's just, you know, what a
life!''
</P>
<P>
   No need for a doctor in the house, thank you. Sharon Stone is
doing just fine.

   WORLD-MUSIC (New York) _ The world's music has never been more
accessible, speeded to new ears by everything from jet travel to
the Internet. And the whole world comes to New York: if not in
person, then through its songs. Onstage or on CD's, music from
far-flung places offers easy transport to distant lands and times.
The Babel of different musical languages promises not strife but
diverse pleasures, available amazingly close to home. This is the
second annual survey of world-music albums released in the last
year. By Jon Pareles.

   MET-EVANS-PHOTOS (New York) _ ``His general note is lyrical
understanding of the street, trained observation of it, special
feeling for patina, eye for revealing detail, over all of which is
thrown a poetry.'' That's the photographer Walker Evans, writing in
1931 about Atget. Later, lecturing in 1964 about Atget and also
about Mathew Brady, another hero, he projected a group of the penny
picture postcards he had collected since he was a child. ``Can you
imagine anything more?'' he asked his audience about his anonymous
little hand-colored images of small-town main streets and trolley
cars. ``A conglomeration of hideous things that come together by
casting a spell of _ I can't call it beauty, but of a certain kind
of silent poetry.'' Twice, poetry. That was what Evans was after in
his own photographs, a poetry that you couldn't call beauty, not
conventional beauty anyway, an art inspired by vernacular subjects
and aspiring to the natural dignity of the street. As the Met's
excellent new retrospective of him reiterates, to the end of his
life (he died in 1975, at 72), Evans had this goal, which in his
case became a distinctly American project. By Michael Kimmelman.

fall almost daily, the hushed atmosphere of the streets in their
winter whiteness is broken only by the muffled sounds of city life.
Magical winters like these are so rare in New York City that they
form precious memories for people who treasure bundling up for the
adventure in the otherwise quiet month of February before the
awakening of spring. But there is no need to pine. Skiers are not
the only ones who can travel to find ideal snow conditions. For
people whose favorite winter sport is not skiing but hiking along
woodland paths or simply walking on streets in a small town after a
blizzard, to recapture the crunch of snow underfoot that so quickly
disappears in the city, the best choice is to journey to a
university or college town in New England. By Paula Deitz.

 STAY TUNED: Networks Will Do Anything During Sweeps _ Even Kill
a  Neighbor  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death comes to ``The Simpsons,'' UPN crushes trucks, Mary and
Rhoda re-emerge at ABC, CBS squeezes an old presidential scandal,
and NBC gambles on 10 hours of pure fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the February sweeps. The theatrical movie industry has its
summer season, with thunder-dumb, mega-budgeted spectacles, and the
TV industry has the big sweeps months in November, February and
May.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, viewers could count on choice cuts of movie meat
during the sweeps _ ``Shogun,'' ``Masada,'' ``The Winds of War,''
``Lonesome Dove,'' ``War and Remembrance.'' Oh hell, even ``The
Thorn Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before the networks pared their way to skinflint
status. Now, generally speaking, the trick is to get the loudest
bang for the fewest bucks. Look at Fox's addiction to all those
sordid ``reality'' specials.
</P>
<P>
   The February sweeps begin Thursday and last for four weeks. The
month's plumpest program is NBC's ``The 10th Kingdom,'' from
prolific producer Robert Halmi. It begins February 27 and consumes
10 hours over five nights; the last two installments are actually
outside of sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10th Kingdom'' is the story of a young waitress (Kimberly
Williams) who, with her father (John Larroquette), is transported
from New York to a magical kingdom where an evil queen (Dianne
Wiest) is vying for the throne. Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice''
turns up as, ahem, Snow White, and Ann-Margret is a most elderly
Cinderella.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``The 10th Kingdom'' is a plum as well as plump remains
to be seen. It must be noted that Lindy De Koven was sacked as
NBC's vice president for movies and miniseries about the time ``The
10th Kingdom'' was delivered to the network, and two months after
``Leprechauns'' and ``Y2K'' fizzled in November. Mere coincidence,
NBC insists.
</P>
<P>
   Other high and low points from the grand tour of the February
sweeps:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunday, February 6: &LR;  James Coburn stars in ``Missing Pieces,''
a ``Hallmark Hall of Fame'' movie on CBS, as a rancher who flies to
Mexico to investigate the death of his estranged son (Paul Kersey).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Monday, February 7: &LR;  Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper are
reunited, as the same characters they played in ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' in the ABC movie ``Mary and Rhoda.'' Mary is now a
widowed mother, Rhoda a newly divorced mother.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tuesday, February 8: &LR;  CBS' ``JAG'' begins a two-parter shot on
location in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Friday, February 11: &LR;  Walter Cronkite hosts ``Good Grief,
Charlie Brown: A Tribute to Charles Schulz,'' a television
retrospective on the career of the Peanuts creator, who has cancer
and has relinquished the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunday, February 13: &LR;  On Fox, a ``Simpsons'' character is due
to die as a sacrifice to the sweeps god. The likely cartoon corpse
is Maude Flanders, wife of the Simpsons' irritatingly effervescent
neighbor, Ned Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   NBC counters that night with ``Homicide: The Movie.'' Most of
the cast of ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' is reunited for the
movie, which concerns the shooting of Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet
Kotto).
</P>
<P>
   And CBS presents the first half of a two-part miniseries,
``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.'' Sam Neill stars as Thomas
Jefferson, and Carmen Ejogo (``Metro'') plays Jefferson's slave and
lover, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tuesday, February 15: &LR;  The contestants in Fox's ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' are 50 women competing to marry a real
multimillionaire whose identity will be kept secret until the end
of the show. Fox says the two-hour special will culminate in an
actual wedding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wednesday, February 16: &LR;  A JonBenet Ramsey movie was
inevitable, and there are two of them in February. Fox's ``The
JonBenet Ramsey Story'' is based on a Vanity Fair article about the
unsolved murder of the 6-year-old Colorado girl. The stylistic
hitch is that Fox bills this as a ``minimovie,'' because it's only
an hour long. All signs point to a stinker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunday, February 20: &LR;  Leon (just Leon) stars as Richard
Penniman, otherwise known as rock legend Little Richard, in the NBC
movie ``Little Richard.'' It's the story of the Georgia gospel
singer who hit pay dirt with ``Tutti Frutti'' in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Modine stars that same night in ``Flowers for
Algernon,'' a CBS movie about a ``mentally challenged'' bakery
worker who becomes the subject of a lab experiment to raise his IQ
from 68 to genius level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tuesday, February 22: &LR;  With muted pride, Fox presents the
self-explanatory ``Banned in America: The World's Sexiest
Television.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wednesday, February 23: &LR;  Rosie O'Donnell hosts ``The 42nd
Annual Grammy Awards'' on CBS. It could be a big night for the
resurgent Bay Area musician Carlos Santana, whose 10 nominations
include record of the year and album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox counters with a live special, ``Robbie Knievel Train Jump
Live'' _ he's supposed to jump over a speeding locomotive on his
motorcycle _ and ``Secrets of Street Magicians Finally Revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunday, February 27: &LR;  ``The 10th Kingdom'' has plenty of
competition, led by the beginning of the ABC two-part miniseries
``The Beach Boys.'' Kevin Dunn (``Godzilla''), Alley Mills (``The
Wonder Years'') and Frederick Weller head the cast in the story of
the surfer rock group and the Wilson brothers' domineering father.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS miniseries ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' also
beginning on February 27, is the month's second excursion into the
JonBenet Ramsey case. This one stars Marg Helgenberger as Patsy
Ramsey and veteran character actor Ronny Cox as John Ramsey, and is
based on Lawrence Schiller's best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tuesday, February 29: &LR;  On the next-to-last night of the sweeps,
UPN chimes in with its biggest event of the month. A music special?
A big-time movie? No, silly, it's bigger and better than that. It's
``Monster Trux 2000: The New Thrillennium,'' with grinding wheels
and serious fender bending.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be more excitement than some Arkansas
11-year-olds can stand. Maybe the winner can be in the next version
of ``Flowers for Algernon.''

JOHN GRISHAM RUSHES IN WHERE TOM CLANCY TREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading a John Grisham novel is like driving sleepy. By the end,
we're addled, cramped and sheepishly satisfied with ourselves. We
may have little memory of how we got there, but hey, we made great
time.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham's schizoid, occasionally diverting new novel, ``The
Brethren,'' comes across like a typical Grisham legal thriller
that's been infiltrated by a crack team of Tom Clancy frogmen. It
opens with three disbarred judges in a Florida minimum-security
prison, happily entrapping and blackmailing a series of closeted
gay men through an elaborate pen-pal sting. So far, so
jurisprudential, but wait.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to CIA headquarters, where a gnarled, dying agency director
reminiscent of William Casey is recruiting a nice-looking,
personable enigma from Capitol Hill to jump into the presidential
race. Never mind that Rep. Lake is too late to get on the ballot in
New Hampshire. With the CIA in his corner, he'll have the best
opposition-research team in the business, a fortune in soft money
from defense contractors and a mandate to double the Pentagon
budget by November. To the CIA, readiness _ the military kind _ is
all.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth ``The Brethren'' flits, from Lake's surging
campaign to the three defrocked judges in the pokey, trawling
through gay personals for likely pigeons. It doesn't take a genius
to figure out that the judges' newest pseudonymous pen pal will
turn out to be Lake in the throes of midlife sexual confusion and
that these three blackmailing ``brethren'' have hooked a fish way
too big for their boat.
</P>
<P>
   No one can fault Grisham for wanting to broaden his brand. We're
told at one point that ``Lake loved Clancy novels,'' and it seems
more than plausible that Grisham loves them, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason we read Grisham and Clancy, though, and it's
not for their nuanced characterizations or deathless prose. We read
them because they give the impression of knowing something about
courtrooms and geopolitics, two spheres that make many Americans
feel nervous or stupid or both.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grisham nor Clancy practices his specialty as well as he
used to, but each does it better than the other ever could, and
we've rewarded them handsomely for it. Grisham on spies? We might
as well read Philip Roth on gentiles or John Cheever on Jews.
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Brethren'' gives us the CIA director saying stuff like,
``We have excellent intelligence. If we react to him, then he'll
know that we know. It's the spy game, Mr. Lake.'' Now, maybe real
spooks really talk like this. Everyone's allowed to sound like
people in books once in a while _ except, unfortunately, people in
books.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a bigger problem at work here, and that's ``The
Brethren's'' utter lack of a hero, or an anti-hero, or even a
lovable loser. Great works of fiction can get by without a single
redeemable character, and often do. Great works of popular fiction,
with very few exceptions, can't. ``The Brethren'' has three judges,
a lawyer, umpteen CIA agents and a few stray politicians, and not
one gives a damn about any of them except himself. In a better book
this might have been funny, or sad, but here it's just redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Be assured, ``The Brethren'' doesn't stink. There's a grin or
two, the legal stuff is borderline convincing, and a couple of the
female characters even get last names.
</P>
<P>
   But Grisham can do better _ or at least he wants to. For proof,
pick up the first installment of his lawyerless novel ``A Painted
House'' in the current issue of the Oxford American: The Southern
Magazine of Good Writing, which Grisham bankrolls from Faulkner's
hometown of Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   It's way too early to tell whether this ambitious coming-of-age
novel will amount to much. But if it succeeds only in exposing the
work of other contributors, such as Barry Gifford, Rick Bass, Vicki
Covington, Roy Blount Jr. and Billy Collins, to a wider readership,
we should still be grateful that Grisham isn't merely diverting his
royalty checks into one of those Bahamian bank accounts his lawyers
are so fond of.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see Grisham as a kind of Ozarks Salieri, gifted
enough to recognize in others the talent he himself lacks. At least
he's using his power, as Maxwell Smart used to say, ``for niceness,
instead of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, ``The Brethren'' makes the second best-seller in
less than two years _ after Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' _ to
perpetuate the notion that political operatives still walk into
churches on election day and buy votes for cash on the barrelhead.
Millions of readers have now imbibed this idea from two of our most
popular novelists. With November just nine months away, and no
shortage of nice-looking, personable enigmas on the ballot, does
nobody else wonder exactly how apocryphal this particular urban
legend is?

   For Black History month, which began on Feb. 1, The New York
times Syndicate is offering a five-part feature, ``The Caldwell
Journals,'' an account of major moments in the civil-rights
movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally acclaimed
black journalist whose early career was shaped by that dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, was witness to some
of the most important events of the last 40 years. He covered the
riots that swept many American cities during the summer of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C.
Maynard Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and
is writing ``The Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site.

   &UR; PART 1: THE BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

``The advertising business is always a battle. Your main goal is to
bring in revenues, no matter how. You'll go after any client to get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that relentless pursuit, Cohen was spending all
of his days working on things that needed to be done. He spent very
little time doing things that he actually wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't having any fun,'' he confesses. ``I wasn't doing the
things I had dreamed about when I started out in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of muddling through until retirement, Cohen decided to
find his way back to his original career objectives. Two years ago,
he sold his interest in a small Houston advertising agency and set
out to find a new path to reach an old but unachieved objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up a dream list of things that would make me happy,
make me money and help me achieve a balance in my personal and
private life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`DREAM PLAN' GUIDES ACTIONS &QL; 
 &QL; 
The first priority was to make a ``dream plan,'' a short list of
things Cohen really wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Item One: Spend more time on restaurant marketing, an area he
always found to be interesting and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Item Two: Do some hockey marketing. A native Canadian, Cohen
wanted an excuse to indulge his love of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Item Three: Conduct marketing workshops and speaking
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Item Four: Jump on the Internet bandwagon and find a way to make
technology work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has made strides at making each objective a reality, but
it is chasing after Item Four that prompted Cohen to do something
groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started researching ad agencies on the Web, and very few
sites came up in my searches,'' Cohen said. ``I thought that was
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cohen launched Americanadagencies.com, a listing of Web sites
for agencies in 20 U.S. cities. Agencies sign up for no charge _
unlike many other directories _ and Cohen looks to make his money
off banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its a great idea,'' said Alex Lopez Negrete, who owns
a Houston agency called Lopez Negrete Communications. ``In the
future, clients will want to select agencies in a new way. They
will depend less on the rumor mill and do more of their own
research.''
</P>
<P>
   By using stealthy, discreet methods such as online searches,
clients can avoid attracting a flurry of unwanted attention _
including from legions of hungry agencies eager to snap up any new
business that's up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthy for a client to be able to learn what its options
are,'' Lopez Negrete said. ``We agencies like to wave the
e-commerce flag, but you know, that same logic applies to our
business, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOUSTON SLOW TO RESPOND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, only 10 agencies _ all of them on the small side _
have signed up with Americanadagencies.com. Oddly, the response has
been much stronger away from Cohen's hometown. It has been
especially strong in Atlanta, Chicago and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The idea did not catch on in Tampa, Fla., or Nashville and
Memphis, Tenn. Cohen shut down the fledgling attempts to create
directories in those midsized cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is, `Why not?''' said Rick Sterling, a principal
owner of the Boulder, Colo.-based Sterling-Rice Group. ``It doesn't
cost us anything. It is a potential source for new business for us.
We got into it as an experiment. It's too early to say how much
business we will ultimately get.''
</P>
<P>
   When combining all of his different business pursuits, Cohen
said he is able to make more income than he did in traditional
agency work. He works for a number of restaurants, a hockey team in
Toledo, Ohio, and gets regular speaking gigs. Better still, he is
having more fun than he used to.
</P>
<P>
   However, what may be more important: Cohen has radically altered
the way he approaches marketing work. He routinely gives advice
that he would have considered heretical 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer do marketing plans. I think they are a waste of
time. They end up in some ring binder, stored on some dusty shelf.
No one ever looks at them,'' Cohen said. ``Now I do `dream plans.'
I ask a client to determine what they want, in what timeframe they
expect to get it, and how they plan to get there. It is amazing how
much that clarifies their thinking. Their eyes actually light up,
because it gets them back to what they wanted to accomplish in the
first place.''

<HEADLINE>
DIRECTOR MIKE LEIGH ON `TOPSY-TURVY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dictionary defines topsy-turvy as ``turned upside down.''
That's how devotees of director Mike Leigh's movies may feel when
they see ``Topsy-Turvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this delicious Victorian-era film about operetta
masters Gilbert and Sullivan will cause any upset. It's a joy from
start to finish, even though the leisurely pacing and minute
details are not anything like the typical U.S. movie.
</P>
<P>
   But dedicated followers of Leigh's very British pictures, such
as ``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' ``Naked'' and even the recent _ and
relatively upbeat _ ``Career Girls,'' have come to expect dark,
low-budget contemporary films about folks trapped in bleak,
working-class lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what they'll find in this colorful bonbon with period
costumes and a lot of clever, understated wit.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1884-85, ``Topsy-Turvy'' follows the famous duo of
comic-opera librettist William S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and
composer Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) through a crisis in their
association. It begins with the lukewarm reception of their
``Princess Ida'' and ends with the creation of ``The Mikado,''
perhaps their most popular and enduring work.
</P>
<P>
   Though just now arriving in most cities, ``Topsy-Turvy'' has
already won best-director and best-film awards for 1999 from both
the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film
Critics.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Leigh looks at everything in great detail in
``Topsy-Turvy,'' with long and exacting conversations, often over
obscure subjects. But the film's humor is seldom grim, often
sprightly. The detail includes wonderful bits of Victorian life,
such as use of newly invented fountain pens or telephones.
</P>
<P>
   In a call from Los Angeles, Leigh argues that ``Topsy-Turvy'' is
not so very different from what he always does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you scrape away the very top layer of Topsy-Turvy, you'll
find a regular Mike Leigh film going on underneath the surface,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tension between people enjoying themselves and how tough
life is, is a kind of ongoing theme and preoccupation with me. This
is a film about people trying to give people a bit of joy in their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leigh admits he's not surprised that his regular viewers
were caught off guard by ``Topsy-Turvy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the anarchy of doing it, really,'' he says,
sounding quite pleased with himself. ``'Cause I knew everyone would
be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Gilbert and Sullivan? Because he admires their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly couldn't make the film if I wasn't reasonably fond
of them,'' Leigh says.
</P>
<P>
   But his real interest was for the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert and Sullivan were part of a Victorian culture that
hung in the air when I was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s in
Manchester, which is a great Victorian city,'' the 56-year-old
filmmaker says. ``I read Victorian books and was surrounded by
Victorian architecture and was taught by people born in Victorian
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to subvert the `period film' by approaching it
in the way I approached contemporary material. I thought it would
be, in some healthy and perhaps naughty way, a good notion to
subvert a `chocolate box' subject.''
</P>
<P>
   As a filmmaker and entertainer, Leigh had a more personal reason
to do a backstage theater story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a movie about us _ we who, you know, suffer
to hell and back in the cause of amusing other people,'' he says,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   In that part of the film, the message seems to be that the more
things change, the more they stay the same. The backstage worries
and conflicts and onstage rivalries would seem familiar to actors
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Leigh says. ``The main difference between now
and then is that actors and actresses were ladies and gentlemen. I
love that they rehearsed completely done up in their street finery.
Whereas today's actors would show up in work togs. But at the end
of the day, actors are actors.''
</P>
<P>
   And any modern filmmaker would recognize the eternal conflict
that goes on between those putting up the money for a production
and the artists creating it. Gilbert and Sullivan's backers wanted
the Victorian version of ``more sex and violence'' and a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only purists will care, but Leigh says the film is
faithful to the truth. Mostly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few cheats. It doesn't pretend to be a
documentary,'' he said. ``I'm more concerned with distilling the
essence of the thing. But as it happens, the main thrust of what
happened in 1884-85, from the opening of ''Princess Ida`` through
''The Mikado,`` is pretty much what happens in the movie, with a
few modifications and simplifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Research was intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, we were onto it,'' Leigh says. ``I took on a
full-time researcher, who was on it for 18 months. We built a
detailed resource library and were in constant contact with all the
experts everywhere _ quite a lot of whom are on this side of the
Atlantic, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   From the research came not only information about the
characters, but also the period detail, which adds so much to the
texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most period films, because they are adaptations from novels
and things, don't afford the possibility to enjoy the feeling of
what it was actually like. In that period, there was a sense of
looking forward to the 20th century and a sense of modernity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have we got the telephone and pen, but also the
modern talk. At one point Sullivan's mistress says, `After all, it
is 1885.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh films are famed for the director's collaborative approach
to writing. He begins work with his actors without a script. But
rather than improvise on camera as, say, director John Cassavettes
liked to do, Leigh and his actors improvise during a long rehearsal
process, getting most of their dialogue set before the cameras
roll.
</P>
<P>
   For this film, so carefully constructed, carefully researched,
with a very definite story arc and resolution, it is natural to
assume that this time Leigh used a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on it exactly the same way as usual,'' Leigh insists.
``There was no script.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Leigh means no script when he began calling the
principal cast together for rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``we rehearsed it for seven months.''

DISNEY'S `TARZAN' DAZZLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `TARZAN'
</P>
<P>
   Movies have mangled Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan saga ever since
the silent era.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs wrote 24 adventure novels about a marooned boy, raised
by African apes, who became ``Lord of the Jungle'' _ as well as a
member of the British House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs' Tarzan _ also known as John Clayton, Lord Greystoke _
was a noble, articulate man with wealth and sprawling estates, not
a savage saying ``Me Tarzan,'' as in the early films.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Burroughs immerse Tarzan in such cruel violence and
somber suffering as in 1984's ``Greystoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its customary kids' bent, Disney has given justice to
the jungle hero. Its animated ``Tarzan'' sticks closely to the
character's origin in story and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The animation dazzles, even if it's prone to hyperbolic
extremes. Burroughs' Tarzan never glided down branches like a
skateboarder. But he was larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   The settings also are spectacular. ``Tarzan's'' verdant vistas
are some of the most handsome backgrounds of Disney's modern era.
</P>
<P>
   The story also is ably driven by Phil Collins' fine pop-rock
songs. No characters sing them _ Collins does. With strong lyrics,
they provide offscreen musical enhancement for the plot and action.
</P>
<P>
   The voice actors are excellent, including Tony Goldwyn as the
grown Tarzan (for the film's first 24 minutes, Tarzan is a child)
and Lance Henrikson and Glenn Close as Tarzan's adoptive ape
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Minnie Driver as Jane, the intrepid traveler with
whom Tarzan falls in love. Driver gives the character more
personality than many live-action actors provide.
</P>
<P>
   Not so grand is Rosie O'Donnell as Terk, Tarzan's smart-aleck
ape pal from childhood. Her contemporary sass is jarring for an
otherwise earnest tale, which also happens to be a period piece.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the animals are humanized and sympathetic. Exceptions
are the large jungle cats, whose vicious attacks go far beyond
predatory needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they are reduced to heinous villains, which subverts
Burroughs' central premise: Animals are actually civilized, while
humans are the most dangerous beings _ the only creatures who kill
for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's oversimplifications also extend to an overstated,
pompous, gun-happy hunter. He's an irritating character, much in
the mindless, macho mold of Gaston from ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are quibbles. This ``Tarzan'' largely roars and soars
_ especially on DVD, where Disney has provided the most extras for
any of its animated theatrical films.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has reissued eight such films on DVD, where they've
gained at most a trailer or music video.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Tarzan'' is Disney's first new animated film to hit the
home market on DVD at the same time as VHS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan's'' DVD has enough extra material to keep kids occupied
far beyond the film's 88-minute running time.
</P>
<P>
   One feature is a trivia game _ best played after watching the
film _ in which youngsters can choose an answer from three options
to questions such as, ``What object does a baby gorilla take from
Jane?''
</P>
<P>
   You can click on the DVD's remote control to select an answer.
If it's wrong, an elephant will appear to trumpet noisily, or apes
will laugh. If it's correct, Tarzan appears to give his jungle
yell. After about 20 questions, you get a score and rating.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition is a ``Read-Along Story,'' in which the
``Tarzan'' tale is condensed and presented page-by-page in
illustrated book form, with words on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have the option of reading the words themselves or having
them read by an off-screen narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured are the original theatrical trailer, Collins'
music video for the song ``Strangers Like Me'' and a three-minute
clip on Collins recording ``Trashin' the Camp'' with 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   Discs also offer the film in the wide-screen format and have
audio options for Spanish- and French-language tracks and subtitle
options in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't miss previews of coming attractions. These include a
five-minute scene from Disney's May release of ``Dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its invasive humans, ``Tarzan'' has a similar purity
and naturalism. It's a classic tale _ not just of adventures, but
of a human bonding with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   1999, G, Disney, CC, VHS $26.99, DVD $34.99
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE `INSIDER' STORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of ``The Insider'' and its revelations of
tobacco-industry conspiracies, put this in your pipe and smoke it:
The 2 1/2-hour film will be even longer when it hits DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Mann already has re-edited his movie, adding
scenes for its DVD release later this year and its eventual TV
showings.
</P>
<P>
   On DVD, the extra footage will be separate from the theatrical
cut. On television, it will be worked into the film, to be shown
over two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Mann also revised his 1992 film ``Last of the Mohicans'' for a
recent DVD release (Fox, $34.98), trimming some scenes while adding
others. The resulting movie runs four minutes longer and, Mann
believes, tells a stronger story.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE REAL-LIFE `BOYS' STORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hilary Swank has won a Golden Globe for ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' you can check out a documentary on the life behind it.
</P>
<P>
   New in stores from Docurama is ``The Brandon Teena Story''
(unrated, VHS $24.95, DVD $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Shot over four years in Nebraska, the 88-minute film tells the
real-life story of the young woman who posed as a man, dated women
and was persecuted and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' does not yet have a video release date.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`JUMANJI' FOR COLLECTORS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams' ``Jumanji'' has a new ``Collector's Series''
edition on DVD costing $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   The disc includes a making-of documentary, audio commentary, an
art gallery, an isolated music score, a still gallery, storyboards,
talent files, theatrical trailers and featurettes on the fantasy
film's effects and production design.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEPARDIEU'S `COUNT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Depardieu's ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' is new in a

for $59.98.
</P>
<P>

   WORLD-MUSIC (New York) _ The world's music has never been more
accessible, speeded to new ears by everything from jet travel to
the Internet. And the whole world comes to New York: if not in
person, then through its songs. Onstage or on CD's, music from
far-flung places offers easy transport to distant lands and times.
The Babel of different musical languages promises not strife but
diverse pleasures, available amazingly close to home. This is the
second annual survey of world-music albums released in the last
year. By Jon Pareles.

   MET-EVANS-PHOTOS (New York) _ ``His general note is lyrical
understanding of the street, trained observation of it, special
feeling for patina, eye for revealing detail, over all of which is
thrown a poetry.'' That's the photographer Walker Evans, writing in
1931 about Atget. Later, lecturing in 1964 about Atget and also
about Mathew Brady, another hero, he projected a group of the penny
picture postcards he had collected since he was a child. ``Can you
imagine anything more?'' he asked his audience about his anonymous
little hand-colored images of small-town main streets and trolley
cars. ``A conglomeration of hideous things that come together by
casting a spell of _ I can't call it beauty, but of a certain kind
of silent poetry.'' Twice, poetry. That was what Evans was after in
his own photographs, a poetry that you couldn't call beauty, not
conventional beauty anyway, an art inspired by vernacular subjects
and aspiring to the natural dignity of the street. As the Met's
excellent new retrospective of him reiterates, to the end of his
life (he died in 1975, at 72), Evans had this goal, which in his
case became a distinctly American project. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-ENGLAND-CAMPUSES (Undated) _ When winter comes to other
cities of the world, like Helsinki or St. Petersburg, where snows
fall almost daily, the hushed atmosphere of the streets in their
winter whiteness is broken only by the muffled sounds of city life.
Magical winters like these are so rare in New York City that they
form precious memories for people who treasure bundling up for the
adventure in the otherwise quiet month of February before the
awakening of spring. But there is no need to pine. Skiers are not
the only ones who can travel to find ideal snow conditions. For
people whose favorite winter sport is not skiing but hiking along
woodland paths or simply walking on streets in a small town after a
blizzard, to recapture the crunch of snow underfoot that so quickly
disappears in the city, the best choice is to journey to a
university or college town in New England. By Paula Deitz.

GAY DAD: WHAT'S IN A NAME? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gay Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Give a band a volatile name, and a trail of trials is bound to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of homosexuality within the British band. Suggestions
that Gay Dad isn't really a band at all, but simply a record-label
tool for shock value. Accusations that Gay Dad vocalist Cliff Jones
is actually a journalist, and the band is his fiendish attempt at a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Check. Check. And check. All of these have been trial-ballooned
as sordid buffet gossip for the appetites of the British tabloid
press, according to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John supposedly loved Gay Dad's dance-pop music, but
thought the band was called Gay Dog. Faux-punks the Stranglers _ in
an act of shameful unpunk behavior _ allegedly kicked Gay Dad off
its tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they weren't going to have a band called `gay'
anything on the road with them,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   If Gay Dad were a scam, it already would have produced the
Spinal Tap-like mayhem many have accused it of. The Brit-pop band
isn't a hoax and has a hit single, ``To Earth With Love,'' to prove
it. A band can't open for Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders, as Gay
Dad is doing in Houston, if it isn't legit.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Dad's members would love nothing more than for the hubbub
about its name to go away, but they aren't willing to change it to
get there.
</P>
<P>
   To surmise that the point of a name like Gay Dad is to make some
statement about homosexuality or family values is to miss the point
completely. None of the band's members are gay; only one is a dad.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Dad is more like a barometer _ a two-word manifesto stating
that when the world accepts a name like that, we will all be in a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really about being gay. It just has a rhythm that I
love,'' Jones says. ``Blur. Oasis. Pulp. You might as well be
called washing powder. None of them makes a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Gay Dad is a hoax band began about a year ago
when a vinyl promo of ``To Earth With Love,'' meant to get the band
a little exposure, started getting frequent spins on English radio
as if it were a single. It soon went Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gay Dad was in the studio laying down the tracks
that would become its debut album, ``Leisure Noise,'' and was
virtually unknown. Jones surmises that the British music media _
which love to control what's listened to and when _ weren't ready
for the band's radio coup d'etat, so they tried to muzzle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We snuck up on the music press, and they didn't appreciate
it,'' Jones says. ``It happened without their permission, so they
wrote a lot of stuff that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones could be passed off as just another rock star peeved at
the press, except that before he was the interviewee, he had a side
career as an interviewer; he wrote some music stories for such
magazines as The Face and Mojo. He is quick to point out that he
never really considered himself a journalist, but wrote music
stories simply because he had access to bands and he needed the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a musician who happened to get into writing because I
couldn't make anything being a musician,'' Jones says. ``It was how
I paid rent and kept Gay Dad alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's on the other side of the pen and page, how would
he go about an interview with himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask myself those questions that are really personal,''
Jones laughs. ``Then I'd probably walk out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth on Gay Dad is almost as interesting as the fiction.
The band was formed by Jones and drummer Nicholas ``Baz'' Crowe
around 1994. Bassist Nigel Hoyle was a medical student; another
member, now gone from the band, was a struggling architect; and
Jones was writing music articles.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, another band member sang lead. It wasn't
until Jones, who plays guitar, also took over vocals that Gay Dad
gained recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was a singer, and some would still claim that
I'm not,'' Jones says. ``But the other guy didn't have any soul and
couldn't sing, and I had been writing songs and singing to myself.
I got encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite Gay Dad myth is that Andrew Loog Oldham, longtime
manager and producer of the Rolling Stones, nearly destroyed the
band with a disastrous mid-'90s recording session.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones tells the story, ``Oldham and (producer Tony) Calder
sat in on one of our sessions and just stared straight ahead with
sunglasses on. At one point they got up, said, `Keep playing the
rock operas, boys,' and walked out,'' says Jones. ``The sessions
were a problem, but it was because our singer at the time couldn't
sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Dad broke up shortly after the session and reformed minutes
later with Jones taking over vocals. It's interesting that Oldham
referred to the band's songs as ``rock operas.'' ``Leisure Time''
is much more about quick pop hits than a Queen-like concept album.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the recording studio, the band felt pressured after
``To Earth With Love'' became a hit. The song is a burst of British
Invasion jangle pop that doesn't reflect the rest of ``Leisure
Time'' at all. ``Joy'' is a disco-meets-Deee-Lite dance song, while
``Black Ghost'' is a think piece that Jones describes as a ``German
industrial band playing the Eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   Only on ``Dimstar'' does Jones show any penchant for howling
like Freddie Mercury. It's no ``Bohemian Rhapsody,'' but he doesn't
do a half-bad imitation.
</P>
<P>
   The band was nervous about how ``Leisure Time'' would be
received, but has no regrets about its diversity. After a year of
Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, he says change is exactly what
radio needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of the boy-band bollocks,'' Jones declares. ``The
time has to be over for the neutral pop star. They are like pizza
with different toppings, but they're still pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like All Pizza Radio?
</P>
<P>
   Jones gets excited at the prospect: ``That's what I'm saying.
It's perfect. I'm naming a B-side `All Pizza Radio.' Can I have
that?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, a small thanks in the liner notes is all I ask.

IT'S KIDS' STUFF TO `KIDS IN THE HALL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editor's note: Reporter Sherry Thomas took a backstage look at the
Kids in the Hall and found plenty of zany Canadian sketch comedy
and even got a little time in the spotlight herself. The following
is her account of her adventure.) 
 
By SHERRY THOMAS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Dave Foley's dressing-room door is locked _ tight.
That means you won't be rehearsing the Mr. Heavyfoot usher sketch
like you planned. That means you're nervous.
</P>
<P>
   It's Friday night, and the Kids are in their Hall. Massey Hall.
This is Toronto _ the fourth stop on the troupe's 25-city North
American reunion tour. The sold-out show, ``Kids in the Hall 2000:
Same Guys ... Different Dresses,'' hits Houston on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, thousands of Kids worshipers (some in kilts and green
hair) queue up to pay homage to the drag gods of Canadian sketch
comedy. These petulant, post-punk pilgrims have been watching
Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Scott Thompson, Kevin McDonald and Mark
McKinney since their live-performance days at the Rivoli on Queen
Street.
</P>
<P>
   That's pre-Lorne Michaels. Pre-HBO. Back when the Kids in the
Hall really were just a bunch of warped kids skewering life in
suburbia, not 30- and 40-something movie and TV stars.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the nice guy at the red door chats you up as you park it
on a hard vinyl chair. In a minute, they'll call you for a
run-through. But for now, you feel like one of the namesakes, one
of the ``kids'' who used to line the halls of 1950 comedy shows,
waiting to pitch their jokes to stars. Only you're dressed like an
usher. Black pants, no pockets, black DKNY brogues and a
no-nonsense white blouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came all the way from Houston to see these guys?'' the
security guy says.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you tell him. The Kids are big in the States. Besides, not
every Kids fan gets to be a Kid for a day. Gets to work with Foley,
now a hotshot Hollywood star (``Newsradio,'' ``Blast From the
Past,'' ``Dick'' ... ) with a six-figure NBC pilot deal in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   You fiddle with your pen and paper. Finally, they fetch you.
Walking up the stairs and through the hallowed portals of the
backstage area, you pass ``Gavin's bike'' (for McCulloch's
kid-who-asks-too-many-stupid-questions schtick) parked against
another prop and end up in front of the house, to the right.
</P>
<P>
   The show will open with ``The Secretaries,'' a new twist on the
same sketch the Kids closed with when the CBC/CBS TV series went
off the air in 1995. Reunited five years later, Fran (Thompson),
Kathy-with-a-K (that's McCulloch) and the girls discuss life in the
age of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is comely, as usual, as the upwardly mobile secretary who
seems all too willing to sacrifice her friends for success. But his
part in this sketch is small. By the time the others break into
song and dance, he'll be changing into Mr. Heavyfoot.
</P>
<P>
   As the house lights go down on Sketch I, Foley will crouch in
the corner _ near you _ in his gray suit and fedora. (There's a box
of wet wipes just inside the stage door so he can wipe off his
lipstick). The bit is that Mr. Heavyfoot is going to wander into
the audience, try to get into the front row, and then be directed
by an usher to the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   You're the usher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the spotlight comes on him, stand by the gold column,''
Allen Ross, production manager for the tour, explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first cue comes after `Secretaries.''' You breathe. It
will be simple, you are assured.
</P>
<P>
   The house is ready to open, and since you're standing there
looking like an usher (by now, you've added vest and bow tie) with
an armful of programs (to hide the notebook), you have to go
backstage.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-show, a Kids retrospective set to music, blares as you
try to stay invisible in the chair where a properties master lays
out Mr. Heavyfoot's suit and boots.
</P>
<P>
   David Himelfarb, the Toronto attorney (and de facto Kids
manager) responsible for reuniting the Kids for the 2000 tour, is
back there with his children and some business partners. A promoter
from SFX Entertainment is asking about Houston restaurants. They
talk about the bus tour through Texas and ``the film.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of speculation about the film. About Nicolas
Cage and the possibility of a ``Spinal Tap''-style mockumentary of
the Kids reunion tour. Later, you'll find out more.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the show is ready to start. McCulloch, the quietest of
the Kids, walks by in a robe. Someone pulls you out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to see this,'' she says of the opening entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of American fans of Kids in the Hall were
Gen X hipsters raised on a diet of ``Ministry,'' slam dancing and
Monty Python re-runs. When Lorne Michaels launched the Kids into
the U.S. cable-TV market (they were too risque for network) in
1989, the show appealed to comedy junkies with a sick sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of the TV series will recognize about two-thirds of
the reunion tour's content. Most of it, according to former KITH
lead writer Paul Bellini, is actually from the first season.
</P>
<P>
   It's like seeing Monty Python's Flying Circus do the Spam bit
again _ only live. Many of the sketches are cult classics, like the
one about Gavin, the dorky kid who wants to paint a chair, and
McCulloch's ``sandwich people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing sadder than the sandwich people are the poo
people,'' he says of the people who scoop up after their pets at
the park.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced live show trots out all the old favorites: Buddy
Cole, the barfly (and queen of it); McKinney as the head-crusher
(this time, he squares off with a face-crusher); and the ultimate:
McDonald as the (brock!) Chicken Lady. The themes are perfectly
perverted, as always, with lots of drag (Thompson is the only gay
Kid, by the way) and plenty of irreverent R-rated jokes about the
evil of suburban ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If you're a Kids fan, you'll love the show. If
you've never heard of them, why bother? In fact, they don't want
you to. No sense having horrified first-timers covering their eyes
when the Chicken Lady scrambles a plate of eggs for her date
(Foley) _ warm from her ``body.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready. Here you go again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' your personal prompter calls out. ``Stay two steps
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is your second bit. The first one was a blur. Hazed out
with the spotlights and Foley's goofy stare. This time, you'll do
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   As he stops in front of the audience, walk up and tap him on the
shoulder. Check his ticket and send him up _ far, far and away into
the nose-bleed seats. Sigh for poor Mr. Heavyfoot. The gag never
tires.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in a millisecond, you're done. You can take off the
bow tie and vest and watch the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, they're doing the encore sketch, ``Reg,'' an
updated, darkened twist on ``The Wonder Years'' spoof they did in
an early episode. The crowd mills out, and your day as a Kid has
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   You have a backstage pass to the after-party. You wait while the
Kids give a New York Times reporter his 15 minutes. Chums of the
guys talk about the Toronto opening-night party, the private one
with Mike Myers (also a Toronto native). The Los Angeles bash,
you'll learn later, was also star-studded. Brendan Fraser (who's
working with Foley in the upcoming film ``Monkey Bone'') was there,
along with another name the Kids probably won't mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky,'' whispers Bellini, who is also Scott
Thompson's best friend from college. ``Scott was out of his mind.
It was the most impressive celebrity he's met since Kato Kaelin.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the film, Bellini says Foley has hired an L.A. film guy
(a would-be Prada poster boy with a rock 'n' roll haircut) to
capture every essence of the reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the fights,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Himelfarb confirms it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do a film,'' he says. ``We're doing a
behind-the-scenes look at the tour. We're filming it ourselves and
financing it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kids are talking to Cage and his production company about
putting it on the big screen. No deals have been struck yet.
Himelfarb says the Toronto shows were also taped for a pending
album deal.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Foley and McKinney talk a bit about Texas.
They're excited, really, since it's the first leg of the tour where
they'll be traveling by bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a blast,'' Foley says.
</P>
<P>
   Not too crowded and smelly?
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they always did fancy themselves a rock 'n' roll band.

`SCREAM 3': STILL MAD, STILL SLASHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies
are like episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3''
belongs on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the
film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy
more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling
jolts to the spine.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Wes Craven, and his group, which doesn't include
Kevin Williamson, writer and co-creator, this time around (he was
too busy on other projects), recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not ``The Blair Witch Project'' _ which chose to
deliver shocks on a Fotomat budget without a self-aware sense of
humor _ or ``The Sixth Sense,'' with its heartbreaking austerity,
but rather ``Scream'' itself. (Maybe its real competition is also
``Scream 2,'' in which the actors looked so miserable that they
must have thought of litigating themselves out of the picture.)
``Scream 3'' doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a
personality show as it is a slasher film.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney (Neve Campbell), having survived the knife-wielding
maniacs of the first two pictures, is now a crisis counselor living
in a secluded compound in California; she is treated like a guest
star. She really doesn't get involved in the action, which focuses
on a killer pursuing the cast of ``Stab 3,'' a film based on the
events of her life _ more movie-within-a-movie stuff _ until about
a half-hour into the picture. (The murders are a gambit to lure her
into danger.) Instead, ``Scream 3'' gives the actors playing actors
in ``Stab 3'' a chance to shine.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Posey in particular glows as Jennifer, the actress
playing the bullying reporter Gale Weathers. Posey, a specialist at
jittery self-absorption, is like an up-to-the-minute version of
Carole Lombard; she alone makes the picture worth seeing. Dizzy and
nakedly _ hilariously _ ambitious, she's so flighty she seems to be
levitating. When she has a moment, staring raptly at an important
event happening before her eyes, she's so self-conscious she can't
even honestly pay attention to what's going on. She draws attention
to herself as she watches someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Posey's nervous prodigiousness is just one of the assets of
``Scream 3.'' Patrick Warburton brings his disinterested, smug
squint to the party, playing a celebrity security man who has
guarded ``Julia Roberts, Salman Rushdie and Posh Spice.'' With his
milk-fed good looks _ he's like a slightly melted version of
Captain Marvel _ and that voice like chocolate pudding, Warburton
seems to be lost in a very pleasant dream. And he gets a laugh
every time he shows up. So does Deon Richmond, playing a brother
named Tyson who's very aware of the fate of black actors in
Hollywood. This game is so well-played that Jenny McCarthy as Sarah
Darling, the hungry actress, scores.
</P>
<P>
   Heartless and entertaining when it comes to sending up itself
and the conventions of the genre it helped to resuscitate, the
picture feels tired when it settles into the rusty mechanics of the
``Scream'' movies. There is a nifty cameo by Jamie Walters, the
movie-obsessed video store clerk, who returns to deconstruct the
genre and set things up by telling us all bets are off in the third
part of a series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a series, and said to be the final scream, so we
suffer through the constable Dewey and Gale love connection, which
has hit a speed bump since the last installment. Courteney Cox
Arquette, reprising her role as Gale, looks as if she hasn't eaten
since ``Scream 2.'' The round-faced and game David Arquette, as the
earnestly dim Dewey, the small-town cop who's one of the few
survivors of the first two films, softens her. The gloppy music
that bubbles up when they have one of their soap opera moments _
like Angelo Badalamente scoring ``All My Children'' _ still
produces a chuckle. But this element has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scream'' franchise is still built around Campbell, and
maybe it took three times for her to get it right. She shows real
ability, no longer just the cupcake about to hacked with the
phallic carving knife. She has developed as an actress; when her
eyes go dark with concern and fear, she is nerve-racked and
tormented, not play-acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' fixates on helplessness and failure, in the way
many of Craven's scare-series do. (The woman-in-jeopardy prologue,
as rote as the cold opening of ``Saturday Night Live,'' uses a past
character for a felon-as-celeb joke and also features a brief,
compelling bit by the underused Kelly Rutherford.) Craven has no
condescension in him, which is why his best work, like the first of
the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' films and ``Last House on the
Left,''has a disquieting air of melancholy. He may be the most
conscientious director ever to devote himself to the genre. Still,
it could be that the comedy registers so sharply here because the
emotional scenes in his film have a deadpan quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' happens to be so transparently self-referential
that it probably wouldn't even cast a shadow, but Ehren Kruger's
script is breezily self-mocking, winking at the ``Scream''
phenomenon. (One such in-joke: the phrase ``scary movie,'' the
original title of ``Scream,'' is uttered on a few occasions. And
the director of ``Stab 3'' is named Roman, no doubt in tribute to
Roman Polanski's filmography.)
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' ``Scream 3'' is
stocked with cameos and asides that bring in figures from Miramax
and the whole alternative-indie film world, so many that the core
audience might expect to tumble into the screen. When one of the
``Stab'' actors says, ``Pop culture is the politics of the 21st
century,'' it has the reheated/overheated aftertaste of a line that
might be found in a film by the pop-culture-obsessed cynosure of
``Dawson's Creek'': Pirandello for the WB.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Scream 3'' isn rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes stabbings, slashings,
bad-taste jokes and ... oh, adult language.

`SIMPATICO': AMERICAN DREAM AS A RIGGED GAME OF CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The playwright Sam Shepard doesn't create characters so much as
conjure up colliding forces of nature. As his cowboys and city
slickers lunge at each other in an American landscape that
resembles a corrupted suburban province of Marlboro country, we
have the sense that they are divided halves of the same soul
groping for an impossible reconciliation in a blighted land.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's metaphorically charged vision of the divided American
spirit doesn't translate easily into the movies because language
matters so much less in film than it does on the stage, and
Shepard's writing is all about the raw American vernacular and its
looming, shadowy resonances. Movies also demand a degree of realism
that the stage doesn't require, and conventional realism has never
been Shepard's game. His fables take big, irrational leaps of faith
whose reasoning is symbolic rather than psychological.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the English director and screenwriter Matthew
Warchus, in filming ``Simpatico,'' the playwright's dark comedy
about horse-racing, has had to sketch in so much of the background
that the play omits. Not content for its characters to refer to a
horse-racing scam they conceived two decades earlier, the movie
gives us flashbacks of the actual race and the youthful con artists
(played by different actors) collecting their winnings. The lurid
details of a sex and blackmail scheme to silence the racing
commissioner who discovered the scam and whose career they ruined
are also shown. But in realistically depicting the sordid events to
which the play's characters allude, the film diminishes their
mythical hold on our imaginations. (Was that all they did?)
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of this offbeat, gawky movie, which has gripping
performances by Nick Nolte and Albert Finney and good ones by Jeff
Bridges, Sharon Stone and Catherine Keener, is that it works at
all. The playwright's language, which Warchus' screenplay
skillfully imitates, retains the force of a calligraphic scrawl
evoking the shadowy primal emotions of stored-up memory.
</P>
<P>
   As wielded by Shepard, horse-racing becomes a potent metaphor
for his notion of the American dream as a rigged, adrenaline-hyped
game of chance. And the play's vision of how people can drive
themselves crazy by obsessively chewing over their missed
opportunities, while others are able to let go of the past and move
on has a semi-tragic ring.
</P>
<P>
   The two clashing halves of ``Simpatico's'' divided soul are Lyle
Carter (Bridges), a wealthy horse breeder and trainer who lives
with his wife, Rosie (Stone), in a palatial estate in Lexington,
Ky., and his old friend Vinnie (Nolte), a down-and-out,
hard-drinking eccentric who rattles around his shack in Cucamonga,
a desolate eastern suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie opens, Lyle is anxiously negotiating the $30
million sale of his triple-crown winning horse, Simpatico. That
sale involves the concealing of some damaging medical information
about the animal that the movie leaves teasingly ambiguous. Lyle's
deception implies that beneath the suave exterior of this
gentlemanly horse breeder there still beats the heart of a ruthless
con man.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the terms of the sale are being made final, Lyle
receives a threatening collect call from Vinnie, whom he hasn't
seen in years, demanding that he fly to Los Angeles at once. Lyle
reluctantly hustles himself to the West Coast where he encounters
Vinnie, who has kept the evidence of the 20-year-old race-track
scam he concocted with Lyle and Rosie, which involved the
substitution of slow horses for fast ones. Vinnie has also kept the
pornographic evidence of the blackmail scheme in a shoebox. If he
isn't paid off, Vinnie warns, he'll expose the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Vinnie also introduces Lyle to his only friend and confidante,
Cecilia (Keener), a grocery-store clerk whose dream in life is to
attend the Kentucky Derby. While Lyle is squiring her around
Cucamonga and pumping her for information about the whereabouts of
the shoe box, Vinnie steals Lyle's rental car, plane ticket and
identification and flies to Kentucky. Once there, he calls on Rosie
and on the disgraced racing commissioner, Simms (Finney), who is
living under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lyle desperately dispatches Cecilia (with promises of
Kentucky Derby tickets) to locate Simms and pay him off. But once
she departs, Lyle falls apart, languishing in Vinnie's shack,
swilling whiskey and brooding about the past. Like the brothers in
Shepard's play ``True West,'' the former friends mysteriously
change places.
</P>
<P>
   As Vinnie, Nolte paints a tumultuous portrait of an embittered
wild man on fire with rage, self-loathing and animal cunning.
Heightened by the movie, Nolte's fraternal resemblance to Bridges,
whose eyes glint with enough intimations of corruption to lend him
a slightly slippery aura, underscores the visceral force of their
angry bond. As Rosie, Stone makes a grand star entrance very late
in the film and gets to throw a memorable tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Finney's Simms, a flushed, shifty-eyed lecher who
works on the margins of the horse-racing world. In the play's
master stroke, it is this repulsive world-weary lout, reminiscent
of Sidney Greenstreet stripped of grandiosity, who emerges as the
film's only character to have made peace with the past.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flashes of brilliance, ``Simpatico'' never finds a
consistent style. The ominous film noir ambience of Simms' scenes
is broken by the home movie-style flashbacks. The movie is so
careless about its horse-selling subplot that its melodramatic
payoff feels cheap and abrupt.
</P>
<P>
   With all its inconsistencies, ``Simpatico'' at least has
integrity. Far from being a typical Hollywood desecration of a
difficult play, it stays true to the work's quirky, renegade
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Simpatico'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and one sex
scene.

`GUN SHY': TOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE, PUDDING ON THE INSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop culture coincidences can be plainly unnerving. Last spring
saw both a film comedy (``Analyze This'') and a cable series (``The
Sopranos'') about gangsters forcing themselves to unload to a
shrink. This year, in ``Gun Shy,'' we get a shaken undercover Fed,
Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson), seeing a psychiatrist on the down-low.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to share more than anyone I've ever known,'' his
analyst (Michael Mantell) says softly.
</P>
<P>
   The propensity for crime-infected psychoanalysis and goofily
labyrinthine twists on mob family life has an honorable source: the
1987 crime-stompers' notebook series ``Wiseguy,'' starring Ken Wahl
as an empathetic federal agent who got too close to the criminals
he went under cover to bust. (The show, worth seeking out, is
currently in reruns on Court TV.) And Eric Blakeney, a ``Wiseguy''
writer during the show's early days, has come up with one of the
most subtle and inspired comedies you'll see this year in ``Gun
Shy,'' his feature-film writing and directing debut. The movie is
probably best described as a procedural comedy. During an
undercover operation, Charlie was exposed. His quarry trussed him
up like a pheasant on ``a silver serving tray,'' face down in a
pile of sliced watermelon, before he was rescued. (Flashes of this
obscene torture pop into his head at the most inopportune moments.)
Charlie's a wreck who has lost his nerve. Despite his apparent
calm, he always seems on the verge of dashing out of a room. He's
reshuffling cards in his head. It's Blakeney's way of trumping the
limits of series television, where if the star were to be allowed
to be this damaged, he'd be a ridiculously tragic figure or all
dry-ice cool. Instead, Blakeney uses a matter-of-factness to play
the situation for farce.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is assigned to a job that involves his acting as an
organized-crime envoy in a money-laundering and illegal stock
scheme. He moves between the preening Fidel (Jose Zuniga), a yuppie
Colombian thug, and Fulvio Nesstra (Oliver Platt), whose vulgar
pride in his violent streak is perverse. Fulvio, a baby-faced bull
who seems to be trying to fight off the effects of a tranquilizer,
lashes out at everyone he comes in contact with except his wife
(Mary McCormack), who's tougher and more unpredictable than he.
Charlie's misery makes him seem even-tempered to Fulvio; Charlie
continues with his job because he has nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Charlie's wary mendacity, Fulvio is a
passive-aggressive bully. Fulvio admires Charlie for his sanity and
charm. Charlie's sanity, though, consists of him trying to keep his
head together. He learns to do so with the help of a nurse, Judy
(Sandra Bullock), who ministers to Charlie's gastronentrological
problems. She puts her auto-perkiness on hold and registers with
the openness that made her so essential to ``Speed.'' Well, the
first ``Speed'' anyway. She's given better lines here, and she's up
to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's tense stomach growls like a Rottweiler. It's literally
his gut reaction to the sad duality of his life: he's a man who has
to continually lie to do good and be good at his job. When he
explains his professional dishonesty at his group therapy session,
one of the members _ Elliott (Richard Schiff), who vibrates like a
tuning fork from suppressed rage _ responds: ``It's like a life of
permanent job interviews. You're always on your best phony
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakeney has assembled a cast strong enough to keep ``Gun Shy''
going, and he keeps a tight enough ship that no one performer runs
off with the show. Neeson, whose slightly downturned mouth makes
him a big, dour soul, shows adroit comic reflexes. He's never been
given a chance to play something like this before, a man who
desperately wants out of his unhappiness. He uses his big, handsome
slab of a face for the tiniest shifts of expression. As Platt plays
Fulvio, there's something dim and sweet about him. He's unhappy
being a thug. (He wants to be a gentleman farmer, and his wife
chides him for his black thumb.)
</P>
<P>
   The direction is proficient, but Blakeney has made his job look
easy by shaping such a fine script. Good material certainly does a
lot of the work. It gives the actors something to respond to, and
they rise to the challenge. Neeson and Schiff, as well as the other
actors in the group sessions, make the meetings seem realistically
dreary: there's a five-second delay before the next man utters his
thought. And each of them feels that his complaints are just as
valid as Charlie's. The suffering is democratic. As is that of the
vain and sensitive Fidel, who explodes when the oblivious party-boy
stockbroker (Andy Lauer) buys bean futures. Fidel is insulted over
being associated with beans; he can't go back to his
drug-cartel-running father with this information. It's a matter of
taste.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Gun Shy'' is for Sandra Bullock. She is the producer, and
probably got the picture made by appearing in a small part. She
shows brains as well as taste.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Gun Shy'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes baroque incidents of
violence and adult language.

 &HT;    BLACK FAMILY WEALTH FALLING DESPITE ROBUST ECONOMY, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Black family wealth declined over the past five
years despite a booming economy and income growth in most American
homes, an ongoing University of Michigan study has found.
</P>
<P>
   The net worth of the median black household _ half were higher
and half lower _ decreased from $8,400 to $7,500 between 1994 and
1999, according to the university's Panel Survey of Income Dynamics
study, ``Five Years Older: Much Richer or Deeper in Debt?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the net worth of the median American household
increased 9 percent, to $59,500.
</P>
<P>
   The study also shows that for every dollar of wealth the median
white household had in 1999, the median black household held barely
9 cents. This gap has remained steady for the past 15 years, said
University of Michigan economist Frank Stafford. He heads the
study, which has been surveying 7,056 households every five years
for the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings are shocking, said Joseph Altonji, an
economics professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He
said he had expected the study to show a small increase in black
family wealth, since the economy has done so well.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the strong economy is indirectly responsible for the
decline, Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is good, people tend to spend beyond their
income level and save less,'' Stafford said. A good economy also
causes people to borrow more money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that (Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan)
Greenspan is justified in worrying about too strong a 'wealth
effect,' `` the tendency for people to spend more freely when their
stock holdings or other assets have increased in value, Stafford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This better job market would then show up as income gains and
wealth declines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans, regardless of race, are guilty of overspending,
Stafford said. However, 84 percent of white households kept some of
their wealth in saving or checking accounts in 1999, compared to 57
percent of black households, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, only 17 percent of black families hold
stock or Individual Retirement Accounts, while 71 percent of white
families do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the wide wealth gap between African American and white
families is significantly the result of portfolio choice,''
Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   Black families tend not to invest in the stock market, he said,
because of a long-standing mistrust of banks and securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done research that shows that when your family didn't
hold stock, it affects what you do,'' Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of small businesses and self-employment in the
black community may have also contributed to the decrease in
wealth, Altonji added.
</P>
<P>
   Black families can overcome the wealth deficit, though it might
take some time, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that will be important for African Americans
is to have more involvement in small businesses and
self-employment,'' Altonji said.
</P>
<P>
   Education and more exposure to the stock market, Stafford said,
is the the key. Perhaps when investment companies advertise, he
explained, they should portray blacks as bankers and stockholders.
Schools also need to offer more classes that show children how to
manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't simple, but it's something you can learn,'' Altonji
said.

 &HT;    BLACK FAMILY WEALTH FALLING DESPITE ROBUST ECONOMY, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Black family wealth declined over the past five
years despite a booming economy and income growth in most American
homes, an ongoing University of Michigan study has found.
</P>
<P>
   The net worth of the median black household _ half were higher
and half lower _ decreased from $8,400 to $7,500 between 1994 and
1999, according to the university's Panel Survey of Income Dynamics
study, ``Five Years Older: Much Richer or Deeper in Debt?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the net worth of the median American household
increased 9 percent, to $59,500.
</P>
<P>
   The study also shows that for every dollar of wealth the median
white household had in 1999, the median black household held barely
9 cents. This gap has remained steady for the past 15 years, said
University of Michigan economist Frank Stafford. He heads the
study, which has been surveying 7,056 households every five years
for the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings are shocking, said Joseph Altonji, an
economics professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He
said he had expected the study to show a small increase in black
family wealth, since the economy has done so well.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the strong economy is indirectly responsible for the
decline, Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is good, people tend to spend beyond their
income level and save less,'' Stafford said. A good economy also
causes people to borrow more money, he said.
</P>
<P>

Greenspan is justified in worrying about too strong a 'wealth

`THE GIRAFFE': GRANDPA'S CHOCOLATE BURNS INSIDE A GERMAN POTBOILER
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
By A.O. SCOTT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To see ``The Giraffe,'' the new film by Dani Levy and Maria
Schrader that anchors this week's retrospective of Levy's work at
New York's Anthology Film Archives, is to be confronted by a series
of mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the film's English title, the significance of
which is revealed rather late in the game. In Germany, ``The
Giraffe'' was released as ``Meschugge''; the title comes from a
German word that, like its familiar Yiddish cognate, means, roughly
``nuts,'' and has no particular zoological connotation.
</P>
<P>
   But the conundrum posed by the film's incompatible titles
quickly recedes in the face of a more urgent mystery: what on earth
did Levy and Schrader, who star in the movie and reportedly worked
on its script for 10 years, think they were doing? Most of the
dialogue is, at least arguably, in English, and much of the film
was shot in what is unquestionably New York. But the characters in
``The Giraffe'' seem to have wandered out of a badly translated
German potboiler.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, some are portrayed by gifted American
actors, notably Jeffrey Wright and David Strathairn. Strathairn
plays a paranoid lawyer named Charles Kaminski, who is best
described as William Kunstler with Rabbi Meir Kahane's politics. He
moves with such a fervent sense of purpose, and fulminates with
such demented conviction, that you almost believe he understands
what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   How could he, though? This movie's breathless incoherence is
matched only by its wild implausibility. It opens with arson at a
chocolate factory in a small town in Germany, an event that makes
the front page of The Daily News in New York and brings together
Lena Katz ( Schrader) and David Fish ( Levy).
</P>
<P>
   Lena is a German Jew working as a set designer in New York; her
grandfather owned the factory. David is a New York businessman
whose mother fled Germany in 1941. His relatives are meant to be
Orthodox Jews, which means that the men wear false beards and black
clothes and that the women berate him because he is unmarried and
insufficiently religious.
</P>
<P>
   The plot begins to thicken when Lena's mother apparently kills
David. To reveal any more would not only ruin the suspense (if
that's the word for the hurtling confusion that ensues) but also
take all day. Suffice it to say that the narrative revolves around
stolen identities, forbidden love and the weight of the past on
present-day relations between Germans and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is potentially very interesting. But Schrader and
Levy seem to labor under the assumption that making a film about an
important, politically charged subject is the same as making an
important, politically charged film.
</P>
<P>
   They also seem to think a movie that features people chasing one
another through airports and train stations, exchanging desperate
looks and shouting a lot deserves to be called a psychological
thriller. ``The Giraffe'' no doubt deserves to be called a lot of
things, in any number of languages. Come to think of it, meschugge
might be one of them. &QL;

`LIGHTHOUSE': SO WHERE'S VIRGINIA WOOLF WHEN YOU NEED HER?

<P>
   Near the end of ``Lighthouse,'' the grade-C British horror
thriller that sneaks into New York area theaters Friday, its damsel
in distress, Dr. Kirsty McCloud (Rachel Shelley), a comely criminal
psychiatrist, is dangling from a frayed, burning rope on the side
of a lighthouse amid a cloudburst lighted with exploding electrical
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Lunging at Kirsty through a window is her nemesis and personal
lab experiment, Leo Rook (Chris Adamson), an insatiable killer with
a yellow-toothed wolfman grin who collects the severed heads of his
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Dangling on the same rope while holding her by the hair to keep
her from falling is Kirsty's possible savior, Richard Spader (James
Purefoy), a convicted killer who swears he didn't murder his wife;
he was having an epileptic fit when someone else did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighthouse'' begins on the Hyperion, a prison ship. Leo and
Richard are among the criminals being transported to a remote
island off the northern English coast. When the ship experiences
navigational problems, Leo escapes to Gehenna Rocks, a desolate
island, in a stolen lifeboat. The ship soon runs aground. Seven
survivors make it to shore, where most are picked off one by one by
the yellow-toothed saber-wielding fiend.
</P>
<P>
   As in most horror thrillers, the scenes that work best are the
creepy-crawly early ones in which the killer stalks his prey. The
most carefully set-up moment involves the ship's drunken captain
(Paul Brooke), who peeks under a lavatory stall to see the killer,
who dresses in black except for his white shoes, pacing several
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   We hear the sound of metal being drawn and watch as those shoes
are spattered with blood from a previous murder. Once the movie
becomes a pitched battle for survival, it disintegrates into a
chaotic, screaming frenzy edited on a butcher block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighthouse'' is not without its crude pretensions. Two gory
fantasy montages suggest that Kirsty chose criminal psychiatry as a
profession because as a little girl she witnessed her father slash
her mother to death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Lighthouse' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It is extremely gory, with severed heads flying
in all directions. &QL;

`SCANDALMONGER': THE FOUNDING FATHERS, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end) 
Benson Bobrick is the author of ``Angel in the Whirlwind: The
Triumph of the American Revolution.'' 
(jt) 
 By BENSON BOBRICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Safire, the oft-polemical, sometimes embattled Op-Ed
columnist for The New York Times, is up to mischief in his new
novel, ``Scandalmonger,'' which retells in bitingly embellished yet
reliable detail the muckraking, sordid, yet oddly affecting
wranglings of some of our founding fathers in the wake of the
Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The story opens in Philadelphia, on Dec. 17, 1792, with
Alexander Hamilton, treasury secretary in Washington's
administration, under a cloud for reportedly speculating in
government securities. Confronted by congressional investigators
(John Beckley, the first Librarian of Congress, Frederick Augustus
Muhlenberg, speaker of the House, and James Monroe), he is obliged
to reveal his private affair with a married woman to clear his
public name.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the public and the private is what this
novel is all about, and in the bitter struggle between the
Federalists (led by Alexander Hamilton and John Adams) and the
Jeffersonian Republicans, fortunes rise and fall as scandals
envelop principals on either side.
</P>
<P>
   The reader is introduced to the makings of the Alien and
Sedition Act (in part a partisan attempt to muzzle the opposition
and deport inconvenient members of the press); the relationship
between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, his slave; the
remarkable Maria Reynolds, a femme fatale of sorts and the sometime
mistress of both Hamilton and Aaron Burr; the XYZ affair under
Adams, which involved the bribery of American officials in France;
physical violence on the floor of Congress; the medical quackery of
Dr. Benjamin Rush, who had a great gift for bleeding his patients
to death; and (the last shall be first) the scandalmongers William
Cobbett and James Callender, whom Safire nicely describes as
ideological adversaries and vituperative soul mates. It is to them,
as identified by their pen names _ Peter Porcupine and Timothy
Thunderproof _ that the author dedicates his book.
</P>
<P>
   Safire has great fun with all this and tells his story well. And
by not trying to moralize its meaning (the epigraph carries all the
moral weight the tale can bear) he allows the reader to relax into
the amused and theatrical context of all the posturing and slander.
The facts are also accurate, the more so for the clarifying ``Notes
and Sources'' at the end, in which Safire discloses what he has,
and has not, imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he has not imagined much, and when he has, has
probably got it more or less right. The characters live in the
author's understanding approach to them, more than in his
description of their physical realities or idiosyncratic traits;
but by constructing (or reconstructing) dialogue from sentences
used in their letters, he gives authentic voice to their different
temperaments and a convincing quality to their repartee.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans of Jefferson, Hamilton and others may take issue with
some of the characterizations, but Safire is nothing if not
evenhanded, and some of his most sympathetic writing is inspired by
Maria Reynolds and James Callender, who are usually vilified. Both
are redeemed and redeem each other in an invented but tender
romance, and Callender (the true hero of the story) assumes tragic
stature as his personal life becomes captive to the impersonal
workings of rival political machines.
</P>
<P>
   Safire knows his history inside out, and there is so much of it
in this book that there is almost nothing pertinent to the period
that is not worked in. Every opportunity to fill in the background
and context of events is seized, and this is usually satisfying.
But on occasion dramatic moments list (or are skewed) under the
sheer weight of historical detail.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the verge of a major seduction, Hamilton, in an
effort to ``keep his expectations down'' about his meeting with
Maria, ``recalled how Congress had passed his bank bill over the
objections of James Madison and the Jeffersonians, who argued that
its powers could not be found in the Constitution. These believers
in a rural society of yeomen and farmers had almost persuaded
Washington to veto the banking legislation designed to finance an
empire based on urban manufactures ... '' And the disquisition goes
on about ``implied powers,'' ``strict construction'' and other
matters for another hundred words.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good synopsis of the facts. But there is quite a bit of
this compendious review of material in odd places, and more timely
ways of placing it might have been found. Still and all, the story
moves grandly forward despite such lapses, and the tease of
historical veracity is one that Safire takes advantage of with
considerable skill.
</P>
<P>
   The epigraph from Juvenal is an apt one:
</P>
<P>
   And there's a Lust in Man no Charm can tame,
</P>
<P>
   Of loudly publishing our Neighbour's Shame;
</P>
<P>
   On Eagles' Wings immortal Scandals fly,
</P>
<P>
   While Virtuous Actions are but Born, and Dye.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of polemical journalism, this is doubtless
axiomatic. But it is not, I think, an aphorism to which Safire
wholly subscribes. His novel, like history itself, takes a longer
view. None of the principal characters, all too human as they are,
emerge diminished. Some, however scandal-prone, still ``mount up
with wings as eagles'' in our recollection of their lives.

`GENDERNAUTS': THEIR GENDER WILL BEND EVERY WHICH WAY IT CAN 
</HEADLINE>

   ``Nature can be more inventive than culture,'' observes Monika
Treut, musing on the sex lives, and the sex organs, of the African
spotted hyena. But aside from the hyenas, which show up only in a
precredit sequence, ``Gendernauts'' seems devoted to a contrary
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Hyenas, after all, don't design Web sites devoted to Gertrude
Stein, or organize talent shows for drag queens and drag kings, or
participate in hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gendernauts,'' which opens Friday in New York, might have been
called ``Sexual Ambiguity in San Francisco.'' The subjects of
Treut's earnest new documentary _ although this sounds like a
coldly anthropological description of people who are, in fact, her
friends _ like to think of themselves as artists.
</P>
<P>
   Some make videos or photographs, but what unites them is the
sense that their gender identities, and indeed their bodies, are
works in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Treut, a chirpy, sympathetic presence whose curiosity is always
balanced by tact, introduces us to a few Bay Area residents who
defy assimilation to the usual categories: gay or straight, male or
female.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tomboy, for instance, is biologically a woman. ``She has a
womb,'' explains Tornado, a former Penthouse model who sees herself
as Tomboy's surrogate mother. But Tomboy sports blond stubble on
her chin and prefers to be called he.
</P>
<P>
   A blue-eyed, crew-cut, six-foot photographer named Stafford, on
the other hand, doesn't care what pronoun people use so long as
they use it respectfully. And Hida Viloria, a voluble hermaphrodite
with exquisite cheekbones, can pass effortlessly from ravishing
femininity to sullen machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived credibly as a woman and as a man, Hida, like
Stafford, now seems happiest occupying ``the middle ground''
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that there is a middle ground _ that gender is not a
fixed category, but a fluid domain of expression and
experimentation _ has been a staple of academic discourse for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that Treut should have appointed a
professor, Sandy Stone of the University of Texas at Austin, as our
cicerone on this tour of transgender San Francisco. But Stone, who
aside from her teaching and scholarship performs unspecified duties
as the self-declared ``goddess of cyberspace,'' is not entirely a
happy choice. She speaks in slow, didactic cadences and peppers her
speech with cultural-studies jargon and New Age psychobabble.
</P>
<P>
   It is left to the others _ to Hida, Stafford and Tomboy, along
with Max Valerio, a female-to-male transsexual, and Annie Sprinkle,
who calls herself ``a sex artist'' _ to flesh out, as it were,
Stone's abstractions. The glimpse into their lives that
``Gendernauts'' offers is interesting, but it is only a glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   Treut's intention was clearly to affirm the humanity of the
intersexed, transgendered and transsexual individuals she
encountered, and she has succeeded. (She also helpfully clarifies
the differences among these terms.)
</P>
<P>
   But because human experience is by nature complex and ambiguous,
it requires more than simple affirmation: there is more to these
people, one suspects, than ambiguous sexual characteristics, but
Treut declines to pry.
</P>
<P>
   What results is a movie that, for all its candor, feels oddly
decorous, even prim. The exhilarating, scary mutability of gender
identity has recently inspired brilliant investigations like the
Off Broadway musical ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' and the film
``Boys Don't Cry,'' but those are passionate and troubling works of
art, to which ``Gendernauts'' might be seen as a useful set of
footnotes. &QL;

`BELOVED/FRIEND': DESIRES THAT FALL BETWEEN THE CHASM OF HEAD AND
HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something going on in the director Ventura Pons'
melodrama ``Beloved/Friend,'' though you've got to work hard to get
past what feel like intentional obstacles that he's set for himself
_ like the score, which drizzles over the picture like a caramel
coating.
</P>
<P>
   And the static setups: the camera perches in front of the
players, resting comfortably in the front row of the theater, as if
recording a play. But Pons has made a career out of drama in plain
sight. He doesn't go for the operatic, but rather a soft
earnestness that could be drab in the hands of the wrong director.
He toys with the chasm between the heart and the head.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beloved/Friend,'' Jaume (Josep Maria Pou), a gay college
professor, has drifted into middle age, and passes around a
manuscript that he can't get anyone to read. His student, the
cerebrally cold and physically hot David (David Selvas), crumples
the diskette containing the work right in front of Jaume on two
different occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Pere (Mario Gas), Jaume's closest friend, hasn't had time to get
to it; he's too busy dealing with the involvement of his daughter
Alba (Irene Montala) with the callous pinup David.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is pining for something that can't be had. David, who
also puts in time as a hustler, seems to be looking for love in all
the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   Jaume is shocked when he dials for a sweaty treat and his
student appears at his door, ready to be unwrapped. ``This is why
you have such a nice apartment,'' the shocked Jaume says of David's
unusual work-study arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   David also seems to be looking for a father figure. His own
father killed himself while in prison because of a drug deal gone
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny (Rosa Maria Sarda), Alba's mother, spins anecdotes about
her days as a pleasure-seeking radical. The pregnant Alba wants
David to commit to her and their baby, though she's considering an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pere wants David to disappear from the face of the earth. No one
here seems to have much of a future, not even the young.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaume? Wistful and lost, he wants so much. He wants to rouse
David from his hedonism so he will help raise Alba's baby. He wants
Pere to recognize how close they were to a relationship when they
were younger.
</P>
<P>
   Jaume is dying and at the end of his life he has fallen in love
with another man he cannot have: David. (These contradictions are
responsible for the slightly unwieldy title, ``Beloved/Friend.'')
Jaume's life could be represented by another of Pons' films,
``Damned Misery,'' though that title could easily be applied to a
number of his features.
</P>
<P>
   What Jaume wants for himself and everyone else is salvation.
This element and the thwarted desires that everyone talks about in
``Beloved/Friend'' spell out Pons' affection for Tennessee
Williams. But it's like Williams writ small, with the passion
reduced to one-sixth scale.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why Jaume is reduced to just dwelling on
his lost loves, but David could have a much bigger presence in the
film. With his heavy boots and jeans as tight as shrink wrap, he is
obviously meant to be a Stanley Kowalski with brains. (Though as
played by Selvas, it's hard to be entirely sure how smart David
is.)
</P>
<P>
   Pons' attempt to dig for a deeper, more refined tear-jerker is
admirable, but like its title, it's a clumsy contraption. &QL;

LEGAL SCALES

<P>
   LONDON _ A village butcher is waging a full-scale war against
what he sees as the latest and most insidious invasion from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the scale is full of meat _ pounds of it despite
new rules that make the kilogram the only legal measure of the
realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, an ounce is an ounce, and a pound is a pound,''
explained Dave Stephens, the proprietor of Mandy's Chop Shop in the
east England village of Leigh-on-Sea. ``A kilogram is a foreign
measure, and our customers don't understand what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Stephens ignored a deadline imposed on him by
frustrated local officials to convert to metric _ or else. (The
``or else'' in this case is a fine of 2,000 pounds (about US$3,300)
and/or six months in jail.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, a burly guy with a powerful voice to match, minces
fine English beef _ always by the pound, never by the kilo _ but he
does not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll fight them on the beaches, I'll fight them in the high
street, and I'll fight them in all the little shops around the
country,'' Stephens said after flagrantly violating the law by
selling a customer a pound of chopped meat. ``I'm doing what I
normally do, weighing up in pounds and ounces and wait for the
officials to come down and either confiscate my scales or to try to
take them a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Stephens said he will continue to use pounds and ounces
and is willing to take his fight to court.
</P>
<P>
   Daunted by Stephens' stubbornness and mindful that his
sentiments resonate widely, officials and their lawyers are
weighing carefully _ presumably in kilos _ what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in England _ Stephens among them _ see the
introduction of new European and American ways as an attack on
their English identity, which has suffered a lot, what with the
loss of the Empire and all.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, resistance to Europe is rising at a time when the
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair and business leaders are
pushing for more integration with the continent. Britain remains
the only big economy in Europe unwilling to replace its national
currency with the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop nature but Europe we can do,'' Stephens said.
``I'm going to make my stand now. We're not going to be dictated to
by Europe. Don't forget that Napoleon said that England was an
island of shopkeepers, and we certainly gave them a good showing,
didn't we.''
</P>
<P>
   All but a few imperial measures were to be phased out by the end
of 1999 _ with the major exception being the use of miles for road
distance. Yet, old habits die hard: Despite the switch to a decimal
currency 29 years ago, the term guinea (meaning one pound and one
shilling) is still used by some auction houses. And nearly all
English people weigh themselves in ``stones'' (14 pounds) rather
than pounds or ... shudder, kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said he feels for those unfortunates who have fallen
under Europe's spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had many people come and ask for kilos or grams,''
he said. ``But if someone comes in and asks for a kilo, I'd serve
it to them, because it's only 2.2 pounds.''

 &HT;     McCAIN FACES A BIGGER TEST IN CALIFORNIA  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Despite his commanding victory over Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary, Arizona Sen. John
McCain will have limited time and money to make his case to
California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush will be distracted this month by Republican
primaries and caucuses in seven other states, leaving them limited
time to campaign at length in California. Delaware, South Carolina,
Arizona, Michigan, North Dakota and Virginia all hold Republican
primaries or caucuses this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, have an open calendar before March
7, when vote-rich California and New York, along with 13 other
states, hold presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   The California campaign crush on the Republican side is likely
to favor Bush because he has the resources to spend vast amounts of
money on television advertising in a state that relies heavily on
the electronic media for political information. Bush has the added
advantage of being supported by the state's Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But if McCain continues his successful run, particularly in
South Carolina in on Feb. 19, his insurgent campaign could create
chaos in the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Bush with a 2-to-1 advantage over McCain in
California. But McCain's campaign believes maverick California
voters could show an independent streak. Although California has
far fewer independent voters by percentage than in New Hampshire,
the numbers are growing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reformist platform tends to attract independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an energy to the McCain campaign, and that
fire could light up California and surprise a few people,'' said
Joel Fox, a California co-chairman of the McCain 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In California, it is possible that McCain could win the popular
vote by attracting independent voters and Democrats. Yet Bush could
still win the race for delegates because only votes from registered
Republicans will count in selecting delegates to the Republican
National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say if you can't win California, you can't be
president,'' Fox said. ``If the party then denies the nomination to
the candidate who won California, I think there would be a lot of
trouble and a lot of re-examining going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a county-by-county operation in California, two
campaign headquarters (McCain has none), endorsements from every
major GOP lawmaker, and a record amount of money _ nearly $70
million so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important not to draw erroneous conclusions,''
said state Sen. Jim Brulte, a Bush supporter. ``The McCain campaign
has the luxury of picking and choosing where they want to play.
They've already written off Delaware, and they wrote off Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they have a three-state strategy: New Hampshire,
South Carolina and California,'' Brulte said. ``They have little or
no organization in any other state. ... If you pick and choose five
or six states where you want to play, you can win every delegate in
those states and still be hundreds of delegates short of the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made no secret of his targeted campaign _ do well in
New Hampshire, do well in South Carolina and win in California.
McCain has made 23 campaign trips to California in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   One test for McCain comes this weekend in Burlingame. He is
scheduled to speak Saturday at the state GOP convention, which is
usually populated by the most ardent Republican activists. Bush is
not scheduled to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush is sending his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
Their father, former President George Bush, is expected to campaign
in California next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain is concentrating his efforts in South
Carolina, which has 37 delegates, by stressing his military
experience. The state has a large veteran population.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a 2-to-1 advantage in polls taken in South Carolina and
support from the GOP establishment. McCain hopes his big New
Hampshire win will generate enthusiasm in South Carolina and spark
contributions from across the country. He raised $500,000 in
Internet donations in the hours after his victory was announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain's whole candidacy rests on South Carolina,''
said Alan Heslop, a political science professor at Claremont
McKenna College. ``If McCain can't beat Bush there, then it seems
that New Hampshire was simply a bump in the road for Bush.''

   FEDBUD-DEBT _ WASHINGTON _ Not so long ago, it seemed hard to
imagine how this country would pay off the federal debt. When
President Clinton submits his budget to Congress on Feb. 7, though,
it will contain a plan for paying off the publicly held portion of
that debt _ some $3.3 trillion _ by 2013. That, says Clinton, would
be a stunning achievement that would dramatically change the
country's economic landscape for a generation to come. How,
precisely, would the plan work? Who would get paid, where would the
money come from and what impact would it have on the economy? And
why do some economists _ and some Republicans _ say that paying off
the debt might not be wise? (Deans, Cox News Service).

   SCHOOL-FUND _ Several members of the State Board of Education
say their financial expertise is limited to balancing their
checkbooks, choosing retirement plans and maybe selecting a mutual
fund. The members with the most money-management skills are David
Bradley, R-Beaumont, a licensed insurance, securities and real
estate agent, and Will Davis, D-Austin, a lawyer who represents
insurance companies. Yet the nine members of the board are
responsible for investment decisions on the $22 billion school
trust fund. It's been that way since 1845, and some lawmakers and
investment professionals say it's time to change that. None of the
state's other major pension and investment funds rely on elected
managers without expertise in investments. (Brooks, Austin

morning and quietly pries the posts out of his silver metal watch

continued for decades in this city of azaleas and magnolias, which
lets down its hair once a year for Mardi Gras. ``Nothing happens
quickly in Mobile,'' Williamson said. To help quicken downtown's
economic pulse _ sapped years ago by strip malls and suburban
housing that sprang up to the west _ business leaders aggressively
are trying to land a cruise ship homeport. (Manuel, Atlanta

MCENTIRE'S `SINGER'S DIARY' OPENS THE BOOK ON A REMARKABLE CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oklahoma-bred country star Reba McEntire loves musicals. But
she's never seen ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I never have,'' McEntire says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've never seen `Annie Get Your Gun,' either.''
</P>
<P>
   But this didn't stop McEntire, one of the most successful
country stars of the past two decades, from turning her own life
story into a musical _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   McEntire is on tour with ``The Singer's Diary,'' a two-for-one
extravaganza that begins with a musical play based on her
remarkable career, followed by a concert of her most
autobiographical songs. The concert portion includes songs from her
latest album, ``So Good Together.''
</P>
<P>
   The touring production made its debut last September and will be
on the road through the end of year.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices in the $60-$70 range reflect the elaborate nature
of the show. Concertgoers also are encouraged to donate
non-perishable food items for U.S. Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Singer's Diary'' features McEntire and her nine-piece
band, plus six dancers and a large crew of stage hands. The sets
and costumes look very theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got backdrops, we've got scrims that fly in, fly out. We
have the curtains that come in, come out. And we have the stage
that moves, separates and comes back together,'' McEntire said by
phone from a tour stop in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Though McEntire is known for her over-the-top concert
productions, ``The Singer's Diary'' is different from anything she
has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the tour, some of my fans didn't know how
to react because it starts out as a play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to sort of prepare the audience when they come to
the theater. I hope my fans enjoy it, and I hope they take the
journey with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, the ranch-raised McEntire dreamed of a
country-music career while competing as a rodeo barrel racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Singer's Diary'' begins in 1974, the year McEntire wowed
fellow Oklahomans by singing ``The Star Spangled Banner'' at the
National Rodeo Finals. A year later, McEntire signed a recording
contract. But it wasn't until 1981 that she had her first No. 1
country hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, well, the record labels would have dropped me like a
hot potato,'' she said in a tough, self-assured tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God they had the time to work with me then. Country
wasn't booming at that point. But in the '80s, country went through
this huge period of success, from the `Urban Cowboy' craze to the
rise of Garth Brooks. And, boy, if you don't make it quick these
days, the labels don't have much time for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the show are three songs from McEntire's latest
album, among them her new single, ``What Do You Say.'' The album is
unusual in that it recruited three producers, David Malloy, Keith
Stegall (senior vice president of A&AMP;R at Mercury Records) and Tony
Brown (president of MCA Nashville). The result is more stylistic
breadth than on her previous efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The last song on the album is Rita Coolidge's 1977 hit, ``We're
All Alone,'' recorded as a duet with Brazilian group Chitaozinho
Xororo. McEntire is the latest country artist (Brooks and Alan
Jackson preceded her) to record with a foreign-language group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wantin' to do something with a foreign-language act
for a long time,'' she said. ``I've gotten to go to Germany and
record `Does He Love You' with a lady named Corina Mae. She sings
in German and I sing in English. And that was a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian market, with its cattle ranches and wide-open
spaces, could prove to be a fertile region for American country
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the Brazilian people. We had a wonderful time when we
were there last,'' she said. ``So we're really looking forward to
going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether she's performing in Brazil or North America, the
pressure is always on to come up with an entertaining, eye-popping
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge. Not only to entertain our fans, but
to entertain ourselves,'' she said.

`GUN SHY' DOESN'T BLUSH AT BODILY FUNCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Gun Shy,'' a mildly amusing but forgettable and
way-too-scatological black farce, Liam Neeson plays Charlie, an
18-year veteran undercover DEA agent who, after one particularly
traumatic experience, loses his nerve and becomes a physical wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, his stomach is constantly gurgling with gases,
he's lost all control of his bowels, and when not popping pills or
whining to his shrink, he's usually in the act of dropping his
pants and racing for the nearest toilet. Very distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's chief nemesis is a sadistic Mafioso enforcer (Oliver
Platt) whose life is almost as miserable: He's the son-in-law of a
aging Don (Frank Vincent) who hates his guts, his wife (Mary
McCormack) constantly abuses him, and his tomatoes won't grow.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix is a ditzy nurse (Sandra Bullock) whom Charlie
meets one day over a barium enema, a pair of gay Colombian drug
lords (Jose Zuniga and Michael Delorenzo) and a crooked Wall Street
trader (Andy Lauer) trying to put together a money-laundering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   As Charlie joins in as part of a DEA sting, a few honest laughs
emerge between all the flatulence and body functions, and Platt
does his usual good work, consistently funny.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson also has his moments. Few stars have his natural
likability, and his self-deprecating comedy style here is
occasionally engaging _ though the film is unlikely to do much for
his somewhat faltering career (after ``The Haunting'' and poor
reviews for ``Phantom Menace'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun Shy'' is also likely to be a bad career move for
producer/co-star Sandra Bullock, who seems bored and distracted,
and for first-time feature writer-director Eric Blakeney, whose
script is sloppy and whose direction is never quite able to make
these elements fly as madcap comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Shy. Directed and written by Eric Blakeney. Cast: Liam
Neeson, Oliver Platt, Sandra Bullock. Hollywood Pictures. 105
minutes. Rated R for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

 &HT;    Author mines dark, hardscrabble truth
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOHENWALD, Tenn. _ It is a bitterly cold day in this small,
southwestern Tennessee town where explorer Meriwether Lewis
committed suicide. Turning up the collar of his faded denim jacket,
William Gay lopes across a near-deserted main street and ducks into
the local pool hall and cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding briefly to the handful of locals, he waits for the woman
behind the bar to flip a hand-shaped hamburger patty on the grill
and orders a beer.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Amy Williams, had described him as a cross between
singers Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett, and there is a resemblance. With
a tangled mass of dark hair and a face as lined as a Tennessee
state map, the 56-year-old Gay evokes the image of someone who has
lived hard and driven on a lot of dirt roads.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks in Hohenwald know Gay as a carpenter and drywall
hanger, but in the rest of the South the self-taught writer is
already being talked about as the next Larry Brown or Cormac
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy has been a major influence, Gay says, sipping his beer
and lighting up what is not his first cigarette of the day. ``I
think he's probably the greatest living writer. I'm flattered by
the comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a little overwhelmed by the attention he's been
getting lately for his debut novel, ``The Long Home'' (MacMurray &AMP;
Beck, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Gay's story of a young Tennessee carpenter, an evil bootlegger
and a beautiful girl has been nominated for the Southeastern
Booksellers Association Award for book of the year. Hollywood has
shown some interest as well, and he has sold his next novel to
Doubleday for a substantial six-figure advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty much of a surprise,'' Gay says with typical
understatement. ``I just wanted the book to be well-thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's gotten his wish. In a lengthy review in The New
York Times, author Tony Earley described Gay as ``a writer of
remarkable talent and promise. ... At his best, Gay writes with the
wisdom and patience of a man who has witnessed hard times and
learned that panic or hedging won't make better times come any
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay freely admits there have been hard times. The son of a
sharecropper and laborer, he grew up roaming the woods around
Hohenwald, joined the Navy after high school and spent several
years living on the West Coast and in Chicago working at odd jobs.
Eventually he returned to Hohenwald, married, took up carpentry and
settled down to raise four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why I started writing in the beginning,'' Gay
says. ``I was 10 or 12 years old and I thought it would be fun to
make up stories.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader, Gay attracted the attention of William Johnson,
his seventh-grade teacher, who gave him copies of books by Faulkner
and Thomas Wolfe. ``I read `Look Homeward, Angel,' at an
impressionable age, I guess. It was a powerful book.''
</P>
<P>
   After he married, Gay continued to write off and on without much
success. He had no idea there were literary journals, and he had
never met a writer. And, he adds, he received little encouragement
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was really down on books. She thought that writing was
a waste of time. She said the only thing more foolish than reading
a book was trying to write one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gay's wife left him shortly before he sold his
novel. What started out as a relatively simple divorce became more
complicated, Gay says, and he finally gave her the house he had
built himself and moved into a rented cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fixed up or nothing,'' he says, finishing his beer,
``but it's quieter there than it is in here.''
</P>
<P>
   `A powerful writer'
</P>
<P>
   Leaving in a white SUV, Gay and his friend Renee Leonard head
out of town for two miles and park in front of a small house set
low to the ground. The blue paint is peeling on the outside, and
inside there are three different kinds of worn linoleum. A
Smith-Corona typewriter sits precariously on a small table beneath
a picture of William Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my stuff is still in boxes,'' Gay says, straightening
a row of Bob Dylan CDs on a bookshelf. ``I may not stay here long.
I'm thinking about moving to Oxford (Miss.). I spent some time with
Larry Brown over there recently, and I like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, another self-taught writer whose literary landscape is
the hardscrabble, blue-collar South, sees some similarities between
the types of people he and Gay write about in their fiction. ``I
think he writes more like Cormac McCarthy than he does me,'' Brown
says, ``but he's a powerful writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay seems pleased and a bit nonplused to be in such heady
literary company. Taking a seat on the sofa, Gay lights another
cigarette and slowly begins to talk about his 30-year struggle to
get published.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first story I wrote was when I was a kid. I sent a story
to a farm magazine, but they didn't take it. I guess it was because
it was handwritten. I didn't have a typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   As he matured, he imitated Flannery O'Connor stories and sent
them to Atlantic and Harper's. Form rejections poured in, but
eventually a few of the letters offered constructive criticism and
encouragement. Finally, in 1998, Gay discovered the literary
quarterlies and soon had stories accepted at The Missouri Review
and The Georgia Review.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Michalson, editor of the Missouri Review, remembers the day
``Those Deep Elm Brown's Ferry Blues'' came over the transom.
Michalson, who normally sorts through 10,000 submissions a year to
find 20 or 25 publishable stories, was so impressed he began
passing the story around the office for everyone to read. ``It was
just a magnificent piece of writing,'' he recalls. ``We were bowled
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In his other role as an editor for the Colorado publisher
MacMurray &AMP; Beck, Michalson asked Gay if he had any other work.
``He said he had a novel and sent it to me. It was an extraordinary
read as well. He's got the voice and the craft, and he's got this
sense of being a storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Gay had tried without success to find a literary
agent. But when New York agent Williams saw his story, ``I Hate to
See That Evening Sun Go Down,'' in the fall 1998 issue of The
Georgia Review, she immediately tried to get in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so blown away by that story that I went back to my
office and spent a week tracking him down. By that time, he had
sold `The Long Home' to MacMurray &AMP; Beck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay did, however, have another novel, and Williams lost no time
in negotiating a lucrative deal with Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 31, who represents 15 mostly young, emerging writers,
was struck by the maturity of Gay's writing. ``He's the real thing.
It was heads above anything else I'd seen. He doesn't dance around
the truth. His characters don't hide from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A Faulkner influence
</P>
<P>
   Gay compares his writing process to piecing together a jigsaw
puzzle. He writes a number of scenes, not necessarily in order, and
then tries to fit them together.
</P>
<P>
   Looking in vain for an ashtray, he finally taps the ashes off
his cigarette into the pocket of his denim jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I learned to write by reading,'' he continues. ``I
wasted years trying to write about stuff I didn't know anything
about. I tried to write mystery novels and sophisticated F. Scott
Fitzgerald kind of stuff, but I really didn't know what I was
doing. It only worked when I started writing about my own part of
the country and the people I grew up with. I could hear the
dialogue exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``The Long Home'' came from a story he had heard
from an old bootlegger about how people were killed and their
bodies thrown in abandoned wells and cisterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kind of disquieting thing to think about. I wondered
if it was really true. Hardin (the villain in `The Long Home') sort
of evolved from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books in Oxford, loved the book
after being initially astonished that anybody would set a novel in
the 1940s South.
</P>
<P>
   ``That earth has been plowed by others,'' Howorth says, ``but he
managed to write about it successfully. I think he's a terrific
writer. It's clear that he's read Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy, but
his language is rich and original.''
</P>
<P>
   There are pitfalls when it comes to writing about days gone by
in the South, however, and some critics have complained that Gay's
women characters appear to be helpless victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of people don't see is that while some of the women
in `The Long Home' are kind of doormats, this was 40 or 50 years
ago, and most of the women did what their husbands told them to do,
for good or evil,'' Gay says with some annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have an option since there weren't a lot of jobs.
They were sort of trapped. I don't think you can write something
that's set 50 years ago and make it politically correct for the
1990s. It's absurd, because that's not the way it really was.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gay is overwhelmed by his success, he does not seem surprised
by the praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my stories were good, even if nobody else thought they
were at the time,'' he says. ``I thought I could write as well as
some of the other writers whose stuff I saw in print. I didn't
think I could be another Faulkner, but I knew I could tell a
story.''

 &HT;    A hilarious, scary look at independent filmmaking
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any groundswell of shoestring independent filmmaking spawned by
the success of ``The Blair Witch Project'' may be squelched by
Chris Smith's simultaneously hilarious and horrifying documentary,
``American Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A winner at last year's Sundance Film Festival and a runner-up
for best documentary in the recent National Society of Film Critics
vote, ``American Movie'' is a portrait of the artist as a
not-so-young movie geek. Mark Borchardt, a 30-ish high school
dropout who lives in Menomonee Falls, Wis., has been mad about
movies ever since he was a teenager shooting Super-8 epics with
titles like ``The More the Scarier'' (a friend shyly yet proudly
confides, ``I was in `The More the Scarier III''').
</P>
<P>
   When Smith and his producer, Sarah Price, catch up with
Borchardt, he is readying his magnum opus, an autobiographical
feature called ``Northwestern.'' Driving through the bleak winter
countryside, the filmmaker, who's more Ed Wood than Orson Welles,
repeats his mantra: ``I can't fail anymore. I'm not going to drink
and dream. I'm going to create and complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. When Borchardt realizes that he hasn't the
resources (read: money, actors, equipment, crew) to start
``Northwestern,'' he decides to raise funds by completing an
earlier effort called ``Coven,'' which he'll sell direct to video.
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt's ability to talk the talk is one of the most
frightening aspects of ``American Movie,'' financed in part by
Michael Stipe of Athens-based R.E.M. and his film partner Jim
McKay. Sounding like he's the star student at UCLA's film school,
Borchardt talks about ``16 mm black-and-white reversals'' and all
that other tech-obsessed detail that film nerds focus on so often
because they can't focus on anything like themselves or other
people. Trying to shake some bucks out of his senile Uncle Bill,
Borchardt explains that he'll market ``Coven'' by ``bringing it
down to 1/2-inch for multiple sales.'' Croaks Bill, ``Multiple
sales to who?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``American Movie'' is celebrating Borchardt as an
all-American dreamer or satirizing him as an all-American loser is
never clear. Rather, the filmmakers give Borchardt enough rope and
basically let him hang himself. A part-time groundskeeper at a
cemetery who still lives with his mother (she's recruited for
everything from director of photography to an on-screen bit
dragging a corpse across a frozen swamp), Borchardt becomes less
amusing _ or even sympathetic _ as the film progresses. Repeatedly
banging an actor's head into a kitchen cabinet that refuses to
shatter is funny; that's typical actor abuse. That this often
obnoxious and always self-centered overgrown adolescent has three
children isn't. His spending the night in a university editing room
may be admirable. That his kids are sleeping there as well isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith never comments on Borchardt's choices. He just
records them. And that's what makes ``American Movie'' as
compulsively watchable as a train wreck in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   This is a funny, scary, ultimately thought-provoking character
study of someone so out there and yet so emblematic of a certain
type that a fictional version would pale by comparison. At the very
least, Borchardt has a kind of can-do optimism, even if he so
obviously can't do.
</P>
<P>
   And let's look on the bright side. As one interviewee says,
``Honestly, I thought he'd grow up to be a stalker or a serial
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary featuring Mark Borchardt. Directed by Chris Smith.
Rated R for profanity and some drug content. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A look at the Ed Wood of independent filmmaking. Be
afraid. Be very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: It's among 12 finalists for best documentary.
The five nominees will be announced Feb. 15.

 &HT;    Witty `Scream 3' ends slasher series
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not much steam left in ``Scream 3.'' Even so, this final
chapter (they swear) of the smarty-pants slasher series manages to
wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the trilogy in
satisfying fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The setting now is Hollywood, primarily the film studio where
``Stab 3,'' based on the Woodsboro murders of the first ``Scream,''
is being shot. But production shuts down when actors start winding
up dead, knifed by the latest psycho wearing the familiar ghost
costume. Enter dirt-digging reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox
Arquette), who runs into estranged beau Dewey (David Arquette). The
former lawman has moved to Los Angeles to be technical adviser on
the new film. He's also gotten cozy with Jennifer Jolie (Parker
Posey), the actress playing Gale in the movie-within-the-movie.
</P>
<P>
   The catty relationship between Cox and Posey is the film's best
gag, especially when it results in giving us two versions of the
relentless Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, our much-stalked heroine Sidney (Neve Campbell) is
living in heavily alarmed seclusion in one of the city's leafy
canyons, though the killer (whose toys include a very sophisticated
voice modifier) is trying to track her down.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other two movies, the less you know about the plot,
the better. This one continues to treat mass murder as an extension
of show biz, a bloody game whose rules come from horror movies. We
even get a beyond-the-grave cameo from video geek Randy (Jamie
Kennedy), who explains the anything-goes nature of the final part
of a trilogy: The heroine can die, the killer is almost superhuman,
and secrets from the past will erupt.
</P>
<P>
   That means the movie plunges back in time to give us a complex
backstory and a truckload of knotty exposition that ultimately
gives the killers of all three movies a motivation stemming from
the same source. As for the superhuman strength of the killer: This
freak can blow up houses and take on a whole room full of people at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others. It's
easy to guess, if not the killer's name, then his connection to
Sidney. The script tries to keep us off the scent by throwing in a
bunch of new faces and possible suspects: Lance Henriksen as a
longtime horror film producer, Patrick Dempsey as a moody
detective, Scott Foley as the director of ``Stab 3'' and Matt
Keeslar as the actor playing Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' gets off to a shaky start, resorting to Hollywood
in-jokes and pop-culture references. These were novel in the first
``Scream,'' but after only three years, it's a worn-out and much
imitated device, threatening to tip the first hour of the new flick
beyond self-parody and straight into farce. Wes Craven directs
again, but series creator Kevin Williamson had to bail out on the
script, due to overextending on other projects. The chore went to
Ehren Krueger, who lacks the Williamson snap. (Reportedly, his
script has little relationship to Williamson's own outline for the
finale.)
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the movie stumbles with a standard-issue
action scene, as an anxious driver speeds his sport-utility vehicle
through Los Angeles gridlock, causing vehicular havoc. And a couple
of female stabbings seem gratuitous and by-the-numbers. But once
the plot gets going _ and the movie brings the sequestered Sidney
into the action _ the flick gets better. It's fun to see Gale,
Dewey and Sid interact with the actors playing them in ``Stab 3.''
The movie also gets energy from a couple of well-placed cameos.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the series will enjoy a surreal sequence in the studio
hangar, when Sidney has to elude her nemesis on a series of sets
duplicating the major locations in ``Scream.'' The scene has some
of the creepy dreaminess of Craven's ``A Nightmare on Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   You may expect the persistent life-vs.-movies motif to develop
into something interesting, elevating ``Scream 3'' to a new level
of smart self-awareness. Mainly it's just window dressing, though
it pays off in the killer's explanation of his (or her?) actions.
It's a Hollywood in-joke that ends the ``Scream'' movies not with a
whimper, but a knowing laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Neve Campbell
and Parker Posey. Rated R for strong horror violence and
profanity.1 hour, 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent
wrap-up of the series.

 &HT;    `Simpatico' stalls before finish line
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any horse-racing fan. Sometimes you can have the best
bloodlines imaginable and the nag still won't run.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case, alas, with ``Simpatico,'' a movie that boasts a
blue-ribbon cast but never quite finds its footing. Jeff Bridges
plays a wealthy Bluegrass breeder who owns the world's most famous
thoroughbred, Simpatico. For reasons that are initially _ and
deliberately _ unclear, Bridges plans to sell the horse, which
doesn't sit well with his doped-up, depressed wife (Sharon Stone).
But mid-deal, Bridges gets a call from old pal Nick Nolte, now a
crumpled drunk in California with a crush on a naive but honest
grocery checkout clerk (Catherine Keener).
</P>
<P>
   As the movie unfolds, we learn that Bridges, Nolte and Stone
have a shady shared past. Something to do with fixing races and
some sordid sex photos that resulted in ruining the career of a
randy racing commissioner (Albert Finney) 20 years ago. Nolte still
has the pictures, which supposedly explains his hold over Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest pleasure in ``Simpatico'' is watching the pure,
unadorned professionalism of the cast _ especially Finney, who
brings weight and sympathy to an essentially despicable character.
The problem, however, is the script, which is based on a 1994 Sam
Shepard play. All the stuff that Shepard routinely gets away with
onstage _ the vagueness, the heavy symbolism, the lack of a
coherent story line _ is glaringly apparent here. We're more caught
up in his theme than his characters.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's a good theme _ how what we do with our past
affects our present and our future. Do we flee it like Bridges,
hang on to it like Nolte or let it be, like Finney?
</P>
<P>
   But once that conflict is laid out for us, the movie doesn't go
anywhere. It's an actor's exercise, interrupted by too many
flashbacks, weakened by too much repetition. See it for the
performances and, if you're so inclined, for the horses. But keep
in mind that ``Simpatico'' never quite makes it to the winner's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one factual note: Horse lovers will no doubt be
surprised that Bridges plans to present his prize stud decked out
in western gear, a la Trigger, to prospective buyers. It's like
having Michael Jordan pitch running shoes while dressed in a
football jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte, Albert Finney and Sharon
Stone. Directed by Matthew Warchus. Rated R for language and
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another example of when bad movies happen to good
actors.

 &HT;    Alternative ports make cruising convenient for Southern
travelers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've heard of bringing the mountain to Mohammed?
Well, major cruise lines are trying to bring the ocean to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least make it easier for us and our Southern neighbors to
get on their ships. Time was, if you wanted to take a cruise to the
Caribbean or other warm-weather vacation destinations south of the
United States, you had to depart from Miami or Fort Lauderdale. But
thanks to booming business in recent years, major lines have
expanded their Southeastern ports, first to Port Canaveral, about
an hour east of Orlando (it's home to Disney's two ships and
several others), then to Tampa, New Orleans and _ local travelers,
listen up _ Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines has led the way among the majors in
opening up these ports. In 1994, it began service from Tampa and
New Orleans with its smallest ship, Tropicale (1,022 passengers).
Today, Carnival books weekly trips on two cruisers out of Tampa,
Tropicale and Sensation, and one out of New Orleans, Celebration.
These four-to-seven-day tours hit such hot spots as Grand Cayman,
Cozumel and Jamaica. Last year, the line began offering occasional
sailings to the Bahamas out of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruises from these ports are definitely on a growth track,''
says Jennifer de la Cruz, a spokeswoman for Carnival. Out of New
Orleans alone, the company's bookings jumped from 28,000 guests in
1994 to 81,500 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this region, you have a huge population that drives to
cruise departures. It's much easier to drive to New Orleans or even
Tampa than Miami,'' de la Cruz explains.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she continues, ``Some people just don't want to come to
South Florida. They feel it will be too congested and not a
positive experience. And these other ports have a lot of tourist
appeal. We have folks who will come to New Orleans and stay a day
or two before leaving on their cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But before you say ``Miami, Schmiami,'' a word of caution about
the alternative ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they are not the newest, nicest ships,'' says Carol
Heinrich, a travel agent for Elite Cruise Service in Roswell.
Tropicale, for instance, was built in 1982, Celebration in '87.
Last month, Celebration ran into trouble midcruise. A generator
caught fire, forcing passengers to evacuate in Jamaica. (The
repaired ship is scheduled to relaunch today.)
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich also points out that the Charleston sailings are still
rare _ there are only four scheduled this year _ and they are
sometimes chartered by a single travel agency, which may not offer
the discounts you get when you deal directly with the cruise line
or when the trip is offered to several agencies. ``I just think
people get a better value with the South Florida cruises,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Moses, president of the Cruise Authority in Marietta,
says his agency books few cruises out of the alternative ports, but
he does recommend them for people who don't like to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several senior citizens groups that include some
members who won't get on airplanes. They'll charter a bus to New
Orleans and leave from there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, at least, is attempting to improve service to these
ports. Two Charleston cruises this fall will be on a brand-new
ship, Victory, and New Orleans' Celebration is being replaced by
the larger, newer Inspiration in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau shouldn't start to
sweat just yet. ``These ports are still a novelty,'' Moses says.
``There's nothing out there to challenge South Florida.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies

   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big. The sheer size of the latest Imax
offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience. Otherwise,
this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest state is
just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature flicks.
The film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about
Alaskan life. (Bob Longino)40 minutes. C+

   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   featuring Mark Borchardt.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith's documentary is alternately hilarious and
horrifying as it chronicles Mark Borchardt's attempts to make his
autobiographical magnum opus, ``Northwestern.'' The 30-ish
Borchardt _ a high-school drop-out with three kids who still lives
with his mother _ is a not-so-young, incredibly selfish film geek.
``American Movie'' is funny, scary and as compulsively watchable as
a train wreck. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-

<P>
   A finely made adaptation of Frank McCourt's popular memoir of
growing up in poverty and death in Ireland that's almost too
stately for its own good. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their
favorite parts re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the
memory of McCourt's lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might
wonder what the fuss is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness. (SM) At metro
theaters. 2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
``Man'' moves swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down
to become a disappointingly conventional love story that isn't
really persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
(SM)2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM) 1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' R (language, sex, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What begins
as a hypnotic riff on the old surveillance classic, ``The
Conversation,'' ultimately veers off into nowhere. Too bad because
the picture is as stylishly acted as it is directed. An isolated
British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor) becomes more involved
than he intends in the case of a diplomat's son and a mysterious
femme fatale (Ashley Judd). (ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Genghis Blues'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Paul Pena.
</P>
<P>
   Music fans will probably dig this documentary about music's
ability to bridge different cultures, in this case the obscure
Central Asian country, Tuva. America's emissary is Paul Pena, a
blind Creole bluesman who has learned the technique of
throatsinging, which sounds like several voices emerging from one
singer's throat. (SM)1 hour, 28 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and content relating
</P>
<P>
   to drugs, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a
mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' As Susanna, Winona Ryder
steadies the movie and gives it its emotional center, but Angelina
Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath. (ERG)2
hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Grizzly Falls'' PG (wilderness adventure
</P>
<P>
   violence and some mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bryan Brown,
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Clark, Tom Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harry (Richard Harris) scares his grandkids with a campfire
tale of a hungry bear, then tells them a remarkable adventure he
had at their age and that's the start of ``Grizzly Falls.'' It's a
tale about a boy, a bear, and the bond between parent and child _
even if not of the same species. ``Grizzly Falls'' becomes a
message on the value of family bonds that comes through without a
sentimental overstatement. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun Shy'' R (profanity, violence and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Stressed-out undercover drug cop Liam Neeson matches ulcers with
stressed-out junior Mafioso Oliver Platt in a deeply funky New York
comedy about murder, stomach disorders and male anxiety. It's
scattershot, but it scores a few surprising satirical bull's-eyes.
Love interest Sandra Bullock's screen time is unwisely minimized by
producer Sandra Bullock. (Bob Campbell, Newhouse News Service)1
hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington delivers his best performance in years as
pugilist Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender
wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though
ably directed, the film contains some fabrications _ and invents
one key character, a Javert-like detective _ to tell this otherwise
compelling true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' R (language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane
</P>
<P>
   and Stockard Channing.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't great. Or even good. Bette Midler plays ``Valley of the
Dolls'' author Jacqueline Susann, but the movie is neither
biography nor burlesque. It can't decide if its main character is
great, or a gargoyle. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Robards Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of movie you
live through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. Among
the stellar acting talents: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards Jr. and
Julianne Moore. (SM) 2 hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM)1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' R (violence, sexuality, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson
</P>
<P>
   and Lolita Davidovich.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining take on boxing. Antonio Banderas' Cesar, a
Madrid-born boxer, now lives in Los Angeles and has become best
pals with Woody Harrelson's Vince, a Texas-born fighter. The first
half of the film is a road movie, with Grace (Lolita Davidovich),
Vince's former girlfriend and Cesar's current lady, driving them to
Las Vegas; it soon becomes a love story. (Kevin Thomas, From Los
Angeles Times.)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream any more, but it's a decent wrapup of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween getup. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Bridges,
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nolte, Albert Finney
</P>
<P>
   and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the world of horse-racing, this movie reminds you that
you can have the best bloodlines imaginable and sometimes the nag
still won't run. A blue-ribbon cast is wasted on a tale of old pals
with a shared shady past that still haunts them 20 years later.
Jeff Bridges is a wealthy Kentucky breeder; Sharon Stone his
doped-up, depressed wife; Nick Nolte a crumpled alcoholic
blackmailing Bridges. (ERG)1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' PG-13 (profanity, disturbing images,
</P>
<P>
   sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,Youki Kudoh
</P>
<P>
   and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty but chilly. Based on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a
newspaperman looking into slaying charges against a
Japanese-American. The case rekindles memories of internment during
World War II and Hawke's youthful romance with the suspect's wife.
Beautifully photographed to mask its thin plot, ``Cedars''
generates little passion and, frankly, is flatline drama. (SM) 2
hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent
</P>
<P>
   and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas
to enjoy ``Topsy-Turvy.'' But a love of the theater can help you
appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. The ensemble is superb, but it's
Jim Broadbent who turns in a monumental performance as the pompous
William Gilbert. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 39 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A

   CALIF-CAMPAIGN (Los Angeles) _ For years, California has been
the overgrown stepchild of presidential nominating politics, the
most populous state with a primary election too late on the
calendar to matter much. For even longer, it has been the state
that the rest of the nation loves to mock as a collection of kooks,
cultists, cranky conservatives and tanned blond airheads that has
produced politicians as diverse as Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown.
But this year, with its moved-up March 7 primary, California stands
poised to be dispositive in choosing the nominees of both major
parties. And because of a new primary voting system that is, well,
a little bit kooky, California will be something just as important:
the first state where all the candidates appear on the same ballot,
regardless of party, in a preview of where its crucial 54 electoral
votes might go in the general election next fall. By Todd S.

   VODAFONE-MANNESMANN (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Ending a bruising
three-month hostile takeover brawl, two of the world's biggest
companies in wireless communications agreed on Thursday to merge in
a record $178 billion deal. In a stunning victory that had once
been considered unthinkable, Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany, in an
all-stock transaction that easily shattered the previous record for
a takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago. If consummated, the
takeover will vastly expand the geographic reach of Vodafone, which
already is the world's biggest wireless telephone company, giving
it dominance in the European market. The company has major holdings
in the United States, Asia and Africa. By Edmund L. Andrews and

 &HT;    A leisurely journey into culture of music
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of the movie ``Buena Vista Social Club'' will probably dig
``Genghis Blues,'' another documentary about music's ability to
bridge different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In Roko Belic's film, the emissary from America is Paul Pena, a
blind Creole bluesman who has played with T-Bone Walker, B.B. King,
Bonnie Raitt and others, who finds himself in the obscure Central
Asian region of Tuva.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of something strange that Pena hears one night on
the radio: what sounds like several voices emerging from one
singer's throat. Aptly enough, the technique is called
throatsinging. The result is a bizarre, guttural thrumming sound,
as if the human body had been turned into a giant jew's-harp.
</P>
<P>
   Learning the technique at home in San Francisco over the course
of 11 years, Pena eventually travels to Tuva (between Siberia and
Mongolia), where he charms the natives and wins their admiration
for his singing. That's pretty much the movie, which switches
between snippets of Pena encountering Tuvan musicians and singing
before appreciative audiences. The movie is so laid back that it's
hard not to get excited when the musician starts to freak out
because he's almost out of medicine and a member of the U.S.
entourage has a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. These doses of trouble are soon resolved: The
drum-dwelling evil spirit believed to be responsible for the
mishaps is taken care of by a shaman. Then the film continues to
meander along in its carefree fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genghis Blues''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Paul Pena. Unrated. 404-651-2463. 1 hour, 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A good-natured but meandering travelogue and
musical showcase.

   FIRST LOOK: An excerpt from ``The Long Home''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Hardin had taken on the lineaments of evil. You
would sometimes see him on a Saturday streetcorner, the center of a
group of men itemizing the faults of the world. When he spoke men
listened. He seldom laughed but when he did the rest of the men
laughed too in sporadic bursts of mirthless noise. No one wanted to
be in his disfavor, it had come to seem that being in his disfavor
was tantamount to being homeless. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hardin's vulpine face was leaner and more cunning than ever, the
cold yellow eyes more reptilian. Or sharklike, perhaps, lifeless
and blank save a perpetual look of avarice. And he went through
life the way a shark feeds, taking into its belly anything that
attracts its attention, sucking it into the hot maw of darkness and
drawing nourishment from that which contained it, expelling what
did not.

 &HT;    `Life Stories' profiles The New Yorker's writerly prowess
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is February, which means that in a week or two Eustace Tilley
makes his annual appearance on the cover of The New Yorker
magazine, a ritual bow to tradition and to the ghosts of E.B. White
and James Thurber, Joseph Mitchell and founding editor Harold Ross.
Tilley, the fop peering at a butterfly through his monocle, was Rea
Irvin's cover illustration for the magazine's premiere issue on
Feb. 21, 1925.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker would have turned 75 this year _ ``would have''
because a one-time star contributor, Renata Adler, has pronounced
it in rigor mortis. There are those who thought it died years ago,
but the fact is that it still comes out weekly. Premature or not
(and surely it is), Adler's bitter obituary _ ``Gone: The Last Days
of The New Yorker'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) _ and the contretemps
it has provoked suggest that The New Yorker still has what few
publications can ever claim: the capacity to arouse passion.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who cherish The New Yorker for its quirks as
much as for its cartoons, for its fussiness as much as for its
detachment from fashions and trends. Now under only its fifth
editor in 75 years but its third since the sainted William Shawn
was shown the door in 1987, The New Yorker is a different magazine
from the one its most loyal readers remember. But in one respect _
the Profiles that can go on for pages and pages, and sometimes from
one issue to the next _ it is the same.
</P>
<P>
   On its 75th anniversary, a collection of New Yorker profiles,
along with a collection of short fiction, commemorates a form The
New Yorker more than any other publication helped to create. ``Life
Stories: Profiles From The New Yorker'' bridges the magazine's past
and present by displaying what it has always done differently from
any other _ a writer in leisurely immersion in a single subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Profile,'' as David Remnick, the magazine's current
editor, writes, ``is ubiquitous in modern journalism. We are awash
in pieces calling themselves profiles that are about the inner
thoughts of some celebrity; more often than not they are based on
half-hour interviews and the parameters set down by a vigilant
publicist.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the term and the form have become cliches, the one
meaningless shop talk, the other a prisoner of formulaic rules.
Nothing of the sort characterized a New Yorker profile, and this is
what gave it its identity and its strength as a literary form.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a New Yorker profile couldn't, sometimes, present
problems of its own. Joseph Mitchell, whom Malcolm Cowley once
called the best reporter in the country, had the suspicious gift of
recalling page upon page of conversation, years after it took
place. Yet it was Mitchell's understated style and his sense for
physical detail that became hallmarks of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's piece ``Mr. Hunter's Grave,'' whose subject is an
87-year-old widower who tends the graves of his two wives, his name
on the headstone of one, his future resting place beside the other,
is the first of 25 profiles (``because I love it so'') that Remnick
has selected for a book that ranges from Truman Capote on Marlon
Brando to Susan Orlean on a show dog named Biff. (First sentence:
``If I were a bitch, I'd be in love with Biff Truesdale.'') There
are, as Remnick says, profiles whose animating impulse is malice
(Wolcott Gibbs on Time's Henry Luce) or praise (Joan Acocella on
Mikhail Baryshnikov), others whose theme is identity (Henry Louise
Gates Jr. on Anatole Broyard) or ``the strangeness of American
fame'' (Kenneth Tynan on Johnny Carson).
</P>
<P>
   And a few that are just hard to categorize, such as Ian Frazier
on Heloise.
</P>
<P>
   Disparate as their subjects might be, one quality, as Remnick
writes, connects nearly all of them _ ``a sense of obsession.'' The
Chudnovsky brothers, profiled by Richard Preston, are obsessed with
the number pi _ 3.14 _ and with finding a pattern in randomness.
Calvin Trillin's Edna Buchanan is an obsessive crime reporter in
Miami who visits the scenes of disaster four, five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   From piece to piece, the voices are those of a single writer and
his subject. Seldom are third parties summoned from the wings to
provide an obligatory quote or two and then sent on their way. The
result is an intimacy and immediacy that come from the subject
himself, not the chatter of others.
</P>
<P>
   There are results of another kind as well, and a good example is
John McPhee's ``Travels in Georgia.'' Over the years McPhee has
lost some readers with his excursions into plate tectonics and
other geologic arcana, but in this piece he shows how good English
prose is concrete and visual, built from nouns and verbs. He is
with Atlanta natives Carol Ruckdeschel and Sam Candler, a pair of
ecologists out looking for road kill. Here he describes their
coming upon a snapping turtle that has been hit by a pickup:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam reversed. He drove backward rapidly, as fast as the car
would go. He stopped on the shoulder, and we all got out. There was
a pond beyond the turtle. The big, broad head was shining with
blood, but there was, as yet, very little blood on the road. The
big jaws struck as we came near, opened and closed bloodily _ not
the kind of strike that, minutes ago, could have cut off a finger,
but still a strike with power. The bright spots on its marginal
scutes were like light bulbs in a mirror. The neck lunged out.
Carol urged the turtle, with her foot, toward the side of the road.
`I know, big man,' she said to it. `I know it's bad. We're not
tormenting you. Honest, we're not.' Sam asked her if she thought it
had a chance to live and she said she was sure it had no chance at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   In pieces such as these, The New Yorker has been at its most
vital, a magazine that, in Adler's words, neither chased after
readers nor pandered to them. If it ran ``absolutely counter to the
mentality of subscription surveys, focus groups and polls,'' so
much the better. It was what it was, sure of its readers because it
was sure of itself.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ABOUT THE NEW YORKER
</P>
<P>
   Over the past quarter century, dozens of books have been written
about The New Yorker and the personalities that shaped it. To mark
the magazine's 75th anniversary, a few more join the ranks. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wonderful Town: New York Stories From The New Yorker, edited
by David Remnick (Random House, $26.95). Short fiction from writers
ranging from John Cheever to Maeve Brennan to Jamaica Kincaid, all
set in the singular city.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made by Ben Yagoda
(Scribner, $27.50). Drawing freely from the magazine's archives and
from hundreds of interviews with editors, writers and longtime
readers, this is an analytical history of the publication itself,
not so much the people behind it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Letters From the Editor: The New Yorker's Harold Ross, edited
by Thomas Kunkel (Random House, $26.95). In hundreds of
fascinating, fierce, funny letters, we witness the magazine founder
</P>
<P>
   ``lecturing Orson Welles, baiting J. Edgar Hoover, inviting Noel
Coward and Ginger Rogers to the circus, wheedling Ernest Hemingway
(`Are you ever going to write any short stories again? My God.'),
offering to sell Harpo Marx a used car ... and
</P>
<P>
   explaining to restaurateur-to-the-stars Dave Chasen, step by
step, how to smoke a turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some Times in America: And a Life in a Year at The New Yorker
by Alexander Chancellor (Carroll &AMP; Graf, $25). With wry,
self-deprecating wit, the
</P>
<P>
   British journalist recalls his year spent editing Talk of the
Town for Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Janet, My Mother and Me by William Murray
</P>
<P>
   (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24). Murray, a former staff writer at The
New
</P>
<P>
   Yorker, recounts a childhood spent with his mother, Natalia
Danesi
</P>
<P>
   Murray, and her longtime lover, Janet Flanner, who wrote the
acclaimed ``Letter From Paris'' column.

 &HT;    The ring's the thing: Use your head, heart when buying diamond
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hey, fellas, listen up.
</P>
<P>
   The most romantic thing you can give your lady love for
Valentine's Day is a marriage proposal. The next most romantic is a
diamond engagement ring to let her know you're serious.
</P>
<P>
   But buying a diamond on impulse is as risky as rushing to the
altar that way. So it would pay to heed the following pointers,
from local jewelry experts and a groom to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to buy it: ``Shop around,'' advises Bret Cottick, a
29-year-old software consultant from Alpharetta who recently
surprised his girlfriend, Lisa Flaccus, with a solitaire diamond
engagement ring. ``You can find the same types of diamonds with the
same certificate at many, many stores throughout Atlanta. Go with
someone you trust.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's hot on the market: A colorless or slightly white
diamond in a platinum setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are returning to the classics,'' says Tom Carroll
of Tiffany &AMP; Co. ``Platinum continues to be the (band) color of
choice. It's about 85 percent of what we sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris J. Botnick, owner of Worthmore Jewelers in Atlanta,
agrees. ``Anything platinum is popular,'' he says. ``People realize
it has a lot of advantages over white and yellow gold. Platinum is
more rare, which adds to its popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to look for in a diamond: They're still defined by the
``four C's'':
</P>
<P>
   Carat _ The size of the diamond. It's a matter of budget and
personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   Color _ Diamonds are graded from A to Z. The earlier the letter
in the alphabet, the better the color. For example, stones with a D
to F grade are free of color and fall within the top color range,
because of their rarity. Diamonds graded G to I are in the medium
price range and have a slight white color. Diamonds with J to Z
grades are yellow or brownish in color and are of lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Clarity _ Refers to the visible marks inside or on the surface
of the diamond. A top-quality stone will have no marks visible to
the naked eye. A diamond with low clarity has prominent markings.
</P>
<P>
   Cut _ Indicates the proportions in which the stone was cut to
make it sparkle. Also consider the shape in which it was cut, such
as marquis, oval, round, square, emerald, pear, heart or
rectangular.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Should you shop for the ring alone or take your intended with
you? It's a matter of personal preference. Many men take their
girlfriends with them to make sure they get a style she likes. But
there are others, such as Cottick, who'd rather pick it out alone,
so the engagement ring comes as a total surprise when they propose.
``I don't think you need to drag her along,'' Cottick says. ``If
you're getting ready to ask someone to marry you and you don't know
what her taste in jewelry is, you should think hard about what
you're going to do.''

 &HT;    New coffee-table book looks at the intriguing hairstyle called
dreadlocks
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 6.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something both off-putting and intriguing about ``dread
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that duality in attitudes toward dreadlocked hair, combined
with the power of good black-and-white photography and this era's
fascination with testimonials, that could cause you to acquire
``Dreads'' (Artisan, $35), a new coffee-table book by Italian
lensmen Francesco Mastalia and Alfonse Pagano.
</P>
<P>
   As Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker writes in the
book's foreword, explaining why she dreaded her own hair a decade
ago: ``I wondered what such hair felt like, smelled like.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the hairstyles mankind has manifested, dreadlocks may be
the most curious. And, truly, some of the 100 dreaded hairstyles
that these two shutterbugs immortalized have the look of matted
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the sight of a dreaded head gets us, as
Walker puts it, ``aroused.'' Mating with someone who chooses a
matted mane, she writes, ``must be like the mating of lions.''
</P>
<P>
   And so we look, stare even, and wonder. Dread heads peer into
the mirror and do the same.
</P>
<P>
   As this book points out, Africans and Asians, Australians,
Caucasians and Jamaicans apply such words as ``sacred,''
``natural'' and ``liberating'' to their unbrushed heads. But dare
to approach a dread and ask for a succinct explanation of why their
hair is that way, and you may get a halting, uncertain response.
</P>
<P>
   The dreadlocked Atlantans we approached and ultimately
photographed were no exception. Some took weeks to form their
responses. Their looks spoke volumes, perhaps more than their
testimonials ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio ``DJ Gato'' Soca, 23
</P>
<P>
   College student, /DJ, 23
</P>
<P>
   ``My locks represent myself and my personality. By no means is
it a hairstyle or fashion statement. I take pride in my dreads;
they aren't the easiest to carry around. There are people who love
to prejudge other people who don't look a certain way or may look a
little out of the ordinary. But people's opinions don't move me at
all. Still I love my locks, and now that my mother does too, it
makes it more enjoyable and worthwhile. The ocean and other dreads'
positive vibes contributed to my decision to undergo lockdown.''
Turtleneck ($60) by Ralph Lauren, from Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Maxamilliah Noflin, 38
</P>
<P>
   Office administrator, 38
</P>
<P>
   ``I began locking my hair in 1994, which (signaled) the death of
Jannie Marie Noflin-Hegamin and the rebirth of `Maxamilliah.' I
never intended to grow dreadlocks; it seemed to me at the time so
permanent, and I was not willing to make the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I was residing in Manhattan Beach, Calif. I love
the ocean. My original plan was to embrace my ethnicity by sporting
an Afro and occasionally twisting my hair. However, the combination
of the salt water and my hair fell in love with each other; my hair
naturally started locking. Meanwhile, my spirituality began to
flourish as well. As I stepped into my spirituality and loving
myself, I decided to lock my hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having locks is like removing a veil from my eyes. I see
people and my environment through different eyes. Bottom line:
Having my locks has been a blessed event for me. I am no longer
lost. I am on the path.'' Sweater dress ($400) by Missoni, from
Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Consuela Brooks,
</P>
<P>
   Poet/songwriter, 22
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this month, I've had my dreads for five years. My locks
are a constant reminder of unity. People would say I'm weakening my
locks because I lighten them. But I disagree. To me, it shows my
inner fire.'' Blouse ($35) and skirt ($50) from TriBeCa, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ase ``Red Wadz'' Anderson,
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer, 27
</P>
<P>
   ``Locks have been with me for eight years and represent my bond
with my mother, nature, and my link to Father Time. They are the
roots that strengthen my life.'' Velvet burnout shirt ($90) from
TriBeCa, Atlanta.

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DIRECTIONS: ``New Directions'' (Blue Note).
</P>
<P>
   The history of Blue Note Records in the 1950s and '60s is both
routinely fetishized and dulled. There's no other period of jazz
from which the documents are so beautiful: Reid Miles'
constructivist album-cover designs, Francis Wolff's tenebrous
photographs of musicians in the studio, the intimate, resonating
sound created for them by the engineer Rudy Van Gelder.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when the average group of young jazz musicians these
days decides to play a classic tune associated with the label from
that period, like Lee Morgan's ``Sidewinder'' or Joe Henderson's
``Recorda Me,'' watch out for musical diffidence, the stuff that
gives jazz a stodgy name, with no apparent will to update those
strong little melodies and small-group arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   So what's really impressive about the album by New Directions _
a special band made of current players on the Blue Note label,
including Greg Osby, Stefon Harris, Mark Shim and Jason Moran, who
were given the opportunity to record their choice of tunes from
Blue Note's history _ is how unlabored and efficacious their
reworkings of these tunes are.
</P>
<P>
   This is an album that sets the mark for what cool is in jazz at
the moment, not only in playing but also in conception. Every tune
is reworked from scratch: where there was a vamp in a piano's bass
clef, it has been transferred to a higher register on a different
instrument and reharmonized; where there was a dominant rhythm,
like the bossa nova beat in Horace Silver's ``Song for My Father,''
it's been wiped away without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering chords from Harris' vibraphone and Moran's piano,
pushing against the time of the rhythm section, add an air of
watery irresolution and mystery to the tunes; Osby and Shim's
saxophone lines are clean and darting, and the drummer Nasheet
Waits maintains a balletic, rising-and-falling stammer on the snare
drum and ride cymbal.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of this repertory-centered record is that there's a
true group sound at work: there's such an intuitive comfort in the
musicians' interaction that whatever repertory they choose is
ultimately unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, judicious thought was given to material, which ranges
from the hits and modern standards by Morgan, Henderson and Horace
Silver to much lesser known pieces like Sam Rivers' ballad
``Beatrice'' (here done as a duet for piano and vibraphone), Wayne
Shorter's ``Ping Pong,'' and some beguiling originals by members of
the group.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: End of the road for Bauer
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the janitor's son who served in the Reagan White
House and mounted a presidential bid of his own, has decided to
drop out of the race, according to news outlets citing anonymous
sources close to the conservative activist. His campaign said today
that Bauer would hold a news conference Friday morning, but did not
reveal details of the event _ but he is expected to announce his
withdrawal then.
</P>
<P>
   THE REST OF THE FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley was campaigning in San Francisco. Al Gore also was
in California before flying to Washington state for an event in
Olympia. John McCain and Georgia W. Bush were in South Carolina,
with Bush breaking off for an event in Detroit. Steve Forbes was on
a bus tour of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   THE MIDAS TOUCH
</P>
<P>
   Like the fairy tale character who spun straw into gold, John
McCain is turning his New Hampshire win into green. Since Tuesday's
victory, McCain has raised more than $740,000 through his campaign
Web site and thousands more at a fund-raiser in South Carolina. In
addition, the site logged 4,000 new volunteers. ``I'm humbled and
gratified that so many people would support my message of
conservative independent reform,'' McCain said today. At the rate
he's going, McCain could top the million-dollar mark by Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   KERREY KNOWS THE TRUTH WHEN HE HEARS IT
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is demanding that Al Gore apologize for the actions
of some campaign staffers who reportedly mocked Sen. Bob Kerrey
(D-Neb.), who has been campaigning for Bradley. Bradley: ``Gore
people demeaned him and called him a cripple. They threw mud, and I
think ... he ought to take responsibility for those actions and
ought to apologize.'' Kerrey, who lost a leg in Vietnam, took it a
bit easier, saying that calling him a cripple ``was the only honest
thing they said all day.''
</P>
<P>
   VEGAS COULD HAVE TAKEN A BEATING
</P>
<P>
   Most polls had a pretty good grip on the winners in New
Hampshire, but the margin of victory was a bit slippery. Most
picked Al Gore to win the Democratic primary and John McCain to win
the Republican contest. But almost nobody anticipated McCain's
18-point spread, winning not only the independents but the
registered Republicans, too. Gore's four-point margin was close to
the mark.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S GEORGE?
</P>
<P>
   When California Republicans meet this weekend in Sacramento to
size up presidential candidates, there will be a very conspicuous
absence: George W. Bush is skipping the gathering for the third
straight time, sending his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to speak
on his behalf. The W. will be in Michigan when the convention opens
Friday, and will spend most of the weekend resting in Texas after
an 18-day sprint through Iowa and New Hampshire. John McCain will
be at the convention, though, speaking on his own behalf.
</P>
<P>
   TWO WEEKS TILL SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   The next crucial decision in the 2000 presidential primary
season will be made Feb. 19 by Republican voters in South Carolina.
It's ``Bush country,'' claims George W. Bush, suddenly struggling
to recover from the whipping by John McCain in New Hampshire. But
with its long military tradition and large military population,
South Carolina really could be McCain country. The state has a
natural place in its heart for the surging war hero and POW in
Vietnam. Two polls released Thursday show the Bush and McCain
statistically even.
</P>
<P>
   LINE THEM UP, SEE WHO SALUTES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush collected endorsements from retired generals and
war heroes Thursday. His endorsements came from a parade of
veterans' groups, Medal of Honor winners and former general
officers, led by retired Adm. Thomas Moorer. But continuing to
question Bush's fitness to lead, John McCain said he wouldn't need
``on-the-job training'' as commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S GOT QUAYLE _ THAT SHOULD CLINCH IT
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle threw his support to George W. Bush, describing him
as the candidate with the values as well as the other
qualifications to be president. ``We know that we have prosperity
today, but let us be very clear that prosperity without values is
no prosperity at all,'' Quayle added. Shortly before Quayle dropped
out of the presidential race in August, his South Carolina campaign
aides left him to support John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLY PREPARED
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how close Al Gore's advisers thought they were
coming to losing in New Hampshire, ABC reports, his speechwriters
had drafted two versions of a speech for delivery Tuesday night.
Throughout the day, according to ABC, Gore aides were having
heartburn over exit polls that at some points showed Bradley ahead.
The staff was still editing the losing speech even as the winning
results started coming in.
</P>
<P>
   NAUGHTY-NAUGHTY, THEY GOT CAUGHTY
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the New York state GOP answered a challenge by Steve
Forbes by admitting in court that Republicans in Brooklyn and the
Bronx used fraudulent signatures to try to get George W. Bush on
the March 7 presidential primary ballot in their districts. The
admission means no Bush delegates will appear on primary ballots in
the 16th Congressional District, which covers part of the Bronx.
The 10th District frauds were committed only by people seeking to
become alternates, so the regular Bush delegates can remain on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   JUST INVESTIGATE WHEN DEMOCRATS DO IT
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is suing the Federal Election Commission
over the agency's decision to drop an investigation of foreign
donations to the Republican Party. At issue is a $2.1 million
donation in 1994 from a Hong Kong businessman, Ambrous Young. The
contribution was solicited by then-party Chairman Haley Barbour.
The FEC's general counsel had recommended proceeding, but the
commission deadlocked 3-3 along party lines and dropped the case,
according to records made public.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE JUST BLOWING SMOKE RINGS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain was greeted in South Carolina with ads bashing him
for supporting a tobacco tax increase favored by President Clinton.
The ads by the National Smokers Alliance, based in Alexandria, Va.,
are scheduled to run through the week in Columbia, Charleston and
Florence. ``I'm honored by their opposition,'' McCain said at the
University of South Carolina. ``There's no other group I would
rather be attacked by.''
</P>
<P>
   NO SWIMSUITS OR SASHES
</P>
<P>
   In the world of politics, some presidential primaries and straw
polls are just beauty contests that allow voters to express their
opinions, but have nothing to do with selecting delegates. Delaware
this weekend is an example. The state's Democratic Party is having
a primary Saturday, but won't actually allocate its 22 delegates
until caucuses held throughout the state on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   WITH CATLIKE TREAD, UPON HIS OPPONENT HE STEALS
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Rudy Giuliani has no intention of announcing
that he's running for the Senate from New York. But it's not that
he doesn't want to; it's just that the only time he ever formally
announced an elective run _ in 1989, his first shot at the New York
City mayoralty _ he lost. So he said he plans to stealthily become
a candidate ``in the middle of the night,'' presenting a stark
contrast to Sunday's gala campaign kickoff by adversary Hillary
Rodham Clinton, which he calls a ``Hollywood kind of
extravaganza.''
</P>
<P>
   THE JOYS OF THE COMMUTER SHUTTLE
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents called it unprecedented: a vice president
sitting on a commercial flight, snoozing like any other New
York-to-Washington commuter. That was early Wednesday morning, when
Al Gore had to make a mad dash to D.C. for a possible tie-breaking
Senate vote and Air Force Two wasn't ready. But there he was,
trying to sleep with his head tipped against the window, ignoring
the bagel snack on his tray. He also had to ignore the interview
with George W. Bush on the overhead TV. Gore did wake up in time to
bring his seat back into the full upright position, and close and
lock his tray table like a good passenger.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SIMPLE, OLD-FASHIONED MERCHANDIZING
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's campaign committee, which didn't
hold any traditional fund-raising events last year, took in more
than $137,000 in 1999, most of it from sales of action figures and
other Venturabilia. The fund-raising is modest for a sitting
governor, and the way it was raised is perhaps unprecedented: no
contributions from lobbyists or political action committees, only
about a dozen individual donors who gave more than $100 apiece, and
not one who gave the nonelection-year limit of $500.

`MASTERPIECE THEATER' PRODUCTION OF `BOVARY' IS SINFULLY SENSUOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Emma Bovary were around today, what do you suppose she'd be
reading? Cosmopolitan? Victoria's Secret? Architectural Digest?
</P>
<P>
   In Gustave Flaubert's randy tale of a narcissistic, unsatiable
dreamer, the beautiful-but-bored Madame Bovary finds escape in the
romantic novels and society journals of her day _ the mid-19th
century. An early proponent of the school of style that proclaims
it is better to look good than feel good, Emma Bovary is the
reflection of modern-day styloids for whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away too much of the story in the new ``Madame
Bovary'' for PBS's ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' Emma's mirror
eventually cracks and we are left to assume that shallow
materialism and the preference for beauty over morality are
inadvisable career options.
</P>
<P>
   No big shocker there, but this co-production of WGBH Boston and
the BBC is so sumptuous, so sensuous, that fans of PBS's
``Masterpiece Theatre'' shouldn't mind the fairly obvious track.
Frances O'Connor, currently gracing movie screens in the Miramax
version of Jane Austen's ``Mansfield Park,'' brings such honest
yearning to ``Bovary'' that it's hard not to like her, despite her
cuckolding the devoted but painfully pedestrian country doctor she
married for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the other man's grass is greener, not to mention
more fun to roll around in, Emma pursues sexual ecstasy the way a
retriever chases a stick. Suffering terminal ennui in a one-sided
marriage, Emma comes back for more, more, more passion because
suitors keep throwing her lifelines a la Regis Philbin. Well, not
exactly. Regis keeps his clothes on in ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so Rodolphe (Greg Wise), the hunky cad who wins Emma's heart
by taking her on a canter through the Norman countryside. A few
grass stains later, Emma is so smitten that reality for her is
forever altered. She has a beautiful daughter, a loving husband
who'll do anything for her and a spacious house that is comfortably
appointed, yet her idea of the perfect life bears no resemblance to
the one she comes home to after her licentious assignations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief catalyst for her domestic dissatisfaction is Charles,
her husband. Although hardly passionless, the affectionate,
attentive Charles is no match for Emma's fantasies. Hugh
Bonneville, who appears with O'Connor in ``Mansfield Park'' as a
well-heeled dandy, plays pretty much the opposite as Charles. The
quintessential ``nice guy'' _ well-meaning, educated, considerate _
Charles is the sort of man some desperate women dream about.
Bonneville plays him not as a one-dimensional dolt but as a simple
man with simple tastes and needs. It's this subtle but important
difference that allows O'Connor to achieve a Madame Bovary who is
at once despicable and delectable. Hugh Dancy, as another of Emma's
lovers, artfully brings the necessary ingredient of youthful
indiscretion to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The film airs in two 90-minute segments, one this Sunday, the
other Feb. 13. The second half is more satisfying, with faster
pacing and more interesting plot points. But O'Connor and
Bonneville do such faithful justice to Flaubert's main characters
that sitting through a less-than-stellar Part I is hardly a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Madame Bovary. Three-hour ``Masterpiece Theatre'' film about a
middle-class Frenchwoman's quest for passion in her life. Starring
Frances O'Connor, Greg Wise, Hugh Bonneville, Hugh Dancy, Trevor
Peacock and Keith Barron. Airing in two parts, Sunday and Feb. 13,
on PBS. Check local listing. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA.

   DUSSELDORF, Germany _ Ending a brutal struggle to dominate
Europe's insatiable market for wireless communications, a company
that was until recently a relative unknown name outside Britain on
Thursday rammed through the biggest takeover deal in history.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after attempting the biggest hostile takeover bid
in history, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain achieved a stunning
victory Thursday morning when Mannesmann AG of Germany surrendered
and agreed to be acquired for about $170 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest corporate takeover on any continent, eclipsing
the previous record set less than three weeks ago _ America Online
Inc.'s $165 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the takeover will create the world's biggest
wireless communications company, one that dominates the European
market and also has major holdings in the United States, Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is even more important as a watershed in European
corporate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a European company carried off a hostile
takeover on such an audacious scale: cross-border, cross-cultural
and financed with shares in a company that most Germans had never
heard of until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented hostile bid outraged many German leaders,
including Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who attacked it as a
violation of Germany's tradition of consensus that could lead to
the dismantlement of a revered German company.
</P>
<P>
   But in a major departure from traditional European practice,
Mannesmann avoided any attempt to seek political protection and
waged its battle by appealing directly to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   When it became obvious this week that shareholders were ready to
sell out, Mannesmann's embattled chief executive, Klaus Esser,
reluctantly sued for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached after hours of bargaining at
Mannesmann headquarters here Wednesday night, Esser agreed to
endorse a peaceful takeover in which Vodafone will issue millions
of new shares to buy out Mannesmann shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes just four days before the expiration of
Vodafone's hostile bid to Mannesmann shareholders. And although it
is nominally a ``friendly'' merger, Esser only capitulated when it
became obvious that a majority of his shareholders were about to
sell out.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shareholders will end up with about 49.5 percent of
the combined company's stock, and Esser will resign from the
company in favor of Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone shares hold their value, the agreement will become a
huge bonanza for Mannesmann shareholders. At current stock prices,
the Vodafone offer is worth more than 330 euros per share _ more
than double the price that Mannesmann shares were trading at before
the takeover battle began last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is a bitter defeat for Esser, who passionately
fought to preserve his company's independence. It is also a shock
for Mannesmann, an old-line industrial conglomerate that had
brilliantly transformed itself into the biggest provider of
wireless communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gent also outmaneuvered Esser on the chessboard of Europe's
wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely
valuable national wireless licenses in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann owns national networks in Germany, Italy and Britain.
Vodafone owns Britain's second-largest network and scores of other
stakes around Europe and on other continents.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed
to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies _ Vivendi SA of
France.
</P>
<P>
   That move derailed Esser's desperate attempt to hammer out a
merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a major
French network and greatly strengthened his position with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie
Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal
convinced wavering shareholders that Esser had lost the upper hand,
even with his allies, and they immediately began betting on a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's
three biggest markets _ Britain, Germany and Italy _ along with a
45-percent stake in the biggest U.S. network and holdings in more
than 30 other countries from Sweden and Poland to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has witnessed a surge of big hostile takeovers in
the last two years, the takeover of Mannesmann makes history on
several fronts besides its sheer size.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has seen a surge of hostile takeovers, the only
successful ones have occurred between competitors within a single
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Mannesmann marks one of the first real battles
for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants
recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption
of a single currency in eleven countries made it crucial to
overcome national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also marks one of the first cases in which national
political leaders did not try to interfere in order to protect an
important domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated
takeover battle last year, it was largely sanctioned and guided by
the French Ministry of Finance, which wanted to consolidate the
nation's banking industry and keep out foreign bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true when Totalfina SA, the French-Belgian oil
company, launched a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine
SA. Likewise, Italian political leaders actively opposed the
proposed telephone merger between Deutsche Telekom of Germany and
Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Italy's Olivetti SPA.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reaction was entirely different. Despite the
angry rhetoric from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about the
dangers of hostile takeovers, the German government stayed out of
the fight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That reflected a widespread view among German executives that it
was far more dangerous to interfere with a legitimate if hostile
bid and jeopardize the ability of German companies like
DaimlerChrysler to buy up foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser and Gent waged their battle almost entirely
through direct appeals to shareholders themselves.

WITTY `SCREAM 3' IS _ OH, YES _ STILL A SLASHER FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM PETERSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kevin Williamson left his screenwriting job after the first
two ``Screams,'' there was worry among fans that ``Scream 3'' could
fall into the dreaded third-movie-in-a-trilogy letdown that not
even director Wes Craven, one of the masters of horror, could save.
</P>
<P>
   However, Craven, who also directed ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2,''
was more than up to the task with new writer Ehren Kruger
(``Arlington Road''), delivering one of the better second sequels
of any genre, not just horror films.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is back again from her narrow
escapes in the previous two bloodbaths, living and working alone in
the bunker-like conditions of her rural home.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Hollywood on the set of ``Stab 3,'' the second
sequel to the film-within-a-film of ``Scream 2,'' dead bodies are
starting to pile up. The evil cell phone prankster with the ghost
mask seems to be shaking things up yet again in his search for the
ever elusive Sidney.
</P>
<P>
   Other surviving characters who make the return trip include the
overly ambitious TV reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette)
and the Barney Fife of horror films, former Deputy Dewey Riley
(David Arquette), who is now the technical consultant for ``Stab
3.''
</P>
<P>
   When the original ``Scream'' was released, it set a new standard
for youth horror films, made a killing at the box office and
unfortunately inspired many forgettable knockoffs throughout the
later portion of the 1990s. ``Scream 2'' bucked the trend of hollow
movie sequels by retaining the original's smarts and self-parody by
using a movie-within-a-movie premise that was based on ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' also has wit and intelligence, but at their core
the ``Scream'' movies are still slasher films and this one is no
exception. The usual trimmings are here, with lots of blood, plenty
of screaming and continual checking of the pulses of horribly
eviscerated people to see if they are indeed truly dead.
</P>
<P>
   But what has always set the ``Scream'' movies apart from other
teen horror dreck is their witty dialogue, surprising plot twists
and ability to make fun of themselves. Kruger delivers a clever
script, even if it pales a bit in comparison to Williamson's savvy
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, Cox Arquette and Arquette give convincing performances
as the three people who truly have the worst luck in the known
universe. The true standout of the film, however, is former
indie-queen Parker Posey, showing yet again that her acting chops
are ready for more major studio roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' also keeps true to the series' tradition of playing
like a mystery as the plot twists and turns, keeping the audience
in suspense as to who (or what) the killer really is.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving anything away, the ending felt a bit
anti-climactic after the build-up through three movies. To be fair
though, most endings to good series never seem to feel quite right
since our expectations rarely match the result.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Craven hasn't lost his horror film touch. But even
though he is currently moving away from the genre (``Music of the
Heart''), his slasher smarts with Kruger's fun and smart script put
a nice finish on a scary franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Scream 3. Directed by Wes Craven. Written by Ehren Kruger. Cast:
David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette, Parker Posey.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than ever, people seem to be in search of what
is truly ``authentic.'' They want authentic political candidates,
authentic experiences on their adventure vacations and authentic
works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Because most art created in the Middle Ages was made for the
church, not for private patrons, some collectors say that it is
somehow more genuine and less self-conscious than art from other
periods. Precious devotional materials like exquisitely carved
wooden saints, metalwork church vessels, altars, enameled plaques
or ivory crucifixions were made to glorify God. They imply good
faith and sincere intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that collectors need be religious to appreciate the appeal
of medieval art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the work speaks for itself,'' said Tony Blumka,
the owner of Blumka Gallery on East 72nd Street in Manhattan.
Blumka specializes in what is known as early European works of art,
which includes medieval (the 5th to 15th centuries), Renaissance
(15th and 16th centuries) and Baroque (17th century).
</P>
<P>
   Blumka has presented an exhibition of 140 artworks titled
``Collecting Treasures of the Past,'' which runs through next
Friday. (Viewing information: (212) 734-3222.) He organized it with
an old family friend, the dealer Florian Eitle-Boehler of Munich.
Both come from families who have been selling European works of art
for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two families have known each other for a long time,''
Blumka said. He is the fourth-generation Blumka to run his family's
gallery, which was founded in Vienna in the late 1800s. It moved to
New York in 1939, when Blumka's father left Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The Boehler gallery, founded in 1880 in Munich, was named
Purveyor to the Imperial Court of Germany and the Royal Court of
Bavaria in 1900. ``Florian took over his uncle's firm,'' Blumka
said. ``My father did business with his uncle and his uncle's
father.''
</P>
<P>
   The two young men spent a year planning the core of this show:
35 objects from the collection of Ernst and Martha Kofler-Truniger,
a couple from Lucerne, Switzerland, who had bought medieval works
from both galleries. Kofler-Truniger died in 1989 at 90, Blumka
said, and his wife died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their collection was cream of the cream,'' said Blumka, noting
that the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Art
and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in Lugano, Switzerland, have
already acquired works from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces we are selling have not been seen on the market for
decades,'' he said. ``They are being offered for the first time and
they are the last group to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The works include a 12th-century oak reliquary casket from
Cologne with applied bone carvings of saints; a tiny 13th-century
ivory statue of the Virgin in prayer; a rare circa 1400 German
bronze aquamanile in the form of a saddled horse (aquamaniles are
water containers used for ritual hand-washing); a large alabaster
St. John the Evangelist made in the Netherlands around 1430, and a
polychrome wood sculpture of St. George on horseback made in Styria
in the 15th century.
</P>
<P>
   These pieces have a genuine freshness. The St. George, for
example, has his sword raised above his head, about to slash the
dragon. Wearing golden armor, he sits on a red saddle. His gray
steed, complete with its original 500-year-old leather reins, rears
above the ferocious dragon, which lies on its back on the ground,
long, curled tail and clawed feet in midair. The saint looks at the
dragon, which has just snapped his lance in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost date it by its armor,'' Blumka said. ``If the
shoes are pointed, it is pre-1500.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Katz, a London dealer in Renaissance bronzes, bought the
St. George. `It's a gift for my son,'' he said. ``I won't sell
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hack, an avid New York collector, acquired the alabaster
St. John. The Evangelist rests his face on one hand as if deep in
thought. He has flesh-colored face and hands and wears a deeply
carved white cloak. His brown wavy hair shows traces of gilding.
</P>
<P>
   The price range for such art is wide; at this show, the pieces
go from $3,500 to $500,000 (the top estimate is for an Italian
majolica Apollo plate, circa 1545, that the Blumka Gallery
previously sold at Sotheby's in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prices may seem high until they are compared with
those paid for artworks from other periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a first-rate medieval object for a third of the
price of an old master,'' Blumka said. ``Early works of art have
always been comparatively inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he continued, ``this business has really
changed. Ten years ago, 85 percent of what I sold went to museums.
Now 85 percent goes to the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, at Sotheby's auction of European works of art in New
York, a Florentine Renaissance bronze statue of a prancing stallion
was sold to a private collector for $761,500, well above the
pre-sale high estimate of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the same sale, a bronze bust of Pope Pius V made in Rome in
the late 16th century went to an Italian collector for $96,000
(against a high estimate of $70,000).
</P>
<P>
   A magnificent terra cotta relief depicting the Ecstasy of St.
Theresa of Avila, made by Tommaso Amantini in Rome in the 17th
century, was sold to the Middlebury College Museum of Art for
$123,500, against a high estimate of $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Blumka credits museums, and particularly the Met, for igniting
the public's interest in early art. He cited the recent Met shows
of Byzantine art and art from the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon and
its 1996 ``Enamels of Limoges: 1100 to 1350.'' He timed his current
show to coincide with the opening next week of the Met's exhibition
on Tilman Riemenschneider, the German Renaissance master wood
sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Such shows, he suggests, create an interest in early art among
clients who previously focused on paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a certain amount of time, many people gravitate to
earlier works,'' he said. ``They are attracted to the simplicity of
the form, the elegance of the materials and the sheer rarity.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out a 10th-century Byzantine ivory relief of the
Crucifixion in his show.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering Christ is flanked by two saints who stand between
pierced open-work columns. Slightly primitive in style, the plaque,
particularly the latticed columns, is meticulously carved.
</P>
<P>
   It is both breathtaking as a work of art and miraculous as a
delicate object that has survived for 1,100 years. It is the
dictionary definition of authentic: real, authoritative, worthy of
acceptance or belief, trustworthy.

 &HT;    MCCAIN RAISES FUNDS IN INTERNET TIME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is using the power of the Internet
to get a new kind of ``bounce'' from his victory this week in New
Hampshire's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has just changed politics,'' said Max Fose, the
campaign's on-line manager.
</P>
<P>
   Donors had pledged more than $741,000 on McCain's Internet site
by midday Thursday, less than two days after the New Hampshire
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid influx lets the campaign immediately commit new
resources to its battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, rather
than waiting for checks to arrive and clear through traditional
pre-Internet fund-raising methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain campaign officials were able to
immediately cite the contributions as evidence of their candidate's
growing momentum in the Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when presidential campaigns were just beginning
to use the Internet and far fewer voters were on line, a winning
campaign would not have been able to exploit its new contributions
and favorable publicity so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain calls the Internet 'the great equalizer,''' Fose
told FreedomChannel.com, a neutral Web site that covers this year's
political contests. ``With over half a million dollars raised
within 24 hours without doing an event, we've just proved we can be
competitive in South Carolina financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Fose reported that the average online contribution was $105.
Nearly 40 percent of the donors had never given before to a
political campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the McCain campaign also plans to combine the
old and the new by sending e-mail to online supporters asking them
to telephone 10 people on McCain's behalf. This technique worked
well in New Hampshire; the campaign e-mail roster has risen
steadily and now numbers more than 75,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to actively try to expand our e-mail list in South
Carolina,'' Fose said. ``It's the best way to keep people involved
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And next Thursday, the Arizona senator plans to hold an online
fund-raiser that will be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors who donate $100 or more by punching in their credit
card numbers will be able to pose their questions and comments to
McCain via e-mail and get a direct response on their computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put a camera in front of John McCain, and he'll
give a speech (on line) about what's happened and where the
campaign is going,'' Fose said.

 &HT;    CLINTON ASKS FOR $236 MILLION FOR HURRICANE FLOYD RELIEF
 &HT;    Attn: N.C. points.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to include $236 million in
additional Hurricane Floyd relief money in a supplemental budget
request he will send Congress on Monday, Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards discussed the funding with White House officials
Thursday. However, a White House spokesman later cautioned that the
$236 million figure is still preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real progress, but I don't think we are
through,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $128 million, will be used for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's housing buyout program and the Small
Business Administration's loan program for individuals and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining money will be used to help commercial fishermen
replace lost equipment, for economic development needs, repairing
military facilities, rural housing reconstruction, beach
renourishment and repairing damaged park facilities, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Hurricane Floyd and subsequent flooding
destroyed or left uninhabitable 24,000 homes in North Carolina and
damaged another 56,000 homes, according to Gov. Jim Hunt's office.
</P>
<P>
   Congress voted last year to send the state $2.2 billion in
federal relief money. But Edwards and North Carolina's 12 House
members wrote Clinton last month asking him to include more relief
funds in a supplemental budget bill for fiscal 2000, which started
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That funding bill will be sent to Congress on Monday along with
Clinton's fiscal 2001 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   This new money will be available to all victims of Hurricane
Floyd, not just North Carolina residents, Edwards said. However,
the senator predicts the bulk of the money will be used in his
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the Hurricane Floyd-specific money, he will be
asking for significant increases for community development block
grants and (Department of Housing and Urban Development) low-income
housing rental monies,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this clearly shows we're making significant progress
and we are filling in the gaps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One area still needing funds is farm equipment replacement,
Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Senate approved $81 million to help farmers
replace equipment damaged by the hurricane, but the money was taken
out of the final budget approved by Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When winter comes to other cities of the world, like Helsinki or
St. Petersburg, where snows fall almost daily, the hushed
atmosphere of the streets in their winter whiteness is broken only
by the muffled sounds of city life. In the evenings, deep snow
drifts lining frozen sidewalks glow in intermittent pools of
lamplight from above. Magical winters like these form precious
memories for people who treasure bundling up for the adventure in
the otherwise quiet month of February before the awakening of
spring.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no need to pine. Skiers are not the only ones who
can travel to find ideal snow conditions. For people whose favorite
winter sport is not skiing but hiking along woodland paths or
simply walking on streets in a small town after a blizzard, to
recapture the crunch of snow underfoot that so quickly disappears
in the city, the best choice is to journey to a university or
college town in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Accessible by public transportation or car, the campuses there
provide landscapes that have been designed to enhance their rural
settings. In a commencement address on the virtues of living in New
England that Elizabeth Hardwick once delivered at Smith College in
Northampton, Mass., she referred to universities and colleges as
being ``the dominant aesthetic of Massachusetts.'' ``Here,'' she
said, ``there is a real winter, not the most spectacular in
hardship our country has to offer, but real nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering country walks in the snow near cozy
inns, these colleges, by virtue of their theater and music
departments, are also thriving performing arts centers where
visitors, after a good lunch or dinner, may attend a theatrical
production or a variety of concerts by outside ensembles as well as
by faculty soloists and student choruses.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true of the five-college group in the
rolling countryside of Pioneer Valley along the Connecticut River
in western Massachusetts: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount
Holyoke College, Smith College and the University of Massachusetts.
And in contrast to frigid temperatures outside, three of these
institutions also provide the perfumed air of tropical greenhouses
as a place to warm up and enjoy exotic blooms.
</P>
<P>
   A ride to Smith College yielded a winter wonderland on a campus
designed in 1892 by Frederick Law Olmsted. By planning a campus
that was both a botanic garden and arboretum with lofty trees, open
greenswards and curvilinear pathways, Olmsted retained the domestic
scale of a New England town surrounded by pastoral scenery. To this
day, the trees and shrubs on the college grounds are labeled with
their botanical names and native regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the tree branches bare and the ground blanketed with
snow,'' said Ann Leone, a Smith professor who is a member of the
college's Landscape Studies Steering Committee, ``Olmsted's vistas
open up to their true perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The campus curves around Paradise Pond, a serpentine water
feature that was a former mill pond in the Mill River with a
picturesque island at its center. This prospect possesses the
romantic aura of an 18th-century English landscape, especially in
winter with yellowing branches of weeping willows and the bright
red berries of winterberry shrubs silhouetted against snowy banks.
</P>
<P>
   When frozen solid, the pond's surface is cleared for ice
skating, which adds to the charm of this winter scene.
</P>
<P>
   Walking north from the boathouse, along the riverside path where
the river flows into the pond, one enters a woodland not unlike the
one Robert Frost saw ``fill up with snow/ ... Between the woods and
frozen lake'' in his poem ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.''
(Beginning in Amherst, where Frost lived, the public walk linking
conservation areas is called the Robert Frost Trail.)
</P>
<P>
   Deeper into the woods, the fresh snow recently was broken only
by the footsteps of other early walkers, leaving marks Thoreau
referred to in ``Walden'' as ``a meandering dotted line, with wide
intervals between the dots.''
</P>
<P>
   In passing the dark silhouettes of trees, interspersed by the
occasional white birch, one could appreciate anew why Thoreau
wrote, ``I frequently tramped 8 or 10 miles through the deepest
snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or
an old acquaintance among the pines.''
</P>
<P>
   As one trudges along, a camaraderie develops with other walkers
pleased to be out in this frosty world seemingly isolated from the
town. Surprisingly, the walk ends on a residential street, and
there is equal pleasure in seeing the old houses and broad porches
of Northampton's side streets in their winter garb. Many of the
rambling houses on Elm Street, the town's main thoroughfare, still
serve as Smith dormitories or as faculty housing. By doubling back
on the woodland path, the hiker arrives directly in front of Lyman
Conservatory, a complex of 12 joined greenhouses completed by Lord
&AMP; Burnham in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking Paradise Pond, the Victorian Gothic greenhouses,
incorporating a balloon-shaped palm house trimmed in fleur-de-lis
metalwork, offer immediate refuge from the cold amid the moist
scent of tropical and subtropical blooms. Fragrant orange blossoms
in the warm temperate house, an allee of deep pink Camellia
japonica and a swag of magenta bougainvillea across the upper
reaches of the cool temperate house are only a few of the winter
blooms that thrive inside when there is deep snow outside.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman Conservatory's display reaches its winter crescendo in the
annual Spring Bulb Show, which takes place this year from March 4
to 19. This is an event that has to be experienced to be believed.
While learning bulb ecology, Smith's horticulture students begin
the process in fall by planting more than 5,000 bulbs that are
placed in the cellar's cold storage for 10 to 12 weeks before being
brought up to the greenhouses, thereby forcing the plants to bloom
simultaneously for the show. Tulips, narcissus, hyacinths, crocus,
scilla and muscari, all from the Mediterranean region, are
literally crammed into brilliant mixtures on planting benches
surrounded by white picket fences in two show houses, with
forsythia, azalea, redbud, willow and Canary broom as additional
decor.
</P>
<P>
   To open the door to the bulb show during the weeks often of the
worst snowstorms is to be overwhelmed by the fragrance and the
possibilities of cyclical seasons. Last year more than 13,000
people attended. As an additional treat, when the greenhouses are
illuminated for the evening openings, from a distance Lyman
Conservatory looks like a crystalline brooch in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   For a pause in activities and to satisfy a hearty appetite,
Northampton abounds with good restaurants both near the campus and
in the downtown business district with its historic 19th-century
commercial and civic structures. Afterward one can select any
number of concerts or theatrical performances in the area and take
advantage of the free bus service that links the five college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Smith, with a music department of 40
faculty members, half of whom are well-known performers and the
other half theorists or composers, sponsors 75 concerts a year,
most of them held in Sweeney Concert Hall in Sage Hall, a domed
building designed by Delano &AMP; Aldrich in 1924 as an adaptation of
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   When college is in session, the frequent noon-hour concerts
offer the opportunity to hear a specialized program. At one
outstanding concert, the soprano Jane Bryden, accompanied by John
Van Buskirk at the fortepiano, sang an entire program devoted to
Robert Schumann, including his song cycle ``Liederkreis'' (Op. 24).
A version of this program has just been released on a CD.

   Last weekend provided a rich assortment of local musicians. On
Saturday at Sweeney Concert Hall, the visiting Kinor String Quartet
played Schumann's Piano Quintet with a Smith professor, Monica
Jakuc, as pianist, and the Third String Quartet by Donald Wheelock,
another Smith professor. On Sunday afternoon the Arcadia Players,
an independent group specializing in music in the European
tradition of the 17th and 18th centuries, performed an all-Bach
program downtown at the Northampton Center for the Arts that
featured Bryden as well as the flutist Chris Krueger, who teaches
at the University of Massachusetts, and the harpsichordist William
Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Strindberg's ``Julie'' will open at Amherst College's Kirby
Theater on Feb. 24, directed by Peter Lobdell, head of the theater
department. Designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White in 1938, Kirby is one
of those special theaters that retain an intimacy with the
audience. Memorable past productions have included Sophocles'
``Oedipus Rex'' and Marlowe's ``Doctor Faustus.''
</P>
<P>
   As audiences leave the various theaters and concert halls on a
cold still night, the stars above are spectacularly bright. Edith
Wharton captured this winter phenomenon when she wrote about a
Massachusetts village in ``Ethan Frome'': ``In a sky of iron the
points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his cold
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   For those inspired to take a closer look, the Amherst Astronomy
Association invites visitors to view the winter sky through a
telescope at Wilder Observatory on the Amherst campus at 9 on
Saturday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Though winter has the feeling of permanence, it is as ephemeral
as other seasons, as witnessed by the jasmine now in flower behind
Lyman Conservatory or the Chinese witch hazel blossoming on the
Smith library lawn.
</P>
<P>
   But no moment is as poignant as the day one sets out on the Mill
River walk during an early spring thaw to discover a new blanket of
whiteness in the thousands of snowdrops in bloom.

   DELTA-SURVEY _ Delta Air Lines slipped from third to fourth
place in 1999 on-time rankings for major carriers but moved up to
second place in baggage handling. Delta maintained a third-place
standing for its rate of consumer complaints to the U.S. Department
of Transportation, which compiles the rankings. Customer complaints
about all airlines more than doubled in 1999 from 1998, probably in
part because internet filing was available. (Thurston, Atlanta

of Southwest Recreational Industries in Leander. ``They've had

`MISSING PIECES': ALL ACTION, NO CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's worse than having one of those hostile family
Christmases, ornamented with guilt, sibling rivalry and
intergenerational tension _ the kind during which one person blows
up and leaves the room in a huff, upsetting the children? Answer:
Getting a telephone call shortly afterward announcing that that
person has committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   James Coburn, as Atticus Cody, has that problem in the CBS movie
``Missing Pieces.'' The volatile family member is Atticus' son
Scott (Paul Kersey), a black sheep who is artistic and lives in
Mexico. His situation is summed up by wildly inventive dialogue
like, ``He's wasting his life down there, you know'' (Atticus to
his other son, a senator) and, ``I'm a painter, not a ranch hand''
(Scott to Atticus). Scott would probably have been a rebel anyway,
but things are made worse by the fact that 12 years ago he and his
mother were in a horrible car accident in which she died. He was
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the two-hour film consists of Atticus' stay in Mexico,
where he goes to claim his son's body and investigate the
circumstances of his death. There is definitely a twisted tale to
unravel _ involving a hit-and-run accident, suspicious photographs,
three leftover rifle shells, at least one prowler, a remarkably
observant answering machine and a one-way ticket to Frankfurt,
Germany _ but the plot is all action and no character. When the
film tries to get deep about the father-son relationship, it shows
Scott's gorgeous seaside house filled with huge paintings of
Atticus looking noble.
</P>
<P>
   And the action doesn't always add up. ``I just don't understand
what happened,'' Atticus tells his daughter-in-law when he calls
her from Mexico, referring to his son's suicide. ``It doesn't make
any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it does. Scott had just returned from a miserable holiday
visit home, where he felt like a failure. He was tortured with
guilt about his mother's death. His girlfriend had just announced
that she was marrying somebody else. And he was drunk. People have
killed themselves over a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer also has to ask if the screenwriters _ any of the
screenwriters (Peachy Markowitz, Philip Rosenberg, Richard Kletter
and D.W. Owen) _ have ever been to Mexico. Atticus arrives by
rickety bus, the kind jam-packed with colorful locals and live
chickens. But flashbacks show Scott spending his time at what looks
like at least a four-star beach resort (actually somewhere in Santa
Barbara, Calif.), so surely there was a hotel shuttle or at least a
few taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, who won last year's Oscar for best supporting actor in
the devastating father-son drama ``Affliction,'' is always
interesting to watch, but he's stuck with a stunningly trite script
here. (Looking at old photographs, he's moved to say, ``Oh,
Scott.'' Trying to prove to Scott that he accepts him, he
proclaims, ``You paint the truth.'') Kersey seems well cast as the
good-looking bad boy who just wants Dad's love, but he also has
dialogue of unlikely honesty; for instance, ``I don't want you to
be ashamed of me anymore.'' Lisa Zane, as Scott's former
girlfriend, Renata, is cavalier, immediately unlikable
(deliberately, as the film eventually reveals) and competitively
trite. (Scott's way of looking at the world was like a
kaleidoscope, she says.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the first shot confuse you. Although Coburn is on a
horse, wearing a cowboy hat, surrounded by majestic mountains,
``Missing Pieces'' is in no way a western.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS: That first year at college is hard, especially
if you keep encountering the girl who died in your dorm room,
looking all drowned and everything. That's the problem Marian
(Julianne Nicholson) faces in the premiere episode of ``The
Others'' (10 p.m. ET Saturdays on NBC), a faintly creepy new
series, aspiring to be a blend of ``The X-Files'' and ``The
Twilight Zone.'' Soon Marian is part of a group of
soap-opera-beautiful young psychics who meet regularly and join
forces to help mere mortals with supernatural problems.
</P>
<P>
   The drowned college student, whose look appears to be inspired
by the drowned hotel guest in ``The Shining,'' turns out to be a
disappointment. A subplot about a recent widow with money problems
is sweet but tired. Next week's episode is better, with a young
woman whose husband goes out jogging with the baby one morning and
never comes back, except as a ghost _ or at least what appears to
be a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But the young psychics aren't nearly as fascinating as they
think they are, and their elderly leader (Bill Cobbs) is a little
too self-consciously wise and weary. We do learn one thing about
the afterlife from these two episodes: The dead enjoy communicating
through numbers. Luckily, one of the group, Warren (Kevin J.
O'Connor), specializes in that and at one point is seen running
through the street, repeatedly shouting, ``6, 28, 31!'' Hike.

A DRAG QUEEN AND A MOBSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now and then, a movie like ``Mob Queen'' surfaces on video: a
good piece of work turned out by young filmmakers on a shoestring
that finally finds a distributor with an eye for something a little
bizarre and highly viewable.
</P>
<P>
   And in this case, the film, to be released on tape Feb. 15 by
First Run Features, happened to pick up some helpful connections
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   How often does a little movie share cast members and other
parallels with a television show like the ``The Sopranos?'' The
story begins in 1995, when Jon Carnoy, a former film student at New
York University, and his boyhood friend Mike Horelick, a film
graduate of the University of Southern California, began playing
with an idea. ``A drag queen with the mob,'' Horelick said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoy wanted to make a drama. ``I said people will be laughing
at us unless we pull it off perfectly,'' Horelick recalled. So they
decided to defuse that danger and do a comedy. Carnoy, now 33,
directed and produced the film, raising the beginnings of the
$200,000 budget from family and friends, and gradually obtained the
rest from other backers as the project moved along. Horelick, 34,
wrote the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is the Brooklyn waterfront in 1957. The hood George
Gianfranco is more than worried about telling his boss, Joey Aorta,
the shocking truth he has just discovered concerning Glorice, the
prostitute George has presented to Aorta as a birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   As George puts it to Dip, the mob's idiot: ``What do I say:
`Aorta, we cannot tell a lie. We accidentally set you up with a man
dressed in women's clothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aorta, who has just beaten up an underling whose sexuality he
suspects because the man ordered a tropical-style drink with an
umbrella in it, is played by Tony Sirico. On ``The Sopranos''
Sirico is the mobster Paulie Walnuts. Gianfranco is portrayed by
David Proval, who began his career in ``Mean Streets'' in 1973 and
made a high-profile entrance in ``The Sopranos'' last Sunday as an
explosive gangster fresh from a 10-year prison stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Mob Queen'' is devoted to keeping Aorta in the
dark about Glorice, played by the drag performer Candis Cayne. That
involves a botched hit and an aborted wedding while neatly avoiding
silliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult knowing how far to go with the humor,''
Horelick said. ``We kept it at a quiet level, not in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by the film's low budget and unknown director, the
casting took a year. ``Jon found Candis in a drag show at the
Barracuda Lounge in New York, doing a `Charlie's Angels'
knockoff,'' Horelick said. Carnoy was looking for celebrities for
bit parts and signed on Gerry Cooney, the former heavyweight
fighter, who plays a baker.
</P>
<P>
   Landing the mob characters was the toughest part. Sirico was in
New York. ``Most mob actors are from New York but live in L.A.,''
Horelock said. There Carnoy found Proval. ``I was attracted to this
'90s dilemma set in the '50s,'' Proval said. ``Plus it was that
particular world. I'm from Brooklyn, East New York. Those guys I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Marius and Jeannette
</P>
<P>
   As surely as romance develops between Jeannette (Ariane
Ascaride), a supermarket cashier and single mother of two, and
Marius (Gerard Meylan), a security guard, Robert Guediguian's film
becomes a love affair with the working class of Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost her job, the resilient Jeannette makes the best of
it amid neighbors who get through hard times by sharing warm
friendships and populist political ideas. One of her sons, by
different men, is Catholic, while the other is Muslim, adding
religious considerations to a warm, rich film with ``a strong,
hearty, down-to-earth spirit throughout,'' Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   1998. New Yorker. $89.98. 102 minutes. French with English
subtitles. No rating.

   The Astronaut's Wife
</P>
<P>
   ``They gon' be pilots, honey,'' drawls the astronaut Spencer
Armacost (Johnny Depp) to his wife, Jillian (Charlize Theron), who
is pregnant with twins. Back from a space mission gone wrong,
Spencer isn't his old self, and when Jillian starts wearing a
hairdo straight out of ``Rosemary's Baby,'' it's better than even
money that if the babies do become pilots, they'll be flying for an
alien air force. With Depp carrying on suavely, Rand Ravich's film
is not that bad, but it is ``ridiculously derivative'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1999. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 100 minutes. R. Release
date: Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Streak
</P>
<P>
   About to be nabbed by the law, Miles Logan (Martin Lawrence)
races into a building under construction and tapes the $18 million
diamond he has just stolen to the wall of an air-conditioning vent.
After his prison term, he returns for the rock, only to find the
building is now police headquarters, and, to have any chance of
crawling into the ventilating system and retrieving the prize, he
must impersonate a police officer. Using all his criminal savvy,
Logan is soon running the station house, but ``among movies of its
type, `Blue Steak' may be classified among the zircons'' (Lawrence
Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $108.97; DVD, $24.95. 93 minutes.
PG-13. Release date: Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Swindle
</P>
<P>
   A couple of con artists work so smoothly in Claude Chabrol's
film that one is never sure of their identity and connection. Betty
(Isabelle Huppert) dons wigs and seductive outfits to set up
well-to-do business and professional people for the blandishments
of her partner, Victor (Michel Serrault), who plays an officer and
gentleman with panache. But then at a Swiss resort Betty latches on
to a handsome businessman (Francois Cluzet), who is either a
perfect target or an uninvited third partner in crime. ``Chabrol
keeps curiosity piqued, the actors delightful and the outcome in
sufficient question'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1997. New Yorker. $94.98. 105 minutes. French with English
subtitles. Release date: Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE. When Dandridge (Halle Berry),
star of Otto Preminger's ``Carmen Jones,'' arrives at the 1955
Academy Awards ceremony, she is called ``the first-ever colored
nominee for best actress.'' (Her competition included Audrey
Hepburn and Grace Kelly, who won for ``The Country Girl.'') Caught
in many of the tired conventions of television docudrama, Martha
Coolidge's film for HBO, adapted from Earl Mills' book, only partly
explains the enigmatic singer and actress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its flat-footed narrative, the production ``is worth
watching for its affecting performances and for the sheer drama of
Dandridge's life,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York Times in
1999. HBO. $76.12; DVD, $24.98. 115 minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   NOSFERATU and THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. Unlike Ernst
Lubitsch, Fritz Lang and other directors of the day who erected
landscapes in the studio, F.W. Murnau shot ``Nosferatu'' (1922, 84
minutes), his unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's ``Dracula,''
in the Carpathian Mountains. Robert Wiene's ``Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari'' (1919, 72 minutes) stars Werner Kraus as a hypnotist who
turns a death-dealing ogre (Conrad Veidt) loose on unsuspecting
country folk. Both films are digitally remastered. Kino. $24.95
each.
</P>
<P>
   BESHKEMPIR: THE ADOPTED SON. In the first independent feature
film made in Kyrgyzstan, a young boy grows to adolescence only to
be undone by the news that he is not his parents' biological child.
Winstar. $89.98. 81 minutes. Kyrgyz with English subtitles. &QL;

 &HT;    Eds: RUNS WITH DOT-COM-COX
 &HT;    Marketer goes hi-tech
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five years ago, David Miranda, then a marketer with
Holiday Inns Worldwide, didn't know a dot.com from a dot.con. A
Pentium chip sounded to him like a snack food.
</P>
<P>
   He actually thought he was being conned when he first had a
brush with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out in what I now know as Silicon Valley for a meeting,
and while I was waiting, they gave me a tour, and I go into this
very small office, eight or 10 people in an office that should have
held two,'' said the boyish-looking 51-year-old. ``Everybody looked
like they hadn't bathed in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked what they were doing. ``They said, 'We're on the
Internet.' That was the first time I heard it.'' As a guy who'd
been in the business of scrambling to unload hotel rooms that
hadn't been rented for the night, his ears perked up when they said
they were communicating long-distance by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'My God, if you're talking to places all over the
world, you must have a hell of a long-distance bill.' They looked
at me like I was a dinosaur. I said, 'What's the Internet?' They
told me, and I thought it must be illegal, that they were tapping
into something they shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   The techies gave him a crash course, and a light bulb flashed in
his head: There must be a way to book empty hotel rooms this way.
And airline seats. And cruise tickets. And ``just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon began discussions with colleagues in the travel
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said the same thing. 'David, somebody's got to be
doing this.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He found out that many were, but none like he thought it could
be. So he set out to find a way to sell ``perishable'' airline
seats, hotel rooms and other travel-related offers. And the more he
talked, the more people listened. And offered to invest.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with a company he called LastMinuteTravel. It was a
natural, and he figured somebody must have claimed the Web address.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't, so he did, for a $75 fee.
</P>
<P>
   He continued raising money by offering a piece of the business
to investors called ``angels'' by entrepreneurs. Angels generally
gamble on many long-shot possibilities, knowing most will fail. But
if they get in on the ground floor of one that works, they stand
</P>
<P>
   to reap huge profits that far offset their losses from ventures
that fail.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Miranda was approaching investors, he went
after travel providers, like hotel chains and airlines, telling
them they could reduce their costs if they'd let him act as a
matchmaker. He had created a Web site, he told them, that would
list ``perishable''
</P>
<P>
   airline seats and rooms and rental cars. He wouldn't charge
consumers, but the travel providers would have to pay a fee to be
listed.
</P>
<P>
   After raising enough capital, he set out to recruit his
marketers and geeks. They rented a small office, and just recently
moved to swanky digs in the Pinnacle Building in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Total payroll runs $250,000-$300,000 a month, which at this
point comes mostly from the bankroll of angels. Every employee has
a stake in ownership, and if the company turns into a hot stock
issue, each could become an instant millionaire. As befits a
</P>
<P>
   dot.com startup, job titles are nontraditional. Ronald Mulliken
is an eVP. Richard Chen is an eWizard. Ted Perlstein is head
sherpa. Tara Kennelly is manager of the eOffice. Heidi Fraser is
director of eVents.
</P>
<P>
   There are more weird titles, but you don't need to look at a
company flow chart to know this is not your ordinary office. You
get that impression when you enter the front door, where a huge
silver globe weighing 300 pounds rotates on an axis, displaying the
</P>
<P>
   company's name as it turns.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda didn't know a bit from a byte only five years ago. Now,
in kicking off a massive marketing campaign with a Super Bowl ad,
he's ready to take a bite out of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a better way for people to travel at the
last minute,'' Miranda said. ``We're providing it. We've got a
three-lap lead in a four-lap race. We're going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiles. As if he knows something you don't.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you build it, they will dot.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dream of LastMinuteTravel.com of Atlanta and a bevy
of other newly hatched dot.com companies. And just to make sure the
customers do come, a slew of Internet startups took big gambles on
super-pricey Super Bowl ads.
</P>
<P>
   As with the teams on the field, it was a make-or-break move for
some of the small companies. They realized that unless millions of
viewers remembered their names and Web addresses, their business
plans could die as like the Nashville Titans' hopes did at game's
end.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com, a book-your-own-travel Web site that was
launched in January, spent about $3 million of the $9 million it's
raised from startup investors on a single 30-second ad in the
fourth quarter. It showed two cowboys waiting until the last minute
_ get it? _ to flee a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it as a gamble,'' said David Miranda, 51, founder
and
</P>
<P>
   chairman of the company. ``We're not reckless. I would never bet
the company's life on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the ad ran, (the first to air after the game
ended), Miranda claimed his site was getting 5,000 hits a minute
and that the ad had been wildly successful.
</P>
<P>
   But though he didn't see his $3 million ad as a gamble, many
outside observers did. Nine of every 10 new Internet companies will
fail this year, predicted John Antil, a marketing professor at the
University of Delaware and one of the top sports-ad experts in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you look at it, it's a crap shoot,'' Antil said.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands why a company like Miranda's would take the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a small, unknown company that wants to reach a very large
audience fast to gain brand awareness, which is essential for
growth, it's a crap shoot worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl may be the only true national mass-media event
around, drawing up to 150 million Americans, Antil said, plus
millions more worldwide. And Antil's research shows that many
people tune in to the games _ which tended to be boring until this
year _ not to watch football, but to get a few chuckles from the
innovative commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only broadcast of the year where people are looking
forward to ads,'' Antil said. ``They've developed a reputation.
It's a showcase, and it can pay off big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two dot.coms _ HotJobs.com and Monster.com _ bet the
bank on advertisements, and their gambles paid off.
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs.com, the smallest company in history to buy Super Bowl
airtime, spent $2 million for airtime and production costs. That
from a company with only $4 million in1998 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   People noticed, big time. HotJobs.com's Web site was inundated
with so many hits its computers couldn't handle the load. But it
had gained lasting brand recognition. Revenues shot up, and in
August it sold 3 million shares of its stock to the public for $8
per share. Now it's selling around $35 a share, and many of those
who were in on the ground floor are millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The story was similar for Monster.com. Traffic on the job-search
Web site skyrocketed 450 percent the first month after the game.
</P>
<P>
   So what did HotJobs.com and Monster.com doing with their
new-found wealth?
</P>
<P>
   Bought more Super Bowl ads.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com reckons it spent $5.5 million this year for five
30-second spots and production costs. Hotjobs.com figures its tab
ran $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a third of the 60-odd Super Bowl XXXIV ads were bought
by Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like AutoTrader.com, which is owned in part by Cox
Enterprises (owner of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other
businesses), have pockets as deep as the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Comparatively speaking, many others have pockets as deep as a
mud puddle. This year's newcomers included Kforce.com, a job-hunt
site, and OurBeginning.com, which sells party supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much expect a 'Darwinian shakeout,' `` said Luke
Sullivan, creative head of the Atlanta ad firm WestWayne.
``Dot.coms that claim a significant share of mind and market now
are going to have the upper hand in all the struggles to come.''
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com could be one of them, Antil speculates.
``They've got one advantage over others,'' he said. ``Their name
makes sense, and it's easy to remember. Most dot.com names
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the exposure they provide, one problem with Super Bowl
spots is that, in order to ``break through the clutter,'' many
devote most of their air time to humor, which leaves little time to
explain what the companies actually do. Anheuser-Busch doesn't need
</P>
<P>
   to explain that it sells beer, but the dot.coms are another
story. But can you remember from the ads what Oxygen.com
</P>
<P>
   does? Or computer.com? Or LastMinuteTravel.com, whose name
appeared for a second or two at the end of its ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can watch most Super Bowl ads and have no idea what the
point is or who's doing the advertising,'' Antil said. ``That's
where they go wrong. You can't be effective with humor alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most dot.com advertising has most consumers wondering, 'What
the hell are they selling?' `` agreed Marian Salzman of Young &AMP;
Rubicam in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes attempts at humor can actually hurt a company. No one
in the ad business can forget an ad that shoe store Just for Feet
ran during last year's Super Bowl. It showed a black runner
sprinting through the African bush, chased by white men in a
military truck. After they snared him, they give him a drink laced
with drugs and put a pair of athletic shoes on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever comedy the agency intended couldn't be discerned by
critics, who quickly dubbed Just for Feet ``Just for Racists.'' Now
Just for Feet has run to court _ both to sue its ad agency and to
file for bankruptcy. It announced just before this year's Super
Bowl it was going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the message gets through, mass exposure alone isn't
always a recipe for success. Tiny Gardenburger, a meatless-patty
maker, plunked down $1.5 million for an ad during the final episode
of ``Seinfeld'' in 1998. At first, sales went up, but they soon
</P>
<P>
   flagged.
</P>
<P>
   This year some companies paid as little as $1.9 million for a
30-second Super Bowl spot, while late-buyers anted up as much as $3
million. The average was $2.2 million, a big jump from the $1.6
million Fox charged last year.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com's Miranda, a veteran marketer who spent
most of his career with Holiday Inns Worldwide, is nail-bitingly
aware of the TV costs, as well as the $500,000 it took to produce
his company's humorous spot. But Miranda, a Vietnam veteran used to
taking risks, is convinced it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is to create something that can extend beyond
the commercial itself,'' saud Atlanta ad whiz Joel Babbit, owner of
the agency 360. ``By that I mean PR and word of mouth. You need
something people will talk about and read about the next day at the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda and his marketing VP, Jack Arogeti, aren't arguing with
that. But they plan to keep on advertising as long as there's money
in the till.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep it up,'' Arogeti said. ``There'll be more
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to spend another $20 million this year on
additional advertising, which means it's got to keep raising money.
Its posters and billboards, featuring pictures of its own
employees, already are plastered across MARTA stations and buses in
Atlanta and a few other cities.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com also is betting on its niche in the dot.com
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com differs from other book-your-travel sites
in that it specializes in seats available _ sometimes at a discount
_ in the days or hours before departure. Miranda calls it a ``stock
exchange'' that ``brings together motivated buyers and sellers.''
Travelers can use the site to find the best deals on last-minute
offerings of airline seats, hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises, even
tee times.
</P>
<P>
   The site has signed up more than 100 airlines, hotel chains,
rental-car companies and convention bureaus that pay to use
LastMinuteTravel.com. In most cases, they're charged a monthly fee
for the right to unload ``perishable'' commodities, such as unsold
</P>
<P>
   airline seats.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel doesn't promise bargain prices, but Miranda
said they're possible if providers are eager enough to fill hotel
rooms or airline seats that pay nothing if left empty.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda raised his $9 million stake from private investors,
including Ted Turner, Billy Payne and Sergio Zyman, a former
marketing chief for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Bowl Sunday is the day the advertising business faces
itself,'' Young &AMP; Rubicam's Salzman said. ``If we're about
inventing desire, then it's the most significant prom, and the king
and queen had better exude sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Reiman, Babbit's former partner who now owns the
Brighthouse ad agency in Atlanta, wasn't impressed with
LastMinuteTravel.com's sexiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LastMinuteTravel.com commercial feels like it was created
at the last minute,'' he said. ``The advertiser would have been
better off to offer last minute travel out of Atlanta after the
Super Bowl. That would have demonstrated the speed and the need of
this great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's ads, he said, must be ``deliberate and incredibly
focused. You have to break through the clutter and not be part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons were learned this year, said Fred Allvine, who teaches
E-commerce and marketing at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he's looking for a major shakeout in dot.coms
this year, he predicts more start-up companies will be staking it
all on Super Bowl ads next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their time has come,'' he said. ``Or at least they think it
has.''

   Auctioneers Trading Up
</P>
<P>
   With Sotheby's and Christie's preoccupied with the Justice
Department's criminal antitrust investigation, Phillips, the
world's third largest auction house, is busy trying to make itself
more visible. With deep pockets provided by Bernard Arnault, the
French investor who bought the company in November, it is scouring
Manhattan for bigger, splashier premises.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips owns a building on 79th Street between First and York
Avenues, but it is a small space, with only one combined gallery
and salesroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding an ideal auction site in New York is a nightmare,''
said Dan Klein, Phillips' international executive director. ``It
took Christie's years to find Rockefeller Center.''
</P>
<P>
   While it looks, Phillips will take over the exhibition space at
the American Craft Museum at 40 W. 53rd St. in Manhattan from May
11 to 18 to show and sell 19th- and 20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Klein declined to say how much Phillips was paying the museum
but said he considered the fee ``a fair commercial rent.'' People
close to the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that the auction house had agreed to pay the museum $100,000,
which includes the cost of printing a catalog for one of the
museum's exhibitions, ``Defining Craft I.'' Phillips is a sponsor
of the craft exhibition, which opens next week and runs through May
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a corporate rental program like any other,'' said
Holly Hochner, the American Craft Museum's director. ``But this is
the first time we've done something of this nature.'' Hochner said
that the timing was serendipitous.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has supported 20th-century decorative arts, she said,
and when it approached the museum about renting space, she realized
the auction dates fell between two shows. ``It seemed like a great
marriage of opportunity,'' Hochner said. ``Our whole museum will be
empty, so there won't be any confusion of identify. Even the shop
will be shut.''
</P>
<P>
   For Phillips, the chance to exhibit and sell its goods in a spot
diagonally across the street from the Museum of Modern Art and four
blocks from Christie's was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we needed to break the mold and to build a more
credible, glamorous image,'' Klein said. ``Being in the heart of
the art district is a way of being taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the Phillips sale include paintings by Monet,
Chagall, Matisse and Braque and sculptures by Henry Moore and de
Chirico. Phillips will also be showing 10 years of French
photography. Viewing is from May 11 to 16, with the sales on May 17
and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a hurry to make a move,'' Klein said. About
competing with Sotheby's and Christie's he added, ``Maybe we can
drive a wedge between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning House
</P>
<P>
   In the printmaking world, the name Kenneth Tyler is instantly
recognized. Tyler, a pioneer in developing printmaking techniques
and persuading major artists to devote much of their time to
pushing the limits of the art, began to print for Josef Albers in
1963 and founded Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles two years later. By
1973 he had moved to Bedford, N.Y., and begun Tyler Graphics Ltd.
in a carriage house. In 1987 he moved the business to Mount Kisco,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Tyler announced that he was retiring and that he
would sell a selection from his personal collection and inventory
from Tyler Graphics at Sotheby's in New York on May 6. It will be
the most comprehensive sale of postwar prints.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler has worked with artists including Frank Stella, Robert
Motherwell, Roy Lichtenstein and Helen Frankenthaler. Their works
are to be in Sotheby's sale. ``These works go way beyond simple
prints,'' said Christopher Galliard, head of Sotheby's contemporary
print department in New York. ``What makes them so special are the
unusually large presses used to make large-scale prints and the
complex, rich surfaces. It could often take over a year to produce
a print.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Sotheby's star offerings are Frankenthaler's ``Free Fall''
(1993), a woodcut on hand-dyed, handmade paper, estimated to sell
for $20,000 to $25,000; Lichtenstein's ``Reflections on a Girl''
(1990), a lithograph with screen print and relief print, is
estimated at $100,000 to $125,000, and Stella's ``Fountain''
(1993), a woodcut, etching and aquatint relief printed in colors on
three sheets of handmade, hand-colored paper, is estimated at
$100,000 to $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring
</P>
<P>
   Christie's is preoccupied with examining its bottom line and
ways it can capitalize on its valuable real estate holdings. The
latest news: an internal staff announcement on Monday that Spink, a
London-based subsidiary of the auction house, is closing its
department of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South East Asian,
Himalayan and Tibetan art as of Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see a profitable future in this area,' said Edward
Dolman, chief executive of Christie's. ``We've been looking at
Spink for some time, and only last week did we make the decision
final. This is part of an ongoing review to make sure we're trading
as profitably as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Spink's coins and medal department is to move to Southampton
Row, near the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1666, Spink has built its reputation by specializing
in Asian art along with British paintings, coins and medals. When
Christie's bought it six years ago, its location next to the
headquarters of Christie's London, on King Street, St. James', gave
it as much as its art trade did.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Spink gave Christie's control of the block bordered by
King, Duke, Ryder and Bury Streets. For months, Christie's has
considered developing the block with an eye toward transforming the
Spink building into a retail and office complex and building a
hotel with an entrance on Ryder Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a property play,'' Dolman said. ``It is a result
of restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's plans to keep Spink's Islamic and Indian art
departments, but they will not be based in the Spink building. All
Dolman would say about their new home is that it would be
``somewhere in St. James'.'' &QL;

`DIRTY BLONDE' HUNTING A HOME  
 AN ACTRESS RETURNS 
A SECRET TREATMENT  
 NINE LIVES FOR GRAY  
 MUSICAL CHAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's got good ink, hot sales and celebrities flocking
in. It's got the money, the talent and the time to perform right
into the summer. So where is Claudia Shear's ``Dirty Blonde'' going
to go _ and when?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question bouncing around Broadway, but so far there
are many possibilities and no clear answer. The show, about Mae
West and a pair of fans obsessed with her, is playing at New York
Theater Workshop in the East Village, where it is scheduled to
close on Feb. 13. But it is an open secret that the workshop and
the Shubert Organization, which helped develop the play, are
looking for another home. An extension at the workshop is not
possible because another production is scheduled to open in March.
</P>
<P>
   So three options are being weighed. The first and most
intriguing possibility is the Criterion Center in Times Square, the
former home of the Roundabout Theater Company, which left in June
after longstanding conflicts with the building's owner, Charles B.
Moss Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Criterion has been dark ever since, and one of its two
theaters is not suitable for performance. But the remaining
theater, the 499-seat Stage Right, is functional. Producers have
been discussing reopening Stage Right for ``Dirty Blonde,'' though
that decision would require restaffing the theater, not to mention
plenty of dusting.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the Criterion would also raise some interesting awards
issues. When it was being run by Roundabout, Stage Right was a
Tony-eligible theater, but it is not clear whether that status
would still hold for another production. Keith Sherman, a spokesman
for the Tony awards, said the issue would have to be sorted out by
the group's administration committee, which has put it on the
agenda for a meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   (In separate Tony news, Sherman confirmed Thursday that Rosie
O'Donnell would return as this year's host, a move that organizers
hope will reinvigorate the telecast's sagging ratings. The awards
are to be presented on June 4 at Radio City Music Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Criterion doesn't work out for ``Dirty Blonde,'' the play
may try an off-Broadway theater, though few are available, or even
a small Broadway house, like the Helen Hayes or the Golden. In
either case, ``Dirty Blonde'' would need another show to expire,
which producers are loathe to talk about for fear of inviting bad
karma on themselves. Indeed, producers would not comment on any
plans for the show except to say that several alternatives are
being weighed.
</P>
<P>
   All the maneuvering, of course, is in support of a show that is
packing the house downtown, drawing the likes of Glenn Close, Tim
Robbins and Faye Dunaway. David Bowie and his wife, the model Iman,
are on Saturday night's waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Paul Newman,'' said Kevin Chamberlin, who plays a
shy fan, Charlie, in the show, ``I said, `It's an honor, Mr.
Newman. And he said, `Call me Paul.'''
</P>
<P>
   An Actress Returns
</P>
<P>
   It's an all-too-familiar story. An actress cuts her teeth in New
York theaters, makes a name for herself, then takes off for
Hollywood and is never seen in these parts again.
</P>
<P>
   But now one's coming back. Beginning in June, Christine
Baranski, who found mainstream fame a few years back in the CBS
sitcom ``Cybill,'' will be back on stage, appearing with Nathan
Lane in a revival of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' at the Selwyn
Theater, the new home of the Roundabout. Baranski will be working
once again with the director Jerry Zaks, with whom she teamed up in
``The House of Blue Leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Baranski, who helped make her name with turns in ``Hurlyburly''
and ``Rumors,'' hasn't been completely AWOL; she appeared briefly
in a 1997 concert version of ``Promises, Promises,'' at City
Center.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she says, she'll stick around a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   A Secret Treatment
</P>
<P>
   Beth Henley, whose voice still glimmers with a Southern lilt, is
headed north again. Her newest play, ``Family Week,'' is set to
open in the second week of April at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts on East 15th Street in Manhattan. Ulu Grosbard will
direct.
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Henley said the five-character play concerns a
weeklong visit to a treatment center by a family visiting a
middle-aged woman. Treatment for what? Henley won't divulge that
secret, but will say it's ``not what you would think.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It's terrible and hysterical and everybody has a
different take on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine Lives for Gray
</P>
<P>
   The sun just won't set on Spalding Gray's ``Morning, Noon and
Night.'' After a run last fall downtown at P.S. 122 and a current
run uptown at Lincoln Center, Gray's droll new monologue will head
to the Union Square Theater, where it will reside on Sunday and
Monday nights. (``Wit'' is there the rest of the week.)
``Morning,'' about Gray's adventures as a parent, will begin
performances at the Union Square on Feb. 20. David Binder is
producing.
</P>
<P>
   Musical Chairs
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those who keep score at home: ``Waiting in the
Wings'' will transfer from The Walter Kerr to the Eugene O'Neill on
Feb. 17 to make way for the revival of O'Neill's ``Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' opening at the Kerr on March 19. ``James Joyce's
`The Dead,''' meanwhile, has announced an indefinite extension at
the Belasco Theater, where it has had surprisingly brisk sales. No
replacement yet for Blair Brown, who is going into rehearsals for
``Copenhagen,'' but Christopher Walken is staying put and
apparently loving the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing the Belasco, ``The Real Thing'' will play the
Barrymore. And finally, because of knotty scheduling problems and a
scarcity of theaters, it looks increasingly unlikely that ``Boston
Marriage,'' a new play by David Mamet, will reach New York this
spring. Look for it in the fall.

<P>
   In its corn-tassel golden heyday, the American musical presented
its own happy vision of a democratic society. True, its plots were
usually about the willfully individual: lovers who wanted only to
be alone together, comic wild cards and trouble-making malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   But you could also count on moments in which the whole cast
would sing together, with melding voices and synchronized smiles
and movements, from the title song of ``Oklahoma!'' to the
top-hat-and-tails finale of ``A Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``James Joyce's `The Dead''' opened at Playwrights Horizons
last fall, it provided a gentle but firm refutation of this
tradition of optimistic harmony. Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey's
adaptation of the classic short story portrayed a Christmas party
during which people sang, yes, and sometimes sang together.
</P>
<P>
   But what you were most conscious of was how all the characters
seemed to have other things on their minds. There was scarcely a
musical number during which someone didn't wander out of the room,
or quietly dissolve into tears or laughter, or exchange nervous
glances with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of a current of life flowing subversively
around and even over the songs that these turn-of-the-century
Dubliners were performing to entertain one another. And in the
intimacy of the Playwrights Horizons theater, you did indeed feel
like the proverbial fly on the wall, afforded access to painfully
private moments in the midst of conviviality. It did not seem the
most likely candidate for a transfer to Broadway, home of the
assembly-line chorus and extroverted show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now ``The Dead'' is indeed on Broadway and, what's more, is
holding its own completely there. Under Nelson's direction, the
production has achieved the deliciously improbable: it scales up
understatement without shedding subtlety. And its new home, the
Belasco Theater, built in 1907, has a frayed gaslight-era elegance
that wraps the show into a natural embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than at Playwrights, you're aware of how many
different individual stories are taking place simultaneously. It is
no discredit to the performers to say that if one of them is
singing a solo, you are just as likely to be focused on the faces
of those watching (or perhaps not watching) them. And what eloquent
faces they all are, even in repose.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptation by Nelson (book) and Davey (music) has been
tweaked here and there since the fall, in ways that are only for
the better. There is still that midway moment, with a song called
``Wake the Dead,'' pitched directly at the audience, when the show
seems to violate the self-contained spirit that made it so original
in its first hour, a spirit it never quite recaptures.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be argued that a few of the performances,
particularly those of the generally superb Stephen Spinella and
Alice Ripley, have unnecessarily broadened at moments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the evening's leads, Christopher Walken and
Blair Brown, have merged even more deeply with their characters, a
husband and wife who know each other less completely than they
thought. The quiet eccentricity and inwardness of Walken's Gabriel
have been made more legible without seeming less idiosyncratic, and
the sensuality of Brown's Gretta is, more than ever, the evening's
warming hearth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while this adaptation diverges in marked ways from
Joyce's original tale, it captures in its very form the story's
modernist essence: a sense of individuals alone, confined by their
separate consciousnesses. Turning that sensibility into a
compelling Broadway musical, one that is sentimental in the most
profound sense of the word, remains one of the season's most
astonishing and laudable accomplishments.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clouds, patchy light snow and flurries will linger from southern
New England to the interior Northeast as low pressure moves out to
sea south of Cape Cod. The snow will accumulate an inch or two in
many areas near the southern New England coast during the day,
while little accumulation is expected farther north. Locally,
higher amounts may fall near the immediate coast where winds from
the ocean import additional moisture. Elsewhere across the region,
snow showers will be common near the eastern Great Lakes and
central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be breezy and cool in the wake of a
cold front. Cloudiness will linger near the western slopes of the
southern Appalachians, but sunshine will be plentiful from the
eastern Carolinas to most of the Gulf Coast states. Clouds and
thundershowers will occur in the warmer air over southern Florida
early Friday, but drier air is expected to arrive by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will promote dry weather and plentiful
sunshine over a large area from the Rockies to the Plains.
Temperatures will remain several degrees above normal in northern
areas, while near seasonal conditions prevail farther south.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, clouds will linger from central California to the
coastal Northwest. Light rain will dampen northern California and
coastal Oregon as an offshore front approaches. Intermittent snow
will prevail in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades.
Meanwhile, the interior Western States will be dry with a mixture
of sunshine and clouds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Clockwork Ice
</P>
<P>
   Like clockwork, Lake Erie became covered by ice this week, a
total freezing that happens, on average, the last week of January
or the first week in February. Lake Erie is the only Great Lake to
typically freeze over in winter, a distinction dictated by depth.
Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, with a limited
reservoir of warmth stored beneath its surface. As surface water
cools in winter, it becomes dense and sinks, with slightly warmer
water from below rising to the surface to replace it. By late
January or early February, warmth is exhausted, and the lake
freezes over. &QL;

have filed two bills that would remove the Confederate battle
symbol, which they feel glorifies the Old South and with it,
slavery. Similar bills have been filed for 20 years in Mississippi,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If all the world's a stage, the crucial role is to
operate the curtain, or better yet, the trap door.
</P>
<P>
   That's what New Hampshire gets to do every four years, and state
voters took their responsibility seriously this week. Their primary
did us all a favor by producing an entirely satisfactory outcome,
setting up a competitive presidential contest between two men in
each party who are experienced political pros sensitive to the
country's philosophical middle-ground instincts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens next, the country will be in safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   The primary dispatched the notion that either party was headed
for a coronation. Two hundred years ago we taught the British we
don't like crowned heads and we haven't changed our minds since.
Somehow the self-anointed heirs-apparent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Vice President Al Gore, initially missed that message.
</P>
<P>
   But we prefer professional wrestling to non-competitive
ceremonies, whether in mud, a roped-off canvas ring or politics.
Grubby work, but it's our specialty.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire gave Arizona Sen. John McCain a spectacular
victory to humble Bush and stop all that premature measuring of the
White House drapes. And the state was kind enough to former Sen.
Bill Bradley that his narrow loss will keep Gore on his toes for a
while yet.
</P>
<P>
   We now have four presidential candidates who are responsible,
qualified and articulate politicians with differing but not
alarmist views of the world. None is likely to take us off on an
unsettling, ideological lurch the way the discredited former GOP
Speaker Newt Gingrich attempted after seizing control of the House
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore can take nothing for granted. If they are to beat
off the insurgents, they must work for it. This is the American
way.
</P>
<P>
   We can mercifully forget the three unworthy Republicans who
cluttered up that party's debates without any elected governmental
experience or sense of our country beyond their own narrow
ideological agendas. One candidate had the mistaken idea that money
is everything and the other two that criminalizing abortion is all
voters care about. Of the latter pair, Gary Bauer is already
leaving, and the remaining Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes are all but
finished. Good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who wised up to Bradley's threat months ago, is a stronger
candidate now than in the days when he expected the nomination
simply because he was next in line as sitting vice president. If he
wins, he will have done it the old-fashioned way: He will have
earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's learning curve has been slower. He still seems burdened
with a sense of entitlement that leads him to underestimate the
public desire for the unscripted candor, fresh ideas and strong
voice that propels the McCain candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been running a campaign just like the one that elected
dear old dad to the White House in 1988 _ full of empty patriotic
phrases and establishment endorsements but short on substance. Papa
Bush got away with it because his Democratic opponent was the
hapless Michael Dukakis, who never knew what hit him. But daddy
lost his re-election bid four years later when he tried to run on
the same empty fumes against a more scrappy, policy-oriented rival,
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bush the younger's bad luck to face in McCain a candidate
with an intellect more like that of Clinton than Dukakis. McCain is
personable and out to redefine conservative politics along new,
centrist lines _ much as Clinton reshaped Democratic politics. It
will not be enough for Bush to insist that he is conservative and
McCain is liberal. Voters are bored with ideological games and not
sure about the distinctions that matter so much to purists anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in South Carolina, which holds the next GOP primary,
Bush seems content to rely on labels rather than specifics. He
cites his all-out tax cut plan as the goal of a true conservative
and McCain's tailored tax cut reserving money for Social Security
and Medicare as a liberal big-spending boondoggle. This will not
wash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first move in South Carolina was to produce his father's
widely derided vice president Dan Quayle for an endorsement. Quayle
himself tested a presidential campaign last year but gave up for
lack of support. His appearance with Bush in that heavily religious
state was supposedly meant to reinforce the Texas governor's
Christian conservative credentials. But it seemed instead a
desperate tactic. If he's his own man, why does he need Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   The familiar view of South Carolina is that of a state mired in
its past, proud of its conservative traditions and instinctively
bowing to entrenched power. But South Carolina is changing,
becoming a modern center of industry and commerce. McCain is
testing the limits of that change. Bush is clinging to the past.
They both can't be right. That's why we have democratic election
campaigns.

<P>
   I've always taken my car's dashboard for granted. Other than
fiddling with the radio or tape player, an occasional glance at a
gauge or warning light is about the extent of my involvement with
that structure between me and the engine.
</P>
<P>
   But after reading ``Dashboards,'' by David Holland (Phaidon
Press, paperback, $19.95), I've found myself stopping at
interesting-looking parked cars, particularly older ones, to peek
at their arrangements of gauges and dials on the other side of the
steering wheel. That's because Holland's lavish coffee-table book,
with photographs by Colin Turner and Ken Kirkwood, conveys a
fascinating tale of the evolution of the automobile dashboard, even
to those with only a passing interest in cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is accomplished with photographs of 52 vehicles and their
dashes, ranging from the 1904 Panhard et Levassor of France to the
1973 BMW 2002 Turbo of Germany. There is a minimum of text, but
it's enough. The pictures do the job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction, Holland, a British automobile collector and
restorer, explains why he did not go beyond 1973: ``I have
deliberately stopped at the point where natural evolution has
brought all to the same bland conclusion _ the padded facia
containing near-identical instruments and controls in standardized
positions. The dashboards selected for this book come from the days
when a dash was still a dash. These dashboards have character.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess that accounts for the lack of interest I have shown in
the dash of my 1991 Saab.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard, as Holland explains it, was originally the
foremost part of a horse-drawn carriage that prevented mud or
stones from being thrown onto the passengers. By the early 1900s,
similar boards, or sometimes a leather apron, were used for the
same purpose in horseless carriages. Pretty soon carmakers began
hanging gadgets and gauges on these boards and they evolved into
the modern dashboard with which we are all familiar. And while the
dashboard comes between the driver and the engine, it is at the
same time the driver's vital link to the machinery he or she is
operating, providing important data like engine temperature or oil
pressure. Of course, modern electronics have made the post-1973
dash a virtual cornucopia of data _ from door-ajar warning lights
to electronic maps _ compared with the simple panels pictured in
``Dashboards.'' But the book is a paean to aesthetics, not
technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, readers will be drawn to those cars in the book that
they remember or have had some experience with. Your reaction to
the pictures will date you as surely as growth rings reveal the age
of a fallen tree. One of my earliest childhood memories is riding
on my father's lap in Kentucky in 1948 as he let me ``drive'' an
Army surplus Jeep whose engine he had overhauled. And there,
starting on page 150 of ``Dashboards,'' are photos of a 1943 Willys
Jeep, looking just like my father's _ down to the olive-drab paint,
the round gearshift knob and the fold-down windshield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dash of the 1958 Edsel, Ford Motor Co.'s $350 million
failure, is pictured, along with the horse-collar grille that
surrounded the car's name in vertical lettering. Despite its
failure, the Edsel had some flash: a rotating-drum speedometer that
looks a bit like a ship's compass and ``teletouch'' buttons in the
center of the steering wheel to engage the automatic transmission.
But, alas, the car never engaged the buying public.
</P>
<P>
   For chrome-dripping opulence, few cars can match the 1959
Cadillac Eldorado with its distinctively high tailfins, boatlike
proportions and full-width grille. But surprisingly, the dashboard
is more spartan than the exterior would suggest. Holland describes
the dash as a prelude to modern design because it features cruise
control, electric windows and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The dash of the 1955 Chevrolet Corvette, America's answer to the
sports cars of Europe, seems odd by today's standards. It is nearly
symmetrical, with instruments radiating both left and right from
the center rather than being clustered in front of the driver. The
radio speaker on the right matches the shape of the speedometer on
the left; the tachometer is in the center, under the radio itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My favorite photographs are of a 1950 Chrysler Town &AMP; Country
``woodie'' and the 1951 Buick Le Sabre concept car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler's dash is surprisingly modern, with a hooded
speedometer and instruments clustered directly in front of the
driver. But it's the car's exterior wood trim that captivates. A
close-up photo shows the quality of the wood and carpentry, right
down to a carefully mitered joint.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Sabre was a monster of a dream car created by Harley
Earl, the legendary General Motors designer. It looks like a rocket
with its mammoth fins and big central taillight. The
black-and-chrome dash, embedded with exotic instrumentation, seems
ready for Buck Rogers to jump in and roar off. In fact, the car
stands as a symbol of what futurists of the early 1950s thought
we'd be driving by 2000. They were wrong, but they sure had fun.  &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two other new books look into the future, not the past, of the
automobile, toward a time when the internal-combustion engine and
its pollution are gone. That may be sooner than you think,
according to ``Forward Drive'' by Jim Motavalli (Sierra Club Books,
$25) and ``Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel Cell and the Race
to Change the World'' by Tom Koppel (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $27.95).
Hybrid cars are already in production that combine electric and
gasoline engines, and cars run by fuel cells _ which mix hydrogen
and oxygen to produce electricity, with clean water the sole
byproduct _ seem only a few years off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forward Drive,'' which will not go on sale until March,
Motavalli deals more broadly with alternative power and takes the
automotive press to task for its continued fascination with the
internal-combustion engine. The author is editor of E: The
Environmental Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powering the Future'' is mainly about Ballard Power Systems of
Burnaby, British Columbia, which has done pioneering work on fuel
cells. Koppel, a Canadian freelance writer, tells how Geoffrey
Ballard and his colleagues took an exotic, space-age technology and
adapted it for use in automobiles. Ballard's rise from its humble
beginnings in a makeshift lab in Arizona in the 1970s to its
pivotal position today _ DaimlerChrysler and Ford both hold stakes
in it _ makes compelling reading. And Koppel explains the
technology in a way that the average reader can understand.
</P>
<P>
   These are among other recently published books with an
automotive bent:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Deal Maker,'' by Axel Madsen (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $30). A
well-written biography of William C. Durant, who founded General
Motors in 1908 but declared bankruptcy in 1936, listing assets of
$250.
</P>
<P>
   _  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Rage to Road-Wise,'' by John Larson, M.D., with Carol
Rodriguez (Forge, paperback, $11.95). A psychiatrist's somewhat
overblown response to a somewhat overblown problem. But such a book
clearly has its place in driver education courses or for those with
a history of traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Selling Dreams: How to Make Any Product Irresistible,'' by
Gian Luigi Longinotti-Buitoni with Kip Longinotti-Buitoni (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $26). This book explains how you've been manipulated into
lusting for a $10,000 watch that doesn't tell time any better than
a $50 Timex. The author knows a thing or two about marketing
expensive goods: He is president and chief executive of Ferrari
North America. &QL;

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE SAYS ANTI-DRUG TV CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``e'' categories)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An aide to White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
denied Thursday that administration officials have pressured TV
networks to include anti-drug messages in TV programs but vowed to
continue offering financial incentives for the networks to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug use is down in this country, and part of that success has
been the changing attitude of the entertainment industry toward
drugs,'' Alan Levitt, director of the National Youth Anti-Drug
Media Campaign, told a Senate panel investigating the
administration's controversial practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Levitt told the panel that the White House anti-drug
office would no longer provide ``guidance'' to television
scriptwriters while program scripts were still being written.
</P>
<P>
   The government's controversial practice of influencing TV
programming stems from a government-financed advertising campaign
designed to discourage drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The $120 million campaign, which began in 1997, pays for
anti-drug commercials in prime time on six broadcast networks _
ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, WB and ESPN. For every commercial purchased by
the government, the networks agree to donate a
substance-abuse-related public service ad (PSA) in prime time. But
the networks can avoid giving away that second ad _ and instead
profit by selling the air time _ if their regular programming
includes scenes with negative portrayals of substance abuse, as
measured by White House previewers. Eager to regain those PSA slots
so they can sell them to regular commercial advertising, the
networks began submitting scripts and tapes to the White House
anti-drug office for approval before they were broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, scripts or tapes of 130 series
episodes were submitted for review. White House officials then
decided that 109 episodes had anti-drug messages that qualified for
credits under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The White House preview covered such popular and profitable hits
as ``ER,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and the ``Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the networks were able sell the advertising
time that would have been used for PSAs for an estimated $22
million, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's incentive program, Levitt insisted that
the White House never attempted to regulate content or to tell the
show's writers what they had to put in the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the programs felt any pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that to avoid any ``suggestion of federal
interference in the creative process,'' the White House anti-drug
office will change its policy and will review programs only after
they have aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't provide guidance on whether a script will qualify for
credits while the writers are still working it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also urged members of Congress _ some of whom have called
for an end to the credit program _ to keep the campaign alive. He
said the behavior of television characters has more influence over
young people than paid advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any anti-drug lobby group what they'd rather have, ads or
programming, and 10 out of 10 will pick programming,'' he said.
details of the program became public last week, McCaffrey insisted
that his office had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has defended the script-preview program, saying,
``What we're doing is in accordance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hyper-sensitive to First Amendment rights issues, and I
am not going to get involved in influencing program content,''
McCaffrey said last week.Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
chairman of the Senate panel, said the issue was not whether the
campaign has been effective, but whether the White House was
influencing the content of television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The White House anti-drug office) has set a dangerous
precedent,'' Campbell said. ``You're on thin ice dealing with a
program's content, whether it's intentional or not.''Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., agreed, saying that the campaign raises ``serious
questions'' about the government's role in television programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be disappointed if TV gave a better message, but I
get nervous when I learn that a government agency is involved,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Congress will continue investigating the extent of
White House influence over television programming and will consider
ways to ensure it does not continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be giving you some very clear and concise
direction to make sure there is no government role in the writing
of shows, and I warn you, that direction may come in the form of
reduced funding,'' he said.

KREMLIN SAYS IT HAS SWAPPED MISSING JOURNALIST FOR 3 POWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The case of missing journalist Andrei Babitsky took a
strange twist Thursday as the Kremlin announced it had turned the
crusading reporter over to Chechen rebels in exchange for three
Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Russian authorities were trying to either silence
or discredit Babitsky, who infuriated the Kremlin with his critical
coverage of the war in Chechnya, his family and colleagues reacted
to the announcement with suspicion, fear and anger. Some said they
feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awful. I am very worried about Andrei's safety,''
Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila Babitskaya, said in an interview. ``I
don't know what kind of condition he is in, if he has been beaten
or worse. I don't know what to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for US-funded Radio Liberty, Babitsky, 35,
disappeared while leaving Chechnya's capital of Grozny on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in Moscow said Russian forces had detained
him for lacking accreditation to work in the war zone and on
suspicion of joining the Chechen rebels. On Wednesday,
law-enforcement officials said Babitsky, who had not been allowed
to contact his family or his colleagues, would be released and
returned to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
Babitsky had instead been exchanged for three Russian prisoners of
war and was in the hands of the Chechen rebels. Yastrzhembsky added
that Babitsky had agreed to the exchange and that Russian
authorities were no longer responsible for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious blow to journalism and free speech in
Russia,'' said Savik Shuster, Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau chief.
``When a journalist is taken hostage and he is then exchanged for
other hostages, what can we expect next?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried about Andrei's safety. Until I see him I
cannot be certain that he is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Liberty's broadcast director, Jeff Trimble, said that
Thursday's news came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible and unacceptable that a man who has been held
without the ability to communicate with his family should be used
in this way,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharip Yusupov, a Moscow-based spokesman for the Chechen
government, said that Babitsky was with the rebels, that he was
safe and would soon be returning to Moscow. The claim, however,
could not be independently confirmed, and a Chechen representative
in Washington said he had not heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, suspicion about Babitsky's whereabouts
increased when he failed to contact his colleagues or his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Yakovenko, head of the Russian Journalists' Union, said in
a statement that he held the Russian government responsible for
Babitsky's safety. He also called accusations that he had joined
the Chechen militants ``wild and absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid of my own suspicions. I sincerely hope I am wrong
but I am very worried that Andrei may not be alive,'' said Oleg
Panfilov of the Glasnost Defense Fund, a Moscow-based free press
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media have been mostly supportive of Russia's battle
against separatist militants in Chechnya, which began in September.
Mindful of how critical media reports turned public opinion against
Russia's previous, unsuccessful attempt to defeat the rebels in
1994-96, the Kremlin has gone to great lengths to control
information this time around.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Babitsky's witheringly critical reports on high
Russian casualties and the plight of Chechnya's civilians iritated
officials in Mosccow. On Jan. 8, police raided the reporter's
Moscow apartment and confiscated photographs he had taken of a
battle in Grozny in which Russian soldiers were routed by Chechen
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generals wanted to remove Andrei. If you look at the first
Chechen war it is clear that the journalists were the winners,''
Panfilov said. ``They stopped the war.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview, Russia's Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev showed open disdain for Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would trade 10 Babitskys for one soldier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Russia's state-controlled media has branded
Babitsky a traitor, the privately owned NTV television station _
which has also criticized the war and has used Babitsky's material
in its reports _ has been supportive of his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Boris Yeltsin's first decisions as president was to
grant Radio Liberty the right to work officially in our country,''
NTV anchor Yevgeny Kisselyev said in a broadcast Sunday. ``Now,
after Yeltsin's resignation, one of the first journalists to suffer
repression is a Radio Liberty correspondent.''

GORE HAMMERS AWAY AT BRADLEY ON HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a whirlwind cross-country trip and a
marathon town hall meeting that dragged on until 1 a.m. Thursday,
Vice President Al Gore hit the ground running later in the day,
telling employees at a Los Angeles visual effects company that Bill
Bradley's health care plan would squander the surplus and cheat
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that surplus is gone, he can't put anything into
education,'' Gore said. ``That's why he has not put forward a
comprehensive education plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has made several education proposals, which include: an
early care and education partnership program with local businesses,
fully funding Head Start, training and recruiting 60,000 teachers,
forming scholarship and loan programs, improving access to
community colleges and improving after-school care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite you to contrast the positions that I've put forward
on this (education) with the positions put forward by (Bradley),''
Gore said.``If you look at his proposals, here's what you find: no
comprehensive education plan, not one penny to help middle income
families pay for college ... It is not a priority to his campaign.
It is the No. 1 priority for me,'' Gore said at Digital Domain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals are similar to Bradley's, but his includes a
plan for smaller classes and schools, tutoring for failing
students, tripling the number of charter schools by 2010, new
buildings and higher academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also was in California, holding a rally Thursday with
supporters at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's message that education should be America's No. 1 priority
in the information economy appeared to strike a chord with computer
specialists at Digital Domain, the multimedia company that provided
visual effects for such movies as ``Titanic,'' ``Apollo 13'' and
``What Dreams May Come.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with Digital Domain said 40 percent of its employees
were foreign nationals, because the company could not find
qualified Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``is speaking the same language,'' said Joanne Capitano,
the company's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pointed out that the Venice, Calif., company, which also
works on visual effects for theme parks and computer games, has 30
well-paid jobs that it can't fill because it can't find enough
qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not limited by much here,'' Gore said, ``but you are
limited by the substandard performance of our public schools.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore was accompanied by California Gov. Gray Davis, who told a
crowd of about 50 employees that Gore's experience is key to
providing leadership from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to give a speech and another thing to make
something happen in your life,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore traveled from New Hampshire to New York to
Washington, D.C., to Ohio before recharging on the flight to Los
Angeles and then engaged voters in a town hall meeting that dragged
on for 3 hours and 18 minutes, just a few minutes short of his
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry. I promise you I won't leave until every question
is answered,'' Gore told undecided voters gathered at Los Angeles
City College. ``I'll stay here until March 7 if that's what it
takes.``
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after Gore finally closed the formal question
and answer session, dozens of people hung around to shake his hand
and ask questions ranging from his religious beliefs to gay rights
to welfare reform to the Internet.

 &HT;    See you at the bookstore, our living room away from home
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Duane Brantley leans on a magazine rack at
Borders bookstore, his head buried in Mountain Bike Action
magazine. He's happily oblivious to the passage of time, to his
fellow magazine browsers, to the live jazz band playing in the
cafe. A few feet away, Yiannis Pavlou, 28, a four-times-a-week
regular, is sitting at a table, using his laptop to catch up on
work. Across the room, Thays Glasgow is knitting a sweater for her
9-year-old daughter, Daphne, who is reading ``Lacey's Crush,'' the
sixth in the Sweet Valley Jr. High Series. The only thing missing
is a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the magazine rack, Tsambika Bakiris, 20, who believes
there is no such thing as too many books, is carting an arm load of
psychology texts. Mingling at Borders provides ``balance'' in her
busy collegiate life. Later, she's going dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would rather go have a drink after work. I like to
come look at computer books, listen to the music, relax and have a
cup of hot chocolate,'' says Brantley, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new town square. Or public meeting hall. Or
watering hole. Whatever it is you're looking for, chances are you
can find it at the Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore/cafe
behemoths that have sprung up in metropolises across the country.
Mix live music, coffee, food and bibliophiles in a comfortable
atmosphere. Shake them around. Chill out. What you get is a place _
maybe even a community _ where people want to hang out for hours,
browsing through bookshelves, sipping coffee, eyeing the seemingly
single.
</P>
<P>
   It's coming together at a local Borders, which Glasgow, husband
David and daughter Daphne patronize every Friday and Saturday night
and sometimes Sunday afternoons. ``We make dates with other
families,'' she says. ``I'll talk to someone and say, `Oh, you're
going to Borders tonight? We'll see you there.' We spend little
money for good entertainment here. We can easily spend four hours
on two cups of coffee, and this is a good place for Daphne because
she loves to read.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the large chains that are attracting customers who
are looking for the extras. Eddie Tennison and Anne Cook are hooked
on Adventures In Crime &AMP; Space Books, a small bookseller that makes
up in hometown feel what it lacks in big store amenities. They
frequently dine in nearby restaurants and complete the evening with
a visit to the bookstore, where they browse and pick owner Willie
Siros' brain about mystery and science fiction books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie's is a special event for us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They also spend a lot of time at Book People down the street
from Adventures, and Barnes &AMP; Noble in Westlake, where their
teen-age daughter likes to study. Cook says Barnes &AMP; Noble, which
is near their home, has turned into a weeknight homework haven for
high school students.
</P>
<P>
   Serving customers' needs is important to a store's place in the
community. Yes, community _ the big chain stores want to be
involved in the schools and neighborhoods around them. Take the
Borders near the new southern branch of Central Market. It has its
own community relations coordinator, Sharon Mays, who visits
schools, lines up live music and last month organized group
discussions on exercising, losing weight, traveling and balancing
the family budget. As a result, outside groups, not just book
clubs, are meeting at the cafe. She calls her store a community
events center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers told us they wanted live music in the afternoons, so
we switched it (from nights). They asked for children's storyteller
Lisa Baker twice a month, so we booked her. We're buying a piano
for the cafe that anyone can use. Why? Because people expect more
than books,'' says Mays.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expectation that was created years ago not by the
mammoth chains, but by the scrappy independents.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1976, Edward Morrow, the owner of The Northshire
Bookstore in Manchester, Vt., began occasionally serving hot malt
cider and scones to his customers. They loved it. Then he moved his
store across the street to bigger quarters, sans the drinks and
pastries. Now, he's adding a cafe to his expanding store. ``People
are now expecting first-rate stores to have a a place to sit and
drink coffee,'' says Morrow, who served as president of the
American Booksellers Association from 1989 to 1990. ``The chain
stores picked up the idea from successful small independents like
Kramerbooks &AMP; Afterwords in Washington, D.C., and went to Wall
Street for financing. Then they rolled out the stores across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely even their investors foresaw what was coming.
Local artwork on the walls. Pokemon card trading clubs. Brunch. And
the unwritten invitation to browse. The stores don't care if you
buy something (well, they sort of do), they just want you there.
Borders is confident that customers who spend a lot of time at a
store sipping coffee or browsing are also impulse buyers. ``It's a
whole shopping experience,'' explains Mays. ``Even the people who
come for just an event or hang out will buy a book, or music or
merchandise that day or return another day to buy. We know these
people are regulars who come in four times a month. They will
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they've got something to sell. Bob and Carrie Barnstien
show up at Borders on a Saturday night to listen to the Java Jazz
band and tell people the good news. ``We came here to speak God's
word. We'll tell people what God has done for us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brantley, the bike magazine browser, says the environment is
conducive to entrepreneurship. ``I see people jotting things down
on paper napkins. New ideas are being created. The possibilities
are endless,'' he says. ``The next great widget could be coming
from a guy sitting over there listening to the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the guy who's probably making the biggest killing is
whoever took out a patent on big, cushy chairs. At the Barnes &AMP;
Noble near the University of Texas, students loiter in various
states of sprawl. Shaw Lash, 19, and Kimberly Jarboe, 21, are
draped on chairs and chatting over coffee. Classical music is
playing softly on the intercom. ``It feels like home,'' says
Jarboe.
</P>
<P>
   Home, meeting room, study hall, library with very strict
checkout policies _ the new bookstores are all of these things, and
more. But one thing they're not are singles bars for the brainiac
set. At least not yet, says Borders customer Melanie Thompson, 21.
``They could be. I met a nice guy here last week with the same
literary interests as me. I was hoping he'd be here tonight, but oh
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she's off to the travel section to visit faraway places.
``I want to go to China, and here I can do it,'' she says.
``Without anyone telling me I have to buy the book.''

 &HT;    MIAMI _ When Luiz Augusto Rocha was named head of the Florida
office of Odebrecht, the Brazilian engineering and construction
giant, he didn't waste any time. Upon arriving in Miami, one of the
first things he did was make the rounds among local politicians,
accompanied by his predecessor, Luis Oswaldo Leite, who started the
company's Florida business in 1991 and was then headed back to
Brazil.
 &HT;    One of their first stops was the office of Miami-Dade County
commissioner Natacha Millan. ``They didn't have an appointment;
they just dropped by,'' she says. ``We met for five or 10 minutes,
just to meet the new guy. It was a courtesy call.''
 &HT;    That kind of political finesse, along with bidding expertise and
an international reputation for quality, has helped Odebrecht
become a dominant player in South Florida public works
construction.
 &HT;    During the early 1990s, Odebrecht was one of more than a dozen
foreign construction firms competing for public contracts to
modernize roads and highways, primarily in South Florida. Most of
them have since left. But Odebrecht has stayed, setting itself
apart from competitors, both foreign and domestic.
 &HT;    So far, Odebrecht has landed more than US$400 million in South
Florida public works projects. About two-thirds of that amount
stems from the company's prominent role in Miami International
Airport's $4 billion long-term expansion and remodeling effort.
Odebrecht has also clinched several large highway projects and is
partnering with New York-based Morse Diesel Co. to build the $157
million American Airlines Arena.
 &HT;    That's not all. Odebrecht has also completed several bridge and
highway projects in other parts of Florida, as well as in Alabama,
South Carolina and North Carolina. A few years ago, the company
expanded into commercial construction and has completed 17 projects
throughout the Southeast to date.
 &HT;    Still, Florida remains Odebrecht's primary market. It accounts
for about $150 million in annual revenues, compared with
approximately $45 million from California, according to Leite and
Rocha. That's why Odebrecht consolidated its U.S. operations in
Miami, shutting down its California office and relocating Rocha and
six other employees to Florida. ``The significance of merging the
offices is to focus on Florida, because that's where the money is
in the U.S.,'' Rocha says. illion-a-year conglomerate with more
than 18,000 employees in 15 countries. However, the company has
prospered in Florida by making Odebrecht Contractors of Florida
Inc. a local operation. ``Odebrecht had the know-how and resources
to get their name known and open doors in Miami,'' says William
Delgado, president of the locally powerful Latin Builders
Association. ``Plus, their work was good to very good.''
 &HT;    Odebrecht's Florida executives say their success stems from a
company philosophy of local involvement and decentralized
authority. ``Our branches have full power to develop our local
company with local resources and local people,'' Rocha says. ``We
are an American company in the U.S., a Peruvian company in Peru, an
Ecuadorian company in Ecuador, and so on.''
 &HT;    Company executives set their sights on becoming a part of the
South Florida landscape immediately after setting up shop in Miami
in 1991. They purposely cut a high profile, Delgado recalls. ``They
immediately joined our organization. They had a presence at almost
every industry-related event I attended in the early '90s _
dinners, workshops _ whatever,'' he says.
 &HT;    Odebrecht built a strong foundation for future success by
teaming up with Church &AMP; Tower, a Miami construction firm with
strong political ties. The company was run by Jorge Mas Canosa, the
late Cuban exile leader. ``At the time, Church &AMP; Tower was a small
company looking to develop itself in heavy construction,'' Leite
says. ``They knew uring Bush's 1998 campaign. Odebrecht said at the
time that it gave the money to help support the foundation's
publication of Bush's book ``Profiles in Character.'' Says Leite:
``We were looking for a worthwhile project to support. Bush was not
in a campaign when we made the contribution. We thought it was a
good investment.''
 &HT;    Just to show that it was non-partisan, in September 1998
Odebrecht also contributed $5,000 to the state Democratic Party,
which was paying many of the expenses for Bush's opponent, Buddy
MacKay.
 &HT;    Odebrecht is no stranger to political controversy. In the early
1990s, the Brazilian government investigated allegations that
Odebrecht and other construction companies had bribed officials in
return for public contracts. Odebrecht denied any foul play, and
the company was never indicted.
 &HT;    In Miami, politicians describe Odebrecht's lobbying efforts as
relatively understated. The company has one full-time lobbyist.
Some construction firms have two or three, notes Millan, a key
player in the Miami-Dade commission's decisions on matters
involving Miami International Airport.
 &HT;    ``Odebrecht is low key compared to what I see from some other
companies,'' Millan says. ``They brief me on their proposals well
in advance and provide more information if I request it. They never
pressure me just before I sit on the dais to make a decision.''
Odebrecht may be low key, but somehow, it certainly has been
effective at grabbing public-works projects in Florida.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO SEEK $304 MILLION FOR HURRICANE FLOYD RELIEF
 &HT;    Eds: Updates with new funding amount, details.
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to include $304 million in
additional Hurricane Floyd relief money in a supplemental budget
request he will send Congress on Monday, White House officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., met with White House officials
Thursday to discuss additional aid for the victims of the hurricane
and the flooding it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, White House officials said the president would seek
$236 million from Congress, with the bulk going to fund housing
buyouts and Small Business Administration loans, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   However, after further discussions, Clinton decided to ask for
additional farm aid, raising the package to $304 million, said a
White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real progress, but I don't think we are
through,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money, $128 million, will be used for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's housing buyout program and the Small
Business Administration's loan program for individuals and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The farm aid will be used to replace equipment and structures
lost in the flood and to provide loans to farmers raising commodity
price crops.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining money will be used to help commercial fishermen
replace lost equipment, for economic development needs, repairing
military facilities, rural housing reconstruction, beach
renourishment and repairing damaged park facilities, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Hurricane Floyd and subsequent flooding
destroyed or left uninhabitable 24,000 homes in North Carolina and
damaged another 56,000 homes, according to Gov. Jim Hunt's office.
</P>
<P>
   Congress voted last year to send the state $2.2 billion in
federal relief money. But Edwards and North Carolina's 12 House
members wrote Clinton last month asking him to include more relief
funds in a supplemental budget bill for fiscal 2000, which started
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That funding bill will be sent to Congress on Monday along with
Clinton's fiscal 2001 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   This new money will be available to all victims of Hurricane
Floyd, not just North Carolina residents, Edwards said. However,
the senator predicts the bulk of the money will be used in his
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the Hurricane Floyd-specific money, he will be
asking for significant increases for community development block
grants and (Department of Housing and Urban Development) low-income
housing rental monies,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this clearly shows we're making significant progress
and we are filling in the gaps,'' he said.

 &HT;    SENATORS DEBATE LOANS TO IMPROVE RURAL TV PROGRAMMING
 &HT;    By GINGER LIVINGSTON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rural communities would have better access to local
television channels under a $1 billion federal loan guarantee
program for satellite broadcasting, the Senate Agriculture
Committee was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-scale, low-density settlement patterns make it costly to
deliver these types of services to rural Americans,'' said Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite television industry, originally created to serve
rural America, told the committee that economic considerations
force it to concentrate on the nation's largest television markets.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 television stations serve the nation's 66 largest
television markets and reach 80 percent of its households, said
John Hutchison, chief operating officer of LTVS, a Raleigh, N.C.,
satellite broadcasting company.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 800 U.S. stations serve the remaining 144
television markets, but reach only 20 percent of the nation's
households, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The loan guarantee would support up to $1 billion in loans to
provide a satellite that would beam local broadcasts to those rural
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max S. Baucus, D-Mont., proposed the loan guarantees last
fall as part of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, but the
provision was removed from the final version of that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, whose Banking Committee also held
hearings on the issue this week, was among the lawmakers who
opposed the Baucus provision.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm believes the legislation should provide for a greater
financial investment by the private sector, plus guarantees that
taxpayers could recoup losses if there is a default on the loan,
said Christi Harlan, the banking committee's communications
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm also wants an advisory panel that will oversee the
management of loans.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar said Thursday that creating a new oversight committee
would delay implementation of the program. He is proposing that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service agency
oversee the loan's management.
</P>
<P>
   The Banking Committee will take the issue up again next week
when its hears from Montana's other senator, Tom Burns, who is
drafting legislation that will incorporate Gramm's proposal into
Baucus's original legislation.

<P>
   You have to hand it to the bold women in Rylstone, England, who
decided to do a nude calendar and raise money for leukemia
research. Certainly, baring one's buns for charity beats holding an
everyday bake sale.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did standing there facing the world wearing only their
pearls yield this innovative group a whopping $550,000 in calendar
sales, they performed a great public service _ to middle aged
bodies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you love to read the minutes from the brainstorming
meeting when their Women's Institute, which normally meets to make
jam and do crafts, came up with a new fund-raiser: ``It has been
moved by Moyra and second by Lynda that we all take our knickers
off and pose starkers.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen the calendar. Their Web site reports they're sold
out. But the newspaper photo of the group, in which they're fully
clothed, shows them looking like nice, ordinary women. Like
someone's book club.
</P>
<P>
   The telling thing is that even out of their neat suits and
turtleneck sweaters they apparently look equally ordinary. And this
made them more a hit than a disappointment. They look like us,
meaning ``us'' as in real flesh and blood types. No celebrity
tushes here. No Golden Globe bosoms. Just your average naked
grown-up body that has been around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The response was the British equivalent of ``you go, girl'' and
respectful applause. Uplifting, said one reviewer. How wonderful to
see real women, wrote one man, ``instead of stick insects with
pouty lips and pipe cleaners for legs.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a bit harsh, but it was jolly good of him to appreciate
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   How refreshing to see ripe, middle-aged bodies whose hills and
valleys you can relate to. The problem with going around with
clothes on all the time is that everyone's hiding everything, so
after a while we begin to think that we're the only ones whose
bodies don't match the ones in magazines and those taut ones on the
movie screen getting all the good sex. Real women can use the
validation.
</P>
<P>
   In the old movie ``Harold and Maude'' in which young Harold
cavorts with much older Maude a priest shudders over the mere
thought of her nakedness next to his.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much how it has been with the media, making it
tough to be comfortable in our own skins when we're told all the
time that the only flesh worth looking at belongs to a certain age
and skin tone.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said the women of Rylstone, England, and their fans.
What's wrong with ripe flesh? Who says smooth is better than
wrinkled? Hip, hip, hooray for a round belly and un-perky breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who can believe in celebrity flesh anyhow, with all the
plumping, enhancing, implanting and sucking out that is routinely
done on actresses and models. With digital photography, even those
bodies we futilely compare our own against may be artificially put
together from various real ones.
</P>
<P>
   Better for your self esteem to go with the real women of
Rylstone whose dimples you can trust as much as your own.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural ideal of beauty being a ``non-threatening girl's
body rather than a woman's body'' serves to keep women pre-occupied
with body-hating, says Carol H. Munter who co-authored the book,
``When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies.'' Munter says that when we
complain non-stop about our bodies we perpetuate the belief that
the female body is never entirely acceptable. Then we end up
spending all our time trying to change the way we look rather than
trying to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think would happen if all the women in the world
suddenly stopped hating their bodies?'' Munter ask groups of women
who come to her talks. And the reply, she says, is, ``We'd have so
much energy, we'd take over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark that down on your calendar.

 &HT;    Kors' fashion picks make him Goodwill ambassador
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stand back. Hold on to children and
small pets.
</P>
<P>
   Keep elbows and feet out of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors is shopping, and no item of clothing is safe from
his dead-on sense of style, eye for quality and quick wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a baby T. How much is it? A dollar? Excuse me! The
Gap's too high.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer, visiting Palm Beach for a personal appearance at
Saks and a charity fashion show at a private home, has one hour to
pull together three outfits from the thousands of mismatched pieces
at the South Dixie Goodwill. It's a gauntlet that we've thrown down
and he has gamely picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Sound easy? Ha! His mission is rife with danger: A thrift store
can be a minefield of fashion disasters waiting to explode. Again.
</P>
<P>
   A chunky pair of maroon corduroy shirts catches his eye. ``How
fat do you think someone will look in these? She bought them, she
took them home, and she always regretted the day of purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Seventh Avenue credentials, Kors is no stranger to
the often strange world of thrift, where Calvin Klein sweaters can
rub worn elbows with college sweatshirts. ``Fashion people love to
forage and love to shop,'' Kors says. ``This is really what I do
for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and design critically acclaimed clothes for his own
label and the French fashion house Celine. His fun, sexy, colorful
sportswear _ seen regularly in the pages of Vogue and Harper's
Bazaar and on the backs of celebs such as Gwyneth Paltrow and
Courtney Love _ helped him snag fashion's most prestigious prize
last year, the CFDA Award for Women's Wear Designer of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Kors divides his time between New York and Paris, but on a
recent Friday afternoon he arrives at the pink stucco Goodwill,
looking very fashionable in Banana Republic khakis and a black
long-sleeved T from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, it's department-store thrift,'' he gushes,
surveying the Goodwill. ``This is the biggest thrift I've ever been
in! It's enormous. ... This isn't like some of them I've been in
where it's like dragging through a box.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes to get his bearings, Kors plunges into the
skirt section, partly because it's easier for women to get a proper
fit in a skirt than in a pair of pants. (``I don't trust pants,''
he says.)
</P>
<P>
   Kors says he's looking for natural fibers and classic shapes,
and each piece has only seconds to impress.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny wrap skirt in a bold print: ``A little Heather Graham.
Someone was flirty.''
</P>
<P>
   A gingham skirt: ``This looks like Michael Kors from the '80s. I
always did a lot of chocolate-and-white gingham.''
</P>
<P>
   A corduroy skirt with ruffled hem: ``I think someone in Paris
just showed that skirt! You have to understand, fashion moves so
fast now we're soon going to have an early '90s revival.''
</P>
<P>
   Kors briefly considers tooling through the menswear department,
where women can find timeless basics such as plain white shirts.
(``Men think it's a badge of honor to tell you they've been wearing
the same thing for 30 years. But just because you can get it on
your body doesn't necessarily mean it still fits.'')
</P>
<P>
   But he never makes it to men's, with so many shorts, dresses and
shirts to size up. Coats beckon to him, PJs ``depress'' him. The
'80s-ness of so much of the inventory is almost unbearable. The
good, the bad and the hideously ugly is each summed up with a quip.
</P>
<P>
   A sundress: ``Get ready for full Melanie Griffith! She's
flowered. She's strappy.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of short shorts: ``Someone had a little hot pant thing
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   A white boatneck shirt: ``That's fabulous. Excuse me, it's
probably on Worth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   A menswear-inspired vest: ``It's gray flannel, so it sells me.''
</P>
<P>
   A striped boatneck tee: ``A Marimekko moment! We love
nautical!''
</P>
<P>
   A fire-engine red crocheted top: ``Very Jan Brady. I think my
mother wore it as a coverup over her swimsuit. It's a little
acrylic for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes, his shopping cart is overflowing and Kors is
satisfied that he's seen enough. The clothes are laid out in the
furniture department on a sectional sofa that the designer
describes as ``very `Boogie Nights'.''
</P>
<P>
   The Melanie Griffith dress gets tossed for being ``too funny,''
a basic white shirt is declared ``too boring,'' and the Marimekko
top is just too large compared with the other pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A '50s fur-collared coat, although it had sent him scurrying
across the floor when he first spotted it, gets the cold shoulder
because of a damaged spot on the arm. A pair of white jeans has a
tiny stain that Kors thinks would be impossible to remove. In
total, 30 pieces receive a one-way ticket back to the racks, and
three modern outfits are created using yesterday's castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun thing about going into a thrift shop is you can buy it
and wear it once. If you had to pay $1,200 for that dress, you'd be
annoyed. But, for $3.85, it's a date dress.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUR LOOKS FOR FIFTY BUCKS!
</P>
<P>
   Surveying his final choices, Michael Kors is pleased and, he
admits, pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally how all the supermodels dress. ... Amber
Valetta would not be seen in a new dress. It has to be vintage.''
</P>
<P>
   In just three outfits, Kors has covered every season and every
time of day _ work, weekend, evening. Plus, he has built one outfit
around black, one around brown and one around vivid colors _ a
smart strategy that could be expanded wardrobe-wide. The price tag
on so much style? A measly $52.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saved all this money,'' Kors says, ``you could afford
to go buy one expensive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. We hear this fellow Michael Kors makes some fabulous
frocks ...
</P>
<P>
   THE PALM BEACHER: $15.44!
</P>
<P>
   ``How Palm Beach is this?'' Kors says. ``With the green pants, a
fuchsia turtleneck and a yellow cardigan, she could go insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The pants are a men's 30 _ roughly a women's size 8. But Kors
says they're worth altering, and he'd hem them into capris. (``The
ankles are the one part of the body that doesn't age.'')
</P>
<P>
   When dressing casually, you can choose shoes on the cheapy side,
Kors says. For this outfit, he suggests Dr. Scholl's, flip-flops in
a bright color or a pair of white leather loafers. His final
choice, however, is this pair of yellow heels: ``How good are
these? These are heaven!''
</P>
<P>
   Lined in canary yellow, the purse is a last-minute find. ``Oh,
here's my bag. She's been hiding. She's so good. You can't go wrong
_ it's straw,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Green pants (never worn!): $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Pink Land's End turtleneck: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Yellow lambswool sweater: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Yellow leather shoes: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Straw purse with yellow lining: $2.19
</P>
<P>
   Straw hat: $1.85
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL: $15.44
</P>
<P>
   THE CAREER GIRL: $19.23!
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for this outfit is Mary Tyler Moore, a '70s
fashion icon who continues to serve as muse for designers today.
``The whole working-girl thing is coming back,'' Kors says.
</P>
<P>
   The A-line tweed skirt was the first item Kors spied when his
spree began. ``This skirt is heavenly. Right off the bat!'' (He
points out that it would also look good with a snug turtleneck.)
</P>
<P>
   The blouse ``is full-on Prada this season'' _ with one small
fix, the removal of ``the really ugly button'' at the collar.
</P>
<P>
   And the trench coat is pivotal because it will go with anything.
``I literally showed this coat,'' Kors says. ``This is the most
perfect piece in the whole store.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Don't go looking for the trench at Goodwill. The Palm
Beach Post fashion editor bought it for herself.)
</P>
<P>
   Trench coat: $8.49
</P>
<P>
   Ivory blouse: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Plaid tweed skirt: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Open-toed pumps: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Clutch purse: $2.19
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL: $19.23
</P>
<P>
   THE LADY: $15.23
</P>
<P>
   Despite its clear retro influences, this feminine ensemble is
very, very now.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer black dress ``looks just like Prada this season,''
Kors says.
</P>
<P>
   And the shrunken, velvet jacket? ``I think we're showing this
jacket in New York in a month.'' (If a jacket's sleeves are too
short for you, cut them off to bracelet length to make them look
purposefully short, Kors suggests. Think of the way Jackie Kennedy
used to wear her suits.)
</P>
<P>
   Kors calls the T-straps with skinny heels ``fabulous and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a timely look. ``There's a return to `The
Lady,''' Kors says. ``Something a little more Grace Kelly is
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer, pleated dress: $3.85
</P>
<P>
   Fitted velvet jacket: $5.49
</P>
<P>
   Patent-leather belt: $.85
</P>
<P>
   T-strap heels: $2.85
</P>
<P>
   Deco-inspired purse: $2.19
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL: $15.23
</P>
<P>
   BONUS OUTFIT!
</P>
<P>
   Kors' task was to assemble three ensembles, but he was compelled
to create one more when it came time to toss a DKNY houndstooth
skirt into the discard pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's asking to be put in,'' said Kors, matching the
wool/cashmere skirt with the velvet jacket from the evening outfit
and the ivory blouse from the work category.
</P>
<P>
   And for $2.85, who can resist?
</P>
<P>
   BUYING POWER
</P>
<P>
   Designer Michael Kors makes thrift-shopping look remarkably easy
and incredibly fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an eye, you can do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He shared some tips on developing that eye and shopping smarter,
whether at Goodwill or Bergdorf Goodman:
</P>
<P>
   _ Go natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wools hold up. They last. Cottons and linens do too.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get caught up in the bargain of it if it truly isn't a
usable piece. But if it has possibilities, for $3 you can take a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Gather, then edit.
</P>
<P>
   Kors paid little mind to whether separates would match as he
piled his shopping cart high. He spent 3/4 of his time at the
Goodwill gathering items, and the last 25 percent deciding what to
keep and what to toss.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest in small changes.
</P>
<P>
   Big shoulder pads bugging you? Replace them with smaller pads or
rip 'em out all together. Love the dress but hate the buttons?
Change them. The shoes fit but they're a little rough around the
edges? Have them reheeled and resoled.
</P>
<P>
   _ That said, carefully consider footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not normally a believer that you can fake it on shoes. You
can pay a dollar for a dress, but spend the money on the feet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have a tendency to pile on too much,'' Kors says.
``Take it off.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Take care of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   A good haircut, a manicure and professional alterations are the
foundation of looking stylish, no matter how much you spend on your
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   THE KORS LOOK
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Michael Kors' Spring 2000 collection was the
preppy glamour of early '70s Palm Beach: crisp colors, clean lines
and a certain sex appeal. As for the Barbie-doll models, their hair
was big, and their fake lashes were bigger.

SEPARATING PLAYERS FROM THE FANS AT PEBBLE BEACH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE MEADOWS   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ When it comes to security for players at
a PGA tournament, especially one like this week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, how much is too much?
</P>
<P>
   ``It might come to the point where it might be like a high
school, where you have to have metal detectors in order to go in,''
said Tiger Woods, who is going for his sixth consecutive victory at
Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a gallery-sized entourage of security people when he
played at the Williams World Challenge in January in Arizona that
included two Scottsdale police officers along with security
officers hired by the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the various bodies _ the PGA, the USGA and PGA of
America _ have to wrestle with the reality,'' said Ric Clarson, PGA
business affairs spokesman. ``And I can tell you, the Tour has gone
to great lengths to address the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournaments like this week's AT&AMP;T, the Bob Hope two weeks ago
and last week's Phoenix Open are all popular events that draw
crowds who come not only for the golfers, but the celebrities as
well.
</P>
<P>
   At the Phoenix Open, David Duval was so upset by heckling on
Saturday, that he cleared out his locker and appeared ready to quit
the event. PGA officials coaxed the world's No. 2 player to come
back on Sunday, when he shot a 69 to finish tied for 30th at 5
under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's irrelevant,'' Duval said when asked about whether he
had planned to pull out. ``But I think we as players deserve to be
treated with a bit more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Galleries in Phoenix are among the rowdiest on the PGA Tour, but
Duval was bothered by some specific comments about him personally.
</P>
<P>
   He raised some hackles in the gallery when he raised his finger
to the crowd on the 12th hole. Observers differed on whether it was
an obscene gesture or an effort to quiet the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there myself,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``But I was
disappointed that some people continued heckling him. That was
uncalled for.'' Mickelson said fans who harass players should be
kicked off the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the marshals there for?'' he asked. ``As many times
as he got heckled, I can't believe the marshals or somebody didn't
get rid of somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second episode in as many years at Phoenix. The
previous year, an inebriated spectator following Woods' group was
arrested and a loaded gun was found in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Duval and Woods incidents happened near the 15th and
16th holes at Phoenix, where large groups of fans gather around
tents that dispense booze.
</P>
<P>
   There are other recent incidents as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Greater Hartford Open, Scott Hoch came to blows with
a heckler when he walked off the 18th green after comments had left
Hoch's wife in tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 Anderson Consulting World Match-Play event, Nick
Faldo topped a tee shot, hitting it 100 yards when a cell phone
went off during his downswing.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are banned at PGA events, but you don't have to look
hard to find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago there were no cell phones, so it wasn't a
problem,'' said pro Jim Furyk. ``But now, people are so blatant
about it ... they talk on the phone while you're 10 feet away
trying to hit off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Players Championship, Steve Elkington enjoyed a
five-stroke lead when a drunken fan yelled out: ``Hey Elk, how
about a couple of double-bogeys to make it interesting?''
Elkington's caddy later got in a confrontation with the spectator.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA is well aware of the growing problems, many of them
directly tied to the sale of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At the AT&AMP;T, a 4 1/2-foot chain-link security fence was erected
between the 18th green and the bleachers to keep fans at a
distance. The PGA also is enforcing more strictly a policy of
searching handbags and other such items carried by fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour has created a full-time security force at PGA and
Senior PGA events, including personnel in civilian clothes as well
as uniformed officers, and has urged tournament officials to beef
up their own security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to publicly state the exact measures we're
taking, for obvious reasons,'' said PGA spokesman Dave Lancer.
``But we're dealing with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some changes include banning beer sales at historic ``trouble
holes,'' and moving beer stands several hundred yards away from
tees.
</P>
<P>
   If a fan brings a cell phone or pager to a PGA event, he or she
will have to hand it over to security and pick it up from security
when the round is over.
</P>
<P>
   But with spectators able to smuggle just about anything on the
course _ including weapons _ with relative ease, it's not a stretch
to foresee something truly unfortunate happening to a player,
spectator or marshal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for PGA commissioner Tim Finchem told the PGA Policy
Board that the only way to control the Phoenix Open _ which drew
close to 500,000 spectators last week _ is ``to reduce the size of
crowds significantly, like they did in Dallas'' for the Byron
Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be to limit daily ticket sales _ like it's done at
the U.S. Open _ or eliminating daily tickets entirely, opting for a
weekly badge that could cost as much as $150.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're talking about taking money out of the cash
register, tournament officials would quickly point out, that you're
taking away money from the charities that benefit greatly from the
PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the answer is,'' Mickelson said. ``But
something needs to change.''

TEXAS COUNTY PLEADS FOR HELP AS SUSPECTED PAROLE VIOLATORS FILLING
UP JAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Harris County Jail official Thursday pleaded
for state help in dealing with the costly, steadily increasing
number of suspected parole violators temporarily locked up in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   More than 550 suspected parole violators are in custody in
Harris County awaiting hearings, up from about 200 less than a year
ago, said Sheriff's Maj. Mark Kellar. Their upkeep costs the county
about $50 a day per inmate, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The state needs to speed up parole revocation hearings and
dedicate more prison space to parole violators, Kellar told the
Texas Commission on Jail Standards, which regulates crowding in
local lockups.
</P>
<P>
   With the Harris County Jail barely under its capacity of 8,600
inmates, jailers have been nervously watching increases in the
number of parole violators since last spring. If unabated, the
trend could cost local taxpayers about $10 million a year, Kellar
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to identify why is this number growing. Quite
frankly, I don't think we have an adequate explanation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts said a possible cause is an effort by the
Board of Pardons and Paroles to deal with backlogged parole
violation charges, coupled with a space crunch in some state
prisons. Other causes cited were bureaucratic inefficiencies and
delayed impact from the restructuring of the criminal justice
system in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Though counties and the state used to feud openly about the
state's duty to house sentenced offenders, this quandary will be
fixed with state and local cooperation, Kellar predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get into drawing lines in the sand and
chaining inmates to fences. We are approaching it from good
faith,'' Keller said, adding that parole and prison officials have
been ``very encouraging'' in recent meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has a responsibility in this issue,'' Kellar
emphasized. ``These are state inmates who have been convicted of
state crimes in state district courts, sentenced to terms in the
state penitentiary and paroled to a state agency, with the rules
and regulations developed by another state agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin County Sheriff Terry Box, a commission member,
sympathized with his colleague's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very large number of inmates without any local
charges,'' Box observed. ``It's really hurting the bigger urban
counties.''
</P>
<P>
   One defense lawyer suspects the numbers are swelling because the
state is tackling a long-standing backlog of unserved ``blue
warrants'' for parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely out of control,'' said Huntsville lawyer Bill
Habern, who said he has won cases recently in which blue warrants
were not served deligently and were based on long-expired parole
restrictions.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Cuando a Luiz Augusto Rocha lo nombraron jefe de la
oficina floridana de Odebrecht, el coloso brasileno de construccion
e ingenieria, no queria desperdiciar ni un minuto. Al llegar a
Miami, una de las primeras cosas que hizo fue conocer a los
politicos locales, acompanado por su predecesor, Luis Oswaldo
Leite, quien inicio el negocio de la compania en la Florida en 1991
y en ese momento regresaba a Brasil.
 &HT;    Una de las primeras visitas que hizo fue a la oficina de Natacha
Millan, comisionada del Condado de Miami-Dade. ``No habian hecho
una cita; simplemente llegaron sin anunciarse,'' dice Millan. ``Nos
reunimos unos 5 o 10 minutos, lo necesario para conocernos. Fue una
visita de cortesia.''
 &HT;    Esa clase de astucia politica, junto con la experiencia en las
licitaciones y una reputacion internacional de calidad, han dado a
Odebrecht una fuerte presencia en el sector de las obras publicas
del sur de la Florida. A principios de la decada de 1990, Odebrecht
era una entre mas de una decena de empresas extranjeras de
construccion que competian por contratos del sector publico para
modernizar calles y autopistas, sobre todo en el sur de la Florida.
La mayor parte de esas firmas se han marchado. Pero Odebrecht se ha
quedado y se ha distinguido de la competencia, tanto local como
internacional.
 &HT;    Hasta ahora, Odebrecht ha conseguido mas de US$400 millones en
contratos de obras publicas en el sur de la Florida. Alrededor de
las dos terceras partes de esa suma proviene de su participacion en
la remodelacion y expansion a largo plazo del Aeropuerto
Internacional de Miami. Odebrecht tambien ha firmado varios
contratos grandes para obras en autopistas y se asocia con Morse
Diesel Co., de Nueva York, en la construccion de la Arena de
American Airlines, que costara US$157 millones.
 &HT;    Odebrecht tambien ha completado varias obras de puentes y
carreteras en otras partes de la Florida, asi como en Alabama,
Carolina del Norte y Carolina del Sur. Hace unos anos, la compania
se expandio hacia la construccion comercial y hasta la fecha ha
realizado 17 obras en el Sureste.
 &HT;    Pero la Florida es el principal mercado de Odebrecht. El estado
le representa unos US$150 millones en ingresos anuales; en
California tiene ingresos de unos US$45 millones, segun Leite y
Rocha.
 &HT;    Odebrecht es un conglomerado que mueve US$5.000 millones al ano,
con mas de 18.000 empleados en 15 paises. Pero la compania ha
prosperado en la Florida haciendo de Odebrecht Contractors of
Florida Inc. una operacion local que realiza obras de calidad.
``Odebrecht tiene los conocimientos y los recursos para darse a
conocer y abrir puertas en Miami,'' dice William Delgado,
presidente de la poderosa Latin Builders Association, de Miami.
``Ademas, su trabajo paso de bueno a muy bueno.''
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de Odebrecht en la Florida dicen que su exito
esta en usar los recursos locales y descentralizar la autoridad.
``Nuestras sucursales tienen la potestad de desarrollarse con
recursos locales y con personal local,'' explica Rocha. ``Somos una
compania norteamericana en Estados Unidos, una compania peruana en
Peru, una compania ecuatoriana en Ecuador, y asi sucesivamente.''
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de la empresa decidieron integrarse plenamente en
cuanto llegaron a Miami en 1991. Delgado recuerda que uno de sus
objetivos era llamar la atencion. ``Inmediatamente se unieron a
nuestra organizacion. Estaban representados practicamente en todos
los eventos del sector a los que asisti a principios de los 90:
cenas, seminarios, de todo,'' relata.
 &HT;    Odebrecht consolido la base del exito futuro asociandose con
Church &AMP; Tower, una empresa de construccion de Miami con fuertes
lazos politicos. La firma estaba dirigida por Jorge Mas Canosa,
difunto lider del exilio cubano. ``En ese momento, Church &AMP; Tower
era una pequena compania que trataba de desarrollarse en la
construccion pesada,'' dice Leite. ``Conocian el mercado y tenian
capacidad administrativa. Un conocido nos presento a Mas Canosa y
desarrollamos una buena relacion.''
 &HT;    Unos meses despues dice Leite, Odebrecht se asocio con Church &AMP;
Tower para participar en la licitacion de una extension del sistema
de tren elevado del centro de Miami, el Metromover. Hicieron la
oferta mas baja y ganaron el contrato. Odebrecht era propietaria
del 80 por ciento de la empresa conjunta, valorada en US$27,8
millones. Un ano despues, las dos companias consiguieron un
contrato de US$22,4 millones para ampliar un basural.
 &HT;    Despues de conseguir el segundo proyecto, las dos empresas no se
asociaron mas. Church &AMP; Tower, que despues se vio involucrada en un
escandalo cuando se la acuso de cobrar excesivamente al gobierno
local por obras de pavimentacion, es una filial de MasTec, empresa
de Miami que se especializa en instalar sistemas telefonicos y de
television por cable en America Latina y Estados Unidos. ``Llegamos
a la conclusion de que estabamos en negocios distintos,'' dice
Leite. ``Ellos se dedicaban mas a las telecomunicaciones y nosotros
a la construccion pesada.''
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la relacion dejo a Odebrecht con conexiones
politicas duraderas. ``Mas Canosa me presento a mucha gente en
Miami, muchos todavia son amigos,'' relata Leite. Fernando Rojas,
portavoz de MasTec, se nego a hacer comentarios y dijo que la
relacion entre las dos companias era ``historia.''
 &HT;    Odebrecht tambien fortalece su reputacion mediante
contribuciones a obras btos de obras publicas en la Florida.

   NY-MCCAIN-BALLOT (New York) _ Gov. George Pataki, George W.
Bush's top New York backer, waved the white flag of surrender
Thursday in the battle to keep John McCain off the state's
presidential primary ballot. ``I believe that John McCain should be
on the ballot,'' Pataki said in a statement. ``This should be a
campaign about ideas and issues, not technicalities. I'm confident
that George Bush will win that campaign.'' (Summary from wires) By
Clifford J. Levy.

   VODAFONE-MANNESMANN (Dusseldorf, Germany) _ Ending a bruising
three-month hostile takeover brawl, two of the world's biggest
companies in wireless communications agree to merge in a record
$183 billion deal. In a stunning victory that had once been
considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany, in an
all-stock transaction that easily shattered the previous record for
a takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago. By Edmund L. Andrews

 &HT;    Delta rank for on-time arrivals dips, report shows
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines slipped from third to fourth place in
1999 for on-time rankings for major carriers but moved up two spots
to second place for fewest mishandled bags.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta also maintained a third-place standing for
its rate of consumer complaints to the U.S. Department of
Transportation, which compiles the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's year-end Air Travel Consumer Report reflects
airlines' poor year for customer relations, which saw the industry
come under fire in Congress and issue voluntary service standards
to avoid government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers filed 20,495 complaints to the DOT about airline
service, more than double the 9,608 complaints of 1998. Part of the
reason, however, may lie in easier methods of filing, including an
electronic complaint form now posted at the DOT Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint total translated to a rate of 2.48 complaints per
100,000 enplanements, up from 1.08 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But for Delta specifically, the results ``confirm our ongoing
commitment to customer service,'' said spokesman John Kennedy. He
noted that Delta was the only hub-and-spoke carrier that finished
among the top four in all three service rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had consistently ranked near the bottom of the industry
for on-time arrivals _ including a last-place finish in 1997 _
before the carrier's new management team started a concerted effort
to improve. That led to a third-place finish in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Delta backtracked only slightly in 1999, with 78 percent of
flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, down from
79.6 percent in 1998. TWA showed the biggest on-time improvement,
jumping from fifth to first, while American and USAirways fell to
the bottom tier.
</P>
<P>
   Delta improved its luggage handling rank despite a slight
increase in its rate of mishandled bags to 4.39 per 10,000
customers vs. 4.27 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers filed 1,916 complaints to the DOT against Delta,
giving it the lowest rate except for Southwest and Alaska. AirTran,
Delta's much smaller rival in Atlanta, was the subject of 267
complaints, but it is not ranked by rate because it is not
classified as a major carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaints about both Delta and AirTran were about
flight delays, cancellations or unspecified ``customer service''
issues.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,' starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). McGregor is a British
surveillance expert and Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he
falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this
ludicrous psycho-thriller. As McGregor's character, known only as
the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the
movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of
``Vertigo.'' But the film, by the director best known for ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' is so garish,
disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music
video posing as a movie (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction title and the Imax-size
screen on which it is shown, ``Fantasia/2000'' is more
backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to
the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and
the finale (set to Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite), in which a
cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating,
destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity
introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate
promotion. (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ryder has the
courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small,
introspective movie is nearly stolen by Jolie as a charismatic,
brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film
moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more
serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't
help that Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's P.J.
looking overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ISN'T SHE GREAT,' starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard
Channing, David Hyde Pierce and John Cleese. Directed by Andrew
Bergman (R, 90 minutes). In this bio-pic, Midler portrays the
author Jacqueline Susann, who took the lurid pulp genre to a new,
sweaty level. No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva
than Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic
self-absorption than anyone else. And Lane, who plays Irving
Mansfield, Susann's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark
plug: His voice shows up before he does. Yet in this adaptation of
the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly
hostility seems to be a facet of the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's
talent. But Rudnick and Bergman have so defanged ``Isn't She
Great'' that it's like watching a sketch from the old ``Carol
Burnett Show'' that has mildewed (Elvis Mitchell).

   `THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG,' directed by Aviva
Kempner (not rated, 90 minutes). This unabashed valentine to
baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and
some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930s and '40s
and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation
founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The '30s and '40s were
the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of
the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's
home run record and become the first man to win Most Valuable
Player Awards at two positions, first base and left field. In
blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome
Greenberg became a target of anti-Semites. But his stardom, his
innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him
a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is
faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with
meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A MAP OF THE WORLD,' starring Sigourney Weaver, David
Strathairn and Julianne Moore (R, 127 minutes). Jane Hamilton's
novel about a rural Wisconsin family besieged by misfortune after
Alice Goodwin (Weaver), a mother of two girls and a part-time
grade-school nurse, is accused of sexually abusing a student, is an
acutely wrenching domestic drama stripped of the usual
sugar-coating. Weaver's portrayal of a complicated,
not-always-likable but essentially decent woman under unbearable
stress is a revelation. The movie is an impressive filmmaking debut
by the New York theater director Scott Elliott, whose talent for
microscopic psychological realism translates smoothly onto the
screen (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `PLAY IT TO THE BONE,' starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio
Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124
minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Harrelson (with a
shaved head) and Banderas as fading middleweight boxers and best
friends summoned at the last minute to fight each other as the
opening act for a Las Vegas heavyweight bout. The formulaic road
movie follows them with their pal and mutual ex-girlfriend
(Davidovich) on their wisecracking way from Los Angeles to Las
Vegas, where they fight a brutal match. The dialogue has sass, and
the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the professional boxing world
is very knowing, but the relationships don't track (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a
fine character actress, while Blanchett makes the delirious most of
her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious
playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously
photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering
force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with
Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).

 &HT;    Former President Bush's planned speech raises some GOP eyebrows
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Democrats are amused as some of
Florida's top Republicans squabble over plans to allow former
President George Bush to address the state Legislature just five
days before the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's certainly a plus for George W., and after what
happened to him in New Hampshire he needs all the help he can
get,'' said Charles Whitehead, the Florida Democratic Party
chairman. ``If I were John McCain, I would think it was a little
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``political elitism,'' state Comptroller Robert
Milligan, who is state chairman for McCain's presidential campaign,
said the Arizona senator is a victim of ``power politics made worse
by its use against a member of the same party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who overwhelmingly defeated Texas Gov. Bush in the New
Hampshire primary Tuesday, has not been invited to speak to the
Legislature. The Florida primary is March 14 and Bush is to speak
on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no occasion for such a speech at this time other than
an effort to rub the former president's popularity in Florida off
on his son just before the primary election,'' said Milligan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Florida's Republican leadership is backing the Texas
governor. His brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is using his
formidable resources to help George W. Bush's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Making the effort here additionally daunting for McCain is the
support George W. Bush is getting from the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crucial time in our history and we have to do all we
can to make sure Republicans win this election,'' said Al Cardenas,
the state GOP chairman who, rather than remain neutral as has been
custom, has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker John Thrasher
</P>
<P>
   (R-Orange Park), who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire,
insists that the timing of the elder Bush's speech is largely
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, President Clinton and then-Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas
spoke to the Democratic-controlled legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Republican legislature, so I guess if they want
President Bush to come by, he can come by,'' said Sen. Tom Rossin,
the Democrat leader. ``I'm not sure it will really accomplish
anything.''

 &HT;    Georgia's 7th District race sparks $2 million
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leading Republican and Democrat candidates in the 7th
Congressional District race raised more than $2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Republican Bob Barr reported collecting $1,286,000 in
1999. He spent $572,000 and has $714,000 on hand, according to
Federal Election Commission reports.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta businessman Roger Kahn, Barr's likely Democrat opponent
in November, reported contributions of $750,000 with more than
$500,000 on hand. Thus far, Kahn has opposition in the Democratic
primary from former Polk County Commissioner Jim Williams, who got
45 percent of the vote as the Democratic nominee in 1998, and
Charles ``Chip'' Warren, a former Atlanta police officer who is
president of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.
</P>
<P>
   Although incumbency gives Barr a clear advantage, Kahn's
fund-raising appears to be enough to make a competitive race, said
Merle Black, Emory University political science professor. ``People
don't give that kind of money for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barr has represented his district in such a way as to make it
possible for him to be unseated. He has been very visible and very
involved in political causes. That is a style that unites a
hard-core conservative base but does little to enlarge that base,''
said Black. ``Someone like Barr will always be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia residents accounted for 60 percent of the itemized
contributions received by Barr, who aims to raise $2 million for
the campaign.

   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders
ended a summit meeting here Thursday in frustration, still bogged
down in disagreement over interim issues and far from bridging gaps
on the thorny final issues that stand between them and a permanent
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the meeting began, there seemed little chance that
the Israelis and the Palestinians would meet their written goal of
reaching a framework for a final status accord by Feb. 13. But the
two-and-a-half-hour meeting, reportedly tense, did not produce even
enough understanding for the two sides to announce a deferral of
the deadline, as had been expected, or any other plans for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the parties went backward and became mired in rehashing
an interim agreement that they signed in September. Specifically,
the Palestinians expressed anger that the Israelis had not
accommodated Palestinian requests to gain control of villages near
Jerusalem when the Israelis drew up the maps for their next
withdrawal from the West Bank, which was supposed to have proceeded
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the two sides did quietly acknowledge to each other
that the deadline would be broken, although no new date was set,
said a spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of mutual understanding that by Feb. 13 there
will be no detailed framework agreement,'' the spokesman, Gadi
Baltiansky, said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials declared a crisis in the negotiations,
saying their leader, Yasser Arafat, whom Barak walked to his car,
had left in anger. A news conference scheduled at the end of the
session was abruptly canceled. Arafat and his aides drove off
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were left to shrug and raise their eyebrows
and put a positive spin on a clearly disappointing meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there is no crisis,'' Barak's senior diplomatic and
security adviser, Danny Yatom, said as he denied reports that
Arafat had stormed out. ``There are some disputes between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, especially concerning the contents
of the land that we committed ourselves to hand over to the
Palestinians. But the meeting went as planned, and everybody was
patient enough to sit in the room to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barak and Arafat arrived, local photographers called out to
request a handshake. A good body's length away from each other,
they extended their arms and shook for the cameras. But it was
decidedly forced, just as the setting was both more formal and more
public than that of many of their previous unpublicized late-night
meetings in private houses or unmarked office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting Thursday, the two were accompanied by phalanxes
of advisers but spent a brief period face to face. Their encounter
ended while journalists were gathered in a conference room for the
news conference that never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, plans for the next negotiating round, scheduled for
Sunday, were not canceled. So despite the disappointments of the
day, the process is generally expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   What the parties labeled ``intensive negotiations'' on the
substantive issues of a permanent peace _ borders, the status of
Jerusalem, the future of the Jewish settlements and the Palestinian
refugees _ began last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. peace envoy, Dennis Ross, arrived Wednesday to assist
the effort. But a spat over what was to have been Israel's third
and final land transfer to the Palestinians under the interim
agreement of September has marred progress on the talks for a
permanent peace. As during the second Israeli land handover, the
Palestinians objected to the ``quality'' of the transfer, having
requested control of some Arab towns on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
They strongly objected to the process, which they think should be
more collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   And they protested Barak's reluctance to discuss yet another
Israeli redeployment, beyond the three mapped out in the September
accord, in the interim period. Barak contends that the status of
the remaining territory should be debated in the context of a final
pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real crisis is the crisis of trust, which is growing
larger,'' said Palestinian minister of Jerusalem affairs, Ziad Abu
Ziad. ``It seems that the Israeli government does not view the
peace process as a process that involves two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after Arafat had left, Foreign Minister
David Levy of Israel said he had no doubt that the matter of the
maps and the land transfer would be resolved. A similar dispute
over the second withdrawal, at the end of last year, was resolved
despite Palestinian predictions that Israel's behavior would be a
deal-breaker. But Palestinian officials were led to believe that
they would be more satisfied this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the interest of both parties to solve the problem,
and not to remain in an argument over the interim agreement,'' Levy
said. ``Because that which awaits us is the thing that counts and
is the work in which we have to invest all of our efforts. The
attempt to delay is simply not productive and will not be
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said they would ask Ross and the Americans
``to pressure Israel to implement the signed agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis prefer to solve issues bilaterally. Levy said that
the Americans ``enjoy the faith of both parties,'' but that the
Americans could not be substitutes for a real dialogue between the
parties.

 &HT;    Three legends reunite in booth
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For college basketball fans whose memories date to a time when
Ronald Reagan was president, the CBS coverage of Connecticut and
Michigan State on Saturday will be like a reunion of their favorite
band.
</P>
<P>
   After a playful suggestion that the return of Dick Enberg, Billy
Packer and Al McGuire as a three-man booth was akin to a Beatles
reunion, McGuire said, ``I don't think you can return. It was a
happening at the time, like the Amboy Dukes. But we won't try to
recapture anything. We'll just be ourselves in the year 2000, and
it will be three guys who leave their egos in their cars in the
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And if McGuire is to be taken at face value, this reunion will
also be part of his farewell tour to broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely my last year,'' McGuire said. ``I don't
want to have to start a third safety-deposit box.''
</P>
<P>
   However, McGuire, 71, has not told CBS formally that he is
quitting after this season, and, for the moment, the network does
not expect McGuire's ninth year at CBS to be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do Enberg and Packer. Instead, they spoke about looking
forward to their first game with McGuire since the 1981
championship between Indiana and North Carolina on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick and I worked together last week for the first time in 20
years, and it took us a half to figure out where we were,'' Packer
said. ``This is something I never expected to happen, and it's
rather incredible that our great friendship and relationship will
have a chance to get together at least for one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although two decades have passed since Enberg, Packer and
McGuire were a team, they still rank as one of the best three-man
booths in the history of sports television. Their last telecast
together was significant for another reason. President Reagan was
shot that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were stunned they didn't postpone the game,''
Enberg said. ``Our enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of the crowd were
drained away. There's not much I remember about that game....
</P>
<P>
   ``But Saturday's game between Connecticut and Michigan State is
still the thing, and we're not going to let a chance to take an
encore bow get in the way of the game. But you know there will
probably be some disagreement between Billy and Al in the first 10
minutes. Our reportage won't be set to soft violin music.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A weekend for star gazing
</P>
<P>
   Between the CBS coverage of the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and
ABC's hockey-football doubleheader Sunday, plenty of star power
will be on display. ``A lot of people who come here do not want to
watch the golfers,'' CBS golf analyst David Feherty said. ``They're
not here to see Tiger Woods; they're here to see Kevin Costner.''
Meanwhile, ABC will showcase hockey's best in the NHL All-Star Game
at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, followed by the NFL's best in the Pro Bowl at
5:30 p.m.... For further proof of the Kings' star power in the NBA,
their game against the Pacers at 8 tonight on TNT replaces the
Rockets and Timberwolves, and NBC will show the Kings and 76ers to
more of the country Sunday than it will the Spurs and Jazz.

GORE SEEKS CALIFORNIA WIN AS BRADLEY KNOCKOUT PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore is looking to delegate-rich
California to help him knock Bill Bradley out of the race, and he
has spent an enormous amount of time and energy here raising money
and cultivating support, particularly among minorities, organized
labor and women.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day Wednesday that began in New York and included
stops in Washington, D.C., and Columbus, Ohio, Gore arrived at the
Burbank Airport, where he was greeted by a about 400 supporters,
including comedian Jay Leno, and a few protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Then he conducted a 3-hour, 18 minute town hall-style meeting
with undecided voters, who were very different from those in Iowa
and New Hampshire _ not only more diverse but also more personal in
their probing of the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Are he and Tipper born-again Christians? (They are, Gore said).
Does he support marriages bewteen homosexuals? (He does not, but he
also opposes the Knight Amendment, a March 7 ballot inititiative
designed to invalidate gay marriages considered legal in any other
state).
</P>
<P>
   James Thomas, a 37-year-old minister, lectured Gore on the vice
president's support for welfare reform. He also told Gore, ``You
have mentioned slavery many times. Affirmative action is in no way
a remedy for slavery.'' He then called on Gore ``to not only
declare war on the environment, but to declare war on people who
continue to oppress people of color'' if Gore is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, ``I have it in my heart to do exactly that and
to lead to the kind of changes in the way people think and feel.''
He also defended his views on welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Thomas said he was still ``ambivalent'' about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Gore spoke to about 50 employees at Digital Domain, a
multimedia company in Venice, near Los Angeles, that does special
effects for movies. Tweaking his message somewhat, he focused on
education and the economy, and also sought to distinquish himself
from Bradley, talking about improving schools and repeating his
refrain about the former New Jersey Senator being a ``good man with
a bad plan'' on providing universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gore arrived in the renovated warehouse, a small sign
that said ``Nader 2000,'' referring to the consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, was removed from the wall. Afterward, Gore stopped at a
resturant to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to return to California next week. He also plans to
hold at least one debate with Bradley in the state, said Gore
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has attributed his win in the first caucus and primary
states to a series of such interminable town hall-style meetings,
ususally with undecided voters, where he stays until the last
audience member is left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said Gore's strategy for California and the 14 other
states that will hold primaries March 7 will obviously differ from
the tact taken in New Hampshire and Iowa, though he refused to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the national campaign has started,'' Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left Los Angeles for a campaign stop in Olympia, Wash.,
before returning to Washington, D.C., early Friday.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Cuando a Luiz Augusto Rocha lo nombraron jefe de la
oficina floridana de Odebrecht, el coloso brasileno de construccion
e ingenieria, no queria desperdiciar ni un minuto. Al llegar a
Miami, una de las primeras cosas que hizo fue conocer a los
politicos locales, acompanado por su predecesor, Luis Oswaldo
Leite, quien inicio el negocio de la compania en la Florida en 1991
y en ese momento regresaba a Brasil.
 &HT;    Una de las primeras visitas que hizo fue a la oficina de Natacha
Millan, comisionada del Condado de Miami-Dade. ``No habian hecho
una cita; simplemente llegaron sin anunciarse,'' dice Millan. ``Nos
reunimos unos 5 o 10 minutos, lo necesario para conocernos. Fue una
visita de cortesia.''
 &HT;    Esa clase de astucia politica, junto con la experiencia en las
licitaciones y una reputacion internacional de calidad, han dado a
Odebrecht una fuerte presencia en el sector de las obras publicas
del sur de la Florida. A principios de la decada de 1990, Odebrecht
era una entre mas de una decena de empresas extranjeras de
construccion que competian por contratos del sector publico para
modernizar calles y autopistas, sobre todo en el sur de la Florida.
La mayor parte de esas firmas se han marchado. Pero Odebrecht se ha
quedado y se ha distinguido de la competencia, tanto local como
internacional.
 &HT;    Hasta ahora, Odebrecht ha conseguido mas de US$400 millones en
contratos de obras publicas en el sur de la Florida. Alrededor de
las dos terceras partes de esa suma proviene de su participacion en
la remodelacion y expansion a largo plazo del Aeropuerto
Internacional de Miami. Odebrecht tambien ha firmado varios
contratos grandes para obras en autopistas y se asocia con Morse
Diesel Co., de Nueva York, en la construccion de la Arena de
American Airlines, que costara US$157 millones.
 &HT;    Odebrecht tambien ha completado varias obras de puentes y
carreteras en otras partes de la Florida, asi como en Alabama,
Carolina del Norte y Carolina del Sur. Hace unos anos, la compania
se expandio hacia la construccion comercial y hasta la fecha ha
realizado 17 obras en el Sureste.
 &HT;    Pero la Florida es el principal mercado de Odebrecht. El estado
le representa unos US$150 millones en ingresos anuales; en
California tiene ingresos de unos US$45 millones, segun Leite y
Rocha.
 &HT;    Odebrecht es un conglomerado que mueve US$5.000 millones al ano,
con mas de 18.000 empleados en 15 paises. Pero la compania ha
prosperado en la Florida haciendo de Odebrecht Contractors of
Florida Inc. una operacion local que realiza obras de calidad.
``Odebrecht tiene los conocimientos y los recursos para darse a
conocer y abrir puertas en Miami,'' dice William Delgado,
presidente de la poderosa Latin Builders Association, de Miami.
``Ademas, su trabajo paso de bueno a muy bueno.''
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de Odebrecht en la Florida dicen que su exito
esta en usar los recursos locales y descentralizar la autoridad.
``Nuestras sucursales tienen la potestad de desarrollarse con
recursos locales y con personal local,'' explica Rocha. ``Somos una
compania norteamericana en Estados Unidos, una compania peruana en
Peru, una compania ecuatoriana en Ecuador, y asi sucesivamente.''
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de la empresa decidieron integrarse plenamente en
cuanto llegaron a Miami en 1991. Delgado recuerda que uno de sus
objetivos era llamar la atencion. ``Inmediatamente se unieron a
nuestra organizacion. Estaban representados practicamente en todos
los eventos del sector a los que asisti a principios de los 90:
cenas, seminarios, de todo,'' relata.
 &HT;    Odebrecht consolido la base del exito futuro asociandose con
Church &AMP; Tower, una empresa de construccion de Miami con fuertes
lazos politicos. La firma estaba dirigida por Jorge Mas Canosa,
difunto lider del exilio cubano. ``En ese momento, Church &AMP; Tower
era una pequena compania que trataba de desarrollarse en la
construccion pesada,'' dice Leite. ``Conocian el mercado y tenian
capacidad administrativa. Un conocido nos presento a Mas Canosa y
desarrollamos una buena relacion.''
 &HT;    Unos meses despues dice Leite, Odebrecht se asocio con Church &AMP;
Tower para participar en la licitacion de una extension del sistema
de tren elevado del centro de Miami, el Metromover. Hicieron la
oferta mas baja y ganaron el contrato. Odebrecht era propietaria
del 80 por ciento de la empresa conjunta, valorada en US$27,8
millones. Un ano despues, las dos companias consiguieron un
contrato de US$22,4 millones para ampliar un basural.
 &HT;    Despues de conseguir el segundo proyecto, las dos empresas no se
asociaron mas. Church &AMP; Tower, que despues se vio involucrada en un
escandalo cuando se la acuso de cobrar excesivamente al gobierno
local por obras de pavimentacion, es una filial de MasTec, empresa
de Miami que se especializa en instalar sistemas telefonicos y de
television por cable en America Latina y Estados Unidos. ``Llegamos
a la conclusion de que estabamos en negocios distintos,'' dice
Leite. ``Ellos se dedicaban mas a las telecomunicaciones y nosotros
a la construccion pesada.''
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la relacion dejo a Odebrecht con conexiones
politicas duraderas. ``Mas Canosa me presento a mucha gente en
Miami, muchos todavia son amigos,'' relata Leite. Fernando Rojas,
portavoz de MasTec, se nego a hacer comentarios y dijo que la
relacion entre las dos companias era ``historia.''
 &HT;    Odebrecht tambien fortalece su reputacion mediante
contribuciones a obras beneficas y otras organizaciones. Por
ejemplo, Leite integro la junta de directores de la Sinfonica del
Nuevo Mundo y de la Camara de Comercio Brasilena-Americana.
 &HT;    Entonces llego el escandalo. En 1995, Odebrecht dono US$75.000 a
la Fundacion para el Futuro de la Florida (FFF), un grupo de
estudio sin fines de lucro. Fue la mayor donacion de FFF, fundada
por Jeb Bush, urbanista del sur de la Florida e hijo del ex
presidente George Bush, despues que Jeb perdio en las elecciones a
la gobernacion en 1994. Se postulo de nuevo en 1998 y gano.
 &HT;    La donacion llego a conocimiento publico durante la campana de
Bush en 1998. Odebrecht dijo en aquel momento que dio el dinero
como respaldo a la publicacion de ``Profiles in Character,'' un
libro de Bush publicado por la fundacion. ``Estabamos buscando un
proyecto que valiera la pena apoyar. Bush no estaba haciendo
campana cuando donamos el dinero. Pensamos que era una buena
inversion.''
 &HT;    En septiembre de 1998, para demostrar que no estaba inclinada
hacia ningun partido, Odebrecht dono US$5.000 al Partido Democrata
de la Florida, que pagaba gran parte de los gastos del rival de
Bush, Buddy MacKay.
 &HT;    Odebrecht no es ajena a la controversia politica. A principios
de la decada de los '90s, el gobierno brasileno investigo
acusaciones de que Odebrecht y otras constructoras habian sobornado
a funcionarios para recibir contratos de obras publicas. Odebrecht
nego haber cometido nada indebido y nunca fue acusada.
 &HT;    En Miami, varios politicos dicen que Odebrecht no hace mucho
cabildeo en comparacion con otras firmas y tiene un cabildero a
tiempo completo. Algunas empresas de construccion tienen dos o
tres, senala Millan, que tiene un papel clave en las decisiones de
la comision de Miami-Dade sobre el Aeropuerto Internacional de
Miami.
 &HT;    ``Odebrecht no tiene tanta presencia en ese sentido como otras
companias,'' afirma Millan. ``Me informan de sus propuestas con
mucha antelacion y dan mas informacion si la pido. Nunca me
presionan cuando voy a tomar una decision oficial.'' Es posible que
Odebrecht no haga un gran trabajo politico pero no hay duda de que
ha sido muy eficaz a la hora de conseguir contratos de obras
publicas en la Florida.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ When Luiz Augusto Rocha was named head of the Florida
office of Odebrecht, the Brazilian engineering and construction
giant, he didn't waste any time. Upon arriving in Miami, one of the
first things he did was make the rounds among local politicians,
accompanied by his predecessor, Luis Oswaldo Leite, who started the
company's Florida business in 1991 and was then headed back to
Brazil.
 &HT;    One of their first stops was the office of Miami-Dade County
commissioner Natacha Millan. ``They didn't have an appointment;
they just dropped by,'' she says. ``We met for five or 10 minutes,
just to meet the new guy. It was a courtesy call.''
 &HT;    That kind of political finesse, along with bidding expertise and
an international reputation for quality, has helped Odebrecht
become a dominant player in South Florida public works
construction.
 &HT;    During the early 1990s, Odebrecht was one of more than a dozen
foreign construction firms competing for public contracts to
modernize roads and highways, primarily in South Florida. Most of
them have since left. But Odebrecht has stayed, setting itself
apart from competitors, both foreign and domestic.
 &HT;    So far, Odebrecht has landed more than US$400 million in South
Florida public works projects. About two-thirds of that amount
stems from the company's prominent role in Miami International
Airport's $4 billion long-term expansion and remodeling effort.
Odebrecht has also clinched several large highway projects and is
partnering with New York-based Morse Diesel Co. to build the $157
million American Airlines Arena.
 &HT;    That's not all. Odebrecht has also completed several bridge and
highway projects in other parts of Florida, as well as in Alabama,
South Carolina and North Carolina. A few years ago, the company
expanded into commercial construction and has completed 17 projects
throughout the Southeast to date.
 &HT;    Still, Florida remains Odebrecht's primary market. It accounts
for about $150 million in annual revenues, compared with
approximately $45 million from California, according to Leite and
Rocha. That's why Odebrecht consolidated its U.S. operations in
Miami, shutting down its California office and relocating Rocha and
six other employees to Florida. ``The significance of merging the
offices is to focus on Florida, because that's where the money is
in the U.S.,'' Rocha says.
 &HT;    Odebrecht is a $5 billion-a-year conglomerate with more than
18,000 employees in 15 countries. However, the company has
prospered in Florida by making Odebrecht Contractors of Florida
Inc. a local operation. ``Odebrecht had the know-how and resources
to get their name known and open doors in Miami,'' says William
Delgado, president of the locally powerful Latin Builders
Association. ``Plus, their work was good to very good.''
 &HT;    Odebrecht's Florida executives say their success stems from a
company philosophy of local involvement and decentralized
authority. ``Our branches have full power to develop our local
company with local resources and local people,'' Rocha says. ``We
are an American company in the U.S., a Peruvian company in Peru, an
Ecuadorian company in Ecuador, and so on.''
 &HT;    Company executives set their sights on becoming a part of the
South Florida landscape immediately after setting up shop in Miami
in 1991. They purposely cut a high profile, Delgado recalls. ``They
immediately joined our organization. They had a presence at almost
every industry-related event I attended in the early '90s _
dinners, workshops _ whatever,'' he says.
 &HT;    Odebrecht built a strong foundation for future success by
teaming up with Church &AMP; Tower, a Miami construction firm with
strong political ties. The company was run by Jorge Mas Canosa, the
late Cuban exile leader. ``At the time, Church &AMP; Tower was a small
company looking to develop itself in heavy construction,'' Leite
says. ``They knew the local market and we had managerial
capabilities. We were introduced to Mas Canosa by a common
acquaintance, and we developed a good relationship.''
 &HT;    Just months after they met, Leite says, Odebrecht teamed with
Church &AMP; Tower to bid on an extension for Miami's elevated transit
system, the Metromover. They submitted the lowest bi and won the
contract. Odebrecht owned 80 percent of the joint venture, valued
at $27.8 million. A year later, the two companies won a $22.4
million contract to expand the South Dade Landfill.
 &HT;    After landing the second project, the two companies stopped
partnering together. Church &AMP; Tower _ which has subsequently become
embroiled in a major road-paving scandal for allegedly overbilling
local government _ is a subsidiary of Miami-based MasTec, which
specializes in building and installing cable TV and telephone
systems in Latin America and the United States. ``We came to the
conclusion that we were in different businesses,'' Leite says.
``They were more into telecommunications, and we were into heavy
construction.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the relationship left Odebrecht with lasting
political connections. ``Mas Canosa introduced me to many people in
the community, and a lot of them are still my friends,'' Leite
says. MasTec spokesman Fernando Rojas declined to comment, calling
the relationship between the two companies ``history.''
 &HT;    Odebrecht also builds goodwill through contributions of money
and staff time to high-profile charities and other organizations.
For example, Leite joined the board of directors of the New World
Symphony and the BrazilianAmerican Chamber of Commerce.
 &HT;    Then came the whopper. In 1995, Odebrecht contributed $75,000 to
the Foundation for Florida's Future (FFF), a non-profit think-tank.
It was the FFF's largest donation. The organization was established
by Jeb Bush, a South Florida developer and son of former President
George Bush, after Jeb lost a 1994 run for governor. He ran again
in 1998 and won. Democrats claimed that the FFF was a clever way
for Bush to run a shadow _ but legal _ campaign by keeping his name
in the public eye between elections.
 &HT;    The donation became public during Bush's 1998 campaign.
Odebrecht said at the time that it gave the money to help support
the foundation's publication of Bush's book ``Profiles in
Character.'' Says Leite: ``We were looking for a worthwhile project
to support. Bush was not in a campaign when we made the
contribution. We thought it was a good investment.''
 &HT;    Just to show that it was non-partisan, in September 1998
Odebrecht also contributed $5,000 to the state Democratic Party,
which was paying many of the expenses for Bush's opponent, Buddy
MacKay.
 &HT;    Odebrecht is no stranger to political controversy. In the early
1990s, the Brazilian government investigated allegations that
Odebrecht and other construction companies had bribed officials in
return for public contracts. Odebrecht denied any foul play, and
the company was never indicted.
 &HT;    In Miami, politicians describe Odebrecht's lobbying efforts as
relatively understated. The company has one full-time lobbyist.
Some construction firms have two or three, notes Millan, a key
player in the Miami-Dade commission's decisions on matters
involving Miami International Airport.
 &HT;    ``Odebrecht is low key compared to what I see from some other
companies,'' Millan says. ``They brief me on their proposals well
in advance and provide more information if I request it. They never
pressure me just before I sit on the dais to make a decision.''
Odebrecht may be low key, but somehow, it certainly has been
effective at grabbing public-works projects in Florida.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a bizarre episode that underscores the limits the
Kremlin has imposed on reporting from Chechnya, Russian authorities
Thursday handed over a Radio Liberty correspondent to Chechen
rebels in exchange for two captured Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities had detained Andrei Babitsky, a Russian
citizen who is a correspondent for the U.S.-funded Radio Liberty,
on Jan. 16 as he was leaving the rebel-controlled section of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He was later charged with ``membership
in an illegal, armed group.''
</P>
<P>
   The detention of Babitsky seems to reflect a shrinking tolerance
for a free press since Vladimir Putin became acting president.
</P>
<P>
   At first it appeared that the Kremlin had grudgingly yielded to
appeals by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a variety of
press freedom organizations to set Babitsky free. Russian officials
suggested that he would be returned to Moscow and released on his
own recognizance pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Russian government's new
spokesman for the war in Chechnya, announced that Babitsky had been
traded to the Chechens Thursday afternoon at the crossroads between
the towns of Argun and Shali.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unexpected development,'' Yastrzhembsky conceded.
Then he read two statements, asserting that they were from Babitsky
and Saied Usykhodzhiyev, whom the spokesman identified as a Chechen
field commander. The statement from Babitsky, dated Jan. 31, said
he had agreed to the swap to secure the release of the Russian
soldiers. The statement from the field commander said he had
proposed the swap and praised Babitsky as a ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister of the breakaway Chechen
republic, said that no one in the Chechen government had heard of
the commander.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said a videotape had been made of the exchange and
would be made available. Thursday night, however, Babitsky's
whereabouts were unknown and some of his friends said they feared
for his safety. Radio Liberty executives deplored the Russian
government's handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was held for more than two weeks with no access to a
telephone or access to legal representation,'' said Jeff Trimble,
Radio Liberty's director of broadcasting. ``That raises very
serious concern about the Russian government's attitude toward the
press. And the announcement that he has been exchanged for Russian
prisoners has made a bad situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, 36, was one of a handful of reporters who ventured
into the rebel-controlled areas of Grozny. His reports irritated
Russian authorities, who have sharply restricted access to the
battlefield and sought to discourage reporting from the Chechen
side.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen on Jan. 16 on the northern outskirts of Grozny in
the custody of Russian authorities. Nonetheless, Yastrzhembsky
insisted last week that Moscow had no knowledge of his whereabouts.
Radio Liberty was officially informed on Monday that Babitsky had
been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was a human rights activist during the Soviet era and
worked for the magazine Glasnost. He has worked since 1989 for
Radio Liberty, which was established by the United States during
the Cold War to broadcast news to the Soviet Union and East
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   When Chechen rebels seized a hospital in the southern Russian
town of Budyonnovsk during the first war in Chechnya, Babitsky
agreed to take the place of some of the rebels' hostages, a deed
that suggested to some of his associates that he might in the
current case have agreed to the exchange for Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, feared that the decision was made under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Some challenged the Russian account of the exchange. Babitsky's
wife, Lyudmila, who has not been able to talk to her husband for 19
days, said the Kremlin was trying to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who were the people they gave Andrei to?'' she said in an
interview. ``Nobody knowns a Chechen field commander by this
name.''

POLICE DETAIL SERIES OF EVENTS IN FATAL SHOOTING

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ ``Oh, that's one of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, a Providence police officer leaning over a
bleeding body last Friday made the shocking discovery that
patrolman Cornel Young Jr. had been mortally wounded by friendly
fire.
</P>
<P>
   That tragic revelation, publicly detailed Thursday for the first
time, was the end of a lightning-quick series of ugly events
outside Fidas Restaurant _ and the beginning of what could be a
prolonged period of racial friction in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Young, dressed in civilian clothes, did not identify
himself as a police officer and did not respond to several shouted
commands to drop his .40-caliber Beretta pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty and wearing casual clothes and a baseball cap over a
stocking cap, Young had rushed outside the restaurant to help his
fellow officers as they confronted an armed man at the center of a
late-night fracas.
</P>
<P>
   Many black leaders are questioning whether a snap act of racial
profiling led to the death of Young, the son of the highest-ranking
black officer in the Providence Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a report in the Providence Jounal-Bulletin,
some members of the department now believe the decision of two
officers to fire six bullets at Young appears to have been
justified.
</P>
<P>
   After he had closed to within 5 feet of the armed man _ who had
just dropped his gun on police orders _ Young was struck by three
bullets to the head, chest and stomach, according to sources quoted
in the report. Police said that the man who released his weapon,
Aldrin Diaz of Providence, believed Young was from the group with
whom he had been fighting and that Young intended to shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said that, in the chaos outside the restaurant, a
woman from the rival group believed Young to be her boyfriend. She
rushed to Young, but was pulled away by police an instant before
they made their shocking identification, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation told the newspaper that
police Officer Carlos A. Saraiva yelled at least twice for Young to
drop his weapon as he walked toward Diaz. Rookie police Officer
Michael Solitro 3d is also reported by those sources as yelling the
command.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Horton, a longtime friend of Young's who had been with
the officer earlier in the evening, told The Boston Globe Thursday
he is suspicious about the police version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's accurate,'' Horton said. ``It doesn't sound
like something he'd do. He'd identify himself as soon as the
uniformed police came on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton had been with Young at Gerardo's Alternative Nightclub,
where he said they had seen a dance-floor fight that he believes
involved a female member of Diaz's group. That fight, between two
women, might have been the genesis for the later brawl at Fidas
Restaurant, Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   Young rose to help break up the nightclub fight, Horton said,
but security separated the women before he was needed. Ironically,
Horton said, Diaz was also at the nightclub, and at one point stood
only a few feet from Young.
</P>
<P>
   Horton said he made plans to meet Young later at the restaurant,
where the officer's brief stop for a takeout steak-club sandwich
spun tragically out of control.

EVANS NOT EASY TO LIKE, IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``His general note is lyrical understanding of the
street, trained observation of it, special feeling for patina, eye
for revealing detail, over all of which is thrown a poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Walker Evans, writing in 1931 about Atget. Later,
lecturing in 1964 about Atget and also about Mathew Brady, another
hero, he projected a group of the penny picture postcards he had
collected since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine anything more?'' he asked his audience about
his anonymous little hand-colored images of small-town main streets
and trolley cars. ``A conglomeration of hideous things that come
together by casting a spell of _ I can't call it beauty, but of a
certain kind of silent poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice, poetry. That was what Evans was after in his own
photographs, a poetry that you couldn't call beauty, not
conventional beauty anyway, an art inspired by vernacular subjects
and aspiring to the natural dignity of the street. To the end of
his life (he died in 1975, at 72), Evans had this goal, which in
his case became a distinctly American project.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of him during his last years make him out to be an
ironic, oblique conversationalist, funny, insecure, vulnerable,
weakened. His best work was years behind him. He had trouble
understanding why people were no longer interested in what he was
doing, but he had been out of the spotlight for a long time. Some
people thought he was already dead when he had his last
retrospective in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The list of people he couldn't abide or about whom he made
nasty, unbecoming cracks is well known. About Ralph Steiner, the
photographer who generously offered to teach him photography, Evans
commented, ``He is a bitter little Jew, intelligent, whose
limitations are skillfully blurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans despised Victorian proprieties, which he associated with
his parents. He hated all do-gooders and ideologues, whether they
were limousine liberals or far-right-wingers, and he especially
disliked ``artistes.'' ``Too much exposure to art is not very good
for an artist,'' he told his students. He couldn't stand the idea
that he might be linked with somebody like Alfred Stieglitz, who
represented what might be called official bohemianism, which to him
was as bad as the old academy.
</P>
<P>
   As Douglas Eklund puts it in the catalog for the outstanding new
Evans retrospective at the Metropolitan, ``In all of those circles
Evans the man moved quite comfortably but with a residue of
free-floating negativity; the uniquely subdued, dispassionate tone
(and some might argue the chilling effect) of his photographs came
from this sustained and critical refusal to join.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met's survey, organized by Jeff L. Rosenheim, a curator in
the museum's photography department, sweeps skillfully through six
decades of Evans' career, with 175 vintage photographs and other
objects and documents. The stress on vintage photographs means that
there's a patina to his early work, now 70 or so years old, which
is an interesting counterpoint to the astringency.
</P>
<P>
   The documents and objects come from Evans' archives, which the
Met owns. They include ``Pictures of the Time,'' a rarity of sorts:
a splenetic, witty scrapbook of clippings from newspapers and
magazines that Evans compiled with the writer James Agee. It
consisted of what they hated about commercial photography and
photojournalism, like celebrity portraits and soft-core
bathing-beauty advertisements, but also what they liked, like crime
scene photos and ethnographic documents: all straight,
unpretentious pictures. You see clearly what Evans became when you
look at what he did and didn't admire.
</P>
<P>
   There are also copies of Fortune magazine, where he was a
longtime editor, with Evans' photo spreads in them, a slide show of
his great color pictures of railroad cars, which he did for
Fortune, and postcards and old road signs.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Evans was fascinated by lettered signs, and
he emphasized the obvious connection between language and
photography: they were two surrogates of reality, words and
pictures each being meaningful but incomplete and often misleading
by themselves. Signs, like photographs, were to him specifically a
form of poetry, and his photographs of isolated words or letters
read as a kind of abstract language.
</P>
<P>
   He collected road signs, even pilfered them: he would drive
around rural Connecticut with students who would unscrew the signs
he liked most when the coast was clear.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first complete retrospective of Evans. The 1971
overview, at the Museum of Modern Art, came before he worked with
the Polaroid SX-70, with which he took his last photographs. Those
are minor pictures, mostly, but intriguing. A mass-market gadget
given to him and a few other prominent photographers by Polaroid to
help publicize its product, the SX-70 gave Evans a new lease on
life.
</P>
<P>
   It spit out palm-size glossy images in saturated colors. It was
for casual snapshot portraits. Evans had trouble wielding bigger
cameras by then. Now he could work again, and no doubt he relished
working with a tool as mundane and populist as the SX-70. It
involved photography at its most basic level: point and shoot. He
had always tried to show what was distinguished in what other
people overlooked, and now he was making art, or at least trying
to, with a tool that sophisticated photographers generally wouldn't
take notice of.
</P>
<P>
   He took 2,600 pictures with the new camera, lots of fish-eye
close-ups of friends, and especially of young women he was trying
to impress, but also tightly cropped abstract vignettes that
reprise basic themes from the 1920s and '30s, now in the SX-70's
garish colors, which he clearly embraced. The late street-sign
pictures are derivative and unremarkable. But one Polaroid recalls
his best work: a junked pink Ford in the weeds, the grill a toothy
smile. Typical of Evans, the car is a ready-made American beauty.
</P>
<P>
   We see basically what was already clear before this exhibition:
that American documentary photography is synonymous with Evans. It
is built on his belligerent independence (this was his most truly
American trait), his elevation of the everyday, his open eye, his
mordant concentration and deliberate organization, his slow,
razor-sharp, deadpan gaze.

 &HT;    MCCAIN RAISES FUNDS IN INTERNET TIME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is using the power of the Internet
to get a new kind of ``bounce'' from his victory this week in New
Hampshire's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has just changed politics,'' said Max Fose, the
campaign's on-line manager.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, donors had pledged more than $1 million on
McCain's Internet site, less than two days after the New Hampshire
victory, a campaign spokesman said. All in all, McCain has so far
raised $2.5 million on line.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid influx lets the campaign immediately commit new
resources to its battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, rather
than waiting for checks to arrive and clear through traditional
pre-Internet fund-raising methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain campaign officials were able to
immediately cite the contributions as evidence of their candidate's
growing momentum in the Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when presidential campaigns were just beginning
to use the Internet and far fewer voters were on line, a winning
campaign would not have been able to exploit its new contributions
and favorable publicity so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain calls the Internet 'the great equalizer,''' Fose
told FreedomChannel.com, a neutral Web site that covers this year's
political contests. ``With over half a million dollars raised
within 24 hours without doing an event, we've just proved we can be
competitive in South Carolina financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Fose reported that the average online contribution was $105.
Nearly 40 percent of the donors had never given before to a
political campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the McCain campaign also plans to combine the
old and the new by sending e-mail to online supporters asking them
to telephone 10 people on McCain's behalf. This technique worked
well in New Hampshire; the campaign e-mail roster has risen
steadily and now numbers more than 75,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to actively try to expand our e-mail list in South
Carolina,'' Fose said. ``It's the best way to keep people involved
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And next Thursday, the Arizona senator plans to hold an online
fund-raiser that will be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors who donate $100 or more by punching in their credit
card numbers will be able to pose their questions and comments to
McCain via e-mail and get a direct response on their computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put a camera in front of John McCain, and he'll
give a speech (on line) about what's happened and where the
campaign is going,'' Fose said.

 NEW YORK: deadpan gaze. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was also something particularly American about him: his
lean, laconic scrutiny of the world. His pictures are called
elegies, but they're elegies devoid of nostalgia. They are
difficult to like at first, they're so austere. Gradually one can
be moved by them because their construction _ often head on,
seemingly uncomplicated, sometimes as if the images are not really
even composed _ comes across as plain, eternal truth. Evans
photographed disappearing national icons, like old Model Ts and
gingerbread houses, but no matter what his subject was, his
pictures always connoted the world out of time. Not just time
stopped, which is the condition imposed by all photographs, but
objects held in a kind of supreme suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Disorder is suddenly made to seem like order, the timeworn and
commonplace looks extraordinary, and everything briefly snaps into
focus. Call it a natural state of grace, which gives inherent
dignity to all the ephemeral subjects Evans shot.
</P>
<P>
   You see his elegance of vision in his famous pictures of
sharecroppers' and tenant farmers' cabins in Alabama for ``Let Us
Now Praise Famous Men.'' These may be even better than his
portraits of the Burroughs and Tingle families. The portraits are
ingrained in the American psyche basically because Evans, in a
photographic style as spare as James Agee's writing was the
opposite, denied us what we expected: he short-circuited pity for
those people by cutting out the charm and anecdote. We stare
level-eyed, and as if without any distance from his subjects, who
gaze _ squint really _ at us as if demanding to know who are we to
look at them. Lionel Trilling, observing the portrait of Allie Mae
Burroughs, put it this way: she ``simply refuses to be an object of
your `social consciousness,''' he wrote. ``She refuses to be an
object at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cabin interiors may be closer to the core of Evans'
achievement, because in essence he was always a still-life
photographer, even when he was photographing street scenes or
people. Still life implies an art of inanimate objects, of objects
made into archetypes. Evans constantly implied that the things and
people in his pictures had symbolic roles. They never seemed to
exist in the here and now, just through Evans' lens.
</P>
<P>
   So the few spare objects that the Burroughs family possessed _
table, towel, jug, bowl, kerosene lamp _ as in a Vermeer, are each
given a separate weight, purity and value. Together they
nonetheless look isolated and self-contained. No doubt this quality
was an expression of Evans' own feeling of separateness.
</P>
<P>
   His history is familiar: born in St. Louis to an advertising
executive and a housewife; boarding school in the East; rebellious
adolescence; Williams College briefly; literary aspirations; Paris
in the mid-1920s, too shy to meet Joyce; makes photographs in the
'20s in an abstract, Cubist-inspired mode; documents the South in
the '30s for the Resettlement Administration of the Department of
Agriculture, then with Agee; ``American Photographs'' show at the
Museum of Modern Art in 1938 establishes his early fame.
</P>
<P>
   It can be useful to read Evans, not just see his pictures. As a
writer he was lean and fastidious. The second edition of ``Let Us
Now Praise Famous Men'' has just been republished with his brief
memoir of Agee. Evans managed in prose something of what he
achieved in his pictures: concision, clarity, no pretense, dry wit.
Critics and historians, starting with Lincoln Kirstein in the essay
he wrote 62 years ago for ``American Photographs,'' have stressed
Evans' literary connections for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's writing showed him the virtues of economy. Cummings
showed him how to make fun of stuffy social conventions and vapid
consumerism. Eliot showed how to express emotion in a chilly,
oblique style, which came naturally to Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a modern visual grammar of forms that, in picture
after picture, resists easy absorption. They take time to sink in.
The more we look at an Evans photograph, the more his language
elaborates itself through essential details: the sliver of light
through the shutters of the plantation house in Louisiana; the
lovers at Coney Island whose forms echo the column and tower behind
them; the light reflected above the man in the subway, who is
absorbed in thought, his face in shadow; the menu of the sandwich
shop that we read over the shoulder of the cook and his pal; the
three men outside the barber shop in Vicksburg, Miss.,
serendipitously posed.
</P>
<P>
   It is curious that such a prickly man could have made such
moving, ultimately optimistic pictures. But maybe that's why
they're moving, because sentiment is checked by dispassion. The
world is a beautiful place, Evans keeps telling us _ often despite
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his best-known photographs, of rain-slicked Main
Street in Saratoga Springs, the street's slow arc is picked out, as
if in black outlines, by parallel rows of identical parked cars.
The geometry of the scene is neatly complicated by a scrim of Dutch
elms in silhouette. America is freshly born. Everything is
complete. Nothing is hackneyed or maudlin, just straight. Typical
Evans.

 &HT;    MCCAIN RAISES FUNDS IN INTERNET TIME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is using the power of the Internet
to get a new kind of ``bounce'' from his victory this week in New
Hampshire's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has just changed politics,'' said Max Fose, the
campaign's on-line manager.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, donors had pledged more than $1 million on
McCain's Internet site, less than two days after the New Hampshire
victory, a campaign spokesman said. All in all, McCain has so far
raised $2.5 million on line.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid influx lets the campaign immediately commit new
resources to its battle with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, rather
than waiting for checks to arrive and clear through traditional
pre-Internet fund-raising methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain campaign officials were able to
immediately cite the contributions as evidence of their candidate's
growing momentum in the Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when presidential campaigns were just beginning
to use the Internet and far fewer voters were on line, a winning
campaign would not have been able to exploit its new contributions
and favorable publicity so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain calls the Internet 'the great equalizer,''' Fose
told FreedomChannel.com, a neutral Web site that covers this year's
political contests. ``With over half a million dollars raised
within 24 hours without doing an event, we've just proved we can be
competitive in South Carolina financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Fose reported that the average online contribution was $105.
Nearly 40 percent of the donors had never given before to a
political campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the McCain campaign also plans to combine the
old and the new by sending e-mail to online supporters asking them
to telephone 10 people on McCain's behalf. This technique worked
well in New Hampshire; the campaign e-mail roster has risen
steadily and now numbers more than 75,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to actively try to expand our e-mail list in South
Carolina,'' Fose said. ``It's the best way to keep people involved
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And next Thursday, the Arizona senator plans to hold an online
fund-raiser that will be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors who donate $100 or more by punching in their credit
card numbers will be able to pose their questions and comments to
McCain via e-mail and get a direct response on their computer
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put a camera in front of John McCain, and he'll
give a speech (on line) about what's happened and where the
campaign is going,'' Fose said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although human beings depend on the land for life
itself, European painters did not put landscape at the center of
the program for many centuries. The land as artists saw it was
mainly background or the site of seasonal chores and pleasures. Not
until the 16th century, when Northern European painters inserted
small holy figures into enormous wildernesses, did landscape even
begin to become the real subject of painting.
</P>
<P>
   After that the land played various roles in art: as a setting
for morally edifying episodes, a symbol of order or of the awe and
terror inherent in nature, a sign of the immanence of the deity,
evidence of human ability to triumph over nature, even a relatively
simple document of the world's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the land was an almost infinitely malleable theme. But only
in the last third of the 20th century did the entire Earth become a
major subject: the way that human beings were treating it and its
current condition. Photographers were the chief exponents of the
new theme of the state of Earth itself, which they could only
represent piecemeal, with images of specific sites. They tended to
lament, sometimes adding accusations when humans treated the planet
particularly badly.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ParkeHarrison, 12 of whose large photographs are on view
at Bonni Benrubi Gallery in a show called ``Robert ParkeHarrison:
Earth Elegies,'' takes a different tack. He comes down on the side
of lamentation but expresses it with an unusual combination of
poetic license, laboriously constructed props and a wry and
melancholy, vaguely allusive sense of myth.
</P>
<P>
   He appears in every picture, in a black suit and white shirt
with no tie, a kind of Everyman or a minor employee of the
universe, patiently, dutifully doing a job that's too big for him.
That job is essentially to take care of a devastated Earth with
inadequate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He works or performs obscure rituals in large and empty
landscapes beneath gray skies. There appears to be no one home on
Earth but the black-suited fellow, making his rounds on a schedule
devised by Samuel Beckett. Perhaps nuclear meltdown has occurred,
though you might expect rage and desperation then, if your mind has
been honed on films like ``Mad Max'' and ``Blade Runner.'' More
likely clear-cutting, strip mining and global warming have done in
this land. The man in the photographs is tender and sad and
protective.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been pushed back into some vaguely 19th-century time
zone. The photographs are printed from paper negatives, a technique
that echoes photography's beginnings. Varnished and mounted on
large wooden blocks, they have been made in several stages,
frequently with more than one negative and with some elements
discreetly painted in and any visible seams painted out.
</P>
<P>
   The skies (usually canvas backdrops) are dappled, and they
darken just a bit around the upper edges in a rough arc as in many
early 19th-century photographs. The overall tone is the pale, warm
and lovely, brownish gray of early paper prints, with the extra
gloss of varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Everyman has even slipped into an actual 19th-century photograph
of the land as a caretaker. In ``Mending the Earth,'' he kneels in
a rephotograph of a picture that Timothy O'Sullivan took back in
1867: a fissure vent in Steamboat Springs, Nev., one long,
irregular gash in the ground where steam leaks out from the bowels
of the Earth. O'Sullivan recorded startling aspects of the Western
landscape and its stupendous, even frightening natural wonders for
a geological expedition. Today the caretaker considers this
particular awesome rift evidence of damage to the Earth's crust.
With a needle nearly as large as himself, he is sewing the cleft
together.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere he attends to similarly vast and improbable tasks with
equally low-tech equipment. Carrying a ladder and a backpack with a
bedraggled mop and a rough branch converted to a scouring
implement, he considers how to clean a dirty cloud. In
``Oppenheimer's Garden'' he kneels on a ladder holding what looks
like a huge sieve made of bent twigs to catch strange pods floating
down from the sky on parachutes. Or he stands on a dead tree in a
swamp of stumps, serenading the leaden heavens with a stringed
instrument patched together from a rough box and a violin neck.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For some years photographers have been issuing warnings about
the toll being exacted on Earth. After all, photographs from space
were crucial to the establishment of Earth as a possible subject,
so it seems only fitting for photographers to follow up. In 1968,
when communications were becoming increasingly international, the
pictures of Earth taken from Apollo 8 were broadcast live around
the world, a striking visual index of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound photographers generally look at some piece of the
globe directly as best they can while standing on it, though some
take to the air in planes in distant imitation of space flight.
They have photographed deforestation and land abuse, pollution,
overdevelopment, oil spills, dying coral, military damage, nuclear
threats: all the ills that beset the planet except perhaps the hole
in the ozone layer. What the ultimate results will be, what will
remain after the end of it all, is pretty hard to photograph.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons the world's epilogue has been mainly the
province of literature and film, though occasionally photographers
try their hands at such fictions, too, as Patrick Nagatani did in
maniacally cartoonish fantasies about nuclear destruction.
Photography just isn't very good at registering what has not
happened yet; and besides, as the saying goes, prediction is
difficult, especially about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The whole notion of a secular apocalypse is an idea of the
future that necessarily includes a return to the past. With so much
destroyed, humans would be forced out of the era of high
technology, since precisely that technology would have unraveled
the skein of competence until only the lowest technology was left.
ParkeHarrison has a penchant for implausible low tech; in his
earlier work he invented all manner of odd and primitive machines
for breathing, flying and making rain.
</P>
<P>
   A few other photographers have taken the trouble to build
handmade mechanisms that do not, cannot work, though generally that
has been the territory of sculptors like Jean Tinguely, whose most
famous machine was programmed to destroy itself. The photographer
Robert Cumming staged gimcrack scientific experiments with devices
expressly designed not to work but to make jokes and raise
questions about perception and photography. Laurent Millet made
wind traps and coastal machines of no apparent use, modeled on
18th-century illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ParkeHarrison not only builds his extravagant out-of-date
machines and props by hand _ a handmade model of an IBM Selectric's
typeface ball is approximately one and a half times his height _
but he also painstakingly puts scenes together from various
negatives and paint when a computer would surely do it faster.
Either he does not have a computer, or he is a kind of heroic
Luddite, employing labor-intensive low technology before the
world's collapse has made it essential.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is one man's private way of saying that neither
pollution, global warming nor digitalization can entirely
extinguish the hands-on experience and the human desire to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert ParkeHarrison: Earth Elegies'' is at the Bonni Benrubi
Gallery, 52 E. 76th St., (212) 517-3766, through March 4.

<P>
   SUTTON, England _ Shoppers are not greeted by pleasant folks
wearing yellow happy face pins, but the spirit of Sam Walton
abides.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Asda superstore in this leafy London suburb, the
familiar philosophy of the late Wal-Mart founder is etched _
literally _ in stone: ``Permanently Low Prices Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple, yet potent ethos that changed America now is working
its way through Britain _ and is poised to sweep the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart purchased Asda,
Britain's No. 3 grocery story chain for $10.8 billion. The stage
was set for a retail revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has been warmly welcomed by British shoppers, who pay
up to 40 percent more at the market than their European and
American counterparts. A 1997 survey found that Britons paid US$138
for a shopping cart of groceries that would cost about $96 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are all a bit weary of these truly horrible
prices,'' said Fiona Brindle, a housewife who drove eight miles
from the town of Bookham here, to Sutton to save on her weekly
grocery bill. ``We all know what people pay in America for things.
I've been to a Wal-Mart in Florida, so I know how it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Wal-Mart took control, prices at Asda's 229
stores plummeted. A 2-litre bottle of Coca-Cola dropped from the
equivalent of US$2.10 to US$1.06. A bottle of Pantene shampoo
dropped from US$3.28 to US$2.05. The company says it is slashing
its prices nearly US$170 million to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company dispatched 250 store managers to the
United States to meet with their counterparts and to be schooled in
the American model of customer service - an alien concept to many
British store clerks who often seem to loathe customers.
</P>
<P>
   This all sends shivers down the spine of traditional British
retailers, who long have enjoyed high profit margins and only
modest competition. When the Wal-Mart deal was announced last
summer, Tesco, the country's No. 1 grocery chain, immediately
slashed prices and launched its own internet marketing service.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hyman, managing director of Verdict, the retail
analysts, said the American retailer's arrival on the British
shopping scene already has changed the landscape. ``It has raised
the ante,'' Hyman said ``(The atmosphere has) become far more
aggressive. It's injected a new level of price-led competition into
UK retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Auberon Waugh, the columnist for the Independent, took note of
the depth of the cultural change required for British
businesspeople to embrace discount retailing. ``This must be seen
as deeply 'un-British,''' Waugh wrote. ``Prices in Britain are so
much higher than anywhere in the rest of Europe, let alone America,
because our government is greedy and nobody believes in
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wal-Mart has a firm grip on the principals of retail
competition, its British juggernaut faces a more concrete obstacle:
The stores here are too small for high-volume sales.
</P>
<P>
   British stores tend to be about 50,000 square feet _ about a
quarter the size of an American Wal-Mart _ and are surrounded by
complicated, cramped parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Wal-Mart's practice is to obtain a huge
tract in a small town or at the edges of urban development. This
land tends to be cheap, taxed modestly and regulated minimally.
</P>
<P>
   But, such parcels are rare in Britain, which is a densely
developed island that is fiercely protective of its countryside.
Since 1996, British land-use laws have effectively contained new
development in central business districts.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Wal-Mart's move to replicate its American stores
probably would prick fears about the future of city shopping
districts, known as the High Streets. These remain the prevalent,
if endangered shopping areas across Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Spencer, the city planner in the central England town of
Gloucester, is decidedly cool to allowing a Wal-Mart into his
community. His concerns would sound familiar to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may offer cheaper prices in the short term, but as
planners we have to cater for our children's children,'' Spencer
said. ``Wal-Mart sells everything from cigarettes to cars. Every
shop in the city center would suffer. It would change the tone of
the city. We've got flower sellers and musicians on our streets.
There is a rejuvenation of civic pride. A retail conglomerate which
excludes people without cars, the young and those with rough edges
would change all that.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential way around British planning rules is for Wal-Mart
to buy existing retail parks and convert them into mega-stores.
Britain has an estimated 500 out-of-town retail parks, a third of
which are already authorized to sell both food and non-food items.
ASDA has stores at only three of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response at these sites is likely to be mixed. Norman
Davies, the deputy chief planner in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales,
said Wal-Mart could expect few problems if it were to obtain that
town's office park and seek to convert it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrelevant who trades there and what they do with the
buildings so long as what they sell represents a similar range of
goods as before,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart entered the European market in 1997 with the US$880
million acquisition of Wertkauf hypermarkets in Germany. Last year,
the company added the US$660 million Spar Handels chain, giving it
a total of 95 stores throughout Germany. The retailer also is
reportedly looking to buy Metro, Germany's biggest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its aggressive foreign expansion, the company still
derives only 13 percent of its revenues from overseas. The
Economist, Europe's most respected business publication, last week
expressed doubts about Wal-Mart's ability to take control of the
continent's retailing. The magazine contends that the market
already has entrenched retailers and that Wal-Mart will find it
difficult to find its own sources of inexpensive merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the specter of Wal-Mart's moving into France was enough
to drive that country's big rival retailers _ Carrefour and
Promodes _ into one another's arms in a proposed merger. The
European Commission approved the merger on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   For now, shoppers here seem to welcome a break from the
tradition of high prices and rude service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' said Margaret Phillips as she waits to
unload her cart at the Sutton Asda. ``It's all great to talk about
British and the High Streets, but we all have families to provide
for, don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a male voice came on the store's public address
system to inform shoppers that pizzas were - for a limited time -
two for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's brilliant!'' said Phillips, as she pulls out of
line to follow the lure of free pizzas.

WIRELESS COMPANIES FACE SOME THORNY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With VODAFONE-MANNESMANN)  
(lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Vodafone AirTouch of Britain's $183 billion deal to
acquire Mannesmann of Germany would be the biggest takeover in
corporate history, reactions to the deal Thursday from
telecommunications analysts and wireless telephone executives in
the United States were characterized mostly by profound ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing more than the obvious,'' said one Wall Street analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty straightforward, isn't it?'' said an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a huge impact globally,'' said another analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective yawns may have only underscored how quickly
the communications industry is changing and how important the
wireless sector _ once a backwater _ has become.
Multibillion-dollar wireless deals have come so fast and furious
over the last year that Thursday's agreement seemed only to fit
into the pattern in what is perhaps the fastest-growing segment of
the global telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that wireless phones were seen as the toys
of globe-trotting power brokers and gilded celebrities _ and were
priced to match. Now, about 85 million people use them in the
United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   That explosive growth has compelled communications companies on
both sides of the Atlantic to bet billions of their shareholders'
dollars on the vision of seamless global, or at least continental,
wireless service. More billions are being wagered that soon,
wireless Internet service will become as common as annoying
cell-phone users next to you at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Sprint, the big long-distance carrier, U &UR;  &LR; S
West, the Bell local phone company, and Tele-Communications Inc.,
the big cable television company, agreed to be acquired in separate
transactions for a total of about $176 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a wireless phone company in Germany could be seen
to be worth more than all three of those companies combined speaks
for itself.
</P>
<P>
   But until wireless subscribers around the world can speak with
each other without roaming hassles and while traveling, the
industry must resolve some thorny technical and financial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless is still a Tower of Babel. While almost all wireless
operators in Europe and the Middle East use a common digital
technology, known as GSM, for global system for mobile
communications, adoption of GSM has been far from global.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, GSM is generally used in the United States by
only a handful of smaller carriers, though some big communications
companies including BellSouth use GSM in parts of their networks.
More prominent in the United States are other, incompatible digital
technologies known as TDMA, for time-division multiple access (used
by AT&AMP;T, for instance), and CDMA, for code-division multiple access
(used by Sprint and Bell Atlantic, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The International Telecommunication Union, a U.N.
standards-setting organization, has been trying for years to
encourage wireless operators from around the globe to agree on a
common global standard so that companies can upgrade their networks
in the future. But much of that effort has stalled because of
political wrangling among communications equipment companies in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial ideal was global roaming with one standard,'' said
John M. Bensche, a wireless analyst for Lehman Brothers. ``The
initial ideal of the ITU is not going to be realized.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet. Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint's
wireless operation, Sprint PCS, which provided the main reason for
MCI WorldCom Inc. to agree to acquire Sprint last year, says he
expects global roaming in three or four years. But the technical
issues will not be solved through mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't really bring us one step closer to resolving the
worldwide issue because that's a standards issue,'' he said in an
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also important business issues to be resolved. When
wireless customers ``roam'' from their home network and onto the
system of another carrier, they face higher per-minute rates, and
the home carrier's profit margins generally suffer for having to
pay the owner of the host system in the roaming area for network
use.
</P>
<P>
   To offer rate plans that make widespread roaming financially
attractive, wireless carriers must either own far-flung networks
themselves or strike special partnerships with other carriers to
charge one another low roaming fees.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, an acquisition of Mannesmann by Vodafone would
facilitate roaming between Britain and Germany for customers of
those companies, but it would still leave major parts of Europe out
of the equation, even though the two companies have minority
investments in many other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they have unified technology, from a business side,
offering pan-European service is not compelling for the carriers,''
Sukawaty said. ``This is just a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's agreement to merge its U.S. operations into a joint
venture with Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. could speed the advent of
seamless trans-Atlantic roaming. But those companies' customers in
the United States still generally use wireless phones that are
technically incompatible with European networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scramble for scale will almost surely continue
in the wireless business as carriers try not only to offer their
customers broader networks but also to seek the financial
advantages that accrue to sheer size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless business was always about coverage and
footprint,'' said Steven R. Yanis, an analyst for Banc of America
Securities. ``That originally meant, `Do you have your city
covered?' then `Do you have your region covered?' and then, `Do you
have your nation?' and now it's, `Do you have the globe covered?'''

SOME IN   AUSTRIA REACT TO HAIDER AND SOME TO THE REACTION OVER
HAIDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AUSTRIA-POLITICS, AUSTRIA-EUROPE) 
(DW) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ OK, tell the truth, a young reveler at Joerg
Haider's birthday celebration on an Alpine ski slope was prodded
recently _ isn't all your Freedom Party's talk about the economic
threat posed by immigrants really just a cover story for not liking
dark-skinned people?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Martin Pohl answered, fixing his questioner with a
straight, if slightly beery gaze. ``We Austrians are not like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not,'' he added firmly, ``as bad here as in America. I
have seen `Mississippi Burning.'''
</P>
<P>
   That, in its way, encapsulates the view of many Austrians in
Haider's camp _ and many who dislike him _ about the threats from
the European Union, Israel and the United States to isolate Austria
diplomatically if Haider joins the government. Look to your own
houses before dictating to us, they say. Some leaders, they
suggest, have mounted the dung heaps of corruption scandals and
neo-Nazi incidents in their own countries and suddenly shouted that
they have the moral high ground.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who feel just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, as an Austrian, I enjoy this,'' said Georg
Hofmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for Profil magazine. ``Why shouldn't
the EU say we don't want an extremist in your government? It's not
good manners to have racists in government. We don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in the Alps, where Haider comes from, and in the
streets of liberal Vienna, where hostility to him is strongest,
produce a wide range of musings _ not just about the diplomatic
crisis, but about Haider's unpredictable personality and Austria's
complex self-image as the one-time seat of a vast empire later
reduced to a Nazi state and now to an Alpine chalet on Western
Europe's frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Haider often says what some other Austrians feel but dare not
say. Sometimes, it is complaints normal to a democracy: The
government is full of tired old men who divide the spoils. The
economy would be stronger if they dared privatize. Civil servants
are lazy and rude.
</P>
<P>
   In Carinthia, as a lawyer who inherited wealth, Haider is seen
as above corruption, pro-business and a leader who made the civil
servants smile on time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, what he says is unpleasant but true: Immigrants are
responsible for a disproportionate amount of the small crime rate.
Some cheat on the generous welfare system. Sometimes it is wacky:
Immigrants use state-paid fertility treatment to out-breed
Austrians. Sometimes, it is over the line: The Waffen SS deserves
the same respect any military unit does.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's style has been called ``defamation followed by
halfhearted excuse,'' and he used it again last week, calling the
Belgian government corrupt protectors of pedophiles and implying
that France's president, Jacques Chirac, was a doddering failure.
Senior politicians say such language cannot be used in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander van der Bellen, leader of the Green Party, called him
a ``persistent offender.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Haider backers enjoy his forthrightness; some worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, but when he opens his mouth, it's a
catastrophe,'' said Willy Klima, 53, a Vienna cabbie.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Spahn, 32, a casino floor manager, said: ``I admit I did
think of voting for Haider as a protest, because he exposed
corruption. But I have an aunt who died recently at 93. She lived
through two world wars, and she compared Haider to Hitler and said
it might be possible to happen again, so she decided to vote for
the reds, even though she had voted black all her life. I listened
to what she said.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austrian politics, the Social Democrats are known as the
reds; black is the color of the conservative People's Party, which
has signed an agreement on a coalition government with Haidar's
party.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chik, 19, who planned to join an evening anti-Haider
demonstration, is part of the tiny Chinese minority, born here of
parents who immigrated to open a restaurant. ``I know some people
in the Freedom Party, and they are quite racist,'' he said. ``And
it's the members who make the party.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been teased as a child. ``They did this,'' he
said, pushing his eyes up into slits. ``But it's the Turkish people
who get beaten up and face discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who are, by Austrian law, ``foreigners,'' say they do not
feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a supporter, not at all, but Haider's not against
anyone like me who's been here 30 years and does his work
properly,'' said Milan Lakobria, 50, an electrician originally from
Yugoslavia. ``He's against those who don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakobria is not a citizen, nor are most of his children born
here. But they could be if they wanted, he said, they get free
health care, schooling and pensions, ``and anyway, it's better here
than in my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Krailler, 75, a retired cashier walking her small white dog
through a middle-income Vienna shopping center, made no secret of
her feelings. ``Yes, I am for Haider,'' she said. ``It's time that
all those foreigners who steal cars were out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there,'' she said, pointing to a residential district,
``there are blocks with only one or two Austrians. You get no
peace, there are so many children running around. In summer, the
foreigners take over the parks. And it's not only them. My
generation helped rebuild Austria, and I don't get enough pension
to live on. I think things will be better under Haider.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the diplomatic isolation, she said: ``Well, the
German criticism wasn't so bad. The worst was the Jews. They're
afraid. I don't know why _ no Austrian would ever harm a Jew. And
their ambassador should just go home. How are we supposed to react?
Suddenly everyone's against us, but no one has the right to condemn
Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elisabeth Sickl, a minor official of Haider's party in
Carinthia who is likely to be the social minister in a new
government, denied that xenophobia and racism are characteristic of
Haider supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanism is my aim,'' she said. ``I feel treated very
unjustly. We are no Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   A theme coming up repeatedly was fear of the ``jetzt erst
recht'' backlash. The phrase is literally ``now first right,'' but
is translated as ``now more than ever,'' meaning that if you push
an Austrian, he will get his back up and do exactly what you wanted
him not to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of new elections, because Haider will get more
votes,'' said Susanne Fromwald, 31, a social worker who spent the
night sleeping on a sidewalk in an all-night demonstration against
the proposed government. ``People here who don't like people from
other countries telling us who to vote for will vote for Haider.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she preferred European ``concern'' to isolation, but
her companions liked the stronger course.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi-hunter based in Vienna, opposes
isolation, fearing that the tiny country's lifeline _ tourism and
trade _ will shut down. He prefers new elections, even knowing that
they could strengthen Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say he's a Nazi,'' Wiesenthal said, ``but when Jews
call me and say, `We're not against Haider because he never said
something against the Jews,' I ask: `Is that the best you can say
about him?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is for sure,'' he said. ``The man has no deputy.
When there's a traffic accident, that party is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Austrians, regardless of their political sympathies,
said the European Union had gone too far by condemning Austria
before Haider spent a day in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Haider is a problem _ OK, I can cry,'' said Klima, the
ebullient taxi driver. ``But every man should have a chance.''

SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY BACKS GREENSPAN FOR FOURTH TERM AS FED
CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.D., Minn., Nev.)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Alan
Greenspan's nomination to his fourth term as chairman of the
Federal Reserve on Thursday after members of both parties lauded
his performance over the last dozen years in nurturing the
economy's long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 89-4.
</P>
<P>
   The action gave Greenspan, 73, another four-year term as head of
the nation's central bank, a post that makes him one of the most
powerful policy-makers in an increasingly interconnected global
economy. It came a day after Greenspan raised interest rates by a
quarter of a point to slow the fast-growing economy in an effort to
head off the possibility of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose administration has had a close working
relationship with Greenspan, a Republican, said he was pleased by
the Senate's action, especially in light of the Fed chairman's role
in allowing the current expansion to become the longest on record
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Greenspan's wise and steady leadership has inspired
confidence here in America and around the world,'' Clinton said in
a statement. ``He has made a truly remarkable contribution in
helping lead our nation to the longest economic expansion in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was first appointed to the Fed by President Ronald
Reagan in 1987, after Paul Volcker resigned as chairman. He was
subsequently reappointed by President George Bush, and now twice by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said Greenspan is the only person who could have won
such broad bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``And why have three successive administrations appointed Alan
Greenspan to be chairman of the board of governors of the Federal
Reserve system?'' Gramm asked during Senate debate on the
nomination Wednesday. ``Because he is the best central banker we
have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The four votes against Greenspan came from liberal Democrats who
said he was too focused on fighting an inflation threat that was
more theoretical than real, and doing so behind a cloak of
excessive secrecy at the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   They were Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa; Byron Dorgan of North
Dakota; Harry Reid of Nevada; and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the debate, Harkin said that in focusing singlemindedly
on the ``specter of inflation,'' the Fed was paying too little
attention to its legislated mandate of encouraging full employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board seemed to think
they needed to make a preemptive strike on inflation before we see
clear signs of inflation our there,'' Harkin said. ``This view, if
aggressively acted upon, would place an absolute cap on our
economy's ability to grow. It would destroy much of our potential
for growth. That is a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates four times in quarter point increments
since June, pushing its benchmark federal funds target rate to 5.75
percent. Most analysts expect the central bank to tighten policy at
least two more times in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed released the minutes of its policy-setting meeting of
Dec. 21 on Thursday, at which it voted unanimously to hold interest
rates steady. The minutes showed that Fed officials were concerned
about continuing signs of incipient inflationary pressures in
December, but that they were primarily focused on guiding the
economy smoothly through the year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said at the meeting that the three rate increases
they had approved over the previous six months had had relatively
little effect up until that point in slowing the economy. But they
agreed that it would be prudent to delay any action on rates, in
part because waiting would give the central bank further time ``to
assess the delayed effects of its earlier tightening actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed concluded this week that its prior rate increases had
not been enough. In explaining its decision on Wednesday to raise
rates again, the Fed said the risks to the economy ``are weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures.''

   There was a time when children were told they could hope to be
president, but for many Americans the envied footsteps are no
longer those of Al Gore or George W. Bush. Now people dream of
being like P. Kingston Duffie, Richard N. Tinsley or M. Denise
Savoie.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of them? Two years ago they invested almost $8,500
as they founded Turnstone Systems to design products that help
local phone companies provide DSL lines, which allow rapid Internet
communications. The company looks like it may succeed, having so
far sold $27 million in products. Last year, it almost broke even.
</P>
<P>
   This week Turnstone went public, selling stock to the public at
$29 a share, compared with the tenth of a cent a share that the
founders paid. Investors fell all over themselves to buy the stock,
and Thursday Turnstone closed at $132. The shares bought by the
three founders, who range in age from 35 to 44, now are worth $1.1
billion. The company, in which about $100 million has been invested
_ including the $87 million put up by public investors this week _
has a market capitalization of $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Turnstone saga so impressive is that it is not
all that extraordinary. Seven American companies have gone public
this week. Besides Turnstone, they are SkilSoft, a provider of
corporate training courses; Sequenom, a biotechnology company;
Quantum Effect Devices, a semiconductor company; Telaxis
Communications, a wireless equipment company; Centra Software, an
Internet company; and Alamosa PCS, a cell phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The seven sport a total market capitalization of $13.4 billion,
equal to 16 times the amount of money that equity investors put
into them and more than 170 times the $78 million in combined
annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures reflect the wealth effect in action. The Federal
Reserve, which has now raised the federal funds rate four times
since last summer, is expected to raise it two or three more times
before this year is out. That has put a damper on some old stocks,
but it has not damaged the market for companies like these.
</P>
<P>
   An initial public offering that immediately doubled in price
used to be an amazing phenomenon. Now it is almost taken for
granted that new offerings will soar. Of the seven, all but
SkilSoft traded at twice the offering price or better the first
day, although Alamosa faded to close with a gain of just 66
percent. But none got much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Those doubles benefit the lucky people who got in on the public
offering. Those who got in earlier do much better. All told,
insiders _ including founders, employees and the venture
capitalists who financed these seven companies _ have put $257
million into their equity investments. Their stakes are now worth
$11.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth is created not by the success of the companies _
none are now profitable _ but by the enthusiasm and hope of
investors. It is a virtuous circle, in which optimistic investors
produce higher share prices that justify the optimism and draw in
more investors.
</P>
<P>
   All this is possible because many companies have a shot at being
winners in an era in which technology is changing the economic
landscape. But while some companies may prove to be great
successes, there is no way that the economy will produce enough
profits to justify all the optimism now being shown. Someday, when
enough companies have fallen by the wayside, investors will grow
hostile and even promising ventures will find it hard to raise
capital. There are no signs that day is near.

have suffered a decline similar to that of Detroit. Just as
Mannesmann re-invented itself from a producer of seamless steel
pipe to a fast-growing telecommunications company, Dusseldorf has

succumbing to the $170 billion hostile takeover by a British
company that seems intent on running the company from London. Yet
business executives and even political leaders here seem to share
an overwhelming view that there is no turning back. To the extent
that Dusseldorf and Mannesmann have achieved a new prosperity, they

 &HT;    Warehouse developer likes Atlanta airport's cargo potential
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A developer believes Hartsfield International Airport
will become one of the nation's top air cargo centers in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Seefried Properties is so confident about the growth of air
cargo that it will spend $45 million to develop more than 1 million
square feet of space near the airport to accommodate the world's
top freight-forwarding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Freight forwarders pick up goods from manufacturers and deliver
them to destinations around the world. They use warehouses such as
those built by Atlanta-based Seefried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to build at Hartsfield because we believe its
importance as an air cargo hub will increase in the coming years,''
Seefried President Ferdinand Seefried said Thursday. ``It will be a
first-tier air cargo hub in the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's top freight-forwarding airports include Miami, Los
Angeles, JFK in New York and Chicago's O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Hartsfield ranked in the lower end of the top 20 cargo
airports in the world with 907,000 metric tons of freight and mail.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, however, international cargo at
Hartsfield has grown considerably. It increased from 212,000 metric
tons in 1997 to 242,000 metric tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Global air cargo traffic is expected to grow by 6.4 percent a
year through 2017, according to the 1998-1999 Boeing World Air
Cargo Forecast. Air cargo accounts for 13 percent of passenger
airlines' revenue, according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Seefried plans to develop 350,000 square feet of space for
freight forwarders at Interstate 285 and Old Dixie Road. The
developer has contracted to buy about 20 acres and hopes to start
construction on an 180,000-square-foot building within 90 days. It
will be completed seven to eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   At Airport South industrial park, Seefried will develop 660,000
square feet in a freight-distribution park with partner Kollmann AG
of Germany, said Tom Ellis, a Seefried vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The developer already has completed three of the seven buildings
it plans for the 53-acre distribution park at Ga. 85 and Rock Hill
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrett III, president of Airis Corp., an Atlanta
developer, also believes air cargo traffic will grow at Hartsfield,
although it likely will not be on the level of the top air cargo
airports any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect to see a lot of cargo opportunities become
available at Hartsfield,'' said Garrett, whose father is a former
Delta Air Lines chairman and chief executive. ``Hartsfield has
absolutely the right fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals include location, a large export business and
the right leadership. Garrett said Hartsfield's top management
promotes air cargo traffic.

   The world's music has never been more accessible, speeded to new
ears by everything from jet travel to the Internet. And the whole
world comes to New York: if not in person, then through its songs.
Onstage or on CDs, music from far-flung places offers easy
transport to distant lands and times. The Babel of different
musical languages promises not strife but diverse pleasures,
available amazingly close to home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the second annual survey of world-music albums released
in the last year. But this weekend is also an unusually strong one
for live performances of international music in New York. A gala
concert Saturday night at Town Hall celebrates the 15th anniversary
of the World Music Institute, which has combed the globe to produce
concerts of worthwhile music rooted in local traditions. The gala
concert includes music from India, Morocco, Uganda, Iran, China,
the Middle East and New York, with a lineup featuring violinists:
Kayhan Kalhor from Iran; Shankar from India; Simon Shaheen, an Arab
oud and violin player; and David Harrington from the Kronos String
Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   An international lineup also appears Saturday night at the
annual Tibet House Benefit Concert at Carnegie Hall, where regulars
like Philip Glass and Patti Smith are to share the stage with
Gomang monks from Tibet, the ethereal Brazilian soprano Virginia
Rodrigues, the West African pop spark plug Angelique Kidjo (from
Benin) and the Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac, who plays Celtic
music with a punk rocker's fury.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Traditional Music and Dance is recreating the
traditional festivities of Jews from the Caucasus Mountains, where
Russian and Persian culture met. Its third annual ``Nashi Traditsii
(Our Traditions),'' a concert of music and dance along with a
banquet, takes over the Atlantic Oceana Restaurant in the Russian
kitsch belt of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is sending its cultural representatives, including
musicians, for a series at the World Financial Center that began
this week and runs through March 26. And the annual birthday
tribute to Bob Marley of Jamaica, who gave hope and direction to
musicians across the Third World, takes place Saturday night at
Irving Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Companies of all sizes continue to release world-music albums,
in an anarchic jumble of scholarly ethnomusicology, non-Western
classical styles, informed compilations, imported pop releases and
hodgepodge surveys. And the musicians, who aren't exactly
primitives, are also coming up with border-crossing collaborations
like Ghazal, a group that reunites Persian and Indian classical
styles, both based on melodic modes and rhythmic cycles.
</P>
<P>
   After the million-selling success of ``Buena Vista Social
Club,'' there has been a flood of releases of music from Cuba. And
the last year has seen the rise of ethnomusicologists treated as
auteurs. Rounder Records has been releasing a series of recordings
made on excursions by Alan Lomax in the United States and abroad,
as he worried that ``our barbarous centralized culture is now
destroying this ancient treasury of musical traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Folkways has just finished releasing a 20-CD series
of music from Indonesia recorded by Philip Yampolsky; and Stern's
Africa is importing a series of albums recorded in the 1950s by
Hugh Tracey, who documented African music soon to be destroyed or
transformed by political upheavals and the electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Large stores like Tower, HMV and Virgin now stock good
selections of world music. The World Music Institute
(www.heartheworld.org) also has an impressive catalog of
traditional and traditionalist music, which it sells by mail, at
concerts and from its office at 49 W. 27th St. in Manhattan
(212-545-7536).
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a selection of rewarding world-music albums from
the last year: just a limited sampling from a world of song. (CDs
range in price from $15 for a single disc to $25 each for some
imports.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albania
</P>
<P>
   Tirana is an unaccompanied choir of six men and one woman,
dedicated to preserving ancient songs from Albania's minorities.
Performing songs from various regions, it's a professional group
that uses robust, polished harmony as a symbol of cultural
survival. On its album ``Xhevhir'' (Arco Iris import), there are
sustained, close-harmony songs similar to Bulgarian choral music,
with Irini Qirjako's sobbing, determined voice answered by the men.
There are also uptempo songs in ebullient major chords that sound
something like tarantellas. Although the performances are far
removed from what were probably more rough-hewn originals, they
maintain a tenacious spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil
</P>
<P>
   For Brazilian musicians there has never been a barrier between
the traditional and the modern. They can draw at will on old parade
rhythms, new harmonies and newer gadgets. Os Mutantes, pioneers in
the surreal late-'60s Brazilian hybrid called tropicalia, finally
had an American greatest-hits collection released in 1999:
``Everything Is Possible'' (Luaka Bop), including some songs in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Mestre Ambrosio, a band from Recife, plugged in the local music
of carnivals and troubadours. On its album ``Fua na Casa de
Cabral'' (Chaos/Sony Brasil), it melds the local variants of fiddle
and guitar with a rock band, singing about the preservation of
culture transforming it.
</P>
<P>
   A songwriter named Otto, on ``Samba pra Burro'' (Trama,
Brazilian import), carries tropicalia's experimentation into the
realm of electronica, letting samba rhythms warp into throbs and
blips provided by D.J. Soul Slinger. Monica Salmaso's ``Trampolim''
(Blue Jackel) is pensive pop as only Brazilians can make it. Her
breathy, melting voice is set against just a handful of instruments
at a time, making the melodies seem even more cherished.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   Congo
</P>
<P>
   Soukous is the perpetual-motion machine of African pop. It
carries the Afro-Cuban rumba back to Africa and transfers its
rhythm to lilting, twining, endlessly inventive guitar lines.
Unfortunately, soukous productions from Parisian studios, where
most of the music is recorded, can grow repetitious or overly
sweet. The assortment on ``Lightning Over the River: The Congolese
Soukous Guitar Sound'' (Music Club), with most of the best-known
soukous bands, can't entirely avoid the synthesizer overlays, but
it keeps the grooves varied, buoyant and continually surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Tracey's ethnographic documents of Congolese music,
compiled by Sharp Wood Productions and available through Stern's
Africa, were recorded nearly 50 years ago and sound as if they come
from another world. ``On the Edge of the Ituri Forest: Northeastern
Belgian Congo'' shows the effects of the polyphonic singing of
rain-forest pygmies on their neighbors; recorded in mono with a
hand-held microphone, many of the pieces sound like bustling, happy
crowds that suddenly coalesce into complex call and response.
``Kanyok and Luba: Southern Belgian Congo'' collects demonstrations
of drum language, pieces with interlocked xylophone or thumb-piano
patterns and ululating voices, and early incursions by the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tracey collection, ``Royal Court Music From Uganda,''
preserves music from courts that were brutally dismantled in the
'60s: patterns so quick and complicated that they turn into a
frenetic, articulate buzz.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cuba
</P>
<P>
   Everyone associated with ``Buena Vista Social Club'' put out a
follow-up album last year, proving again that the club's members
were superbly chosen. Among the best of the spinoffs are Eliades
Ochoa's ``Sublime Illusion'' (Higher Octave), stern and propulsive
songs driven by acoustic guitar picking, and Ibrahim Ferrer's album
of big-band crooning, ``Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim
Ferrer'' (Nonesuch).
</P>
<P>
   They're largely performing music of an older generation, steeped
in nostalgia. Another decades-old style, the charanga _ a large
ensemble featuring violins and flute _ survives with Orquesta
Aragon, which was founded in 1939 and still plays danzons and
cha-chas with suave sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   On ``La Charanga Eterna'' (Lusafrica, French import), the group
has guest singers, including the torchy Omara Portuondo, from
``Buena Vista Social Club,'' and Papa Wemba from Congo, whose music
draws on the Afro-Cuban rumba. Cuba's current dance bands play the
omnivorous updated salsa called timba, a hyperactive,
quick-changing mixture that can include mambos, funk vamps and
plenty of jabbing, angular horn-section parts.
</P>
<P>
   N.G. La Banda, one of the jazziest and most aggressive timba
bands, has just released a compilation, ``The Best of N.G. La
Banda'' (EMI Hemisphere), with liner notes that also explain some
of the lyrics' socially charged double-entendres. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, censorship and civil war took a severe toll on
Ethiopian music. But in the decade from 1969 to 1978 it produced a
homegrown pop: a tense mixture of electric guitars, imported
late-'60s soul and funk, modal Arab-flavored melodies and voices
that veered between the tightly ornamented phrases of Arab music
and the exultance of soul singing.
</P>
<P>
   A series of compilation albums called ``Ethiopiques'' (Buda
Musique, French import) has resurrected some of this music. On
Volume 1, the hybrid is tentative and a little clumsy, though it
has some of the period charm of blaxploitation soundtracks. But it
comes completely into its own with unleashed voices and
horn-section muscle on Volumes 3 and 5, while Volume 7 is a reissue
of Mahmoud Ahmed's ``Ere Mela Mela,'' where the muezzin meets the
wah-wah pedal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finland
</P>
<P>
   Members of Hedningarna, a Finnish folk group, decided to visit
Karelia, a region on Finland's border with Russia. The songs they
found fill ``Karelia Visa'' (NorthSide), and they're hearty
melodies that can seem like Celtic reels at one moment, Slavic
polyphony the next. The arrangements are modern ones, mixing
guitars and keyboards with accordion, fiddle and jaw harp beyond
Hedningarna's two female singers. While the lyrics are haunted by
mortality, the songs sound square-jawed and sturdy, dug in against
adversity.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia
</P>
<P>
   The final volumes of ``Music of Indonesia'' were released last
year by Smithsonian Folkways; like the rest of the series, these
have thorough annotation and superb sound. While some will appeal
mostly to specialists, others are so atmospheric that they deserve
to be in home collections. Volume 20, ``Indonesian Guitars,''
examines local styles as they're transformed by guitars both
standard and nonstandard, bringing in hints of everything from raga
to Hawaiian slide guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Volume 18, ``Sulawesi: Funerals, Festivals and Work,'' features
some of the most otherworldy music anywhere. It begins with somber
funeral songs, sung in eerie near-unison with piercing double-reed
shawms, followed by slow-motion music for women's voices and flute,
pitched so closely they create the vibrating acoustic phenomenon
called beats. Antiphonal choruses, gong pieces and a choral harvest
celebration in bright major chords complete the album.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland
</P>
<P>
   Irish traditional music was thriving well before the faddish
moment fueled by Riverdance and ``Titanic''; even as that craze
passes, there's no shortage of young musicians to learn the
subtleties of the old jigs, reels and hornpipes.
</P>
<P>
   They have hard acts to follow, particularly the Chieftains, who
released ``The Chieftains Collection: The Very Best of the Claddagh
Years'' (Atlantic), from their glory days in the '60s as Ireland's
traditionalist standard-bearers, well before they became the comedy
act of recent years. Lunasa, an instrumental band named after a
Celtic harvest festival, isn't as traditional as the Chieftains; it
includes guitar and bass (sometimes electric bass) alongside fiddle
and whistle. As fingers fly, smart arrangements create shifting
moods: fierce and yearning, lighthearted and melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Italy
</P>
<P>
   On Alan Lomax's trip to Italy in the mid-1950s, he recorded
rural music that can sound as close to Eastern Europe or the Middle
East as it does to the opera house. ``Folk Music and Song of
Italy'' (Rounder) is a countrywide sampler: men, women and
children, old and young, raising raw voices backed by tambourines,
jaw harps, accordions and even bagpipes. It's vigorous, untutored
music. One sea chantey was recorded on a boat, with the fishermen
harmonizing as they haul in a squeaking net.
</P>
<P>
   Lomax's favorite region was Liguria, where he recorded ``The
Trallaleri of Genoa'' (Rounder). It focuses on a local tradition,
popular among dock workers, of male group singing that's a wild
outpouring of harmony and counterpoint. A trallalero is an
unaccompanied five-part song: a vibrant group drone with tenor and
piercing falsetto lines crisscrossing high above. It's the missing
link between Monteverdi and Frankie Valli. Percussive nonsense
syllables _ the tra-la-las that give the songs their name _
percolate through the group or burst out like centuries-old scat
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Mali
</P>
<P>
   When Ali Farka Toure's music first came out of Mali, in West
Africa, it sounded strangely familiar. His circling, meditative
one-chord guitar riffs bore a family resemblance to the deep blues
of John Lee Hooker: a resemblance that Toure was cosmopolitan
enough to recognize and use for ``Talking Timbuktu,'' a 1994
collaboration with Ry Cooder that won a Grammy Award. His songs
have a serene austerity: just voice, guitar (acoustic or electric)
and perhaps a drum, a fiddle or an answering voice.
</P>
<P>
   Two albums by Toure were released in the United States in 1999,
both bare-bones productions with a hypnotic focus. ``Radio Mali''
(Nonesuch), recorded in the '70s, revolves around acoustic guitar
and is achingly quiet. ``Niafunke'' (Hannibal) is his most recent
recording, made on his farm in the village of Niafunke; with
resonant, snaky electric-guitar riffs, its songs have an air of
sage certainty.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar style Habib Koite and his band Bamada ratchet up
the tempos and entwine a second guitar in their songs,
fingerpicking in modal patterns that sometimes resemble Celtic
rock. ``Ma Ya'' (Putumayo World Music), mostly using acoustic
guitars, lets its patterns delicately insinuate themselves, but the
electrified ``Muso Ko'' (Alula) is even better; its songs build up
dizzying cross-rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Before guitars came to Malian music, griots traditionally played
the kora, a 21-stringed harp-guitar. ``New Ancient Strings''
(Hannibal) is an album of duets for two koras by Toumani Diabate
and Battake Sossoko. It's a sequel to an album by their fathers,
``Ancient Strings,'' recorded in 1970, and it displays their
heritage with resonant, shimmering purity.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Middle East
</P>
<P>
   Across the Arab world, singers have been compressing the
impassioned, open-ended improvisations of traditional music into
pop songs with terse melodies and instrumental hooks. Cheb Mami, an
Algerian who now lives in Paris, is one of the most cosmopolitan of
these singers; his album ``Meli Meli'' (Ark 21/Universal) touches
on reggae and flamenco without losing the sweeping passion of his
voice. ``Camelspotting'' (EMI Hemisphere) is a collection of
performers from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Morocco, among other
places; in voices that quiver and slide and rasp, the singers
pledge their love over backing tracks that juxtapose traditional
ouds and hand drums with saxophones and synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   Femi Kuti's father, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, was a pivotal figure in
African music. He invented Afro-Beat, which couched rebellious
manifestos in a re-Africanized funk. Femi Kuti leads a less
flamboyant life; unlike his father, he has only one wife and a mien
of sobriety. But he has chosen to continue his father's approach
with his own Afro-Beat band. On ``Shoki Shoki'' (MCA) Femi holds on
to Fela's social concerns and brusque horn charts while using
modern production techniques to clarify how precisely he builds the
grooves: ticking and wah-wah-ing guitars, terse bass lines,
snickering percussion. Some dance-club remixes are tacked on at the
end of the American version of the album, including a rap from the
Roots, but the strength of the music is in the band's own clockwork
intensity.

   Pakistan
</P>
<P>
   Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who died in 1997, introduced much of the
outside world to Pakistan's qawwali music, with its succinct
refrains and driving, call-and-response improvisations. ``Land of
the Sufis: Soul Music From the Indus Valley'' (Shanachie) surveys
Pakistani music from lesser-known performers and local traditions.
It includes qawwali along with other styles of devotional songs
that share qawwali's melodic clarity and rhythmic vigor. Fiddle,
accordion and a pair of penetrating, oboelike shenais share the
melodies with voices that are weathered but fervent in their
invocations of prophets and saints.
</P>
<P>
   Romania
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of Gypsy musicians sit in on ``Taraf de
Haidouks'' (Nonesuch), which translates as ``Band of Brigands.''
Old, grizzled voices take turns with young and fervent ones;
fiddles are cantankerous and then sweet. Their music has a cagy
sense of timing. Sometimes it bounces easily along, with scratchy
fiddle improvisations and voices that quaver and break with their
urgency. And sometimes the oom-pah accelerates toward meteoric
dance tunes, with accordion, fiddle and panpipes racing through
impossibly fast, zigzagging lines. The music is simultaneously raw
and virtuosic, implacable and giddy, hinting at history but living
in a vivid present tense. &QL;

<P>
   Zimbabwe
</P>
<P>
   The steady, triple-time plinking of the mbira, or thumb piano,
runs through Zimbabwean rock. Two of its masters, Thomas Mapfumo
and Oliver Mutukudzi, released albums in 1999. Mapfumo's band was
one of the pioneers in transferring mbira patterns to electric
guitars for a style of music called chimurenga.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to using mbiras _ but kept the trap drums and
electric bass _ on the 1995 tour that was recorded for ``Live at
the El Rey'' (Chimurenga Music Co., www.anonymousweb.com).
</P>
<P>
   His thoughtful, troubled voice comes through the twinkling
patterns like a gentle conscience. Oliver Mutukudzi's ``Tuku
Music'' (Putumayo World Music) uses chimurenga's needlepoint
electric guitars for music that's intricate, never pushy. In the
husky baritone of a soul singer, he sings social messages about
perseverance for his audience at home. But his music can easily
move listeners who live half a world away.  &QL;

 &HT;    `Terrell's law' passes early test
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Backers of a bill that would give doctors the
authority to take temporary protective custody of children they
suspect have been abused said Thursday they are confident the
measure will win quick approval from the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 315, also known as the ``Terrell Peterson Act,'' was
unanimously approved Thursday by a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
and sent to the full committee for a hearing next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an issue people are looking at. I feel
confident about it making through this session,'' said Sen. Nadine
Thomas (D-Ellenwood), the bill's primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is named for the 5-year-old Atlanta boy who died in
January 1998 after eight reports had been made to the Fulton County
Department of Family and Children Services alleging that Terrell or
his siblings were being neglected or abused.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's grandmother, his aunt and the aunt's boyfriend have
been charged in his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's case was brought to light in a series of articles in
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that documented shortcomings in
DFACS and the state's child protective services system.
</P>
<P>
   His case is among 13 that are being investigated by the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Civil and Criminal Practices Subcommittee made
only minor changes in wording of the bill after questions were
raised about the liability of doctors, how quickly doctors would
have to notify DFACS that they had taken a child into custody, and
how soon parents would be notified of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a registered nurse, said the bill is modeled after
similar laws in Iowa and Illinois.

that shallow materialism and the preference for beauty over

 &HT;    Mississippi foes of Rebel flag crank up campaign
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some Mississippi legislators are hoping this is the
year lawmakers at least discuss removing the Confederate battle
flag from the corner of the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Black legislators have filed two bills that would remove the
Confederate battle symbol, which they feel glorifies the Old South
and, with it, slavery. Similar bills have been filed for 20 years
in Mississippi, but none has made it past a committee.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it is a national issue.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people marched on Columbia last month to
protest the flying of the Confederate battle flag over South
Carolina's Capitol. It is the only state in the nation that flies
the flag. A boycott by the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People has been in effect there for months. During the
Super Bowl last weekend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson brought attention
to Georgia's use of the Confederate symbol in its state flag.
Georgia and Mississippi are the only states that incorporate the
flag in their state banners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that with public awareness, we'll begin to get a
better response to the bill,'' said Mississippi state Rep. Edward
Blackmon, author of one of the bills to change the flag. He wants
the Confederate symbol replaced by a magnolia, the state flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going on in South Carolina will have a great
deal of influence,'' Blackmon said. ``It would be difficult for us
to silently sit by and do nothing if other states take positive
steps to remove it. We don't want to be the last ones with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old lawsuit in which the NAACP challenges the
Mississippi flag was resurrected last year and is pending before
the state Supreme Court. The court will consider written arguments
filed by the state, which is defending the flag, and by the NAACP
and other black plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hankins, a Mississippian and member of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, said the flag has been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War was really a states' rights issue rather than
about so-called slavery,'' he said. ``My ancestors did not own any
slaves, and they fought in the war. We look at it more as a
heritage issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not think the flag, which was adopted by the state
Legislature in 1894, should be changed. He said the American flag
flew over slave-owning states for 150 years but no one tries to
take it down or change it.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute at Mississippi
State University, said the state is still ``fatigued by the public
relations nightmare'' of the civil rights era and may want to avoid
being portrayed in a negative light on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more people are willing to see some change,'' he said.
Moreover, he added, the Mississippi Legislature has a very large
and influential black caucus: Forty-seven of the 174
representatives and senators are black, and many of them have
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will change the nature of the debate,'' Wiseman said.

 &HT;    Smith blazing a new trail
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When guard Steve Smith sat down with Hawks president
Stan Kasten to sign a seven-year, $50.7 million contract in the
summer of 1996, he was startled by his boss' candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never play out this contract in a Hawks uniform,''
Kasten told Smith. ``It's too much money, and we'll have to trade
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith laughed. But exactly three years after signing, Smith
learned, while playing for the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team
in Puerto Rico, that Kasten had kept his promise. The
well-respected and highly popular guard had been shipped to
Portland, with a bottomless pocketbook, by a team with grave
salary-cap concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks felt compelled to make the deal, but they weren't
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most difficult deals I've ever made,'' general
manager Pete Babcock said. ``I don't regret it, because we did it
for reasons that made sense then and now. But any time you have to
trade someone of Steve's caliber _ both as a player and a person _
it's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Hawks have not played well this season, and Isaiah
Rider has not completed the transformation _ hoped for, but not
expected _ into a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's return tonight as member of the league's deepest and
best team takes the spotlight away from the Hawks' efforts to get
their season pointed in the right direction before next week's
all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   It is a homecoming for Smith in every sense. He played five
seasons in a Hawks uniform, annually led his team in scoring and
built a permanent home in the northern suburbs to which he will one
day retire.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he did not want the trade, and as often as he feels
compelled to reminisce with his friend Dikembe Mutombo, Smith
welcomes an opportunity to try to win a championship. He knows that
it could not have happened with a Hawks organization that lacked
reserve strength and was strangled by salary-cap constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is Portland's No. 2 scorer at 15.4 points per game, down
about 5 from what he gave the Hawks each game. He plays 34 minutes,
down four to five from the burden he accepted in Atlanta while
nursing a chronic knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't gloat about what's happened to me and what's happened
to that team,'' Smith said. ``I talk to Dikembe a lot, but I don't
bring up what's going on here or ask about what's going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as his second trade hurt _ he was dealt by Miami to
Atlanta two games into the 1994-95 season _ Smith is a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no depth there last season,'' he said. ``I'm not one to
complain, but that took its toll on me in the playoffs, especially
against New York. That's why I was so happy when I heard I was
going to Portland. In Atlanta, I had to do it all, in terms of
playing time and scoring. Here, we're so talented and deep, the
burden isn't all on me.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what to expect from Smith tonight? Probably a little
something extra, although only an improbable circumstance would
allow him to approximate what he did in a game at Miami a few
months after the Heat traded him.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Jan. 30, 1995, Atlanta was down 19 with 10 1/2
minutes to play when Smith re-entered the game. He brought his team
back with a blistering display of shooting. Inside the final
half-minute, in a one-point game, he had the ball in front of the
Heat bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``You so hot, shoot it from there,'' Miami's Harold Miner
hollered.
</P>
<P>
   Smith checked his spot about 28 feet from the hoop and let fly a
3-pointer that won the game.

 McCAIN DISMISSES ATTACKS ON HIS VOTING RECORD ON MILITARY ISSUES   
 (Eds.: Tod Harris is cq)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By R.G. RATCLIFFE and GREG McDONALD   
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. _ George W. Bush prompted an attack Thursday from
military heroes, activists and a former Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman on rival John McCain's voting record on veterans and
POW/MIA issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to criticize McCain, but stood alongside the
veterans' activist who made the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came home. He forgot us,'' J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of
the National Vietnam &AMP; Gulf War Veterans Coalition said of McCain,
who spent nearly six years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam
before his elections to the U.S. House and Senate from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the attack as ``foolishness'' brought on by
Bush's 19-point loss Tuesday in New Hampshire and a new poll
showing McCain with a 5-point lead over Bush in South Carolina. A
Time-CNN poll conducted Jan. 26-27 showed Bush leading McCain in
South Carolina by 52 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, with 400,000 residents either on active military
duty or retired from the armed services, is another state crucial
to McCain's underdog presidential effort. Its Republican primary is
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's maybe a little bit of foolishness going on here,''
McCain said in Charleston, S.C., with Fort Sumter and a
decommissioned aircraft carrier as his backdrop. Citing his
endorsement by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other major
veterans organizations, McCain said, ``Of all the people they could
attack on veteran's issues, they're attacking me?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials also challenged the Bush campaign to a debate
on military and veterans issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to debate the governor any time, any place and
stick our record against his ... We hope to God this campaign
centers on which candidate is more committed to defense issue and
veterans affairs,'' said McCain spokesman Tod Harris.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a naval aviator who was shot down
and tortured in North Vietnam has been one of the most compelling
attributes of his candidacy. The Texas governor served in the Texas
Air National Guard in Houston during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain has opposed legislation related to Agent
Orange, Gulf War-related health care and the plight of other
Vietnam-era prisoners of war and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp challenged those assertions about his support
for veterans health legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, records show, was a co-sponsor in 1991 of the Agent
Orange Act that became law and testified in Congress in 1994 urging
swift action on legislation to provide compensation to Gulf War
veterans suffering from mysterious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, opposed the Bring Them Back Alive Bill of 1995 to grant
immigrant status to any Asian who brought an MIA serviceman out of
Asia alive. He said McCain also opposed the Missing Persons
Personnel Act of 1997 to make it easier for family members to get
their missing relatives declared dead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said those bills were attached to unrelated
measures that McCain opposed. The Senate never took up those bills
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said McCain also supported normalizing relations with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said relations should not be normalized until there is a
full accounting of all the men still missing from the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did support normalizing relations with Vietnam, a
diplomatic process begun by President Bush. Other Vietnam veterans
in the Senate also backed that effort.
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, Bush said, ``I have no problem with normalization
so long as I was confident there was a full accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in his speech to about 400 people said he wants to improve
military pay and redesign its mission. He said he also wants to
overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a commander in chief who respects the men and women in
uniform,'' Bush said. ``That is the kind of commander in chief I

<P>
   Joining Bush on stage were three Medal of Honor winners from
South Carolina plus Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff during the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on McCain came as both men tried to pick up support
from the state's large military population.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning along the South Carolina coast, home to the Paris
Island Marine Base and hundreds of retirement communities, McCain
stressed not only his military background, but his 13 years in the
Senate as a ``fighter'' for veterans on issues, ranging from health
care to retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully prepared to take over right now - this moment - as
commander in chief,'' McCain said to cheers as he addressed
retirees at several rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to distance himself from any personal responsibility
for the veteran group attacks on McCain's record on veterans
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I stand by is the fact they've looked at both of us and
they've chosen me to be the nominee,'' Bush told a news conference.
``John McCain served our country well. He was a warrior on behalf
of America ... Let them speak. I appreciate their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Col. Dave Townsend, who now lives in Beaufort,
S.C., said he knows McCain ``has got what it takes, despite what
Bush or anyone else may say about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone who understands what duty and country and
morality means ... If we've got somebody up there who has courage
of convictions it will begin to rub off,'' Said Townsend. ``I don't
have anything against the other candidates. I just think he's it.''

EASTMAN KODAK AND HEWLETT-PACKARD PLAN INTERNET VENTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a joint
venture Thursday to develop and market retail and consumer
photofinishing products using the Internet and Hewlett-Packard's
inkjet printer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company will be owned equally by Kodak and Hewlett-Packard
and is expected to generate between $500 million and $1 billion in
sales by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares closed Thursday at $113.50, up $2.9375,
on the New York Stock Exchange. Kodak shares closed at $63.25, up
$1.75.
</P>
<P>
   For Hewlett-Packard, the joint venture is part of a strategy for
moving beyond printers and scanners into the photography and
Internet markets. For Kodak, joining forces with the leading
producer of inkjet printers ensures Kodak a role as that technology
begins to supplant silver halide printing at the consumer level.
Like Kodak's partnership with America Online, the deal stakes a
claim in the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly opens up a chance for Hewlett-Packard to
install more equipment and sell more ink,'' said Paula Bursely, an
analyst with Dataquest. ``It brings the Hewlett-Packard brand and
products to a new and different set of customers. On Kodak's side,
to the extent it provides the opportunity for additional retailers
to provide photofinishing, this is a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak and Hewlett-Packard did not disclose their pricing, but in
a conference call with securities analysts, executives said
equipment costs should be lower than for silver-based processing
and actual processing costs would be similar. Lower-cost equipment
should open photo-finishing services to a broader range of
retailers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Hewlett-Packard's inkjet technology and Kodak's image
science, retailers will be able to offer consumers the options of
printing pictures on a variety of media and of sending digital
files made from conventional film to friends or family over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture is in contrast to Web-based start-ups like
Shutterfly.com or PhotoAccess.com, which are based on the concept
of consumers sending digital images over the Internet to a service
that will produce conventional prints. Currently these companies
are in a competitive frenzy, with each offering vast numbers of
free prints to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hewlett-Packard announced a strategic alliance with
the Asahi Optical Co. Ltd., maker of Pentax cameras and lenses, to
jointly develop cameras using Hewlett-Packard's digital imaging
technology and Asahi's optics.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard also announced two new digital cameras
incorporating Pentax lenses, which will be available this summer.
Hewlett-Packard said the HP PhotoSmart C912 and HP PhotoSmart C618
are aimed at photo enthusiasts, with features and performance
similar to high-quality 35-millimeter single lens reflex cameras. &QL;

BRITAIN WILL SUSPEND HOME RULE IF IRA DOESN'T MOVE TO DISARM
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain moved Thursday night to suspend the
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland by next week, but said
it would intensify efforts to get paramilitary groups to begin
disarming before using that authority.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a somber session of the House of Commons, the
Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said he would
introduce emergency legislation Friday to establish the power to
shut down the two-month old Ulster government and restore direct
rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not ``relish'' the prospect of bringing
self-government to an end so soon after it had been established,
but that course might end up being the best option for preserving
the fragile new political institutions for eventual revival.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was obliged to take the action because of the
``totally unacceptable'' resistance of the Irish Republican Army to
begin dismantling its arsenal. He said the expectation that there
would be some weapons surrender by now was ``completely
unambiguous'' and that the failure was ``deeply disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson called the group's stance ``a betrayal of every
community in Northern Ireland,'' and said Britain's decision next
week would turn entirely on whether the paramilitary groups
recognized the urgency of demands to start disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the paramilitaries to heed the will of the people
and get cracking and enable local self-government in Northern
Ireland to flourish once and for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that intensive contacts would continue for that purpose,
and Thursday night Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland flew to
England to meet with Tony Blair in Cornwall where the British prime
minister was on a two-day swing through farm communities.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson's call for contingency legislation was an effort to
buy time and to spare David Trimble, first minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, from
having to carry through on a pledge to quit as head of the
legislature and, most likely, his party. A postdated letter of
resignation, to be put into effect in the absence of any progress
on paramilitary disarmament, falls due Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Trimble in the hushed hall, Mandelson said that the
government would be depending upon his ``strength and courage'' in
the days to come. He urged Trimble's restive party members not to
take any ``precipitate action.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought on Thursday night's announcement was a confidential
report by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of the panel
charged with supervising disarmament, that offered no evidence that
the IRA and other groups had made any move to begin turning in
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to the British and Irish governments shortly
before a midnight deadline Monday and has been the subject of
intense discussions since then between Blair, Ahern, President
Clinton in Washington and the leaders of the Catholic and
Protestant political parties in Belfast that signed the peace pact
nearly two years ago that established the basis for the home rule
government.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations this week were aimed at persuading the IRA to
make a move on weapons or issue a declaration that their war with
Britain and its Protestant sympathizers was over. The IRA did make
a statement noting that its cease-fire was holding and its
commitment to peace was firm, but it sidestepped the central issue
of disarmament that has continually stalled progress in bringing
stability to Ulster. ``The IRA's guns are silent and there is no
threat to the peace process from the IRA,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson's praise for Trimble in the House of Commons reflected
the government's regard for his indispensability to the effort to
bring peace to Ulster. A onetime intransigent Protestant leader, he
has been transformed in recent years into a persuasive deal broker
within his quarrelsome party. He shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize
with John Hume, the head of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party, who is seen as the original inspiration for the
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's resignation would require a new election for first
minister whenever the assembly resumed its functions, and it is
doubtful now that his party would back him for the top office.
Those in line to succeed him are less committed to sharing power
with their Catholic rivals and would be less willing partners with
Britain and Ireland in trying to set up a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Trimble took a gamble in persuading his party to
enter government with Sinn Fein, the political representatives of
the IRA, even though there had been no turnover of guerrilla arms.
To persuade his party members to abandon what had become a
bottom-line demand, he promised he would resign his position as
first minister of the assembly in February if there was no matching
IRA move by then.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the IRA simultaneously appointed representatives to de
Chastelain's commission, there was widespread expectation that
moves on arms would follow, allowing the arms monitoring agency to
issue a positive report this week.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland had a rare moment of hope for a secure future
with the start-up of the coalition government with its carefully
constructed mechanisms for assuring Catholics and Protestants an
equal say in affairs of the province. Men known to have been
members of Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups suddenly
found themselves running ministries and dealing with issues like
school lunches, farm prices, education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Citing that experience, ``this augurs well for the long-term
future of devolved government in Northern Ireland,'' Mandelson told
the House of Commons Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
warned during the week that the entire peace undertaking would be
in jeopardy if Britain mothballed the new political institutions.
Turning aside accusations that the setback was due to his party's
failure to deliver, he said, ``If the Ulster Unionist Party either
walks away from the process or forces the governments to collapse
this process, then I don't see how we are going to put it together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams contests Trimble's claim that the IRA is obliged to start
disarming now, saying that the only operative deadline is the May
22 date in the original agreement. Mandelson rejected that argument
Thursday night, saying it was clear to everyone that progress on
disarmament was expected by now in response to Trimble's decision
of November to take a chance on entering the government without any
arms being turned in first.

   London and Dublin are sponsors of the 1998 peace agreement
brokered by George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator, that created
the assembly in Belfast and a group of other governmental bodies
intended to balance the desires of the Protestant majority that
wants Ulster to remain part of Britain and of the Catholic minority
that wants the province to establish closer links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing political stability to the province where more than
3,300 lives have been lost in 30 years of sectarian violence has
produced repeated false starts and disappointments followed by 11th
hour rescue measures sustained by spiteful and begrudging
compromises that inevitably break down.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, a senior member of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party and the deputy first minister of the assembly, said he
hoped that once again ``we can pull a rabbit out of the hat.'' He
added, ``So many times in Northern Ireland the possible happened
when things seemed most impossible.''

 &HT;    `Lion's Game' author pounces on critic in latest
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nelson DeMille's novel ``The General's Daughter'' hit the
big screen last year, some of the movie reviews were very critical,
including one by Janet Maslin of The New York Times. Well, DeMille
gets a small measure of revenge in his new best seller, ``The
Lion's Game,'' by having his character John Corey refer to Maslin's
``tortured'' syntax. ``Some days I do the Times crossword puzzle,''
Corey says, ``other days I try to understand what Ms. Maslin is
trying to say. I can't do both on the same day without getting a
headache.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maslin may have another shot or two at the Long Island,
N.Y., writer. Columbia Pictures has bought ``The Lion's Game'' and
``Plum Island'' for $1 million each, and DeMille is at work on a
sequel to ``The General's Daughter'' in which John Travolta's
character, Pete Brenner, goes back to Vietnam to investigate a
30-year-old murder involving a U.S. Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't planning to bring Brenner back,'' DeMille said
in a telephone interview, ``but Paramount came to me and asked if I
would do a sequel because they have a possibility of getting
Travolta again.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing about a recurring character is not something that
interests DeMille, although he brought back ``Plum Island''
protagonist John Corey in ``The Lion's Game.'' In the new novel,
Corey, a wisecracking, politically incorrect former New York
homicide cop, must track down a Libyan terrorist who has killed a
planeload of passengers in New York and intends to kill all the
pilots who took part in a 1986 raid that killed his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem easy to keep using the same character, but it's
difficult to re-create him. I had to go back and reread `Plum
Island' to see how he spoke and acted.''
</P>
<P>
   To research the sequel to ``The General's Daughter,'' DeMille,
55, returned to Vietnam last year to visit the places where he
fought and served in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad in a lot of ways,'' he said. ``Part of the sadness
is that we realized we were not young kids anymore. The same ground
we covered 30 years ago with 70-pound packs was not so easy now.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMille will sign books at 7 p.m. Monday at Chapter 11 bookstore
at Peachtree Battle Shopping Center. 2345-A Peachtree Road N.E.,
404-237-7199.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fact and fiction: Richard Price, the best-selling author of
``Freedomland'' and ``Clockers,'' has signed a deal with Alfred A.
Knopf to write a novel based on the murder of Jonathan Levin, son
of Time-Warner chairman Gerald Levin. Levin, a popular teacher at a
Bronx high school, was tortured and killed in his apartment in 1997
by one of his students.
</P>
<P>
   Price, who used the Susan Smith case as the inspiration for
``Freedomland,'' plans to do something similar with the Levin case,
Knopf editor Robin Desser told the New York Daily News. ``It's a
book inspired by the themes inherent in the case, which have come
up often for Richard in his years working with underprivileged and
poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the book will explore ``whether there's a dark
side to being a saint and about who holds up someone as a saint.
The way Levin was portrayed made Richard think a lot about those
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary event: Frederick Busch, whose novel ``The Night
Inspector'' has been nominated for a National Book Critics Circle
Award, will read from his works at two events Wednesday at Emory
University. A colloquium is scheduled at 2 p.m. in the Joseph Jones
Room of the Robert Woodruff Library, 540 Asbury Circle N.E., with a
reading in the same location at 8:15 p.m. As the author of ``A
Dangerous Profession: A Book About the Writing Life,'' Busch also
is expected to talk about what he learned by exploring the careers
of Ernest Hemingway, Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens,
John O'Hara and others. Both events are free and open to the
public. Information: 404-727-4683.

 &HT;    The heart and soul of Gordon Parks' photography
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Photographer. Poet. Film director. Novelist. If there
is a Renaissance man in American arts, it is Gordon Parks.
</P>
<P>
   As a hard-hitting photojournalist for Life magazine, he gave
bigotry and poverty a human face. But he also has made voluptuous
photos in which beauty is the subject. The breadth of his
photographic career, which will be evident in ``Half Past Autumn:
The Art of Gordon Parks,'' opening Saturday at Emory University's
Michael C. Carlos Museum, would have been achievement enough for
any artist. But not for Parks. In the course of his 87 years, the
Kansas native's creative impulses have resulted in five books,
volumes of poetry, 11 films _ including the landmark Hollywood hit
``Shaft'' _ sonatas, concertos and a ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His mane and signature moustache are white, and Parks looks a
bit frail, but he is still hard at work. Taking a break from the
sonata he is composing for his four children in his Manhattan
apartment, Parks came to Atlanta this week for the Carlos opening
and found time to answer some questions about his life and career.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You seem to have been a mature photographer from your very
first picture. How did you get interested in photography and how
did you learn your medium?
</P>
<P>
   A: I picked it up accidentally after seeing a newsreel in
Chicago, where I was a waiter on the railway. I bought a camera for
$7.50, and I was off. I didn't even know how to unload it. (After
shooting a roll and leaving it at the camera shop to be developed),
I picked up the pictures and told them it was my first roll. They
said, ``If you keep this up, we'll give you a show in our window,''
and they did. It was instinctive. I had seen the work of the
photographers of the Farm Security Administration, the best
documentary photographers in the world. When I saw what was being
accomplished with a camera against poverty, I thought perhaps I
could do the same thing against racism.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a favorite photo?
</P>
<P>
   A: My signature picture was my first official picture for the
Farm Security Administration in 1942, ``American Gothic.'' When I
went to Washington D.C., I was confronted with the worst sort of
discrimination, which I didn't expect here of all places. I met
Ella Watson, a charwoman. I put a broom and a mop in her hand and
stood her in front of the American flag. It was an indictment of
the government. They didn't want it in government files. I had
thought it was destroyed. Then one day, I was on a plane to New
York and saw that it had been published in The Washington Post. I
didn't go home when I got to New York. I took the shuttle to D.C.
immediately and got the negative.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've dealt with such polarities in your work, from fashion
to crime. What did it mean to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was experimenting. I had a yen toward fashion photography.
It intrigued me. There is nothing more beautiful than a beautiful
woman in a beautiful outfit. I didn't have any trouble getting in
that line of work.
</P>
<P>
   After working at the Farm Security Administration, I went to
Harper's Bazaar and showed my pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The art director liked it but told me the magazine didn't hire
black people. Then I went to (then Conde Nast editorial director)
Alexander Liberman at Vogue. I thought, ``Here it comes again,''
but he gave me a try. I worked for Vogue for five years. I learned
a lot, and it eventually helped me get my job at Life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After returning from your Paris assignments with Life, you
threw yourself into some tough assignments on the civil rights
movement and Harlem gangs. Were you ever afraid?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't afraid. I was concerned. It's difficult to get into
a gang. They had to have faith in you. And I had to have faith in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you make the transition from still photography to
moving pictures?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, it came out of my first novel, ``The Learning
Tree.'' (Film director) John Cassavetes read the book and called
and asked me to do a movie of my book. I said, ``There aren't any
black directors in Hollywood,'' but he convinced me to come. Warner
Bros. asked me to write the screenplay, direct, write the music and
produce. It was all new to me, but the screenplay was not that
difficult and the music was in my soul and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You often credit your
</P>
<P>
   background for your success in life. Family is important to you,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was blessed with a wonderful mother and father. They
encouraged me not to let discrimination stop me. My dad said, ``You
waltz around your enemies and do a fox trot on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So many photographers idolize you. Do you feel like a hero?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel as though what I've done was for survival. There's no
genius to it. A lot of people limit themselves as to what they can
or can't do. I realized that I was suffering under the woes of
discrimination, poverty and bigotry, but I had to leave a channel
open. As each success came, I became more confident. I freed
myself. ... Photography comes from the heart. If you don't have it
there, it won't work.

 &HT;    `Others' reach beyond predictable thriller
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Others'' starts off on familiar slasher-movie turf: a
female college student at night, a bathtub, a great ``gotcha!''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Others'' isn't like the others. This new NBC series (a
tryout for a few weeks) about a small group of low-rent
Ghostbusters keeps heading off in unforeseen directions,
confounding expectations. It may not always please an audience
looking for simple thrills on a Saturday night, but there's some
emotional heft here, some interesting performances, some nuance
(for TV, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   The Others are a band of folks with extrasensory powers who can
see into other worlds, particularly the spirit world of the
recently dead. In Saturday's pilot, a newcomer reluctantly joins
the group: Marian (Julianne Nicholson, with the looks and appeal of
the young Shirley MacLaine), a college student who doesn't want her
``fearsome talent'' to communicate with ghosts. But the ghosts want
her, so she joins this disparate little group.
</P>
<P>
   They're led by Elmer (Bill Cobbs, the great black actor of many
films, such as ``The Bodyguard''), a wise but physically failing
elder. Satori is a New Age seer; Mark, a med student and
``empathic''; Albert (John Aylward, who was Dr. Anspaugh on
``ER''), a blind, crotchety visionary; and Warren, a jittery guy
who can't control his talent.
</P>
<P>
   These guys don't just see dead people, a la Haley Joel Osment in
``The Sixth Sense.'' They're more like grief counselors for the
living, de-haunting houses and helping those left behind to move on
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Others'' is being promoted as a straight thriller, from
two former ``X-Files'' writers and the writers of the Michael
Douglas movie ``The Game.'' But like ``The Game,'' it's more than
it initially appears to be. Tonight's show looks like it's going
stalker-vs.-student, but changes course. An upcoming episode, about
a wife grieving for her dead husband and baby, is poignant,
bordering on tear-jerking (think Demi Moore in ``Ghost,'' only
without the potter's wheel).
</P>
<P>
   There's a tendency for the show to dip into what might be called
parapsychobabble, as well as some scenes that come perilously close
to over-the-top camp, like the guy who gets a premonition and is
knocked backward as if pole-axed in the forehead. But there's an
offbeat sensibility at work here, as you would expect from writers
who came up with ``The Game'' and numerous ``X-Files'' episodes. It
has an other-ness that makes it worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Others''
</P>

GRACE L. MITCHELL, AT 91; MOTHER OF F. LEE BAILEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace L. Mitchell, a pioneering day care provider who embarked
on her career to remain close to her young son, lawyer F. Lee
Bailey, died Jan. 27 in her home in Delray Beach, Fla. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A former elementary school teacher, Mrs. Mitchell founded Green
Acres Day School in her apartment in Waltham, Mass. in 1933 in
order to remain close to her son and continue her career in
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lee was only 5 weeks old, I was already missing
teaching,'' she said in a story published in The Boston Globe May
17, 1976. ``I said OK, that's it, I'll start a nursery school. I
didn't even know what a nursery school was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later she was an adviser to the US government's World
War II ``war nursery'' program.
</P>
<P>
   She owned and operated Green Acres Day School until 1988. She
was also a founder of the Living and Learning Centers, a chain of
more than 25 day care centers throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mitchell earned a bachelor's degree at Tufts University
when she was in her mid-40s, a master's degree at Harvard
University when she was 55, and a doctorate at Antioch College when
she was 70 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, she summed up her educational philosophy as ``I am, I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   She said ``Life is a process of becoming. My greatest
satisfaction is the joy of having been a part in helping other
people grow.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Boston Herald on June 10, 1979, she
said it was never necessary for day care to be traumatic for
children. ``Children learn more about emotions by experiencing them
in a day care setting than they ever could from a textbook,'' she
said, and described the sound of children running and playing as a
``good noise'' and a positive indication of the health of any day
care center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides F. Lee, son, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., she leaves a
daughter, Nancy C., of West Palm Beach; another son, William E., of
Boston; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

<P>
   SUVO GRLO, Yugoslavia _ Serbs who survived a bus attack in
northern Kosovo on Wednesday huddled around a wood stove in the
village school Thursday, saying they felt more trapped and worried
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   A day after two neighbors were killed in an ambush, the
villagers left their houses, clustered at the bottom of a steep
slope of sheer ice, down a remote country road, to seek support and
comfort. The 130 Serbs live in the tiny enclave of Suvo Grlo,
surrounded by Albanian homesteads and villages. Behind them rises
the wall of mountains of Montenegro, and before them stretch the
highlands of Drenica, the heartland of the most determined Kosovo
Albanian nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   To escape this isolation, the Serbs had been using a weekly bus
service, operated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It
was their one lifeline in recent months as it shuttled from their
village and another village, Banja, to the Serb district of
Mitrovica some 30 kilometers away. The bus trip always brought the
villagers welcome freedom of movement, but on Wednesday it proved a
death trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the bus,'' said Milomirka Tomasevic, 47, crouching
close to the stove. ``I went to Mitrovica to buy a few things. I
know when they fired on us I threw myself on the floor but I do not
remember anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   She was not hurt in the attack but appeared to still be in
shock. She began to weep. ``If I die there will be no one to take
care of me, I have no father or sister or brother. You have to have
someone to cry after you, I have no one,'' she wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Milomir Tomasevic, 28, was also on the bus, with his brother and
sister-in-law. They had gone to buy coffee and cigarettes. He
escaped unhurt but his 24-year-old brother, Stojadin, was badly
wounded, he said. French soldiers, part of KFOR, the NATO-led
peacekeeping troops, had evacuated him to their hospital and he was
waiting for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most horrible thing that happened,'' he said. ``We
trusted KFOR. Until now we were 100 percent convinced they were
guarding us and that's why we traveled on the bus. But after what
happened yesterday, I do not trust anyone anymore, absolutely no
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasevic complained that the peacekeeping troops, who were
escorting the bus in two armored vehicles, did not react to the
attack, neither firing on nor pursuing the attackers. ``NATO could
bring in 200 soldiers here but the way they are acting it will
serve as nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket attack on the U.N. bus was the worst case of violence
against any escorted Serb convoy in Kosovo and came as a blow to
peacekeeping efforts to improve security.
</P>
<P>
   The attack could push more Serbs to leave the village and other
isolated Serb enclaves. Already 40 percent of the population of
Suvo Grlo has fled to Serbia. And Thursday, villagers said this
latest attack might make them think again about abandoning their
homes. ``No one will be fool enough to stay, if there is one more
incident,'' Tomasevic said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has suspended bus service to Serb areas in
Kosovo while the attack is being investigated. The buses were
frequently portrayed as a sign that normality was returning to
Kosovo, but their future use is now in doubt. In fact, these
villagers said they would no longer use them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claims by peacekeepers that ethnic violence is slowly
decreasing, the incident exposed the unceasing desire for revenge
among the ethnic Albanians who suffered at Serb hands during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian homes up the hill from the Serb houses in Suvo Grlo
all show the damage of the burning and looting conducted by Serbian
forces during the war. Ten Albanians were killed from this little
hamlet and most houses burned, said a shopkeeper, Zenel Sinani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure it was not someone from this village, but it was
done by someone whose heart was burned, whose family was killed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanian youths who stopped Thursday at the scene of the bus
attack, on a lonely hairpin bend near the village of Vitak, were
callous in their reaction. ``Only two killed, I wish there had been
more,'' said one, before he ran off to hail a passing bus.

<P>
   Heartthrob-of-the-moment  &UR; Ricky Martin &LR;  stopped by the White
House on Tuesday night to talk about serious matters with an aide
to the president and make chitchat with the
Vida-Loca-liver-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with aide  &UR; Maria Echaveste &LR;  to tell her that he
was worried about naval bombing exercises on a Puerto Rican island,
Martin stopped by the Oval Office. ``The substance of the
conversation that he had was with Maria,'' said White House
spokesman  &UR; Joe Lockhart &LR; . ``The visit with the president was
social.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Supermodel  &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR;  has pleaded guilty in Toronto to
beating her assistant while making a movie in Canada and, by prior
legal agreement, has ``expressed remorse'' as punishment.
 &UR; Georgina Galanis &LR; , who worked for Campbell for nine days in 1998,
said Campbell hit her in the head with a phone, punched her
shoulder, grabbed her neck and shook her head. Galanis has filed a
lawsuit in New York against Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   - Asked the ``most shocking thing you have ever done,'' bad-boy
designer  &UR; Alexander McQueen &LR;  told V magazine that he had drawn an
image of a male sexual organ ``inside the  &UR; Prince of &LR; 
 &UR; Wales &LR; ' jacket I made at Savile Row.'' The deed gave the
mischief-maker ``an internal smile'' every time the prince was on
the news.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Patrick Robertson &LR; , PR man for  &UR; Gen. Augusto Pinochet &LR; , has
been signed by  &UR; Crown Prince Alexander &LR;  of Yugoslavia, says the
Times of London. Robertson is supposed to help Alexander persuade
 &UR; Slobodan Milosevic &LR;  to allow the royals to return to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   - A study taken by SxSports Med.com found that 78 percent of
people suffering a sports injury ``had less sex compared to before
they were injured.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SETTING THE MUSICAL RECORD STRAIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deborah Meier &LR; , who used to be director of the Central Park
East I elementary school in East Harlem, has strong objections to
``Music of the Heart,'' the movie set at that school.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is advertised by Miramax as the true story of Roberta
Guaspari, the music teacher who brought violin lessons to what's
portrayed as a stereotypical inner-city urban school. In the movie,
Guaspari _ with the principal as her ally and another music teacher
as her foe _ single-handedly turns the program into a success.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Meier writes in Brill's Content, the school that
hired  &UR; Roberta Tzavaras &LR;  (the real name of ``Guaspari'') was
already a highly successful alternative public school and Meier,
its founding director, received a MacArthur fellowship for her work
at the time the film is set. Only a small percentage of students
were affected by Tzavaras' program, Meier writes, and the music
teacher on staff before her ``was the conductor of three large
choruses that performed citywide, expertly taught large numbers of
children the recorder, produced an annual opera that brought much
acclaim to the school and staged an occasional Broadway-style
musical.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Meier, ``The reputation of the school and many of
its teachers were ... harmed in order to tell a story that, by
confirming prejudices about public schools, Miramax knew it could
sell. ... What gives Hollywood the right to play loose with the
real lives of real people _ and real schools _ just to tickle the
heartstrings of a sentimental public?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STAMPING OUT ERRORS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After destroying 100 million Grand Canyon stamps because their
captions had mistakenly placed the natural wonder in Colorado, not
Arizona, the Postal Service has admitted that the corrected version
has the image flipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sticking with it,'' said Postal Service spokesman  &UR; Don &LR; 
 &UR; Smeraldi &LR; . ``No matter how you look at it, the Grand Canyon makes a
beautiful postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're used to seeing are big, movie-like sex scenes; on
tables, they tear each other's clothes off. I hate seeing that. If
somebody tore my clothes off, I would be furious. Think about it.
Some guy rips off your shirt, and you'd be, like, Wait a minute, I
spent $150 on this shirt!''
</P>
<P>

scenes, in Mirabella.

legal agreement, has ``expressed remorse'' as punishment.
 &UR; Georgina Galanis &LR; , who worked for Campbell for nine days in 1998,

   &UR; SETTING THE MUSICAL RECORD STRAIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deborah Meier &LR; , who used to be director of the Central Park
East I elementary school in East Harlem, has strong objections to
``Music of the Heart,'' the movie set at that school.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is advertised by Miramax as the true story of Roberta
Guaspari, the music teacher who brought violin lessons to what's
portrayed as a stereotypical inner-city urban school. In the movie,
Guaspari _ with the principal as her ally and another music teacher
as her foe _ single-handedly turns the program into a success.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Meier writes in Brill's Content, the school that
hired  &UR; Roberta Tzavaras &LR;  (the real name of ``Guaspari'') was
already a highly successful alternative public school and Meier,
its founding director, received a MacArthur fellowship for her work
at the time the film is set. Only a small percentage of students
were affected by Tzavaras' program, Meier writes, and the music
teacher on staff before her ``was the conductor of three large
choruses that performed citywide, expertly taught large numbers of
children the recorder, produced an annual opera that brought much
acclaim to the school and staged an occasional Broadway-style
musical.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Meier, ``The reputation of the school and many of
its teachers were ... harmed in order to tell a story that, by
confirming prejudices about public schools, Miramax knew it could
sell. ... What gives Hollywood the right to play loose with the
real lives of real people _ and real schools _ just to tickle the
heartstrings of a sentimental public?''

BAUER EXPECTED TO BOW OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gary Bauer, the religious conservative who crusaded
against abortion, sharply criticized human-rights abuses in China,
and claimed to be the only real Reagan Republican in the race, is
expected to end his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer received only 1 percent of the vote in Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary and finished fourth out of six GOP candidates in
last mnth's Iowa caucuses. He did not resume campaigning after New
Hampshire but returned to his home outside Washington and scheduled
an announcement for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His expected departure from the GOP field follows seven others _
Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander, Patrick Buchanan, Bob Smith, John
Kasich, Elizabeth Dole, and Orrin Hatch _ and removes one of the
most passionate moral messengers and pungent debaters from the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly that the big civil rights challenge going
into the next century will be whether or not we can set another
place at the table for America's unborn children,'' Bauer said in a
candidate debate in Des Moines, Iowa. There, and in four other
meetings, Bauer tried but failed to extract a pledge from Texas
Governor George W. Bush that he, like Bauer, would choose a
runningmate who opposed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Bauer would endorse Bush. Bush, who is
positioning himself as more conservative than Arizona Senator John
McCain as they both woo primary voters in South Carolina,
reportedly spoke to Bauer, and aides say he would welcome Bauer's
support.
</P>
<P>
   As the former president of the Family Research Council, a
public-policy think tank, Bauer was well-known in Washington as an
advocate for traditional values and an effective spokesman around
the country for religious conservatives. But in a field that had
its share of articulate social conservatives _ most notably former
ambassador Alan Keyes _ and rivals like Bush and Steve Forbes with
much bigger campaign war chests, Bauer was unable to break through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's commitment to the the causes of social conservatives
cannot be questioned,'' said Eddie Mahe, a GOP consultant. ``But he
just did not meet the criteria that the American electorate by and
large envisions in her president: stature, credentials, and
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, 53, grew in Newport, Ky., with an alcoholic father, a
mother who struggled to make ends meet, and a grandmother who
believed that if she took Bauer to church, she could protect him
from the town's organized crime that had claimed the life of one of
her sons.
</P>
<P>
   A born-again Christian, Bauer went on to college, got a degree
from Georgetown Law School, worked for the Republican National
Committee, and was both a top Education Department official and a
key domestic policy advisr in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer frequently described himself as the true heir to his
political idol, Ronald Reagan. In addition to calling for a
constitutional amendment to end legal abortion and no concessions
on gay rights, Bauer advocated a flat tax rate of 16 percent,
school vouchers and school prayer, and the construction of a
missile-defense system. He made a tougher China policy a
centerpiece of his campaign and said China should be denied Most
Favored Nation status until it stopped religious persecution,
coercive abortions, and the export of nuclear technology to
America's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's major contribution to the race was that he effectively
put the China issue on the table, which is of growing importance,
and he forced a debate on what our China policy should be in the
new century,'' said Greg Mueller, a Forbes adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer raised about $7 million through a network of small donors,
but he never could compete with the wealthy Forbes, whose message
in 2000 was targeted much more at social conservatives than it had
been in 1996. Forbes did better than Bauer among Iowa's
conservative Christian voters, and he got the endorsement of the
conservative Manchester Union-Leader. Bauer did not receive the
support of evangelical leaders like Pat Robertson, who believe Bush
has a better chance of winning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bauer gamely trooped on through Iowa and New Hampshire.
His entourage was small _ a couple of aides, maybe a reporter or
two, and sometimes his 21-year-old daughter, Elyse. And there were
bumps along the road: He held a press conference with his wife and
three children last fall to deny rumors that he was having an
affair with a female staffer. Monday in New Hampshire, he tumbled
backward off a stage at a pancake-flipping event.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, he remained good humored. Bauer liked to quip that
women voters liked him for his pro-family message, not his
``debonair good looks.'' And when, in a recent debate, Bush piously
said would take the expression ``Dear God, help me'' with him into
the Oval Office, Bauer shot back: ``So would we, governor.''

COMMENTARY: CORPORATIONS ON STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat came to Davos this year, and there were two people
he insisted on meeting with: Bill Clinton of the United States of
America and Steve Case of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   I never got to ask Arafat whether he thought Bill C. was more
important than Steve C. After all, AOL-Time Warner has a market
value exceeding the gross national product of most countries Arafat
deals with. It's no wonder that when you ask White House officials
what the president did in Davos, they say he had a few
``bilaterals'' _ meetings with other heads of state and business.
When I asked the spokesperson for one of the giant technology firms
what the company's CEO was doing in Davos, the answer was: ``He's
holding bilaterals'' with other heads of state and business. Every
day the line between companies and countries blurs a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it. As the walls around the world disappear,
companies can increasingly compete everywhere. And when you can
compete everywhere, in many businesses you  &UR; must &LR;  compete
everywhere. This is making companies bigger than ever, whether it
is AOL-Time Warner, or Exxon-Mobil or Microsoft. World leaders,
investors and the media are naturally dazzled by the sheer size and
power that some of these companies are amassing.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to democracies when companies grow to size
extra-extra-large, in order to compete globally, but democratic
regulatory institutions _ like the antitrust division of the
Justice Department _ remain a size small?
</P>
<P>
   At a press lunch in Davos, Bill Gates was asked how Microsoft
could have hired lobbying firms to try to defund the Justice
Department's antitrust division, when it had a case pending before
the antitrust division. Flashing anger, Gates said this was ``an
outrageous characterization _ it's untrue ... The only thing that
we ever spoke out on in terms of funding is p.r. funding.'' The
Justice Department, Gates said, shouldn't be leaking or promoting
``negative activities against U.S. companies overseas. I wasn't
involved in any of the specifics of that, but to characterize that
as defunding ... is an outrageous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This answer was disturbing on two levels. First, the notion that
it was OK for Microsoft to engage lobbyists even just to reduce the
public relations budget of the Justice Department's antitrust
division _ while Microsoft had a case pending before it _ suggests
a moral obtuseness that is, well, outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the antitrust division of the Justice Department  &UR; has no
P.R. budget! &LR;  It has one spokeswoman assigned to it from the
Justice's central office of public affairs, and her salary and
related p.r. expenses are paid by public affairs, and they amount
to roughly $100,000. Yet, according to The Washington Post,
Microsoft's lobbyists, and several nonprofit foundations Microsoft
brought to its headquarters on an all-expense-paid trip, tried to
get the fiscal 2000 budget for the Justice Department's antitrust
division slashed by $9 million _ from Justice's request of $114
million (a modest increase so it could hire more lawyers) down to
$105 million (so it would have to cut back activities).
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wasn't trying to reduce the antitrust division's
ability to engage in P.R.; Microsoft was trying to reduce its
ability to engage in antitrust _ in a year when there had been a 30
percent  &UR; increase  &LR; in corporate mergers. As The Post noted, while
corporate lobbying over policies is normal, it is rather unusual
for a firm ``to seek an across-the-board cut in a department's
budget, especially in the middle of a major court battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Old problem _ dangerous new twist. America's antitrust laws were
initially motivated by two concerns, argues the Harvard University
political theorist Michael Sandel _ preventing big monopolies from
overwhelming consumers and preventing big business from
overwhelming democratic government. Those laws first arose when
businesses grew beyond the control of state and local institutions,
and therefore some federal power was needed to rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now business is growing to global dimensions, but governments
are still national _ so government is again struggling to keep
pace,'' observed Sandel. ``In a world without walls, we are going
to have to come up with new ways for government to rein in the
power of global corporations, and prevent them from buying up
democracy. Instead of just being dazzled by these mega-mergers,
there should be a nagging voice in us all asking: Is democracy
going to be bought up too?''

VALUE CITY TO BUY FILENE'S BASEMENT FOR ABOUT $15 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Troubled Filene's Basement Corp., once a retail legend,
was seemingly spared Thursday from a worse fate by Value City
Department Stores Inc. of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement has been doing business in Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection since August, and its most recently released
sales figures were cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Value City agreed to buy Filene's Basement assets
for about $15 million in cash and stock. It also agreed to assume
roughly $74 million in the chain's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new beginning,'' said Samuel J. Gerson, Filene's
Basement chairman and chief executive, who said he will continue to
run a 14-store chain under the Filene's Basement name as a separate
division of Value City.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, it's likely local shoppers will see
few immediate changes at the Basement's eight Massachusetts stores.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might have happened if Value City's offer hadn't
materialized, Gerson said of Filene's Basement, ``There was a
possibility it could have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The sales agreement must be approved by the US Bankruptcy Court,
something Gerson said he expects to happen shortly. He said he
hopes the deal will be completed by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement's new beginning will not come without pain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, the Wellesley, Mass. company expects to
close its eight Aisle 3 stores. Open only on weekends, Aisle 3
employs a part-time work force.
</P>
<P>
   Still, another 700 jobs will be eliminated, though none in
Massachusetts. The reductions come on top of what resulted from 35
previous store closings in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, the Basement operated 59 stores and
employed 4,300 people. While many cuts came from layoffs, another
600 jobs were reduced by attrition, retirement, or voluntary
departure. After the Aisle 3 closings, Filene's Basement will
operate 14 stores and employ about 1,700 people.
</P>
<P>
   As Value City finds overlap between its operations and the
Basement's, small additional layoffs could hit the Basement's
remaining work force, Gerson said. But the ``vast majority'' of the
remaining jobs will be saved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gerson, Value City chairman and chief executive Jay
L. Schottenstein is considering reopening three Basement stores
that had closed in or near Washington, D.C. Value City might open
new Basement stores as well in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who wants to build another business,'' Gerson
said of Schottenstein, a member of Value City's founding family,
widely regarded in retail circles.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, Filene's Basement was the place to go for
bargains on name-brand clothing. Indeed, some of its famous sales
on bridal gowns and designer suits helped turn shopping into a
contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the company lost its way. As competition
intensified, Filene's Basement expanded too rapidly and its
financial resources couldn't support the growth.
</P>
<P>
   While its bargain formula found favor with urban customers,
surburbanites seemed to prefer finding their bargains at T.J. Maxx
and Marshalls, chains owned by the TJX Cos. of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Once an upstart, TJX now dwarfs the Basement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, department stores that the Basement had always
depended on for much of its brand-name merchandise found better
ways to get rid of last year's styles. As more and more outlet
stores opened, the Basement found it harder to stock its racks with
the designer apparel that made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   Then came casual Fridays _ bad news for a place like Filene's
Basement that specialized in suits and dressy attire. Throw in Y2K
problems with the company's computer system, and the Basement was a
retailer in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   All those changes meant big losses for Filene's Basement and,
facing cash-flow problems, forced the retailer to file for
bankruptcy protection in August.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Basement's most recently disclosed financial
information, A.G. Edwards analyst Robert F. Buchanan wondered why
Value City would want to buy such an ailing retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Value City is inheriting a busted mouse trap,'' he
said. ``I'm adopting a show-me attitude (about this acquisition). I
think there's an element of risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Value City thinks Filene's Basement is a good risk.
In its 105 big-box stores, Value City now sells much of the same
brand-name clothing as Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the Basement's best locations to a company that
already enjoys $1.67 billion in annual sales, Value City will have
more muscle to get better deals from its vendors, said company
president Mike Tanner. ``This union will strengthen our
merchandising team and give us greater buying power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gerson, acquiring Filene's Basement could add $300
million in additional sales to Value City. The union will also mean
shoppers will see better-quality goods at lower prices at Filene's
Basement stores, Gerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's (Schottenstein) a very good merchant, a real deal
maker,'' said George Iacono, a former Value City president who now
runs TJX's A.J. Wright division.
</P>
<P>
   In Value City, Filene's Basement is getting a parent with deep
pockets, said Stewart Cohen, chief executive of Paragon Capital LLC
of Needham, one of the Basement's main lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Combine Value City's resources and Schottenstein's savvy with
Gerson's merchandising skills and ``watch what Sam can
accomplish,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Basement's recent history, ``this is a
better-than-expected outcome,'' he said of Value City's proposed
purchase. ``I can only see win-win for both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Value City's planned acquisition of Filene's Basement isn't
win-win for everybody. Investors who bought Filene's Basement stock
are likely to get nothing for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors said they felt misled by ``rosy'' predictions the
Basement made shortly before it filed for Chaper 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this company has not been managed for shareholders but
for the benefit of upper management,'' said Scott Poague, a Kansas
investor who said he bought 13,000 shares a few weeks before the
bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of the Value City deal, Gerson said, Filene's
Basement ``will continue. It will flourish. And it will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Value City rose 1/2 to
close at 16 7/16.

CALIFORNIA FIRM TO ACQUIRE ANDOVER.NET

   Andover.net of Acton, Mass., a leading producer of Linux-related
Internet sites, is being acquired for about $1 billion by VA Linux
Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., a leading maker of Linux-based
computer systems, in a bid to create the world's leading source of
Linux computer hardware, software and support.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux went public in December, rising from $30 to $239 in its
first day of trading. Since, the stock's value has declined
sharply, closing Thursday at 128 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop VA Linux and Andover.net from coming to
terms. Shareholders of Andover.net, which closed at 45 1/8 on
Nasdaq, will get .425 share of VA Linux for each of their
Andover.net shares. The deal works out to $968 million, based on
the closing prices, for Andover.net's 17.8 million shares
outstanding. As part of the purchase price, Andover.net investors
will receive $60 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux shares dropped 8 7/8 while Andover.net's stock rose 9
1/8.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux was one of the first companies to specialize in making
computers specifically tailored to run Linux, an operating system
that is being rapidly adopted in corporate America as an
alternative to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is open source software, in which the raw source code is
made available to the public free of charge, making it easy for
users to introduce their own modifications.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux is a major booster of Linux and other open source
products. The company operates Linux.com, a Web site popular among
open source programmers. In addition, VA Linux recently launched
SourceForge, a site where open source programmers can publish their
code and work jointly on software projects.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Andover.net runs a number of popular open source
Web sites, including Slashdot, a discussion forum for open source
programmers, and Freshmeat, a guide to new open source programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition moves VA Linux forward on the path to being
the biggest name in Linux and open source,'' said VA Linux chief
executive Larry Augustin.
</P>
<P>
   Andover.net chief executive Bruce Twickler said he was attracted
to the deal partly due to the popularity of linux.com, which
attracts about 12 million page views per month. Twickler said the
combination of linux.com with Andover.net's popular sites, like
Slashdot and Freshmeat, would create the leading on-line source of
news and information about Linux and other open source software
projects. ``We go from 51 percent to 67 percent of Linux traffic
share,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Twickler wanted to drive Andover.net into the
software consulting business. Andover.net recently purchased
QuestionExchange, a Web site where companies post offers to pay for
solutions to specific technical problems. But Andover.net has
little visibility in corporate America, while VA Linux has
developed a following there through its sales of Linux hardware.
Twickler hopes that the combined companies will be able to offer a
complete hardware, support and consulting service for businesses
interested in open source solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst with International Data Corp.,
questioned the wisdom of the deal. ``It looks like quite a bit of
money to spend on a Web publishing organization,'' Kusnetzky said.
He worries that VA Linux faces fierce competition in its core
business, as IBM Corp., Dell Computer Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co. and
other major firms all begin making Linux computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have looked at their portfolio and said `what are the
things that would further their success?' '' said Kusnetzky, who
thinks VA Linux should be buying firms that develop enhanced
services for high-end corporate users. ``I never would have thought
of a publication business,'' he said.

LOW-QUALITY CARE FOR WORKFARE CHILDREN IS LINKED TO DEVELOPMENT
PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Fla.)   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 1 million additional toddlers and preschoolers are in
child care because of changes in the welfare laws, but many are in
low-quality care and are lagging in language and social
development, according to a new study of how welfare revisions have
affected young children.
</P>
<P>
   The study of nearly 1,000 single mothers moving from welfare to
work found that many of their children had been placed in child
care where they spent hours watching television or wandering
aimlessly and had little interaction with their caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Dr. Bruce Fuller of the University of California
at Berkeley and Dr. Sharon Lynn Kagan of Yale, included information
from interviews with the mothers and visits to the child-care
settings. The mothers, whose children were 1 to 3 and a half years
old, were in California, Connecticut and Florida. Many of the
toddlers from welfare families showed developmental delays, the
study said. For example, when asked to point to a picture of a book
from among three different pictures, fewer than 2 in 5 of the
toddlers in the study correctly pointed to the book, compared with
a national norm of 4 out of 5 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare reform promised two things,'' Fuller said, ``to move
people from welfare to work, where it succeeded in spades, and to
improve kids' environment over time. It's too early to say that
kids are worse off in mediocre child care than they were at home
with their mothers on welfare, but this study did find early
warning signals of a child-care problem that's going to get worse
as the work requirements of the welfare laws ramp up from 30
percent to 50 percent of the women getting assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors cautioned that their measures of child development
probably reflected the well-documented lag of children from welfare
families behind middle-class norms as much as child-care
arrangements. The impact of the child care will become clearer,
they said, as further rounds of observation are completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that high-quality child care can help children, and
that poor children can benefit the most,'' Kagan said, ``so we hope
this will be a wake-up call to do something about the quality of
child care in this country. The quality of day-care centers is not
great for middle-class families, but it's surprising and
distressing to see the extent to which welfare families' quality
was even lower _ with some exceptions like the day-care centers we
saw in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big surprise in the study, Kagan said, was how much
the child care situation varied by state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to make statements about welfare reform
because it's not one welfare reform, it's 50 different welfare
reforms,'' she said. ``States have used their options to create
very different models.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for example, the study found that more than
three-fourths of the mothers surveyed put their young children in
unregulated care, for example, with a relative or neighbor, and
only 13 percent received any child-care subsidy. Those who did not
receive subsidies paid an average of $292 for child care each
month.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, by contrast, 70 percent of the mothers had their
children in a day-care center or preschool, and half received a
form of public child-care subsidy, including slots in day-care
centers and vouchers worth up to $5,000 yearly. Those who did not
receive subsidies spent an average of $62 a month on child care.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers' average pay varied geographically, as well, ranging
from $5.45 an hour in Tampa, Fla., to $7.24 an hour in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   California fell in between on all four measures.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the disparities reflected differences in supply: Tampa
had 42 slots in day-care centers per 100 young children, while
Santa Clara County, Calif., had only 11.
</P>
<P>
   In all three states, children spend about 40 hours a week in
child care, the study found.

GOVERNOR SAYS $1.1B TAX-CUT PLAN WILL PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci Thursday vowed to press on with
his $1.1 billion tax cut plan despite the stunning news that the
cost of the massive Big Dig project is expected to jump $1.4
billion to $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, making his first public comments since the new price
tag was announced this week, also expressed confidence that
managers of the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project can
absorb the additional costs without needing state funds.
</P>
<P>
   But plans by Big Dig officials to raise tolls on the
Massachusetts Turnpike and the Logan Airport tunnels to cover
skyrocketing project costs is drawing the ire of businesses that
depend on the highway and the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   James T. Wall, president of US Shuttle of Boston, a van company
that carries about 30,000 passengers a month to and from Logan,
said his company will see operating costs rise from $400,000 to
more than $1 million. Company vans, he said, will be forced to use
more sidestreets.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about one-third of the company's fleet uses side
streets in Chelsea, Everett, Medford and Somerville in order to
avoid tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this happens, our only alternative will be to divert 100
percent to the streets in the suburbs,'' Wall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really disheartened by this whole thing,'' Wall said,
saying his company's increasing costs will be passed onto
customers. ``We think it a phony scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he had full confidence that James Kerasiotes, the
Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman who is overseeing the project, and
Patrick Moynihan, the project director, will develop a financing
scheme to handle the cost hikes.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the two men as ``some of the best managers.'' and
said he was sure they
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also insisted that he was telling the truth in his 1998
gubernatorial campaign when he said the Big Dig -- which then
carried a $10.8 billion price tag -- would be finished ``on time
and on budget.'' He said the additional costs had only become
evident in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what the case was at the time,'' Cellucci told
reporters at a State House news conference Thursday. ``I gave the
situation at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci, who had been in Washington testifying against an
Internet sales tax when news of the cost overruns was made public
on Tuesday, skirted questions raised by some fiscal watchdogs and
other Beacon Hill leaders about the impact of nearly $2 billion in
tax cuts winning approval from voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cellucci's ballot initiative calling for a $1.1
billion tax cut, voters also will decide another ballot question
that would create tax credits for tolls and auto excise taxes. That
plan, if passed, would cost the state as much as $700 million
annually, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Assocation.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain the fiscal consequences if both ballot
questions are approved, Cellucci refused to comment on the tax
credit issue, saying he would not be ``diverted'' from focusing on
his income tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But he dismissed arguments that the new Big Dig cost should
raise questions about the fiscal prudence of his tax cut plan,
which would be phased in over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it stengthens our arguments for our tax cut,''
Cellucci said, claiming that the reduction of the income tax rate
from 5.85 percent to 5 percent would be a boost for the state's
economy and would, in the long run, increase state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said the financing plan for the highway project
had for some years included hikes in turnpike and tunnel tolls.
``The question of toll hikes has always been part of the finance
plan,'' he said. ``It should be of no suprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor insisted that the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority,
through toll hikes and other revenue-generating moves, will not
need state funds to meet Central Artery cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democratic legislative leaders have called on the
governor to acknowledge that state funds will have to be used to
pay for the project, which is scheduled for completion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas F. Finneran, who has opposed Cellucci's
tax cut plan, said the administration should be given time to prove
its case that the tunrpike authority can develop a plan to cover
the newest cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the revelation of the overrun doesn't necssarily detract
from the governor to make an argument for his tax cut,'' said
Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said he was sure the state's bond ratings would
not be affected by the new Big Dig price tag. He said he and his
financial advisers had made it clear to Wall Street bond rating
agencies last December that the Central Artery project would face
``additional costs,'' though they did not have exact figures at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely discussed,'' Cellucci said. ``This was a
full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien appears to have forced the
administration to disclose the $1.4 billion cost increase this week
because she was refusing to sign off on a $500 million bond issue
the administration needs for capital projects. The bond will be
offerred on the open market in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, O'Brien said the administraton's decision to publicly
reveal the additional costs ``was the first step.'' She said state
officials must now develop a ``long term plan'' that takes into
account the potential fiscal impact if voters approve both ballot
questions.

BUSH YIELDS, MCCAIN TO APPEAR ON NEW YORK BALLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George W. Bush gave in to the inevitable Thursday,
telling supporters who control the New York Republican Party to let
his rival, Sen. John McCain, appear on all the ballots in the
state's presidential primary next month.
</P>
<P>
   The move might help McCain sustain whatever momentum he still
has from his New Hampshire victory. However, it might also somewhat
dilute his image as an ``outsider'' who makes ``the establishment''
tremble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain celebrated the news, proclaiming on his campaign
bus in South Carolina, ``Republicans of New York, rejoice! You're
free! Cast off your chains!''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, New York's Republican leaders had disqualified
McCain from 14 of the state's 31 electoral districts. McCain
compared the bosses to the old Soviet Politburo and, last week,
filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging their rules on
primaries as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Edward Korman, who heard the case last Friday,
seemed to agree with McCain's arguments, saying the rules made for
a ``meaningless primary'' since they were clearly designed to
exclude all candidates but the one chosen by the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Korman is expected to hand down a formal ruling by Monday at the
latest. The state Republican leaders were intending to appeal the
decision if it went McCain's way. But after McCain clobbered Bush
in New Hampshire, several of them began to see the issue as a loser
that could only fuel the Arizona senator's cause and hurt the Texas
governor's.
</P>
<P>
   So, speaking in Delaware, Bush said, tersely, ``Put him on the
ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki issued a statement, agreeing: ``I think that
John McCain should be on the ballot. This should be a campaign
about ideas and issues, not technicalities. I'm confident that
George Bush will win that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush leading McCain in New York by 20 percentage
points _ but they were taken before New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bush may be the one who doesn't make it on all the
state's ballots. Earlier this week, a judge threw his name off the
ballot in a district in the Bronx after campaign workers admitted
to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As a further irony, the fraud would have gone undiscovered but
for a particularly crude move by the Republican leaders to
disqualify Steve Forbes from three districts in Long Island, on the
grounds that some of those who signed his petitions wrote down
their addresses incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Forbes' lawyers, who have nearly unlimited funds,
to look at Bush's own petitions _ and to discover several pages of
signatures that looked suspiciously similar.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions were confirmed when a few of the people whose
names are on the petitions testified that they had never signed
anything of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will still come to the March 7 primary here with a strong
advantage, enjoying the resources and discipline of the state's
Republican machine. Since Republican primary ballots print the
delegate's name in very large letters and the candidate's in very
small ones, many voters will cast their ballots for the delegates,
who, in Bush's case, are the popular local officials.
</P>
<P>
   By Republican rules here, each electoral district holds a
separate primary, and to get on the ballot, a candidate must obtain
signatures from 0.5 percent of the district's registered
Republicans. There are several procedural rules that make the task
harder still.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Korman suggested last week that he might order the rule
changed to 0.1 percent _ in which case McCain could qualify in all
the districts.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats have very different primary rules. Candidates
who collect 5,000 signatures anywhere in the state qualify for the
ballot statewide.

AUSTRIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT WILL INCLUDE FREEDOM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AUSTRIA-EUROPE, AUSTRIA-VOICES) 
(lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Austria's president announced Thursday that he
would swear in a new government on Friday that includes Joerg
Haider's anti-immigrant Freedom Party, setting the country on a
collision course with its 14 partners in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   President Thomas Klestil announced the decision after a final
day of hesitation that was marked by objections to two proposed
Freedom Party members as cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil's decision bowed to the logic of Austrian democracy,
since the Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party led by
Wolfgang Schuessel won enough seats in elections in October to
govern. But it also gave stature to a rightist party that has not
hesitated to employ bigotry and racist vitriol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute declaration by the coalition promising to
work ``for an Austria in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism
have no place,'' reaction was swift. The other 14 governments of
the European Union confirmed that they would downgrade diplomatic
relations with Vienna and isolate the nation, as they had
threatened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said it would recall its ambassador as soon as the
swearing-in is completed. France and Portugal announced that they
would impose sanctions on Friday. And in Washington, a State
Department spokesman, James Foley, reiterated warnings that the
United States would review its relationship with Austria as soon as
Haider's party joined the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the new government, Schuessel will be chancellor. The
sensitive ministries of justice and defense will go to the Freedom
Party, but Haider himself will not be in the government. He has
made it clear that he prefers to remain out of government office
until he is strong enough to become chancellor. Haider's party got
the chance to join a coalition government after talks between
Schuessel and the Social Democrats collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the election in October, the Social Democrats emerged as the
strongest party, but Haider's Freedom Party came in second for the
first time. The right-wing coalition has 104 seats in the
183-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union stand is based on the view that Haider's
politics, including isolated and subsequently regretted expressions
of sympathy for aspects of Hitler's rule, make him incompatible
with the values of the European Union, and on the pragmatic concern
that other extreme-right parties may benefit from his party's
inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Haider's arrival in power has set up a highly charged
test of the respective powers of nations and the embryonic
government of the European Union. How the test is resolved will
weigh heavily on Europe's unity and Europe's future, issues that in
turn affect the United States directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too simplistic to say that we must keep Austria in
Europe at all costs,'' Belgium's foreign minister, Louis Michel,
said Thursday in a statement indicating the passions Haider's rise
have ignited. ``I think Europe can very well do without Austria. We
don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, dressed in an uncharacteristically sober dark suit
and tie, Haider, 50, appeared in a vast hall of the gilt-dripping
Hofburg Palace and sat beneath the European Union's blue-and-gold
flag as he signed the declaration committing Austria to ``respect,
tolerance and understanding for all human beings irrespective of
their origin.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, drafted in part by Klestil, amounted to a
bizarre list of democratic commitments and mea culpas for the
prospective government of a modern European state to be signing.
But it reflected the degree of alarm that Haider's entry into
government has provoked in European nations governed mainly by the
center-left.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out the tragic
history of the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the
National Socialist regime,'' it said, referring to the Nazis
alongside whom many Austrians fought.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the son of a virulently Nazi family and owner of an
estate that once belonged to a Jewish family that fled, had
expressed admiration for the Waffen SS and for Hitler's labor
policies, before retracting the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's declaration continued: ``Nationalism, dictatorship
and intolerance brought war, xenophobia, bondage, racism and mass
murder. The singularity of the crimes of the Holocaust, which are
without precedent in history, are an exhortation to permanent
alertness against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel described the text as a ``pre-emptive political
strike'' intended to reassure the world about Austria's commitment
to human rights. ``This declaration is very important because it
deals with the fears of many friends at home and abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, who was foreign minister in the outgoing coalition of
Social Democratic and People's parties, has portrayed himself as
the guarantor of the presentability of the restless, chameleonic
Haider.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement, for all its evident worthiness, could not
conjure away the fact that Haider ran an election campaign last
year that included posters suggesting that most black people in
Austria are drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the governor of the southern province of Carinthia, has
been a consistent opponent of immigration and has somehow combined
his professed commitment to freedom with the view that Winston
Churchill was as evil as Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1988 and 1998, an estimated 405,000 immigrants entered
Austria, a country of 8 million people. Many came from the wartorn
Balkans, newly free countries in Eastern Europe and Turkey. Some
neighborhoods in Vienna have changed radically in appearance and
atmosphere, creating unease.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Austria's immigration policy, at least with
respect to Balkan refugees, has been more open than those of most
of its European critics. But the sudden arrival of many foreigners
bolstered Haider's political message among Austrians who are afraid
of losing jobs or are put off by schools in which most children are
foreign.

</P>
<P>
   A brief statement from Klestil's office, issued after a second
meeting Thursday with Haider and Schuessel, said: ``President
Thomas Klestil informed Wolfgang Schuessel that he should appear
tomorrow, Friday, Feb. 4, 2000, at 12 o'clock with his government
team in the president's official chambers to be sworn in.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement went on to say that two proposed Freedom Party
members of the government _ Thomas Prinzhorn and Hilmar Kabas _ had
been rejected as minister of innovation and defense respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In language typical of the regular excesses of Haider's
movement, Prinzhorn recently threatened to give Klestil ``a bloody
head'' if he did not approve the right-wing coalition. This is the
sort of tone that was also apparent in Haider's recent description
of the French president, Jacques Chirac, as a ``megalomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Freedom Party leader in Vienna, Kabas was immediately
responsible for the xenophobic election posters that clearly sought
to play on fears and misgivings over immigration in changing
neighborhoods of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kabas was replaced as defense minister by Herbert Scheibner, the
36-year-old spokesman for defense in the Freedom Party. The highly
sensitive justice ministry, which has some power to direct the
thrust of prosecutors' activities, went to another Freedom Party
member, Michael Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Heinz Grasser, a Freedom Party member and spokesman for the
Canadian automotive parts supplier Magna International, will become
finance minister. He will have the delicate task of working closely
with European Union partners, who seem likely to shun him, on
Europe's shared currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the People's Party and state
secretary at the Foreign Ministry in the outgoing government, was
promoted to foreign minister. She will clearly seek to mollify the
European Union, but it was not immediately clear how Austria could
circumvent its looming isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 European governments that issued the statement committing
themselves to punitive measures against Austria have said they will
avoid bilateral meetings with Austrian ministers. But the
governments stopped short of barring them from European Union
meetings for the simple reason that nothing has happened in Austria
that could legally justify such a step.

COMMENTARY: GUYS JUST WANT TO GET VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ ``LAAAAADIES and gentlemen. Would you please
welcome. The winner of the New Hampshire primary by a landslide ...
JOOOOOOHN MCCAIN!!!'' Several hundred college students begin to
stamp their feet. Cue the heavy metal music.
</P>
<P>
   What does this remind us of, people? I swear, the McCain
campaign is beginning to sound a little like a World Wrestling
Federation match. The courtship of the soccer moms is over. Meet
the new, improved version of the Guy Candidate.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot tell you how much McCain hates this concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for that theory,'' he said dryly, as his bus rolled
through South Carolina. ``Please, let me have both genders.
Please.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was wrestling with a serious gender gap as he headed into
the stretch in the New Hampshire primary. In the end, of course, he
did well among men, women, college graduates, high school dropouts
and the Italian-American senior-citizen snowmobilers. He now claims
that the enormous margin of his victory was due to previously
apathetic young people who didn't show up on the pollster's radar,
then turned out in droves to toss him a vote.
</P>
<P>
   That's more of a vision than an analysis. But there is something
about McCain that appeals to the Jesse Ventura crowd. When he flew
into South Carolina at 3 a.m. Wednesday, he was greeted by several
hundred rowdy college students, who had been dancing and partying
in an airport hanger since midnight. McCain was ecstatic, and to
tell the truth, the kids won many hearts when they yelled so loud
the local congressman was unable to tell a charming story about
Strom Thurmond he'd prepared for his introductory remarks.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain does well in South Carolina, I have a sneaking
suspicion the new voter du jour is going to be the Steel Cage Death
Match fan. We were due for a change. Politicians have fixated on
suburban women for several election cycles, and the wooing of the
woman's vote is getting stale in the worst possible way. It's
suffering from death by pandering, in much the same way that
concern about the angry white male succumbed to testosterone
overkill from the likes of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, you will remember, was going to be the
Republican Who Could Talk to Females. He started out with an
interest in fixing the schools and a speech that stressed the
importance of making sure ``no child is left behind.'' But by New
Hampshire he had become so intent on proving to the party's
conservative wing that he would not turn into a presidential
``superintendent of schools.'' He kept warning audiences against
``people who come to your state saying, `Elect me, I'll build you
more classrooms, elect me, I'll pay your teachers more money.'
That's not a federal prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the experts call going off message. VOTE FOR BUSH.
HELP COMBAT CLASSROOM SPRAWL.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the shift in emphasis, Bush larded his
speeches with odes to The Family. ``If I'm elected president, I'm
going to tell all the moms and dads we need to redouble our love
for our children,'' he informed a crowd, the weekend before the
Mauling in Manchester. Now, how many people out there think it is
possible to love their kids more than they already do?
</P>
<P>
   The difference between women's voting patterns and men's was
always about serious matters. Women tend to worry about the social
safety net, to favor government programs to improve health,
education and the environment. Politicians who labor under the
delusion that all suburban matrons want is a better husband in the
White House are cruising for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has never been particularly fixated on domestic policy;
anybody shopping for a candidate who will improve public schools,
let alone protect abortion rights, had better look for another
market. His top staff has about as high a percentage of women as
the Vatican. But his big issue, campaign finance reform, has
universal appeal. And this is a campaign that's still evolving,
inventing itself as it goes along. If things were carefully
scripted, you would probably not have the senator arriving at a
rally to the tune of ``Play that Funky Music (White Boy).''
</P>
<P>
   It is, at least, a Guy Campaign that respects the audience. And
if you see Bush on TV wearing spangled tights and a cape, you'll
know there's some serious repositioning at work.
</P>

FORD TO OFFER EACH OF ITS 350,000 EMPLOYEES A HOME COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. announced on Thursday that each of its
350,000 employees worldwide, from factory workers in India to car
designers in Michigan, would be offered a high-speed desktop
computer, a color printer and unlimited Internet access for just $5
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Employees' families will be encouraged to use the equipment, and
will be given electronic mail accounts. The Ford offer, which
executives said was intended to promote computer literacy, includes
color monitors, speakers, technical support and ample capacity for
workers and their families to create their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Margevicius, a senior research analyst at the Gartner
Group, a computer consulting firm, said that Ford was the first big
company to try to make home computers available to all employees
around the globe. ``I have not even heard of anything like this
happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford executives portrayed Thursday's move mainly as an
example of corporate munificence, auto industry experts said that
it could carry several benefits for the company. Ford has had the
best labor relations in the domestic auto industry _ its last
strike was in 1986 _ but morale has been damaged by the company's
plans to spin off its auto parts division, Visteon Automotive
Systems, as an independent company later this year. Visteon workers
will be included in Thursday's program even after the two companies
separate, Ford officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and other auto makers have also invested heavily in
automation and need workers who are comfortable operating the
computers that control the equipment. Factory jobs like repairing
robots now require up to a year of training, some of which could be
done online at home.
</P>
<P>
   Envious of the high stock market valuations of computer and
Internet companies, Ford officials have begun a concerted effort in
the last year to portray their company not as a stodgy manufacturer
but as a consumer-products firm actively involved in electronic
commerce. The latest initiatives include using the Internet for
procuring auto parts, promoting new cars and keeping track of cars'
maintenance records.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives have long admired the way General Motors' Saturn
division uses its corporate image to sell cars and have been trying
for several years to project a more progressive image of their own.
As part of this campaign, Ford already advertises that its
automobiles tend to get the highest scores on government crash
tests, and that its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks
pollute far less than government regulations allow.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor also has a history of being a path-breaking employer.
Henry Ford, the great-grandfather of the current chairman, William
C. Ford Jr., infuriated other industrialists in 1913 when he
doubled his company's wage for an eight-hour day, to $5. But the
move paid off by reducing worker turnover and training costs when
workers were so scarce in Detroit and changing jobs so fast that
only one in 10 Ford employees stayed for more than a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that they did not know how many workers
would want the computers, but predicted that almost all would take
them. Delivery of the Hewlett-Packard computers and ink-jet
printers will start in the United States in April, and the price
might be pushed lower than $5 a month for workers in lower-wage
countries, said James Yost, Ford's chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will offer Internet home pages in 14 languages for
employees and does not plan to pay for the program through on-line
advertising, although there will be home page links to Ford Web
sites. UUNet, a division of MCI Worldcom, will provide the Internet
service. Nearly 190,000 of Ford's 350,000 employees are outside the
United States, as the company assembles cars in countries like
Poland and India for sale to their growing middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   Yost and Ford's vendors refused to estimate the program's cost.
Nick Grouf, the chairman and chief executive of PeoplePC, which
will administer the program, said that for other customers, his
company distributed less-powerful computers with unlimited Internet
access but without printers for $24.95 a month. Given the discount
that Ford is offering, this suggests that the auto maker could
spend close to $100 million a year if most Ford employees
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is earning record profits and has $23.6 billion in cash
reserves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The basic computer in Ford's program, the HP Pavilion, is
powerful, with a 500-Megaherz Intel Celeron computer chip. It has a
4.3-gigabyte hard disk, a CD-ROM drive, a 56K modem, speakers, a
15-inch color monitor and Microsoft software including word
processing and spread sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will be eligible for computers, printers and Internet
access even if they already have them at home. They can lease
more-powerful models _ with Pentium III chips, laser printers, and
even DVD drives for playing movies _ at deep discounts if they are
not satisfied with the base model. Upgrade prices have not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard expects at least 300,000 orders, which would
equal 4 percent of its worldwide personal computer shipments last
year. PeoplePC will ship the computers and provide round-the-clock
technical support by telephone, including toll-free lines in many
countries. Ford will not monitor employees' Internet use of
electronic mail in any way, Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shares rose 1/8, to 48 3/4. Hewlett-Packard rose 3, to 113
9/16. MCI WorldCom fell 7/8, to 44 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The program was discussed during Ford's negotiations last autumn
with the United Automobile Workers union, and was backed by Jacques
Nasser, Ford's chief executive. Ford is committed to leasing the
computers for at least three years, after which it will review the
program, Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and DaimlerChrysler concluded their talks with the UAW before
the idea came up. Their spokesmen said on Thursday that they would
study Ford's move. Toyota, Nissan and Honda said they had no plans
to follow Ford's example.
</P>
<P>
   Ford factories in the United States already provide free
computer training labs for all workers to surf the Internet. Mark
Pudelek, a 34-year-old assembler of engine alternators in
Rawsonville, Mich., said that he had gone online at the factory but
would now get his first home computer for his wife and
five-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a great learning tool for my
daughter, for the ABC's, counting and all,'' he said.

   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ The mechanical problem in the MD-83 jet
that led it to turn upside down and corkscrew into the Pacific
Ocean on Monday came in a tail system that is supposed to withstand
failures, engineers at Boeing said Thursday, speaking as searchers
recovered the second of the jet's ``black boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The second box, the flight data recorder, keeps track of the
position of the horizontal stabilizer, the part that jammed,
according to radio messages from the crew of the Alaska Airlines
jet to air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The first box, the cockpit voice recorder, recovered Wednesday
and played by investigators in Washington Thursday, captured the
two pilots discussing a problem with the horizontal stabilizer at
the beginning of the tape, more than 30 minutes before the crash.
Investigators said previously that the crew had first raised the
problem with air traffic controllers about 11 minutes before the
crash, after dropping rapidly from their assigned altitude.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people aboard the jet bound from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico,
to San Francisco were killed; searchers have found the remains of
four of them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, James Hall, the chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said the voice tape showed that the
plane was pitching nose down. ``The crew was able to arrest the
descent,'' he said, and ``continued trouble-shooting and preparing
the airplane for landing'' in Los Angeles. But then, he said,
``control was suddenly lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparations and the loss of control may be related. Boeing
engineers and pilots of the MD-80 series airplane say the airplane
tends to pitch up or down in response to changes in its speed or
fuel consumption or changes in the position of the flaps and the
slats, devices on the wings that are used on takeoff and landing.
Extending the slats and flaps, as a pilot would do while preparing
to land, would aggravate the nose-down tendency.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing engineers Thursday described a detailed emergency
procedure for coping with a malfunctioning stabilizer system. The
stabilizer, which makes up the front two-thirds of the horizontal
tail, can be angled up or down to keep the nose at the desired
angle and is typically adjusted hundreds of times in a flight, they
said. It is moved on its hinge by a jack screw, similar to the
long, thick screw that raises or lowers a garage door. Two motors
drive the screw, one at the command of the pilots and the other
when the auto pilot is in charge, although pilots can operate that
one as well, if needed. The emergency procedure involves switching
off the circuit breakers on each motor, in alternation, to figure
out which one has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer system includes both motors and brakes, and both
would have to fail for the part to move in an undesired manner,
according to the Boeing engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is supposed to be flyable even if the stabilizer is
immobilized, although engineers said it might require the pilots to
pull hard on their control yokes, possibly both at once.
</P>
<P>
   Being stuck in a nose-down position is considered the worst
case, because pilots need to pull the nose up before touchdown, to
dissipate some of the plane's energy. But this plane did not make
it that far.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope the flight data recorder will provide a
clearer picture of what happened. The recorder captures data on
about 25 hours of flight time, ending at the time of the crash.
Investigators said it would show the movements of the stabilizer on
the fatal flight and also whether the stabilizer had any erratic
behavior earlier, on the flight into Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Seattle Times reported that the crew that flew
the plane into Puerto Vallarta said the stabilizer had a problem.
Thursday, Hall made no direct comment on whether the safety board
had heard such reports and said that anyone with such information
should bring it to the board. He said it was ``quite frankly
irresponsible'' to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said that engineers had played the flight data
recorder from another MD-83, an American Airlines flight that took
off from Phoenix on Wednesday and made an emergency return because
of a problem with its stabilizer. But he said, ``we cannot say if
there are any common elements'' with the Alaska Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Loeb, the board's top aviation safety official, said,
``It's premature at this time to conclude there is any kind of
systemic issue.''

BRITAIN TO SEEK SUSPENSION OF LOCAL RULE IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain will introduce legislation Friday to suspend
the fledgling power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and
reimpose direct rule from London in an attempt to encourage an IRA
handover of weapons and avert a Protestant Unionist walkout from
the Belfast assemply.
</P>
<P>
   A suspension of the power-sharing assembly would be a
devastating blow to the peace process, coming just two months after
local government was returned to Northern Ireland for the first
time in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary of state for Northern
Ireland, told the House of Commons Thursday that the British and
Irish governments would continue to seek a commitment from the
Irish Republican Army to disarm before the legislation is approved
late next week. The governments are buying time, hoping for a
last-minute gesture or pledge from the IRA, which seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Irish premier Bertie Ahern flew late Thursday to meet British
Prime Minister Tony Blair in Cornwall, trying to find a
breakthrough. Ahern said progress had been made, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   While Dublin remains reluctant to go along with a suspension of
the fledgling government in Belfast, Britain was determined not to
allow Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble to walk out, as he had
vowed to do Friday unless London agreed to suspend the political
institutions created by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and his party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, agreed to form a government that includes two
Cabinet ministers from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, but
only with the understanding that the IRA begin turning in its
arsenal, or at least commit to doing so, by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Trimble had no right to set
deadlines unilaterally, and accused the British government of
acting illegally by allowing Trimble to alter the terms of the Good
Friday Agreement. That 1998 agreement stated that paramilitary
groups should finish disarming by this May, but it set no date for
the process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Adams argued that his party needs more time to persuade the IRA
to voluntarily disarm, and said unilateral demands by unionists
were making that task harder. He said the British decision to back
the unionist demands to suspend the power-sharing government will
probably lead the IRA to break off its contact with the
international commission overseeing the disarming of paramilitary
groups. The IRA agreed to appoint a representative to speak to the
commission in return for the creation of the power-sharing
government.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the House of Commons, Mandelson confirmed that a
report by the commission concluded neither the IRA nor its loyalist
adversaries had agreed to disarm. While the loyalists are as
reluctant to start disarming, it is the IRA's refusal to commit to
turning in weapons that threatens to bring down Northern Ireland's
government, which for the first time includes unionists who want to
retain the union with Britain and hardline Irish Catholic
nationalists who want to merge with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IRA are opposed to making even a token gesture on
weapons, seeing it as an act of surrender. IRA leaders are
determined to avoid a split over weapons. But Trimble said the bulk
of his party will not take part in a government that includes Sinn
Fein while it maintains ``a private army.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the timetable announced by Mandelson, the legislation will
be passed and the institutions suspended before the end of next
week, avoiding a walkout by Trimble which the British believe would
make getting the government back up and running more difficult
procedurally and politically. The British fear Trimble would be
pushed aside by more intransigent unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the leading nationalist and deputy leader of the
power-sharing government, argued against suspension, saying it
should be delayed until the chairman of the commission overseeing
disarming, Canadian General John de Chastelain, was allowed to get
the IRA and loyalist paramilitary groups to answer two questions:
will they disarm, and if so, when?
</P>
<P>
   But Mandelson called suspension ``the better of the two
options'' and said the IRA's refusal to disarm amounted to ``a
betrayal of the entire community of Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last thing I want to see happen,'' Mandelson said of
the suspension. But, he added, ``there comes a time when we have to
express our impatience and intolerance'' over the refusal of
paramilitary groups to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the IRA issued a statement insisting that it would
continue to observe its cease-fire and that it was committed to a
``permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson praised that IRA commitment, but said it wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions can only work on the basis of cross-community
confidence,'' said Mandelson. ``Without clarity over
decommissioning, I have no doubt that this confidence will ebb
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he did not want to suspend the institutions, but
was determined ``to preserve them from collapse and to create the
time and space in which to rebuild the confidence required to
sustain them.''

   WASHINGTON _ Two U.S. warships enforcing U.N. sanctions against
Iraq seized a Russian tanker in the Persian Gulf on Thursday after
boarding it and discovering evidence that it might be smuggling oil
out of southern Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A lightly armed boarding party from the guided missile cruiser
Monterey landed on the tanker by helicopter Wednesday after
repeated attempts to get the tanker to respond to radio queries
about its cargo, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no incidents of violence whatsoever,'' said Rear
Adm. Craig Quigley. The Americans reviewed the tanker's
navigational equipment and documents, including bills of lading.
They also took samples of the cargo of gas oil to determine whether
the petroleum had originated in Iraq. As of late Thursday, the
analysis of the petroleum _ and the sediment carried in it, which
should indicate its source _ had not been completed, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Volgoneft-147 tanker, flying a Russian flag, is only the
second Russian vessel stopped by the international patrols since
1990, when Iraq was prohibited from selling oil on the open market
as punishment for its invasion of Kuwait, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, the United States has warned the Russian
government of its monitoring of two Russian tankers that had
arrived on the Iraqi coast and appeared to be involved in smuggling
oil. The Russian ambassador to the United States was briefed
regularly on the issue, and U.S. diplomats in Moscow have discussed
it with the government there, said James P. Foley, a State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government has told us that this ship is privately
owned and that an investigation on the Russian side is under way,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ships trying to smuggle oil out of Iraq has risen
dramatically with the increase in oil prices to $27 a barrel from
$11 a year ago, a senior Pentagon official said. But the unusual
presence of Russian vessels pushed the United States to involve the
Moscow government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get the Russians to police this ship themselves,''
the Pentagon official said, ``but I guess with oil prices so high
it's hard to stop these entrepreneurs.''

   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The No. 1 player in Zimbabwe stood shoulder
to shoulder with No. 1 in the world here Thursday. At the Davis Cup
draw to determine the pairings for Friday's opening matches,
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, might have been hoping that
Andre Agassi's magic is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   With lines for gasoline lengthening, unemployment, inflation and
HIV infection rates soaring, and parliamentary elections coming,
the beleaguered president made sure that Agassi was right next to
him for the group photo at the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've read the papers, Zimbabwe is going through a bit of
a rough time right now, and I think this is a bit of a breath of
fresh air,'' said Byron Black, who plays the American Chris
Woodruff in the second match at the Harare Sports Center. Black's
brother, Wayne, will play Agassi in the first match.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven other first-round matchups in the World Group:
Australia, the defending champion, at Switzerland; Britain at the
Czech Republic; Italy at Spain; Belgium at Russia; Austria at
Slovakia; Brazil at France, and Netherlands at Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe called Zimbabwe's encounter with the United States ``the
dwarfs against the giants.'' But Woodruff did not want to hear
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I told you I didn't feel any pressure,'' he
said. ``This is a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was home in Knoxville, Tenn., when the U.S. captain, John
McEnroe, called last Friday to inform him that he had been drafted
by Uncle Sam. Here he is, at 27, set up as the biggest target in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is playing the best tennis of anyone on the planet right
now,'' Byron Black said. ``Obviously, the guy we're aiming to beat
is the No. 2 player, Woodruff. Hopefully, the doubles could be the
crucial decider.''
</P>
<P>
   If that occurs, McEnroe may run out of hairs that have not
turned gray. The U.S. team of Alex O'Brien and Rick Leach has never
played together. The Zimbabwe captain, Gavin Sinney, is pairing
Wayne Black with Kevin Ullyett for Saturday's doubles, and engaging
in some playful warfare with McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, with the players they've got, should win the Davis
Cup every year for the next few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, speaking for the depleted Americans, said ``I think
we'll be fortunate to get through this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   One singles victory by Woodruff would pretty much assure a
second-round match against England or the Czech Republic in Los
Angeles. But Woodruff has no Davis Cup experience other than being
a practice partner. His best ranking was 25, three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He soon hurt his wrist, then tore up his knee just fooling
around, kicking field goals with the tour veteran Richey Reneberg
at a high school field in Atlanta. He was out for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-4, good agility, big hitter,'' said Paul Goldstein, one
of the team's practice players. ``At the Australian Open, he beat
Tim Henman, didn't lose a set for three rounds, lost to Sampras in
the quarters. He's playing good ball.''
</P>
<P>
   How that translates here, in the nearly mile-high altitude and
under extreme Davis Cup conditions, who knows? Byron Black Thursday
was promising more noise than even McEnroe might be able to bear.
There will be ``a lot of drums,'' Black said, possibly _ by
coincidence, of course _ right behind McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Zimbabwe has ever engaged an American
team, a situation that makes Byron Black something of a prophet. A
couple of years ago, when Zimbabwe had qualified for the World
Group, the tennis federation president, Paul Chinoka, asked him if
he and his brother could help bring famous American players like
Agassi, Sampras or even the retired McEnroe to Harare to play
exhibitions and promote the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, this could be a bit expensive,'' Black said.
``I said, `Maybe you should wait for Davis Cup. We'll get them for
free.'''

ANGRY CROWD DEMANDS FIRING OF 2 WHO SHOT FELLOW OFFICER

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Restraint over the slaying of police Sergeant
Cornel Young Jr. erupted into protest Thursday as 200 noisy
demonstrators marched into City Hall and black clergy demanded that
the two officers who gunned down Young last Friday be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In a day filled with angry demands and cross-city meetings,
minority leaders who suspect that Young's death might be linked to
racial profiling met with Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. and state
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse to air their concerns and seek
an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after Young was buried with full honors in an
emotional funeral, about 200 chanting protesters, banging pots,
converged on City Hall to present their demands to Cianci.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators want police Officers Carlos A. Saraiva and
Michael Solitro 3d to hand in their badges, an outside review of
Young's shooting, and that felony murder charge withdrawn against
Aldrin Diaz, whom police holding responsible for the death even
though he dropped his weapon before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' said Melvin Carter, an organizer
of the protest. ``We want to see things change.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 29, the son of the highest-ranking black officer in the
Providence Police Department, was shot three times as he rushed to
aid Saraiva and Solitro as they confronted an armed man in a
late-night fracas. Young, who was off-duty, carrying a gun and
dressed in civilian clothes, did not identify himself as a police
officer and did not drop his weapon when ordered, authorities have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not identified the races of Saraiva and Solitro, but
others say they are white. Cianci said Thursday that Saraiva is
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, many of whom wore three red stickers to
symbolize the number of times Young was shot, urged Cianci to
appoint a civilian review board to investigate other complaints of
police misconduct in the city. Direct Action for Race and Equality,
a grass-roots community group, organized the multi-racial
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the racism to stop, and we want the police brutality
to stop,'' said Ben Moses. ``We're here to hold the mayor and the
Police Department accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is there aren't enough facts to be conclusive
about what happened, but it's likely that racism played a part in
that the officers may have shot sooner than they might have
otherwise had Young been white,'' said Derek P. Ellerman, executive
director of the Providence-based Center for Police and Community.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci, in an interview, said he is being targeted unfairly by
protesters, who chanted ``No justice, no peace!'' and ``Stop police
brutality!''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci cited his administration's work in the minority
community, and said that he appointed Cornel Young Sr. from a
patrolman to major of the community policing division despite
objections from other officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a liberal city,'' said Cianci, who has been mayor for
the last 19 years. ``We believe in and support diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his goals, the mayor said, has been to encourage the
Police Department to hire more black officers. Currently, there are
35 black officers on the 440-member force.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Greene and David Rosen, two first-year students at Brown
University, missed classes to join in the demand that the charges
against Diaz be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong to scapegoat this man,'' said Rosen, 19.
``He didn't shoot the officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid shouts and chants, Cianci emerged from his office to
address the protesters about a half-hour after the demonstration
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one who is sadder than I am to have lost a police
officer,'' he said to a heckling crowd. ``But we have to wait and
let the investigation take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cianci refused to accept the protesters' demands and
quickly retreated into his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing the right thing,'' said Claudia Bellussio,
a chief clerk in the city registrar's office. ``It's a shame that
this has happened, but the protesters don't want to listen to the
mayor. My God, it's one day after the funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci, who had been under attack for appearing to downplay a
racial possibility in the shooting, said Thursday he supports a
broad investigation that will consider whether racial profiling _
the practice of assigning greater criminal suspicion based on race
_ played a role in Young's death. Some had demanded Cianci retract
his earlier statements about that aspect of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to retract,'' Cianci said just before the
protest. ``I said at the time that all aspects of the case should
be investigated, including race.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has no power to grant another demand: an
independent inquiry into Young's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to contribute to the investigation,'' he said.
``At this time it is being handled by the attorney general's
office. I have no control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Cianci met privately with black ministers who
said they believed race had been a factor in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no evidence whether there was race involved or no race
involved, but I think a full investigation ought to be carried
out,'' Cianci said outside the Allen A.M.E. Church, where the
ministers met.
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders from the Ministers' Alliance of Rhode Island and
the Urban League have requested that an outside agency, such as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, handle the probe of Young's death.
The state attorney general will examine Young's death before any
evidence is presented to a grand jury for possible indictment.
</P>
<P>
   However, many minority activists are skeptical that state
government can objectively investigate the case _ and is
sufficiently autonomous from Providence affairs in this small
state.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has been charged with felony murder, which can be filed
against someone committing a felony when a death occurs. Diaz had
waved a .22-caliber pistol outside an automobile during the
altercation at the Fidas Restaurant, but dropped the gun when
confronted by Saraiva and Solitro.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Whitehouse said Thursday that his office will
pursue its investigation vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of our process to get to the bottom of
what happened,'' he said. ``I understand the community's needs for
answers. I want answers as well, but I need to remain dedicated to
deriving those answers through the deliberate and sound grand jury
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford R. Montiero, president of the Providence chapter of the
NAACP, has pledged to meet with minority officers from other states
who have been injured by fellow officers in cases of mistaken
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Montiero, like nearly all black leaders in the city, had
refrained from criticizing the police until Young was buried. The
victim's father, Major Cornel Young Sr., had asked that the
community respect the family's wish to grieve before turning its
attention to questions of police conduct.

 &HT;    American Airlines program to boost legroom
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An airline industry giant is trying a novel concept to
boost passenger satisfaction: more legroom in coach.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said Thursday it will remove 7,200 coach seats
from its fleet of jets, boosting typical legroom by about 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   American executives trumpeted the plan at a news conference in
Washington, D.C., where airline service gripes provoked hearings in
Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding coach legroom ``makes good business sense and is the
right thing to do in today's competitive environment,'' said Donald
Carty, American's chief executive. He suggested the industry has
too long ignored basic physical comfort, at least in coach, while
trying to mollify fliers with new snacks and video programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, this is an industry that has lately been in
denial,'' Carty said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 CEO posed for pictures in a mock-up of the new
seating plan, his knees conspicuously not jammed against the next
seatback.
</P>
<P>
   American's move follows a more limited gambit by United
Airlines. Last year United added legroom to the first few rows of
coach on some planes, reserving them for passengers paying higher,
short-notice fares.
</P>
<P>
   The trend could force Atlanta giant Delta Air Lines, the third
member of the industry's so-called Big Three, to add coach legroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts real pressure on Delta to come up with something,''
said Ed Perkins, retired editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
``For that matter, it puts pressure on Northwest, Continental and
USAirways, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside of added legroom? ``Cutting seat capacity means the
cost per seat goes up,'' said Perkins. He said big carriers that
join the trend may offer fewer seats at the lowest prices to offset
the economic penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the airline is studying
American's plan. ``Seating space is important and we're reviewing
our options in this area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta generally has reserved its seat space initiatives for
front-cabin passengers. Its BusinessElite international cabin
offers unusually generous legroom to fliers who can afford to
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But those benefits don't reach the huddled masses in coach. In
fact, Delta's version of the Boeing 777, its new international
widebody, has coach seats that are 1 inch narrower than those on
the MD-11s it will eventually replace, while legroom is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines can adjust legroom without great technical difficulty,
since seats are installed along rails. Various extra-legroom
programs in the past _ TWA and the now-defunct Kiwi are among
carriers that tried them _ eventually succumbed to pack-'em-in
financial imperatives.
</P>
<P>
   American heralded its coach plan as one that will ``change the
face of domestic and international coach travel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their surveys I'm sure are telling them that people hate the
tight seating, which has really been made worse by the heavy loads
on most flights,'' said Perkins. He said seat dimensions haven't
changed much in the past 15 years, but it seems that way because
passenger loads have gotten heavier _ in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loads are bigger and the people are bigger, too,'' he
noted. ``It's not so bad if there's an empty seat next to you, but
that's a luxury anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   American, based in Dallas-Fort Worth, said it will remove about
6.4 percent of the coach seats in its 700-plane fleet. For
instance, the airline will remove two rows totaling 10 seats from
its MD-80 narrowbody jets, cutting capacity to 129 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, average seat pitch will expand ``from the present
industry standard of 31 and 32 inches to a predominant level of 34
and 35 inches of space, with some reaching as much as 36 inches,''
the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Seat pitch is not a literal measure of legroom but rather the
amount of space from a point on one seat to the same point on a
seat in front or behind.
</P>
<P>
   American said that when the project is finished, about 58
percent of its coach seats will have a pitch of 34 or more inches,
while 98 percent will have seat room ``greater than today's
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline said the project dovetails with an ongoing one to
install new space-saving ``slimline'' coach seats with adjustable
leather headrests.
</P>
<P>
   The American plan does nothing to add elbow room, which is
dictated chiefly by fuselage width. However, Hotard said the new
seats have slightly narrower armrests, providing an extra sliver of
width.
</P>
<P>
   American said it will complete the project on its domestic jets
by November and on international planes next year.
</P>
<P>
   The project will cost the airline an estimated $70 million. Some
analysts fear the reduced seat capacity could mean lower profits at
American and other carriers that follow suit. The move comes amid
concern that profits will be under pressure anyway because of
rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Hotard said American believes the benefit to its service
image offsets capacity loss.

 McCAIN'S VICTORY UNNERVES SOME SENATE COLLEAGUES  
(See related stories, SC-REPUBS, McCAIN-FUNDRAISING,
NY-McCAIN-BALLOT) 
(bl) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again John McCain has managed to irk his
Senate Republican colleagues, and he was not even in town to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Mulling over McCain's walloping victory in the New Hampshire
primary, Senate Republicans said they were startled by his margin
of victory over the party's favorite, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
But rather than drop their heads and shuffle their feet, many of
them agreed that, if anything, Bush's resounding loss would bolster
their commitment to him, and they predicted that it would help Bush
in the long run, just as a tighter race between the Democratic
candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, revved up Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably will re-energize him,'' Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the majority leader and a Bush supporter, said of
Bush. ``He will learn from what he experienced in New Hampshire. As
he said, he's running a 50-state campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his best game-day face, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who
is considered to be McCain's chief foe in the Senate, said bluntly,
``We'll see who the nominee is.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, has always had a knack
for unnerving his Republican colleagues with his blustery style and
renegade crusades. His eagerness to overhaul the nation's campaign
finance laws, a move that Republicans say would hurt their party
the most, turned him into a political pariah among the party's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But after New Hampshire, even some who disagree with him tipped
their hats and proclaimed his message a possible winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than a small blow,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who has endorsed Bush. ``There is no question that
John McCain has captured the essence of a message that could win
this year. That is: `I am not Bill Clinton.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett added: ``He comes across as the ultimate anti-Clinton.
He's a war hero; Clinton is a draft dodger. He insists he wants to
reform a corrupt system, and Clinton represents a corrupt system.
McCain calls his campaign the Straight Talk Express; Clinton is the
epitome of twisted talk.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Republican senators smiled through clenched teeth as they
talked about the New Hampshire results, then quickly recalled Pat
Buchanan's victory in the New Hampshire primary four years ago.
This was the man, they reminded others, whom quirky New Hampshire
Republican voters once wanted to crown president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outsider tone of his message appeals to independents, and
independents is where the core of the victory was,'' Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., who is Bush's chief congressional liaison, said
of McCain. ``But then that's what Buchanan was doing, too, and the
door closed in the South. And I think it will again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters in the Senate _ all four of them _ exulted
in his victory. And Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority whip
who has not endorsed any candidate, broke the ice at a morning
meeting this week when he asked Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., where the
line began to join the McCain administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our focus has been on is the people,'' said Hagel, who,
along with Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Jon Kyl of Arizona and Fred
Thompson of Tennessee, is a McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who will elect the next president and
determine our party's nominee,'' Hagel added. ``Thirty-five
senators won't do that. Thirty governors won't do that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TENNIS IS PART OF FARMER'S CHARMED LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-DAVIS-CUP) 
(rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANDARA, Zimbabwe _ The grounds are out of a dusty colonial
storybook, from another time and a privileged place. This is where
Don Black raised a tennis family, where the grass is lush and the
fruits are plenty and labor was love.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on 22 acres rife with avocado pear trees and vegetation
that sways to a gentle breeze as if it were music, Don Black
awakened his sons, Byron and Wayne, and later daughter Cara, to the
first sign of dawn. School days, every day, they would all hit
barefoot on grass moistened by dew.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fruit, Black grew three tennis pros. The
boys, no physical specimens, always went along with what the father
called ``the contract.'' They became tour veterans, and something
of a local Davis Cup dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if I'd had an athlete to work with,'' Don Black said,
half-kidding. ``If I had one like Michael Jordan, he could have
killed Sampras.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black brothers don't have to worry about Pete Sampras this
weekend. Only Andre Agassi, whom Wayne will try his luck with
Friday in what the country's president, Robert Mugabe, is calling
``the dwarfs versus the giants,'' Zimbabwe hosting the United
States, in the first round of the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Don Black was also a tennis player, once a match point from
Wimbledon's fourth round. Then he returned to his native Rhodesia
and became a teacher, like his English mother, and a farmer, like
his Scottish father, who came to this former British colony in
1913.
</P>
<P>
   What a charmed life the 72-year-old Black has led on this
fertile African land, a straight shot from downtown along
Enterprise Road. He retired, at 40, from teaching with a full
pension. He was too young to fight in World War II and too old, by
three weeks, to be drafted by the colonial regime during the
revolution that resulted in independent Zimbabwe in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of my friends were gone to war and I was over there
working on the kids' strokes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there'' was the grass court he had just stepped off,
after finishing a lesson in an unobtrusive rain. From the veranda,
his bare feet resting on the dry stone floor, he pointed to where
Roy Emerson had climbed the fence and collapsed a rail now known as
``Emmo's Bend.'' All of his old Aussie friends had visited him
here, in fact, and hit on his well-manicured lawns. He and Rod
Laver became good friends.
</P>
<P>
   From his hideaway outside Harare, Black tended to his fruit,
read books and corresponded anonymously (he forgot to sign his
name) with the likes of Bertrand Russell. He constructed four grass
courts, one hard court surrounded by banana trees. He married ``the
girl living two miles down the road.'' Velia Black wrote letters to
her family in England, and they subsequently became a book,
``Growing Up in Rhodesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black kids were raised in a very different place than the
ones who beg for money downtown, or even those visited Wednesday by
John McEnroe. In Chitungwiza Township, where unemployment is
roughly 50 percent, some of the kids also played barefoot, only it
was on sun-drenched cement.
</P>
<P>
   While Velia Black has offered scholarships for a few talented
children there, it is hard to connect or comprehend such disparate
worlds. When he schooled his own children, Don would set up a
bucket and the kids would aim for it with the serve. An African
gardener whom the family only knows as Madala _ Old Man _ would
retrieve the balls.
</P>
<P>
   The gardener, still with the family, was once going blind from
cataracts. An Australian eye surgeon teaching in Harare sent a car.
Old Man was fearful, Don said, and wouldn't get in. They plied him
with brandy, and off he went, returning the next day, eyesight
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Don Black opened his historical storybook and even Byron's
scrapbook for visitors Thursday. Inside, he played a musical video
called ``It's the Blacks,'' composed by a local performer named
Fungai Malianga. There is no disputing the Black family's
popularity here, but the economy is failing, the government is
wheezing and turmoil may be brewing.
</P>
<P>
   While two-thirds of the white population left after 1980, Don
Black stayed. He wouldn't even travel to watch his kids play. ``How
the hell could I leave all this?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Off in the distance, his wife was teaching tennis to a
diplomat's kids. A servant was cleaning the first-floor windows.
Old Man was strolling across the avocado fields.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze was, at once, calming and intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll die here, whatever happens,'' Don Black said.
</P>

BUSH SUPPORTED TOBACCO TAXES, A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH CAROLINA
VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. John McCain was being criticized on
Thursday in South Carolina for his support of higher tobacco taxes,
but Gov. George W. Bush in the past has endorsed similar
initiatives in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bush backed a tax overhaul that contained a
20-cent-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good plan. It's exactly what I hoped would happen,''
Bush declared when the legislation cleared a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of tobacco taxes has arisen in South Carolina, one of
the nation's largest tobacco producers and site of the next hotly
contested GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-industry group, the National Smokers Alliance, has begun
running ads criticizing McCain's sponsorship of legislation that
would have raised tobacco taxes and given the federal government
new power to regulate nicotine. That bill also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying one thing and doing another, that's the real John
McCain,'' the ad says in part.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Humber, president of the smokers alliance, said his group
opposed the effort in Texas to hike cigarette taxes, but he
applauded Bush for remaining consistent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain's insistence that he had never supported tax
increases in the U.S. Senate contradicts his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about misrepresenting the record. To the best of my
knowledge, Governor Bush has never misrepresented the record
regarding that,'' Humber said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the governor's endorsement of the House legislation in
1997, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan would not say whether Bush
liked the tobacco tax being included in it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not in his plan that he proposed,'' said McClellan.
As for the House plan, McClellan said: ``He supported the effort to
move it to the Senate.'' That's where the legislation died.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Hugo Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi, now a lobbyist who
has been friendly with the governor, said Bush never expressed any
opposition to the tobacco tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed the money and the money was going to go to cover
other health care programs,'' Berlanga recalled. ``I think the
governor clearly understood what that meant, and there was never
any resistance from his office regarding that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win-win for him,'' Berlanga said. ``He was smart
enough to understand that in the overall scheme there were some
additional dollars that were going to take care of some worthy
programs, and at the same time achieve his goal of overall tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's critics have in the past criticized the large
number of donations he has received from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal election records, Bush has accepted more
than $50,000 from industry executives. In addition, his chief
political strategist, Karl Rove, was once on the payroll of tobacco
giant Philip Morris.

 &HT;    Poll shows slight McCain lead over Bush in S.C.; Bauer may drop
out of race
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Money, volunteers and a favorable poll came
Sen. John McCain's way Thursday as he campaigned along the
picturesque Atlantic coast, battling Texas Gov. George W. Bush for
South Carolina's large military vote.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the Republican presidential field was about to
become one candidate smaller, with indications that Gary Bauer
would announce his withdrawal at a news conference today. Bauer
would be the sixth Republican dropout, leaving four in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is having a news conference on Friday. That's all we're
saying about it,'' said spokesman Tim Goeglein.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by independent pollster John Zogby released
Thursday gives McCain about a five-point lead over Bush in South
Carolina, 44 percent to 39.3 percent. It is the first time an
independent poll has shown him ahead in the state, which holds its
Republican primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll has a 4.4 percentage point margin of error, so
McCain's lead would be three-tenths outside that.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said he was happy, but wary of the new Zogby
poll. ``The polls will bounce up and down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, still riding high from Tuesday's 19-point victory over
Bush in the New Hampshire primary, directed his harshest words at
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. He barely mentioned
Bush at three stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Gore debased every institution of government in
1996,'' McCain said, referring to Democratic fund-raising abuses in
the last election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also poked fun at Bush for calling his loss in New
Hampshire ``a bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it a bump in the road. I'm telling you my friends,
it was a land mine,'' McCain said on Seabrook Island, the calm
waters of the Edisto River behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign continued trying to take advantage of the
New Hampshire results.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog senator has raised more than $1 million and
attracted 4,000 new volunteers via the Internet in the past two
days. More than 1,000 people heard McCain speak on the Charleston
waterfront. Hundreds more attended events in Beaufort and on
Seabrook Island.
</P>
<P>
   The last public poll in South Carolina, released before the New
Hampshire primary, put Bush up by 20 points. But the McCain
campaign had a poll of its own last week that gave Bush only a
nine-point margin, a campaign official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain's gain in the polls is dramatic in a state that is
crucial to his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the poll is right, it seems as though McCain is a genuine
mass phenomenon right now,'' said Merle Black, a political science
professor at Emory University. ``And at the moment, Bush is coming
across as a highly scripted candidate who can't make a persuasive
argument about where he wants to take the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hoping to string together victories in primaries in
different regions of the country. With New Hampshire behind him,
McCain is targeting South Carolina, which will be closely followed
on the primary calendar by Michigan and his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to determine our party's nominee,'' Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.) said while campaigning with McCain in Beaufort.
``Let me be blunt. If we lose here, it's going to be very
difficult.'' Meanwhile in New York, Republican Gov. George Pataki,
who is supporting Bush, waved the white flag and dropped the state
GOP's court battle to keep McCain off the state's primary ballot.
Pataki said Bush agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain began his day Thursday at S.C. Mayor Bill Rouch's
antebellum house in Beaufort, beneath a giant water oak dripping
with Spanish moss.
</P>
<P>
   Rouch once served as press secretary to former New York Mayor Ed
Koch, a Democrat. He is not affiliated with either major party, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man's fearless,'' Rouch said as he introduced McCain on a
sunny but chilly morning.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is ``fully prepared to lead'' as a result of his
military service and the expertise on foreign policy that he
developed in 17 years in Congress. ``I do not need on-the-job
training,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He paid homage to the ``patriotism and sacrifice'' of South
Carolinians, part of his emphasis on the military in a state with
400,000 veterans. There are more veterans per capita in South
Carolina than in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appealed for South Carolina veterans' support
Thursday. He made a pointed reference to McCain as a potential
leader, saying, ``There is a big difference between being somebody
who had a distinguished military record and being someone who's
trying to lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared in Sumter with Adm. Thomas Moorer, who served as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Nixon
administration, and Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National
Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``came home and forgot us,'' Burch said. Afterward, Burch
said the senator hadn't supported his group's efforts on Agent
Orange, Gulf War Syndrome and support for families of soldiers
missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the criticism as ``bizarre. To say that somehow
I would not be doing everything that I can flies in the face of
facts,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has a large network of veterans supporting him,
including several men held with him as prisoners of war in North
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a janitor's son and conservative activist who served as a
domestic policy aide the the Reagan White House, chiefly stressed
opposition to abortion and China policy during his campaign. But
Bauer was unable to gain much support. He drew 9 percent of the
Republican vote in Iowa, and just 1 percent in New Hampshire.

NASA PREPARED TO MOVE AHEAD IN BUILDING STATION WITHOUT RUSSIAN
HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated by Russia's repeated delays in launching
a crucial component of the International Space Station, NASA said
on Thursday that it was preparing to use an American substitute to
get the project moving again.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said the United States would
complete and launch a new control module for the station that could
replace the long-delayed Russian service module. If the Russian
module, which is to include living quarters and is almost two years
behind schedule, is not launched by July or early August, he said,
the United States will send up its component in December and move
ahead with building the station.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the United States and other international
participants in the $60 billion project want Russia to be a partner
in it, but cannot stand for further delays that are jeopardizing
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we are frustrated and disappointed is an
understatement,'' Goldin told reporters on Thursday in some of his
strongest criticism to date. ``The Russians have got to understand
what the focus is here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was particularly troubled by the Russians' recent
decision to funnel more scarce resources back into its 14-year-old
Mir space station, which was abandoned in August and was to have
been mothballed. But there has been fervor to continue using Mir by
Russian nationalists who see it as the last vestige of a once great
independent space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their primary issue is to meet their commitments to the
International Space Station,'' Goldin said. ``The Russians have to
decide if they want to work with other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments raise the stakes for a meeting later this month in
Moscow, when NASA officials are to meet with their Russian
counterparts to review the program, discuss rocket problems that
have recently delayed the service module launch, and set a date for
putting the component into orbit. ``We want to see if they have a
fire in the belly about getting the service module up,'' Goldin
said said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has called for an emergency meeting of all space
station partners for the end of the month or early March to look at
the launch schedules and decide how the program should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian space officials said recently that they expect to launch
the service module, which is to connect with two sections already
in space, by the end of July or in August. To guard against further
delays and restart building of the orbiting station, Goldin said he
has ordered completion of a so-called interim control module that
would be launched on a space shuttle in December. The new module
will become part of the station, but serve a slightly different
role, even if the Russians successfully attach their module on
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first two components of the station, one each supplied by
Russia and the United States, have been in orbit since late 1998
awaiting the next Russian component. Their service module, which
was to have followed in five months, is supposed to provide living
quarters, laboratory space and flight control for the station
during its early construction phase.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, said NASA's decision to use its
interim control module shows the United States has lost patience
with Russian space station delays and the diversion of resources to
Mir, and wants to preserve its options.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a stake in the ground prior to the Russian meeting
and says there is a certain limit beyond which we can't wait,''
Logsdon said. ``It got to where NASA had no real choice but to do
this. It seems to me the prudent thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional critics of Russian involvement in the space
station program also saw the decision as a step forward. Rep. Dave
Weldon, R-Fla., who recently called for NASA to use the interim
module, said the decision finally allows the program to proceed
without the Russians. ``It is high time that NASA finally woke up
and decided that the Russians were not going to come through on the
service module,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The interim control module, a contingency NASA proposed in 1997,
was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory using components it
designed to maneuver spy satellites for the Pentagon. This module,
which Goldin said would cost more than $200 million to build, test
and launch, provides control and maneuvering power for the station,
but no research or living space.
</P>
<P>
   Not having the service module on the station would delay its
permanent staffing by astronauts, Goldin said, but crews could work
there for short periods during space shuttle visits.
</P>
<P>
   If the Russian unit is launched in time, Goldin said, the
American module will still be sent to the station, but in 2001. He
said having both units will make the station ``more robust,'' and
critics added that having the extra propulsion unit aboard would
make the orbital outpost less dependent on future planned Russian
refueling flights.
</P>
<P>
   To launch the service module on time, the Russians have to fix
problems that have cropped up in its Proton rockets, one of which
is to launch the critical module. Two Proton rockets were lost last
year in launch mishaps, and the Russians say they need to fly
several of the rockets to test proposed fixes for the problems
before trying to launch the important and irreplaceable service
module.

   GROZNY, Russia _ ``No filming the corpses,'' a military press
officer barked as a group of correspondents jumped off a Russian
army helicopter on the outskirts of the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Six dead Russian soldiers were wrapped in shiny metal foil and
lined up in a muddy field. Some photographer quietly sneaked a
shot, but the grisly images were not included in the Russian
television news.
</P>
<P>
   Two struggles are under way in Chechnya: a bloody fight between
the Russian military and thousands of separatist rebels and a more
subtle tug-of-war between the Russian high command and the nation's
media.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Russia's journalists do battle with the military press
service, which regulates access to the battlefield and is
determined to put out the message that the Kremlin's war is going
according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the military has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main preoccupation of the military press service is not to
organize press coverage of the war, but to limit journalists'
access,'' said Yevgeny Kirichenko, a military correspondent for
NTV, the only independent Russian television network.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television helped turn the Russian public against the
last war in Chechnya. So television is now a preoccupation for the
Russian military, which sees it as the main vehicle for influencing
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the Chechnya trips arranged by the military are
for the benefit of Russia's three major television networks: NTV;
the state-owned RTR; and ORT, which is officially owned by the
Russian government but is controlled by Boris Berezovsky, a tycoon
and now parliamentary deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, television crews face enormous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, reporters were able to
shuttle between the Russian forces and the Chechen rebels. But the
threat of kidnapping for ransom, which emerged after the first war,
has discouraged many journalists from traveling freely throughout
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government's restrictions have hampered the media,
too. Russian authorities require that all reporters who enter
Chechnya obtain official accreditation or go on government-arranged
trips, which generally last no more than two or three days. In
either case, the journalists must be escorted by the Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who ignore these procedures and venture into
rebel-controlled areas to cover the other side of the story are
subject to detention when they return to the Russian positions.
After Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for the U.S.-funded Radio
Liberty, filmed life in the rebel-controlled part of Grozny he was
apprehended by Russian forces after he left the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the previous campaign we had a chance to move about
Chechnya on our own,'' said Roman Perevezentsev, a reporter with
ORT. ``In three weeks I have not really been able to see the places
where the main fighting is going on. The abyss between Mozdok and
Grozny is hard to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of Russia's war correspondents, in fact, spend more
time waiting at the sprawling military Russian base in Mozdok,
which is just a few miles northwest of Chechnya, than reporting
inside the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television crews stand for hours on a muddy patch at the
base or even ankle deep in snow when the temperature plunges below
freezing, waiting for the military press service to whisk them into
Chechnya by helicopter. The trips usually last for several hours
and correspondents are rarely allowed to visit with the troops
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The press service chooses the destination. Many of the trips
have been to the highlands in southern Chechnya, where the fighting
is often intense but devoid of the grim scenes of destroyed
apartment houses and terrified civilians, which typify Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to report on the battle for the besieged Chechen capital,
some Russian television reporters have bypassed the military press
service by exploiting their contacts with the Interior Ministry
forces and special rapid reaction troops, which are fighting in the
streets of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, Russian television crews fail to reach the
city and their networks show several-days old film in the evening
television broadcasts without identifying it as dated footage.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny is not the only place that is hard to reach. The military
press service itself is inside a barricaded compound within the
heavily secured base at Mozdok. Reporters cannot call the press
service: It has no civilian telephone. Nor can they visit it
without a special pass, which even some of Russia's most prominent
networks have found hard to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Those that do reach the press service receive one-page situation
reports, which are issued twice daily but provide few battlefield
details.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the constraints are imposed by the military. Pyotr
Korovikovsky noted that his network, RTR, takes care to describe
the militants as ``separatists, bandits or participants in illegal
armed groups.'' They are never ``defenders of Grozny'' or
``resistance fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even RTR has chaffed at the restrictions on travel within
Chechnya and the scanty information distributed by the press
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am greatly disappointed with their work,'' Korovikovsky said
of the press service.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzembsky, the Kremlin's new spokesman for the Chechen
war, has promised to streamline the accreditation system and
improve the quality of information.
</P>
<P>
   To make the point, Yastrzembksy provided the first figures of
the number of Russian soldiers and Interior Ministry troops in
Chechnya: 93,000. So far, however, there is no indication that the
press constraints are being loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, Russian reporters face two types of restrictions:
formal and unstated. The media, for example, is explicitly
forbidden from showing pictures that would enable the rebels to
pinpoint Russian positions.
</P>
<P>
   The unstated rules are more confining. Filming the Russian dead
and wounded, for example, is deeply frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   Kirichenko of NTV was one of the first correspondents to
challenge the official casualty count, citing sources within the
military.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive Russian press coverage of the casualty issue was
the main reason why the Russian Defense Ministry recently
acknowledged that Russian losses in fighting in Chechnya and
neighboring Dagestan since August exceeds 1,100, far higher than
previously stated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Kirichenko's crew filmed wounded soldiers during a
trip to Khankala, a Russian-controlled airfield on the eastern
outskirts of Grozny, it did not include the footage in its evening
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot it but did not show it,'' he explained. ``If we
broadcast it the next NTV crew to come here might not be
accredited.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting military setbacks can be risky, too. Perevenzentsev of
ORT said that the press service recently informed him that the
accreditation of his fellow ORT correspondent Pavel Spirin was
being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   His sin: Spirin reported that a stronghold occupied by SOBR
troops had been jeopardized after nearby Russian army troops failed
to coordinate their actions with the SOBR unit and retreated. As it
turned out, Spirin was at the end of his tour so the sanction had
no effect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sometimes, the press service has fought to keep embarrassing
episodes off the public record. Several Russian television crews
were recently traveling in the Caucasus Mountains with Col. Gen.
Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in the North
Caucasus, when their helicopter was grounded for several hours
because of a thick fog.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the helicopter took off a thick crust of ice had
collected on its blades and it crashed shortly after lifting into
the air, according to Perevezentsev of ORT. The tail broke off and
the helicopter only managed to avoid sliding down a hill because it
collided with a truck filled with ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Kazantsev, his aides and the television crews scrambled out of
the helicopter shaken, but uninjured. They had only just regained
their bearings when the first words from a press officer rang out:
``No filming the helicopter.''

 &HT;    Police seeking statements from two Lewis friends
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A.J. Johnson, one of the two men wanted for
questioning in the double slaying that landed NFL star Ray Lewis in
the Atlanta City Jail, says he wasn't even in Atlanta the night of
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The second man, Kwame King, a longtime friend of the football
player, hasn't been seen by friends and relatives since he left his
home in Florida to meet Lewis for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police said they believe the two men were inside the
black stretch limousine that sped away from the intersection where
the bodies of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, lay in a
pool of blood, police spokesman John Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they were present in the limousine, and we're
interested in anybody that was with the limousine at that time,''
Quigley said Thursday evening. ``We are waiting for them to call
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a student at the University of Maryland, hadn't called
police as of Thursday evening. But he told reporters he watched the
Super Bowl on television with friends in his Baltimore apartment.
He said Thursday that he had socialized with Lewis occasionally,
but never considered him a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine, he can say that,'' Quigley said Thursday evening
referring to Johnson's comments. ``We we want to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and King were much closer.
</P>
<P>
   The two men grew up separated by a strip of asphalt in Lakeland,
Fla. They became teammates on the Kathleen High School football
team, the Red Devils. Both grew up in single-parent homes without a
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray and Kwame are close friends,'' said Chuck Greene, King's
roommate and friend in Tallahassee. ``They grew up in the same
small town, they lived by each other. Kwame's like an older brother
to Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, King's mother, Simone Brewer, said she hasn't
heard from her son recently and wasn't aware of a trip to the Super
Bowl last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' she said from the door of
her Lakeland home.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said he last spoke to King, a doctoral student at Florida
A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee, a little more than a week ago. The
plan, he said, was for King to go to the Super Bowl and meet Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   He said King hasn't returned from Atlanta and he's spoken with
others who feel sure the 26-year-old was in no way involved with
the murders. King has avoided trouble, he said, and is an
``outstanding'' person.
</P>
<P>
   At Kathleen High School in Lakeland, King is remembered as smart
and sharp, with a theatrical flair. His senior yearbook photo shows
him posed with a blond, circular streak in his hair against a
zebra-striped background. He also sang in the school chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddox, former head football coach at Kathleen, worked with
both Lewis and King during his tenure. King, he said, came from a
troubled home but was well behaved and well liked. He recalled that
Lewis was grouped with a harder crowd when he first joined the
squad but Maddox sat him down and encouraged discipline to
complement his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all got into little problems but nothing like this,''
Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is having a hard time adjusting to life in jail, his agent
Roosevelt Barnes said Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Lewis' personal attorney, Ron Cherry, visit Lewis
daily at the city jail. They said afternoons and nights are hardest
for the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very upbeat during the day because he has a lot of
visitors, like his mom and his friends,'' Barnes said. ``But when
it starts getting close to the afternoon, he starts getting mellow
and depressed because he knows his visitors have to go and he'll be
left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is being held with other inmates at the Atlanta Pretrial
Detention Center, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client watched the Super Bowl on television with
friends Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Lewis' new attorney, Ed Garland, proclaimed
his client's innocence at a news conference packed with media from
around the country: ``He is as innocent as all of you in this room.
Ray Lewis did not shoot, strike or stab anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said an arrest warrant drawn up by Atlanta homicide
investigators stating Lewis ``repeatedly stabbed Baker and
Lollar,'' is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed in the Atlanta Police Department,''
Garland said. ``They have made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Lewis was inside the black stretch Lincoln
Navigator limousine that police have said was at the scene of the
killings early Jan. 31. However, Garland said Lewis was trying to
stop the fight and get some of the participants in the car. He said
eight people were in the limousine that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never knew people were killed,'' Garland said. ``He found
that out later in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, the driver of the 40-foot-long limousine, would
not talk to reporters Thursday. Police interviewed him for more
than 10 hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   David B. Irwin, Fassett's attorney in Maryland, would not say
whether Fassett actually saw the stabbing. He declined to give any
details about the incident or the events that followed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fassett drove on and off for Lewis for about a year and
a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks the world of Ray Lewis. He's very sad about it,''
Irwin said. ``He wishes the whole thing would go away.''

BRADLEY ASSAILS BUSH FOR SPEAKING AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley was just getting into a
part of his stump speech Thursday where he usually blasts Vice
President Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, when he veered instead into criticizing a Republican
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before supporters here, Bradley chided Bush for
addressing more than 5,000 students at Bob Jones University, a
bastion of Christian conservatism in South Carolina. In Bush's
speech there Wednesday, he promised to keep ``our ideas, Republican
ideas, conservative ideas, at the top of the national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, noting that the college had lost its tax-exempt status
in the 1970s because it did not allow interracial dating by its
students, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to fight to deny tax-exempt status to Bob Jones
University unless it changed that policy. And yet the Republican
candidate for president yesterday goes to Bob Jones University to
make a speech about what conservatism is in this county. Well,
ladies and gentleman, that is what conservatism is, Bob Jones
University, and it should be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Bradley has criticized Bush. In the
spring, Bradley held a news conference in Austin, Texas, , where he
attacked the governor for saying he would not sign a bill that
would have increased penalties for hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman. said: ``Issues that pertain to
race in America go to the core of Bill Bradley's character. And any
time the potential leader minimizes the ability of Americans to
come together around race and instead opens up the possibility of
division, we are going to move very swiftly on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said, ``I think voters
will reject such devices and unfortunate remarks that pit people
against one another.''

   BUDAPEST _ The Cold War may be over, but international intrigue
swirls like cigarette smoke once again in the ornate Hapsburg-era
cafes of the Hungarian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The talk at the coffeehouse tables is of plots and midnight
liaisons, as the city hosts a new generation of secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   That sharply-suited man watching for his contact as he sips an
early morning coffee could just as likely be trading in classified
information as stocks and shares.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest is now the new spy capital of eastern Europe, as
competing secret services run elaborate intelligence-gathering
operations, both in the city and along the country's border
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Like postwar Vienna, immortalized in Orson Welles' classic film
noir, ``The Third Man,'' Budapest is now unwilling host to a host
of intelligence agencies, several of which are hostile to western
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence services are also monitoring the activities
of several organized crime syndicates from the former Soviet Union
who use Budapest as their forward base.
</P>
<P>
   More spies have begun operating in Hungary in the last few
months, said Secret Services Minister Laszlo Kover, as Hungary's
NATO membership challenges local superpower interests as well those
of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian intelligence services now supply information to their
western partners, he told the daily newspaper Vilaggazdasag.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's geographical position and long experience of dealing
with Balkan and Slavic neighbors gives its agents a head start in
the intelligence race, as well as a sharper insight into the
regional mind-set than that of western analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the northern rim of the Balkans and the former
Yugoslavia, bordering the former Soviet Union, Hungary offers
unrivalled opportunities for information gathering, particularly
since Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, joined
NATO last year.
</P>
<P>
   And straddling the dividing line between east and west, Hungary
shares borders with seven countries, from Austria to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any geo-strategic capital where there is a melting pot of east
and west and north and south is bound to be the target of hostile
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budapest is a traditional meeting place, on the great trade
routes between east and west, a place to find things out, like
Nicosia,'' said a western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was powerless to stop NATO's expansion into its
former sphere of influence, Russia _ especially its army and
defense ministry _ is known to be deeply unhappy about the
Alliance's eastward spread.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary assumed a vital strategic role during the NATO onslaught
on Serbia last spring. As a country bordering Serbia, with a
substantial ethnic Hungarian population within Yugoslavia itself,
it was a natural target for infiltration by Serbian agents.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of Serbian spying activity at the country's
two NATO air bases, at Taszar and Kaposvar, both in the south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest was also the meeting place of choice for clandestine
contacts between Serbs and Croats during the Yugoslav wars.
   The current strong cooperation between Hungarian and western
intelligence services cannot gloss over several embarrassing black
spots in the country's recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most notorious terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, found
safe haven in Hungary for several years under the regime of the
former Communist leader Janos Kadar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian army is now a NATO force, but many of its officers
were trained in Moscow, from where they returned with wives and
other strong ties to Russia. As a member of the former Socialist
bloc, Hungary also had trade ties with states such as Iraq, Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials say that suspect intelligence and military
officials who were unable to make the necessary about-face from
Communism, to capitalism and the west, either retired or left after
the new reality was explained to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians argue that the former ties to the Soviet bloc gives
them an advantage in dealing with Moscow as they understand the
Russian modus operandi. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Perched on the northern rim of the Balkans and the former
Yugoslavia, bordering the former Soviet Union, Hungary offers
unrivalled opportunities for information gathering, particularly
since Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, joined
NATO last year.
</P>
<P>
   And straddling the dividing line between east and west, Hungary
shares borders with seven countries, from Austria to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any geo-strategic capital where there is a melting pot of east
and west and north and south is bound to be the target of hostile
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budapest is a traditional meeting place, on the great trade
routes between east and west, a place to find things out, like
Nicosia,'' said a western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was powerless to stop NATO's expansion into its
former sphere of influence, Russia _ especially its army and
defense ministry _ is known to be deeply unhappy about the
Alliance's eastward spread.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary assumed a vital strategic role during the NATO onslaught
on Serbia last spring. As a country bordering Serbia, with a
substantial ethnic Hungarian population within Yugoslavia itself,
it was a natural target for infiltration by Serbian agents.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of Serbian spying activity at the country's
two NATO air bases, at Taszar and Kaposvar, both in the south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest was also the meeting place of choice for clandestine
contacts between Serbs and Croats during the Yugoslav wars.
</P>
<P>
   The current strong cooperation between Hungarian and western
intelligence services cannot gloss over several embarrassing black
spots in the country's recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most notorious terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, found
safe haven in Hungary for several years under the regime of the
former Communist leader Janos Kadar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian army is now a NATO force, but many of its officers
were trained in Moscow, from where they returned with wives and
other strong ties to Russia. As a member of the former Socialist
bloc, Hungary also had trade ties with states such as Iraq, Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials say that suspect intelligence and military
officials who were unable to make the necessary about-face from
Communism, to capitalism and the west, either retired or left after
the new reality was explained to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians argue that the former ties to the Soviet bloc gives
them an advantage in dealing with Moscow as they understand the
Russian modus operandi. &QL;

<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Two of the world's leading companies in
wireless communications agreed Thursday to merge in a $183 billion
deal, the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning end to the kind of hostile takeover attempt once
considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany. The
all-stock transaction easily shattered the previous record for a
takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the takeover will vastly expand the geographic
reach of Vodafone, which already is the world's biggest wireless
telephone company, giving it dominance in the European market and a
global base of more than 50 million customers. Vodafone already has
a major presence in the United States and two dozen countries in
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal is perhaps more important as a
watershed in European corporate behavior and the export to Europe
of bare-knuckled takeover tactics first honed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a European company carried off a hostile
takeover on such an audacious scale: cross-border, cross-cultural
and paid for with shares in a company that was almost unknown
outside of Britain 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the Vodafone's acquisition of Mann
</P>
<P>
   Esser insisted Thursday night that the situation was the best
possible outcome. ``It's not a change of opinion,'' he told
reporters. But the discomfort was evident between Esser and Gent
when the two men presented their agreement Thursday night. Despite
a show of collegiality, they could barely bring themselves to shake
hands for more than a moment. After a bit of prodding by
photographers, they were cajoled into shaking hands again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Esser's public nonchalance, the takeover is also a shock
to Mannesmann, an old-line industrial conglomerate that had
brilliantly transformed itself into the biggest provider of
wireless communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann owns national networks in Germany, Italy and Britain,
while Vodafone owns Britain's second-largest network and scores of
other stakes around Europe and on other continents.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent outmaneuvered Esser on the chessboard of Europe's
wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely
valuable national wireless licenses in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed
to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies _ Vivendi SA of
France. That move derailed Esser's desperate attempt to hammer out
a merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a
major French network and greatly strengthened his position with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie
Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal
convinced wavering shareholders that Esser had lost the upper hand,
even with his allies, and they immediately began betting on a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies began to work in earnest together
at the start of the week. The companies reached a basic agreement
in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Negotiations continued for
most of Thursday until the announcement was made late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's
three biggest markets _ Britain, Germany and Italy _ along with a
45 percent stake in the biggest U.S. network and holdings in more
than 30 other countries, from Sweden and Poland to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of Mannesmann makes history on several fronts
besides its size.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has seen a surge of hostile takeovers, the only
successful ones only have been between competitors within a single
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Mannesmann marked one of the first real battles
for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants
recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption
of a single currency in eleven countries made it crucial to
overcome national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also marked one of the first cases in which national
political leaders did not try to interfere in order to protect an
important domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated
takeover battle last year, the battle was largely sanctioned and
guided by the French Ministry of Finance, which wanted to
consolidate the nation's banking industry and keep out foreign
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true when Totalfina SA, the French-Belgian oil
company, launched a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine
SA. Likewise, Italian political leaders actively opposed the
proposed telephone merger between Deutsche Telekom of Germany and
Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Italy's Olivetti SPA.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reaction was entirely different. Despite the
angry rhetoric from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about the
dangers of hosile takeovers, the German government stayed out of
the fight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That reflected a widespread view among German business
executives that it was far more dangerous to interfere with a
legitimate if hostile bid and jeopardize the ability of German
companies like DaimlerChrysler to buy up foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser and Gent waged their battle almost entirely
through direct appeals to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market view was that following the deal with Vivendi there
really weren't any more ways that Mannesmann could present a better
strategy,'' Andrew Moffat, telecommunications analyst at the Dutch
bank ABN Amro said. ``A friendly deal is what both sets of
shareholders were aggressively trying to push through.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a power struggle between two companies that
both wanted to command the European market. It began in January
1999 when Vodafone acquired AirTouch of the United States, a long
time minority partner in all of Mannesmann's communication
ventures. But the conflict deepened when Mannesmann invaded
Vodafone's home territory by buying Orange, Britain's third largest
mobile phone network for $33 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Mannesmann's direct attack in Britain, Gent decided
that Vodafone could not remain a real player unless it took over
its partner-turned-rival.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies employed armies of investment bankers to advise
them. Vodafone's lead adviser was Goldman Sachs which devoted more
than 100 people to the cause and will earn about $75 million,
analysts estimate. Vodafone is also advised by Warburg Dillon Read,
which is expected to take home $50 million. It is unclear how much
Mannesmann's advisers stand to earn.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's advisers are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Deutsche Bank AG. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

   ``Who now remembers the Armenians?'' Hitler asked, just before
he embarked on the destruction of European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Precious few, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   As the memorial day for the Nazi genocide against the Jews was
proclaimed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week, there
was not a single reference to the slaughter of one and a half
million Armenian Christians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first holocaust _ and Hitler's inspiration for the
slaughter of the Jews _ was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I wonder? Blair did not mention it. French President
Jacques Chirac is frightened of the very subject, refusing even to
condemn the slaughter when he last visited Beirut, where the
grandchildren of the victims live in their tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government prefers to forget the holocaust of
Armenians, while the Turks _ the inheritors of the empire that
committed the worst atrocities of the First World War _ are
studiously denying the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And we let them get away with it. Who, I wonder, chooses which
holocaust we should remember and which we should not?
</P>
<P>
   The six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis must always
have a place in our history, our memory, our fears. Never again.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the Armenians who perished in the rivers of southern
Turkey, who were slaughtered in their tens of thousands in the
deserts of northern Syria, whose wives and daughters were
gang-raped and knifed to death by the gendarmerie and their Kurdish
militiamen _ they have no place in our memory or our history.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is our friend. Turkey might one day join the European
Union. Turkey is an ally of Israel. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History, of course, is a hard taskmaster, veined with
inconvenient facts and corrupted heroes as well as the massacre of
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian community in Turkey had its Allied sympathizers
when the Ottoman army was fighting the British and French in the
First World War, and Armenians also fought in the czarist Russian
army against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the proof of genocide is intact. The Young Turk movement _
once a liberal organization which the Armenians had supported _ had
taken control of the dying empire and adopted a ``pan-Turkism''
which espoused a Turkish-speaking Muslim nation from Constantinople
to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their victory over the Allies at the Dardanelles
in 1915, they fell upon the Armenians. Churchill was to refer to
the ``merciless fury'' unleashed upon the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador in Constantinople _ himself a Jew _ wrote
heart-wrenching reports back to Washington of mass slaughter. Near
the Turkish village of Mus, hundreds of men were lined up on
bridges and shot into the rivers, Serb-style. &QL;

   Behind the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland, I was once taken
by a camp guide to a series of small lakes in which the Nazis
dumped the ash of the crematoria. Beneath the water and ice lay the
powdered white bones of whole cities of people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the north Syrian desert there are still skulls and bones
in caves and in the clay of river banks.
</P>
<P>
   This place of martyrdom is visited once a year by the local
Armenian community to commemorate their holocaust. They even have a
holocaust memorial day. Yet I wonder if a single non-Armenian
reader of The Independent knows what the date is?
</P>
<P>
   Denial of the holocaust is in some countries a crime. I'm
talking, of course, about the Jewish Holocaust _ because denial of
the Armenian holocaust is not only perfectly legal, it is big
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American company selling weapons to Turkey will discuss the
holocaust of 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs of Ottoman studies are being funded by the Turkish
government at American universities in which U.S. academics _ who
have to prove they have used Ottoman archives to get their jobs and
thus must never have condemned the 1915 slaughters _ propagate the
lie that the Armenians were merely victims of ``civil war'' and
that Turks also died in the chaos of 1915. Turks did. But not on
the Armenian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was to write that the Jews were victims of a European
civil war and that, anyway, ``Germans also died'' would be regarded
as cracked or a neo-Nazi. Not so if you deny the Armenian
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following letter, for example: ``The myth of the
`Armenian Holocaust' was created immediately after World War I with
the hope that the Armenians could be rewarded for their
`sufferings' with a piece of the disintegrating Ottoman state. As
such, the main aims of the inventors were political and
territorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Europe, or indeed Japan and the rest of Asia, ever catch up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the American boom becomes the longest in the country's
history. It is an interesting statistic for Britons, because we
experienced that particular delight _ our longest boom _ in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, hardly anybody noticed. But it is a statistic that raises
fundamental questions about the changing nature of economic
success, as well, of course, as about the durability of the
American boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also, as the euro falls ever lower against the dollar, raises
uncomfortable questions about Europe's future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort is all the greater because that is not as it was
meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-quarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

   Chaos swept through the bond market Thursday as traders and
investors tried to make sense of a spectacular and damaging rise in
the prices of longer-term Treasury bonds. Rumors of significant
losses sustained by banks, brokerage firms and hedge funds said to
be on the wrong side of the Treasury market's move roiled the
market, reminding many participants of the crisis created by the
near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund that
gripped the market in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tripping over themselves to buy 30-year bonds, investors and
traders drove the price of the bonds up an unusual 3 percent early
in the morning. The yield on the bond fell from its Wednesday close
of 6.28 percent to as low as 5.93 percent before settling at 6.13
percent at the end of the day. The yield on the 10-year note fell
from 6.57 percent Wednesday to 6.44 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants were stunned by the action. ``The government
bond market is trading with an extraordinary amount of stress,''
said Tom Juterbock, head of government bond trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``I can't recall a time when this market
had this much stress. This is without historical precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a statement in the
early afternoon denying a rumor that a special emergency meeting
had been called by the Fed to assess the damage caused by the move
in the market. Such a meeting was convened when Long-Term Capital
Management was teetering and resulted in a Fed-assisted bailout of
the hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   But bond traders at banks and brokerage firms across Wall Street
said Thursday that losses were surely large at many institutions
this time around because of the nature of the bets that had been
made by these firms in recent weeks. Once again, as was the case
with Long-Term Capital Management, the majority of bond market
participants are finding themselves all in the same troubling
trades.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the recent trouble is the Treasury's plan to reduce
its issuance of long-term debt and to buy back a good deal of the
debt that is outstanding. Worried about a shortage of Treasury debt
to be traded, investors who need to own high-quality long-term
government securities _ managers of pension funds and insurance
company portfolios who offset their long-term obligations with
assets of similar maturities _ surged into the market.
</P>
<P>
   As these investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasuries,
traders who had sold those securities short faced mounting losses.
Because banks and brokerage firms typically offset the potential
risk in their sizable holdings in mortgages or corporate bonds by
selling government bonds they do not own, a process known as
selling short, the move had punishing effects on firms' positions
up and down Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about possible trading losses, investors pounded the
shares of two Wall Street firms known for their bond trading
operations. Goldman Sachs Group's stock fell 6.3 percent, to
$85.375, one of its biggest one-day declines since the firm went
public in May, while shares in Lehman Brothers Holdings dropped 2.5
percent, to $70.4375.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lehman Brothers said, ``We're not having any
problems as a result of the Treasury market moves.'' A spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Treasury announced its buyback plan on Jan. 13, the
reality of its effects were not fully recognized by bond traders
until recently. As the meaning of the reduction in supply sank in
among investors, the rush into the bond market began.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Treasury said that it would retire $17 billion
of its debt in the first three months of this year. Most of the
buybacks are to be focused on debt with maturities of 10 years or
more. In addition, the Treasury said its most recent auction of
securities would raise $32 billion, almost 14 percent less than the
$37 billion analysts had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Parkhurst, managing director of government bond trading
at Salomon Smith Barney, said that it was troubling that the
Treasury had led the market to believe that the 30-year bond was a
dinosaur and would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   What traders find particularly maddening about the action in the
market is that many of the trades that are causing the greatest
woes are not especially speculative. In fact, they are fairly
ordinary. It is simply that the Treasury's debt reduction plan has
turned the market on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Although no bank or brokerage firm came forward with reports of
losses, the carnage in the market will most likely push brokerage
firms and banks to reassess their heavy reliance on Treasuries to
hedge their corporate bond or mortgage holdings. The U.S. Treasury
market is the largest and most liquid in the world, but now that
this market will be shrinking, traders will look for new securities
to use as hedging vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, these traders are exiting their troubled short
positions, which are sizable, buying long-term Treasuries to cover
those they had sold short. One trader said a conservative estimate
of the Treasuries sold short is twice the securities available for
trading, indicating that the pain in the bond market could continue
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive at a commercial bank said, ``This started
last Friday afternoon and all the trading floors are shaken.'' The
executive added that because no one knew which firms had been hit
the hardest, anxiety levels throughout the market would remain
high.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in bonds has exacerbated an unusual occurrence in the
market: short-term interest rates are considerably higher than
those on long-term securities. That is unusual because investors
are traditionally paid more to hold long-term instruments because
they are taking on more risk than those investors who buy
short-term securities. When short-term yields rise above those of
long-term instruments, Wall Street traders say the yield curve is
inverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have changes in the structure of the yield curve,
it has taken about six months for the market to assimilate the
changes,'' said Gemma Wright, senior interest rate strategist at
Aubrey G. Lanston, an investment firm in New York. ``This is not
going to be any different.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Europe, or indeed Japan and the rest of Asia, ever catch up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the American boom becomes the longest in the country's
history. It is an interesting statistic for Britons, because we
experienced that particular delight _ our longest boom _ in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, hardly anybody noticed. But it is a statistic that raises
fundamental questions about the changing nature of economic
success, as well, of course, as about the durability of the
American boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also, as the euro falls ever lower against the dollar, raises
uncomfortable questions about Europe's future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort is all the greater because that is not as it was
meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-qarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

JORDAN LINKS TERRORIST PLOT TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordanian security agents said this week that 13
men imprisoned here on charges of plotting terrorist attacks in
Jordan were trained in Afghan camps operated by Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested in December after Jordanian officials say
they uncovered a plot to blow up a U.S.-owned hotel in Amman and to
machine-gun tourists visiting several popular religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Jordanian officials said the group's travels to
Afghanistan for training were arranged by Khalil Deek, a
naturalized U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent who is also in
prison in Jordan. One U.S. official said Deek had been acting as a
kind of ``concierge/travel agent'' for the worldwide network
directed by bin Laden, who has been charged with masterminding the
1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Deek, interviewed at a prison on the outskirts of Amman, the
Jordanian capital, insists that he is guilty only of possessing and
copying information about bomb-making that is freely available on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a victim of circumstance,'' Deek said. ``If there is a
fair trial, it will be perfectly clear that there is no evidence to
connect me to planning or committing any act of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The other 13 men have been charged with planning to carry out
the plot, which the authorities say Deek helped organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We captured these men before they were able to take executive
action, but the attacks they were planning would have been very
serious,'' said a senior Jordanian intelligence officer. ``These
people had done a lot of homework, but we also do our homework.
That is why this country remains a safe environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they found a cache of explosives buried near
a farmhouse outside Amman that was used by several of the jailed
men. They said the explosives were the same type as those used in
the bombings in Africa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deek, 41, is from a Palestinian family that fled its home in
what is now Israel in 1948, and was displaced a second time when
Israel captured the West Bank in 1967. Speaking through a wire
partition at the prison where he is being held, he insisted that
his only work in Peshawar, Pakistan, where he was arrested, was
running a small computer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man asked me to copy a disk called the Jihad Encyclopedia,
which had information about bombs and many other things,'' he said.
``But I had never met the man before. I think that when he came
back to Jordan, the police found that disk and asked him where he
got it. He gave my name, and that's why I was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Deek, who moved to California as a young man and became a U.S.
citizen in the 1980s, denied any connection to bin Laden or to any
plans of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lived in Jordan for years, and I don't know a single
person here other than my own family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deek's lawyer, Younis Arab, said he views the case as ``dealing
with the possession of information from the Internet, which is
going to be the basis for many criminal cases in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This disk they found may contain terrible things, but it is
available at grocery stores in Peshawar,'' Arab said. ``We have
found more than 1,500 Internet sites that give information about
making explosives. Maybe someone is interested in these things, but
that cannot be considered a crime in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrests six weeks ago, remarkably little has been
reported in Jordan about the case. Some politicians and private
analysts said they doubted that the plot, if it existed, was as
serious as U.S. and Jordanian officials have alleged.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered why terrorists would plot to blow up the Radisson
Hotel in Amman, as is charged, considering the hotel attracts far
fewer guests than other hotels in Amman. As for tourist sites here,
they attract mostly Japanese and European visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is not known to have been a target for serious terrorist
plots in the past, though its friendship with both the United
States and Israel might make it an appealing target to some
militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very quick to jump at any hint of a threat,
because all it takes is one bomb and our tourist business is dead
for a year,'' said Nasser Lozi, a prominent political figure who
held a series of ministerial posts from 1996 until he left the
government in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of tension in the air at the time these people
were arrested,'' Lozi said. ``You had fears coming out of the
millennium celebration, you had the Y2K fears, and you even had a
specific warning from Washington that there were going to be
terrorist attacks. Maybe there was an exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   Deek and the 13 other men are to be tried within a few months.
The trial is expected to be open to the public, and the
government's evidence will be displayed there for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign specialist who is closely monitoring the investigation
said that doubts about the case may stem from the fact that
Jordanian officials, wary of upsetting the tourist trade or
spreading fear at home, have revealed little of what they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very sophisticated operation that had gotten to the
stage of detailed planning,'' the specialist said. ``It clearly
could have done serious damage to many people. The effectiveness of
the security service here saved a lot of lives.''

 &HT;    Ligtenberg's elbow rehab on schedule,
 &HT;    but relief ace post premature
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kerry Ligtenberg knows what you want to know, and he
wishes he could tell you.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves reliever is just like everybody else who wonders
when he'll be ready to pitch _ especially with John Rocker facing a
suspension until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's asking where I'm at and how I feel,'' said
Ligtenberg, who had ligament transplant surgery on his right elbow
in April. ``I don't know what else to tell them, except that I'm
real happy about where I'm at, and in about a month we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg joined the posse of Braves pitchers at ``Camp Leo''
Thursday at Turner Field, throwing 20 pitches off the mound at
about 75 percent effort. It was the third time he has thrown off
the mound since he resumed such throwing last week. He is scheduled
to see Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., next week and hopes
to face hitters in spring training next month.
</P>
<P>
   How soon he'll be ready to pitch this season is another
question, and nobody knows the answer. Recovering from such surgery
is projected to take 12 to 18 months, but the time frame that
applies to Ligtenberg is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going with the approach that there's no need to rush it,
and I tend to agree with that,'' he said. ``It doesn't hurt, which
is one of the best things about it. I have no pain whatsoever. I've
been doing a lot of long-tossing so my shoulder feels strong, my
elbow feels strong, but it's still not the same thing as throwing
to live hitters. ... If it feels bad, take a day off, but so far I
haven't had any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ligtenberg was about to begin his second year as the
Braves' closer, as Mark Wohlers continued to have control problems.
Rocker was still an untested young arm. Then Ligtenberg suffered a
torn medial collateral ligament in his right elbow in a spring
training game.
</P>
<P>
   While he could be the ideal choice to replace Rocker as closer,
Ligtenberg isn't going to put extra pressure on himself to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a sense of urgency,'' said Ligtenberg,
who had 30 saves in 34 chances in 1998, his rookie season. ``If I
don't come back right away, I'm sure they'll find somebody to do
it. I feel like I can come back and really help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg said he would have approached the season the same,
even if Rocker were available from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the approach that I was going to come in and do what
I've done in the past, and whatever role I end up in, that's the
role I end up in,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   As different as the two pitchers are in temperament and
demeanor, they both are learning a little about restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm ready right now,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I want
them to let me push it just to see. I'm starting to lose patience.
... I've waited a whole year, now I just have to wait a little bit
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg said he's in the best shape he's ever been in, body
and arm. Meanwhile, he has taken some advice from former Braves
reliever Alan Embree, who underwent the same type of surgery in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Embree ``told me, when he came back, the toughest thing was he
didn't know what kind of velocity he would have or what was going
to happen until he faced hitters,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said once you throw a fastball by a hitter, then it's like
you know everything came back,'' Ligtenberg said. ``He said there
will be days where you don't feel that good and you have to get
through it. ...When I get out there, I think it's going to be more
fun than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a step in that direction, as it was for fellow
reliever Rudy Seanez. Seanez said he is fully recovered from a
stress fracture in his elbow and from bone-spur surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm used to get sore (during offseason workouts), and they
told me it had a lot to do with the bone spur,'' Seanez said. ``My
arm was sore only once this offseason. Now I just have to be
careful that, since I'm feeling so good, I don't push it too hard

   CONCORD, N.H. _ A triumphant Senator John McCain stormed back on
to the presidential campaign trail Wednesday after inflicting a
crushing defeat on the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   His 18-point victory over the out and out front-runner for the
Republican Party's nomination burst the race wide open and made
Bush look vulnerable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After celebrating his victory at his New Hampshire headquarters,
McCain flew direct to South Carolina where more than 800 supporters
held an impromptu victory rally in his honor at 2:00 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary, which takes place on Feb. 19, is
seen as the next crucial test for McCain. A conservative state,
with a strong record of support for George W. Bush's father, former
President George Bush, South Carolina is a state in which McCain
must do well if he is to have a chance of taking his campaign
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire Wednesday, McCain's victory was compared to
that of Ronald Reagan in 1980, whose trouncing of the establishment
favorite and victor in Iowa, George Bush, Sr., became the
springboard for his successful national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, said the local Concord paper Wednesday, had ``rushed to
Reagan like iron filings to a magnet'' in the final week of the New
Hampshire campaign, and McCain had drawn people in much the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   After his win, McCain alluded to the straight-talking
meet-the-people strategy that had brought him such success,
greeting cheering fans: ``Welcome to my 115th town meeting. We
finally have a poll without a margin of error.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona had held 114 question-and-answer
meetings in six months of campaigning in New Hampshire, and it was
reckoned that one in four voters had seen him in person by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   He had held his final such meeting on Sunday, in the town of
Peterborough, where he also held his first, attracting more than
1,000 people, in contrast to the 40 who had turned up in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, he paid tribute to the reception he had
received from New Hampshire's famously independent voters, and
hammered away at the theme he placed at the center of his campaign:
``The Washington iron triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation,
which for so long has put special interests above the national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sniping at the current administration _ and his possible
opponent further down the line _ he said it was ``the beginning of
the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain concluded with this rallying cry: ``Our wonderful New
Hampshire campaign has come to an end. The great national crusade
has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, gave a gracious concession speech, looking
forward to victory in South Carolina and beyond. While giving
credit to McCain's strong campaign, he explained his defeat also by
the shorter time he had spent in New Hampshire _ partly because he,
unlike McCain, contested the Iowa caucuses _ and the singularity of
the state of New Hampshire and its voters.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the qualities that had won New
Hampshire for McCain would not translate onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   This argument, however, disregards the strong record of New
Hampshire in giving future winners their first unexpected break.
And, as with Ronald Reagan's win here, it was not only the size of
McCain's win that confounded all forecasts, but its shape.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment Republicans who were expected to follow the party
line and vote for George Bush were split evenly between the two.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attracted the bulk of independent votes, many of the
notoriously fickle under-30 voters, and even some Democrats who
switched party allegiance to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The youth vote for McCain _ as for the Democratic challenger,
Bill Bradley _ was particularly striking, given the recent
handwringing in political circles about the apathy and cynicism of
the young people towards all things and people political.
</P>
<P>
   They attended his rallies in force, listened intently to his
forceful and unscripted answers and cheered him to the rafters,
emerging with the joyful judgment that ``he would make a great
president, someone I could respect.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a military hero and Vietnamese
prisoner of war, his readiness to take on the all-powerful
Washington establishment and the great and the good of the
Republican Party all contributed to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the directness, frankness and transparent
truthfulness of his responses that came as such a refreshing change
for the voters and took New Hampshire by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters admitted that they disagreed with some of his
positions, against abortion, for instance, but their confidence in
him personally outweighed such misgivings. In a national climate
where voters are jaded, these qualities could prove transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside McCain, Bush came across as charming, but weak and
immature. New Hampshirites can pass on the charm, but they admire
character, and they found Bush wanting.
</P>
<P>
   His spontaneity was limited to hand-shaking; his speeches were
multiple variations on his original declaration speech from the
early summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texan just failed to connect _ a problem that also
afflicted his father, whose family estate at Kennebunkport is only
just over the border in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of George Bush, Sr. to campaign for his son over the
final weekend only underlined to many the aspects of George W. Bush
that New Hampshire least likes: his money and his establishment
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be able to count on similar disaffection with
the party establishment elsewhere in the country. Money and
organization count, and Bush has them in spades. But they may not
count for everything.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks will show whether McCain's New Hampshire
victory will remain, as he stated Wednesday, ``the greatest moment
of my political career,'' or whether there is more to come. &QL;

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   The defending conference champions appear to have helped
themselves in every area and could be poised to make a run at the
national championship. The Tide signed three blue-chip defensive
linemen from Alabama schools _ Mac Tyler of Bessemer, Anthony
Bryant of Newbern and Antwan Odom of Bayou La Batre. Thirteen of 26
signees are offensive or defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Coach Houston Nutt continues to bring in solid classes, the
latest headed by cornerback Lawrence Richardson of Galveston,
Texas. Defensive end Jason Peters of Queen City, Texas, is another
talented player, along with cornerback Bo Mosely from Osceola, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers did exceptionally well, signing 10 athletes and
helping themselves at every position. Running back Rudi Johnson
from Butler Community College in Kansas and defensive end Alton
Moore from Southwest Mississippi are among the best in the nation.
Running back Ronnie Brown from Cartersville and quarterback Jason
Campbell of Taylorsville, Miss., could make an immediate impact.
Former Georgia player Daniel Cobb gives the Tigers great depth at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spurrier seemed to get everything on his list. The
nation's No. 1-rated quarterback, Brock Berlin, already is in
school. The Gators beat several other schools for four key players
_ offensive linemen Jonathan Colon and Max Starks, receiver Kelvin
Kight of Lithonia and safety Tre Orr. The class was rated anywhere
from first to third by several recruiting publications.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Antonio Hall from Canton, Ohio, is rated the
No. 1 prospect in the nation. Defensive tackle Jeremy Caudill from
Prestonsburg, Ky., is an elite player, as is safety Antwoine Lias
of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   LSU
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, with new coach Nick Saban, made a remarkable
recovery after a slow start. Heading the class of 25 signees are
defensive tackle John Paul Jones from Carencro, La., running back
Derron Parquet from Metairie, La., offensive lineman Kade Comeaux
from Crowley, La., and safety Adrian Mayes from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels started out fast and finished slow, but took a medium
step toward regaining respectability. Offensive lineman Doug
Buckles from Madison, Miss., is an excellent player, and Jason
Youngs, a junior college All-American from College of the Canyons
in Santa Cerrida, Calif., is outstanding. Cornerback Tavarus Horne
from Hattiesburg, Miss., is probably the best of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   MISS. STATE
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite of Mississippi, the Bulldogs started slowly
and finished with a rush. Four excellent players committed to
Jackie Sherrill _ wide receiver Antonio Hargro of Gautier, Miss.,
defensive end Demotto Youngblood from Hargraves Military, safety
Jonathan Bell from Tupelo, Miss., and cornerback Bryan Shumaker
from Ackerman, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lou Holtz has found recruiting to be a little tougher in
Columbia than it was in South Bend. Mitchell-Baker quarterback
Dondrial Pinkins signed with the Gamecocks, and the team might have
found a pair of sleepers in cornerback Gorzie Gray from Waldorf,
Md., and quarterback Rodriques Wilson from Cross, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   The Vols have one of the top recruiting classes in the nation.
O.J. Owens of New London, N.C., is one of the top safeties in the
country. Quarterbacks Casey Clausen and John Rattay and receiver
Rashad Baker are highly rated players at their positions. The top
offensive lineman is 6-foot-7, 285-pound Michael Munoz of
Cincinnati, son of NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to put a tag on the Commodores' class because
academic requirements force them to go for a different breed of
scholar-athlete. Safety Chris Young from Batesville, Miss., and
linebacker Pat Brunner from Cincinnati are solid players, but the
other 13 prospects remain prospects for at least a year.

the state of New Hampshire and its voters.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the qualities that had won New
Hampshire for McCain would not translate onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   This argument, however, disregards the strong record of New
Hampshire in giving future winners their first unexpected break.
And, as with Ronald Reagan's win here, it was not only the size of
McCain's win that confounded all forecasts, but its shape.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment Republicans who were expected to follow the party
line and vote for George Bush were split evenly between the two.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attracted the bulk of independent votes, many of the
notoriously fickle under-30 voters, and even some Democrats who
switched party allegiance to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   The youth vote for McCain _ as for the Democratic challenger,
Bill Bradley _ was particularly striking, given the recent
handwringing in political circles about the apathy and cynicism of
the young people towards all things and people political.
</P>
<P>
   They attended his rallies in force, listened intently to his
forceful and unscripted answers and cheered him to the rafters,
emerging with the joyful judgment that ``he would make a great
president, someone I could respect.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's personal history as a military hero and Vietnamese
prisoner of war, his readiness to take on the all-powerful
Washington establishment and the great and the good of the
Republican Party all contributed to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the directness, frankness and transparent
truthfulness of his responses that came as such a refreshing change
for the voters and took New Hampshire by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters admitted that they disagreed with some of his
positions, against abortion, for instance, but their confidence in
him personally outweighed such misgivings. In a national climate
where voters are jaded, these qualities could prove transferable.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside McCain, Bush came across as charming, but weak and
immature. New Hampshirites can pass on the charm, but they admire
character, and they found Bush wanting.
</P>
<P>
   His spontaneity was limited to hand-shaking; his speeches were
multiple variations on his original declaration speech from the
early summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texan just failed to connect _ a problem that also
afflicted his father, whose family estate at Kennebunkport is only
just over the border in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of George Bush, Sr. to campaign for his son over the
final weekend only underlined to many the aspects of George W. Bush
that New Hampshire least likes: his money and his establishment
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be able to count on similar disaffection with
the party establishment elsewhere in the country. Money and
organization count, and Bush has them in spades. But they may not
count for everything.
</P>
<P>
   The next two weeks will show whether McCain's New Hampshire
victory will remain, as he stated Wednesday, ``the greatest moment
of my political career,'' or whether there is more to come. &QL;

   The self-frustrating attempts of Tony Blair's government to
foist its favored candidates upon unwilling party members in Wales,
and London, have made us familiar with the dynamics that helped to
determine the outcome of America's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as crown princes waiting for coronation is surely
one reason why Republican and Democratic voters in the ``granite
state'' failed to give George W. Bush and Al Gore the ecstatic
support they may once have expected in the opening round of this
year's presidential primaries. But the natural desire to kick over
the traces tells only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of the primary system is that it forces would-be
candidates to face ``real'' voters, not just party hacks and those
with strong affiliations to a cause or a movement.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important at a time when there is a
practical consensus on most of the main issues of the day, so that
the character of the candidates comes to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contest among the Democrats first. A few months ago, as
vice president in an administration that was presiding over a
period of unparalleled national prosperity, Gore was the
unchallenged heir apparent to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former New Jersey senator and one-time star
basketball player Bill Bradley entered the lists under the flag of
reform, Gore found his opinion poll ratings sagging badly.
</P>
<P>
   His response _ to move his election headquarters from Washington
to his home state of Tennessee and to start wearing cowboy boots
and shouting a lot _ may seem a little obvious to worldly-wise
British eyes, but it seems to have done him a lot of good.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore once planned to see off his rival's challenge early in
the season, thus sparing his party much expenditure in dollars and
bad blood, New Hampshire will have disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's 47 percent of the vote is enough to encourage him to
carry his challenge forward, and he has already raised nearly as
much campaigning money as the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may have failed to score the clean knockout he
desired, on the Republican side Bush was battered badly by his
challenger, Senator John McCain, who took five votes for every
three that went to Bush. (The remaining three Republican hopefuls,
who shared 14 percent of the vote between them, would be well
advised to abandon all hope for this year's nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's main claim to the nomination was the huge popular lead
he held in early polling, it was a particularly bad result for him.
The debates so far have shown that there is strangely little of
substance in his thought, beyond a blatant appeal to religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   His sole remaining advantage is the $69 million war chest he has
amassed, which will be crucial in paying for TV advertising in the
big states, where person-to-person campaigning is fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain, by ironic contrast, has made so much of his
desire to take the influence of big money out of politics, that he
may have a hard time raising the funds he will need to compete in
the remaining primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if he does well on Feb. 19 in South Carolina (a
Southern state proclaimed ``Bush country'' by Bush himself), we may
yet see one of the great political upsets.
</P>
<P>
   We would not be unhappy to see the crumpling of that cardboard
figure. And a presidential race that pits a crusading outsider
against a veteran Washington insider such as Gore could present the
American voter with a genuine choice this November. &QL;

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   CLEMSON
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers appear to have strengthened their offense, with nine
offensive signees. The top recruits include tight end Todd
McClinton, wide receiver Derrick Hamilton, and running back Keith
Kelly, all from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils signed 21 players, but the one with the most
name-recognition is receiver Jeremy Battier, the younger brother of
Duke basketball player Shane Battier. Offensive lineman Patrick
Worsham of Daytona Beach, Fla., and tight end Reggie Love of
Charlotte have impressive credentials.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Another strong Seminoles class. Two top-rated defensive backs,
cornerback Bryant McFadden of Hollywood, Fla., and strong safety
Yohance Buchanan of Douglass High, and linebackers Eric Moore of
Pahokee, Fla., and Michael Boulware, brother of former Seminole and
current Baltimore Ravens linebacker Peter Boulware, enter the
program, along with receiver Javon Walker of Jones County Junior
College in Mississippi and talented offensive lineman Alex Barron
from Orangeburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ron Vanderlinden had an impressive recruiting effort.
Chris Kelley of Germantown, Md., was rated by some as one of the
top 10 passers. Hampton (Va.) High receiver Maurice Shanks should
add some firepower.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting class was headed by two in-state gems _
quarterback Aaron Alston of Durham and defensive end Clarence Gaddy
of Lillington. Brandon Russell of Marist, and Andre Williams of
Durham are talented running backs.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack fell behind in the recruiting race after coach
Chuck Amato was hired more than one month after the firing of
former coach Mike O'Cain. The class is topped by 6-foot-5
quarterback Phillips Rivers of Athens, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Coach George Welsh and his staff bring in another solid class.
Linebacker Ray Mann from Hampton High and running back Art Thomas
of Fork Union Military Academy, both Virginia schools, are touted
players at their positions. Running back Marquis Weeks from Berwyn,
Pa., might be a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons didn't do well. The top two signees are running back
Fred Staton of Charlotte and defensive end R.D. Montgomery of
Wilmington, N.C.

 BUSH AND PATAKI HALT EFFORTS TO KEEP McCAIN OFF N.Y. BALLOT  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fearing that they were energizing Sen. John McCain's
candidacy, Gov. George W. Bush and his chief supporter in New York,
Gov. George Pataki, on Thursday abandoned their efforts to keep
McCain out of the the presidential primary and said they would
insure that he is on the ballot statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Pataki, who both had insisted for weeks that the
primary rules were not burdensome, reversed themselves after
McCain's landslide victory in New Hampshire had increasingly
exposed them to criticism that they were rigging the New York
contest to halt McCain's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the governors sensed the skirmish over the primary
ballot was giving McCain powerful ammunition in the upcoming
contests in South Carolina and Michigan to portray himself as an
outsider crusading against a corrupt political system. McCain, who
had qualified for the New York primary in only 19 of the state's 31
congressional districts, has also made overhauling the campaign
finance laws a cornerstone of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pataki conceded that the campaign leading to the
March 7 New York primary ``should be about ideas and issues, not
about technicalities. Gov. Bush will win that campaign because he
has the ideas and he has the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The surrender by Bush and Pataki over the ballot issue adds even
more luster to a McCain campaign that is on a remarkable upswing
this week, and hopes to continue its surge as it heads to the South
Carolina primary on Feb. 19, and then to Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has repeatedly demanded that Bush rein in the state
party, hailed the decision to let him on the ballot statewide.
``Republicans of New York, rejoice! You're free!'' he said while
campaigning in South Carolina on Thursday. ``I always thought
Texans wanted a fair fight, and he obviously didn't want one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought to distance himself from the dispute, saying
that it was up to the New York Republican State Committee to
determine how to handle the challenges to the McCain candidacy and
that everyone had to play by the same rules. But hours after Bush's
loss in New Hampshire, his chief strategist, Karl Rove, called
Republican leaders in New York on Wednesday and urged them to quell
what had been transformed into a David-and-Goliath fight and to
stem the political damage it had wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Thursday night on his campaign plane on a
tarmac in Dover, Del., before leaving for Michigan, Bush said
Pataki had informed Rove on Thursday afternoon that the party would
let McCain on the ballot in New York, which has the third-largest
number of delegates to the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that this was a decision that he and the party
made,'' Bush said, referring to Pataki. ``We said, `That's the
right decision.' I welcome the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an odd coda to the fight, McCain spoke by phone with former
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who had been Pataki's political
patron but had spoken out in recent weeks in favor of letting
McCain on the ballot statewide. ``Hey Alfonse, how are you doing,
pal?'' McCain told D'Amato. ``I understand you've been doing the
Lord's work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still faces uphill battles in states like South Carolina
and New York, where the Republican establishment stands solidly
behind Bush. Despite an influx of donations after his success in
New Hampshire, the senator's war chest is tens of millions of
dollars smaller than Bush's. And even with the burst of publicity
from New Hampshire and the ballot fight in New York, McCain still
confronts the daunting task of trying to finance increasingly
expensive campaigns in much larger states than New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday ended a lengthy battle that had
focused widespread attention on New York's rules, which are the
toughest in the country, requiring campaigns to circulate petitions
in each of the state's 31 congressional districts while adhering to
a bevy of do's and don't's. The rules heavily favor the candidate
backed by the state party _ in this case, Bush _ because underdogs
do not have the party foot soldiers to collect signatures and
weather the inevitable legal challenges to petitions.
</P>
<P>
   With a shoe-string organization that hardly crosses the whole
state, McCain had sought to get on the ballot, but after petition
challenges by the party, he had qualified in only 19 of the 31
districts. McCain's lawyers sued in federal court to overturn the
system, and a judge had been expected to rule soon in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   How Pataki will engineer getting McCain on the ballot statewide
was a question that Pataki aides declined to discuss Thursday
night. It may require that Pataki ask the Legislature to approve a
special bill putting the three major contenders _ Bush, McCain and
Steve Forbes _ on the ballot. Forbes has already qualified across
the state, while Bush is on the ballot in all but one district,
having been thrown off in the South Bronx because campaign workers
committed petition fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state party were engaged in talks with McCain's
lawyers Thursday night, hoping to settle the case without having
the precedent of a legal ruling by the federal court that could
affect future elections.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's lawyers were adamant that they would not simply
accept a deal that placed McCain on the ballot without overturning
many of the rules they believe are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain didn't fight this hard to get on the ballot just
for himself,'' said one of the lawyers, Burt Neuborne, legal
director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University
School of Law. ``One of the thing he wants is to reform the system.
Until they are willing to acknowledge that the system is
unconstitutional, I have nothing to say to them.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of the election rules are abolished, the outcome of the
legal case and the settlement talks could thus influence future
presidential primaries and other New York elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Pataki has been on the defensive over the ballot
challenges in recent weeks, his aides Thursday night sought to turn
the tables on McCain once again. ``We are going to make sure that
they focus on ideas and issues, not on ballot access,'' said Zenia
Mucha, a spokeswoman for Pataki. ``The fact of the matter is they
are hiding behind this issue because they are devoid of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the McCain campaign in New York, Guy Molinari,
the Staten Island borough president, said that no matter how the
Bush partisans depicted the shift, their candidate had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood why they would allow this thing to occur as
long as it had,'' Molinari said. ``It has helped our campaign
enormously. It is a great issue for us, but it's not an issue that
we wanted.''

<P>
   The self-frustrating attempts of Tony Blair's government to
foist its favored candidates upon unwilling party members in Wales,
and London, have made us familiar with the dynamics that helped to
determine the outcome of America's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as crown princes waiting for coronation is surely
one reason why Republican and Democratic voters in the ``granite
state'' failed to give George W. Bush and Al Gore the ecstatic
support they may once have expected in the opening round of this
year's presidential primaries. But the natural desire to kick over
the traces tells only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of the primary system is that it forces would-be
candidates to face ``real'' voters, not just party hacks and those
with strong affiliations to a cause or a movement.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important at a time when there is a
practical consensus on most of the main issues of the day, so that
the character of the candidates comes to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contest among the Democrats first. A few months ago, as
vice president in an administration that was presiding over a
period of unparalleled national prosperity, Gore was the
unchallenged heir apparent to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former New Jersey senator and one-time star
basketball player Bill Bradley entered the lists under the flag of
reform, Gore found his opinion poll ratings sagging badly.
</P>
<P>
   His response _ to move his election headquarters from Washington
to his home state of Tennessee and to start wearing cowboy boots
and shouting a lot _ may seem a little obvious to worldly-wise
British eyes, but it seems to have done him a lot of good.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore once planned to see off his rival's challenge early in
the season, thus sparing his party much expenditure in dollars and
bad blood, New Hampshire will have disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's 47 percent of the vote is enough to encourage him to
carry his challenge forward, and he has already raised nearly as
much campaigning money as the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may have failed to score the clean knockout he
desired, on the Republican side Bush was battered badly by his
challenger, Senator John McCain, who took five votes for every
three that went to Bush. (The remaining three Republican hopefuls,
who shared 14 percent of the vote between them, would be well
advised to abandon all hope for this year's nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's main claim to the nomination was the huge popular lead
he held in early polling, it was a particularly bad result for him.
The debates so far have shown that there is strangely little of
substance in his thought, beyond a blatant appeal to religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   His sole remaining advantage is the $69 million war chest he has
amassed, which will be crucial in paying for TV advertising in the
big states, where person-to-person campaigning is fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain, by ironic contrast, has made so much of his
desire to take the influence of big money out of politics, that he
may have a hard time raising the funds he will need to compete in
the remaining primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if he does well on Feb. 19 in South Carolina (a
Southern state proclaimed ``Bush country'' by Bush himself), we may
yet see one of the great political upsets.
</P>
<P>
   We would not be unhappy to see the crumpling of that cardboard
figure. And a presidential race that pits a crusading outsider
against a veteran Washington insider such as Gore could present the
American voter with a genuine choice this November. &QL;

<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Two of the world's leading companies in
wireless communications agreed Thursday to merge in a $183 billion
deal, the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning end to the kind of hostile takeover attempt once
considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany. The
all-stock transaction easily shattered the previous record for a
takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the takeover will vastly expand the geographic
reach of Vodafone, which already is the world's biggest wireless
telephone company, giving it dominance in the European market and a
global base of more than 50 million customers. Vodafone already has
a major presence in the United States and two dozen countries in
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal is perhaps more important as a
watershed in European corporate behavior and the export to Europe
of bare-knuckled takeover tactics first honed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a European company carried off a hostile
takeover on such an audacious scale: cross-border, cross-cultural
and paid for with shares in a company that was almost unknown
outside of Britain 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann
still need to be approved by the German conglomerate's supervisory
board _ the equivalent of a board of directors. It is expected to
ratify the agreement at a meeting scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came just four days before the expiration of Vodafone's
takeover offer to holders of Mannesmann stock, which Mannesmann's
management had called unwanted, unfriendly and too low.
</P>
<P>
   And although it was nominally called a ``friendly'' merger
Thursday, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann, only
capitulated when it became obvious that a majority of his
shareholders were about to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann,
a great company, would be better together with Vodafone Airtouch,''
Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, told reporters in
Duesseldorf, where he has spent the last two days negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who had been voluble in his opposition to Vodafone's
takeover designs and had been expected to resign, said he would
continue to work for the combined company, but he will be a clear
subordindate to Gent. Esser will become a non-exective chairman and
keep a seat on the company's board. Mannesmann will get an
additional four seats on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shareholders will control a 49.5 percent share of the
combined company and get 58.96 Vodafone shares for each Mannesmann
share they own. Based on Vodafone's closing share price Wednesday
of 3.855 pounds or $6.21, the day before word of the deal got out,
the total value is about $366.14 per share or $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone shares hold their value, the agreement will be a
huge bonanza for shareholders in Mannesmann, which is the most
widely owned foreign stock in the United States. The takeover price
for Mannesmann shares is more than double what they cost before the
takeover battle began.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has to be reviewed and approved by the European
Commission, which is expected to issue a preliminary decision on
Feb. 17. But the deal is a bitter defeat for Esser, who had
passionately fought to preserve his company's independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Esser insisted Thursday night that the situation was the best
possible outcome. ``It's not a change of opinion,'' he told
reporters. But the discomfort was evident between Esser and Gent
when the two men presented their agreement Thursday night. Despite
a show of collegiality, they could barely bring themselves to shake
hands for more than a moment. After a bit of prodding by
photographers, they were cajoled into shaking hands again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Esser's public nonchalance, the takeover is also a shock
to Mannesmann, an old-line industrial conglomerate that had
brilliantly transformed itself into the biggest provider of
wireless communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann owns national networks in Germany, Italy and Britain,
while Vodafone owns Britain's second-largest network and scores of
other stakes around Europe and on other continents.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent outmaneuvered Esser on the chessboard of Europe's
wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely
valuable national wireless licenses in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed
to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies _ Vivendi SA of
France. That move derailed Esser's desperate attempt to hammer out
a merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a
major French network and greatly strengthened his position with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie
Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal
convinced wavering shareholders that Esser had lost the upper hand,
even with his allies, and they immediately began betting on a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies began to work in earnest together
at the start of the week. The companies reached a basic agreement
in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Negotiations continued for
most of Thursday until the announcement was made late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's
three biggest markets _ Britain, Germany and Italy _ along with a
45 percent stake in the biggest U.S. network and holdings in more
than 30 other countries, from Sweden and Poland to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of Mannesmann makes history on several fronts
besides its size.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has seen a surge of hostile takeovers, the only
successful ones only have been between competitors within a single
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Mannesmann marked one of the first real battles
for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants
recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption
of a single currency in eleven countries made it crucial to
overcome national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also marked one of the first cases in which national
political leaders did not try to interfere in order to protect an
important domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated
takeover battle last year, the battle was largely sanctioned and
guided by the French Ministry of Finance, which wanted to
consolidate the nation's banking industry and keep out foreign
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true when Totalfina SA, the French-Belgian oil
company, launched a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine
SA. Likewise, Italian political leaders actively opposed the
proposed telephone merger between Deutsche Telekom of Germany and
Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Italy's Olivetti SPA.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reaction was entirely different. Despite the
angry rhetoric from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about the
dangers of hostile takeovers, the German government stayed out of
the fight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That reflected a widespread view among German business
executives that it was far more dangerous to interfere with a
legitimate if hostile bid and jeopardize the ability of German
companies like DaimlerChrysler to buy up foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser and Gent waged their battle almost entirely
through direct appeals to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market view was that following the deal with Vivendi there
really weren't any more ways that Mannesmann could present a better
strategy,'' Andrew Moffat, telecommunications analyst at the Dutch
bank ABN Amro said. ``A friendly deal is what both sets of
shareholders were aggressively trying to push through.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a power struggle between two companies that
both wanted to command the European market. It began in January
1999 when Vodafone acquired AirTouch of the United States, a long
time minority partner in all of Mannesmann's communication
ventures. But the conflict deepened when Mannesmann invaded
Vodafone's home territory by buying Orange, Britain's third largest
mobile phone network for $33 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Mannesmann's direct attack in Britain, Gent decided
that Vodafone could not remain a real player unless it took over
its partner-turned-rival.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies employed armies of investment bankers to advise
them. Vodafone's lead adviser was Goldman Sachs which devoted more
than 100 people to the cause and will earn about $75 million,
analysts estimate. Vodafone is also advised by Warburg Dillon Read,
which is expected to take home $50 million. It is unclear how much
Mannesmann's advisers stand to earn.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's advisers are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Deutsche Bank AG. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

 &HT;    Despite losses, a solid haul for Dogs
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ College football coaches don't announce that they
had a bad recruiting class. But Georgia coach Jim Donnan came close
to such an admission when he spoke about the Bulldogs' latest group
of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad recruiting year from the standpoint that we
didn't get the players in the state that we went after,'' Donnan
said. ``But we got enough players when you look at some of the
out-of-state guys we were able to pick up. And a lot of the players
that we lost were at positions where maybe we could afford to lose
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Donnan was probably a little hard on himself and his
staff. Granted, the Bulldogs didn't rack up the majority of the top
players in the state, as they have the previous two seasons. But
they did bring in a solid group of 18 prospects, eight to 10 of
whom have a realistic chance of contributing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengths: Georgia's 2000 class has two major strengths: It
helps to address some immediate needs, and it is solid
academically.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs needed quarterbacks and defensive backs and they
got three and four, respectively. They also needed to boost their
potential at running back, which they did by signing a pair of high
school All-Americans, and to gain depth in the defensive line,
which they did with four players there.
</P>
<P>
   As of signing day, Georgia had only three signees who had not
met entrance requirements, and it expects that number to decrease _
perhaps to zero _ by August.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weaknessess: The Bulldogs did not sign a single offensive
lineman, they signed only two linebackers, and they didn't get the
blockbuster defensive lineman, linebacker or defensive back they
were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 offensive linemen on scholarship next year, Georgia
didn't make that position a priority. Instead, the Bulldogs
concentrated on recruiting the best players around.
</P>
<P>
   _ One that got away: Losing offensive lineman Sean Young to
Tennessee is difficult to understand. The 6-foot-8, 295-pound high
school All-American is the younger brother of Chad Young, a rising
sophomore lineman at Georgia. The boys' parents were outspoken that
Sean should join his brother in Athens and were clear in their
disdain for the Bulldogs' rivals to the north. Even so, Young chose
to sign with the Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned he wouldn't get a whole lot of playing time
here,'' Donnan said. ``He knows a lot about our program, and he
knows we have 16 linemen on scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't miss: Both of Georgia's running backs are good ones.
Albert Hollis II of Sacramento, Calif., was a consensus high school
All-American and is one of the fastest prospects in the country.
Musa Smith of Elliottsburg, Pa., is a big, strong back who averaged
more than 9 yards a carry and scored 31 touchdowns as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleeper(s): Three to watch out for are quarterback David
Greene, defensive lineman Johnathan Sullivan and defensive end
Arnold Harrison.

</P>
<P>
   As the number of Americans who own stock has reached record
levels, capital gains have grown as a share of all income, but
dividends have not. Tax policy is a major factor for these events.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, just before the long bull market began, capital gains
were reported by 11.4 percent of taxpayers. But that share grew to
16.1 percent of taxpayers by 1997, according to data released
recently by the Internal Revenue Service. (Capital gains are
reported only when stocks and other capital assets are sold.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the share of income attributable to capital
gains has also rose. In 1997, capital gains accounted for 7.4
percent of adjusted gross income _ the last figure on the front
page of a Form 1040 tax return _ up from 2.4 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, companies increasingly held down the growth
of dividends, with many paying none at all, partly to save cash for
expansion. Dividends in 1997 equaled about 1.6 percent of the value
of large stocks, down from 4.5 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That lower distribution rate explains how dividends accounted
for just 2.4 percent of adjusted gross incomes, according to tax
return data, the same share as in 1980, despite the growth in stock
ownership. Half of all American households now own equities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal tax law discourages dividends in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, dividends are taxed twice, because they are paid out of
after-tax corporate earnings and then must be reported as taxable
income by individuals. And dividends are taxed at ordinary income
rates, which can be as high as 39.6 percent, while long-term
capital gains are taxed at no more than 20 percent.

   The workplace can indeed be cozy. At some point in their
careers, 59 percent of workers have had an office romance,
according to a recent survey of 1,118 people by Vault.com, an
online career information site.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four percent said they had not indulged in a romantic
relationship at work, nor did they care to. The remaining 17
percent said they had never dated a co-worker, but they expressed a
willingness to do so if the opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, an office romance, like any other, can end
badly. Even so, 76 percent of those surveyed said that finding love
at work was worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' was the feedback from one worker who obviously
had taken the chance. ``Where else can you meet so many people?
We're heading for our 25th wedding anniversary.'' &QL;

   While Valentine's Day conjures up images of a candlelight dinner
with a special someone, research from American Greetings and the
International Mass Retailers Association shows that more than 80
percent of all valentine cards bought this year will be given to
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Men will spend more on gifts and cards than women _ $100, on
average, compared with $60. The men are more likely to spend the
money on significant others, the research found, while women will
spread their money around, also including gifts for children,
grandchildren and parents.
</P>
<P>
   More than one billion valentines will be exchanged in the United
States this year, American Greetings predicts, making Valentine's
Day the second most popular occasion for holiday greeting cards,
after Christmas.

<P>
   LANSING, Mich _ Solidly in the Republican camp, Tom Miller
rattled off the issues most important to him: taxes, the economy,
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion was nowhere near the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I just put that one aside,'' said Miller, a 36-year-old
engineer, waving a hand in the air, as if to dismiss a troublesome
topic. ``The politicians talk a lot about abortion, but it's not
something that's going to decide my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the passionate debate over abortion among presidential
candidates, interviews with more than 50 voters in Michigan,
Illinois and Wisconsin found that it was the rare voter who saw the
issue as pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about abortion evoked a welter of complicated feelings
that left many people uneasy about even discussing it, preferring
instead to focus on tax policy, or the trustworthiness of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Manning, a 46-year-old corporate manager in Naperville,
Ill., who is the bishop of his Mormon ward, said that while he held
``strong personal views about abortion,'' he preferred that the
issue remain outside the political debate. It was a position he
said was common among his Republican acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run with a pretty conservative group of people,'' Manning
said, ``and I don't think they're basing their votes on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a core of deeply committed voters see abortion as
the overriding issue in American politics. Patricia Gantz, 59, who
lives in Dewitt, Mich., said she wanted to see abortion ``outlawed
in all cases,'' and could not fathom casting a ballot for a
candidate who supported a woman's right to choose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater number of voters, including those on both
sides of the abortion debate, said it was just one of many issues
to be considered. Moreover, voters expressed a skepticism about the
hard-line statements against abortion by some candidates,
particularly Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, saying they could be
merely an effort to win ardently conservative voters in the
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a big share of voters said they did not believe it was
likely that any president could overturn laws that protect abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Heinke Hoenck, a retired secretary in
Janesville, Wis., said she could vote for Bush in the fall, even
though she disagreed with his opposition to the Roe vs. Wade
decision by the Supreme Court in 1973 that gave constitutional
protection to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came right down to it, there would be an uproar in
this country'' if abortion were made illegal, Hoenck said. ``It
would be very hard for a president to change the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Harvey, a 38-year-old engineer in Chicago, expressed a
similar view, saying that government would ultimately find it
impossible to stop abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very religious, and I do not believe in abortion,'' Harvey
said. ``But to me, all this talk about abortion is beside the
point. If people want to have abortions, they're going to have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan consistently sided with forces opposed
to legal abortion, Harvey noted, but failed during his two terms as
president to make it illegal.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was also voiced by strong opponents of abortion,
like Herb Dowman, a 37-year-old environmental engineer in Dewitt,
Mich. ``I'm going to vote for an anti-abortion candidate,'' he
said, ``but I don't expect anything to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Smith, a 41-year-old secretary for an insurance company
in Fort Atkinson, Wis., said that while she opposed the late-term
procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion, she favored
keeping abortions legal in the early term.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when she talked about the issues that would
determine her vote, Smith mentioned taxes and help for farmers,
among other things. Abortion was simply ``not that high on the
list,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look at the total package,'' Smith said. ``One issue
is not going to decide my vote. There are too many important things
to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Schweitzer, an administrator at St. John's Student Parish in
East Lansing, a center for Roman Catholic college students, said
abortion did not dominate the political discussion, even among
people who tried to adhere to church teachings on government
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion gets a lot of press, but it is just one of the church
teachings on life and social justice issues,'' Schweitzer said,
noting that Catholic leaders, while opposing abortion, also
espoused many positions that seemed at odds with Republican
politicians, like greater help for immigrants and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which holds a primary in March, has demonstrated a
penchant for surprise. The state's Democratic voters, for example,
have in the past supported George C. Wallace and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of many voters to support candidates regardless
of their views on abortion concerns Marie Jones, a 32-year-old
research scientist at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me that maybe they could make it illegal,'' Jones
said, noting that many states had enacted restrictions on abortion,
like 24-hour waiting periods and requirements for parental
notification.
</P>
<P>
   The same concern was voiced by Laurie Stephens, a 26-year-old
factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say they're going to outlaw abortion, maybe we ought
to take it seriously,'' Stephens said as she walked down a
department-store aisle with her 4-year-old daughter, Kristin.
``What if it goes through, and we're back to illegal abortions?''

<P>
   ABOARD COAST GUARD CUTTER PENOBSCOT BAY, on the Hudson River _
The inch-thick steel bow plates on this 140-foot, bluff-nosed
cutter thundered as it pulled away from the wharf of the U.S.
Military Academy at dawn and quickly began ``hardwater sailing,''
the term its commander uses to describe ice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot rougher than softwater sailing,'' said Lt. Andrew
Raiha, 31, the ship's captain, as the 700-ton vessel plowed into
Worlds End, a serpentine turn in the river near West Point, 50
miles north of New York City, where it cuts through a gap in the
1,300-foot-tall ramparts of the Hudson Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutal cold snap in January, the river started freezing
so thick and fast that powerful tug boats pushing 1 million- to
3-million-gallon loads of heating oil and other fuels upriver were
becoming trapped at this turn, where drifting ice floes piled up
like plaque in an ailing artery.
</P>
<P>
   The ice blockade on the Hudson, which developed over the last
two weeks, is the worst in six years, according to Coast Guard
officials.
</P>
<P>
   With shortages of heating oil already growing in many parts of
upstate New York and prices topping $2 a gallon, the ice-breaking
mission that the Coast Guard has had on the Hudson since 1933 has
rarely been as urgent as it is now, Raiha said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was made more difficult after the Department of
Transportation last year eliminated money for three 65-foot ice
breakers that assist the Penobscot Bay and a sister ship, said Lt.
Danna Lopez, a spokeswoman in the Coast Guard's regional
headquarters on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The ships have been operating despite the budget cut, she said,
with the Coast Guard absorbing the cost. ``It costs $1,194,000 to
operate those boats for a season,'' she said of the smaller craft.
``Compare that to the $1.8 billion in fuel delivered during the
last ice season up the Hudson. It's nothing to operate these things
and the benefits are tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the ice breakers did not need to be spelled out
to Sloan Danenhower, the captain of the Mary Gellatly, a tug boat
that was pushing a bargeload of 600,000 gallons of heating oil
north toward Poughkeepsie _ or at least was trying to.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, there would have been a second tug hired to help out,
Danenhower said, but there was so much demand for oil these days
that every tug on the river was already working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm losing ground here,'' Danenhower called over the
radio to the cutter. Halfway through the turn near West Point, the
tug and its barge had come to a halt, even though the tug's twin
propellers, driven by a 1,800-horsepower engine, churned the brown
water furiously.
</P>
<P>
   The reason became clear as the cutter circled back and the crew
noted a 100-foot-long wedge of slushy ice stuck in front of the
square bow of the barge.
</P>
<P>
   The cutter's helmsman, Chief Petty Officer Deane Smith, drew the
ship alongside the barge, then _ jiggling a joystick rather than
the traditional wheel _ slid the black-hulled cutter ahead of the
barge's bow, in a maneuver that left several coast guardsmen
holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as close as it gets,'' said Raiha, exhaling for
the first time in half a minute as the cutter began breaking a
channel and, with its propeller wash, blasting the wedge of ice
away from the barge's bow.
</P>
<P>
   Roiling bubbles rose from air pumps in the cutter's keel,
helping break up the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off as the tug gained speed. ``We're really moving
now,'' Raiha said, clapping his fist into his palm. The speed
indicator showed the ship was making 3.3 knots, a fast walking
pace.
</P>
<P>
   The radio crackled with Danenhower's voice. ``I really
appreciate this,'' he said. ``It's not often that I pay taxes and
it comes right back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The small convoy slowly nosed into the broad expanse of Newburgh
Bay, passing Storm King Mountain, which was wrapped in a veil of
snow that rapidly spread, erasing the shorelines and seemingly
transporting the vessels to some Arctic wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   As the ship broke into a mile-wide plate of virgin ice, it sent
black cracks speeding in every direction and turned the blank white
surface into a crazy-quilt checkerboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard crew settled into a rhythm, trading places at
the helm, noting the temperature _ 22 degrees and barely climbing _
watching ahead and behind, and absorbing the relentless vibrations,
which made everything from ceiling panels to coffee cups squeak,
jiggle and hum.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, out of the snowy haze, a cluster of green
storage tanks materialized on the eastern bank of the river. The
cutter carved a channel and the barge was slowly nudged alongside
an oil terminal. Waiting at the pier were three Nash Brothers
heating-oil delivery trucks, ready to fill their 10,000-gallon
tanks and head to homes around Dutchess County.
</P>
<P>
   The Penobscot Bay retraced its path back to its temporary berth
at West Point. Behind the ship, the ice floes closed in over the
channel it had recently cut.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the frigid wind would be welding the seam into a
frozen scar, ready to be cut open again in the morning.

 &HT;    Bush vows to battle McCain for S.C. military votes
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. _ With new polls showing George W. Bush tied _ or
even behind _ Arizona Sen. John McCain in this crucial primary
state, Bush on Thursday made it clear that he will fight for a
critical voting bloc that has a natural affinity for his war hero
rival: veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The votes of military men and women, veterans, and their
families will be crucial in the Feb. 19 primary. Almost one in 10
residents are veterans, and there are three major military
installations here.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' efforts to woo them are likely to intensify in a
race that is suddenly extremely close. Late last month, Bush had a
51 percent to 29 percent lead over McCain, whom he led by 33 points
in December and 47 points in November. But polls released today,
the first since McCain's 19-point New Hampshire victory, tell a
different story: One shows McCain with a slight lead, while another
indicates that the two candidates are virtually tied.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina GOP Chairman Henry McMaster, who has not endorsed
either candidate, said he expected McCain's poll numbers to rise,
``but I don't know if anybody expected this.'' The new polls also
compounded the jitters that began among Bush supporters after his
New Hampshire loss. While many of those Bush backers noted that the
Texas governor still leads in money and organizational support,
they said he needs to change his campaign tactics to deal with
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who dropped out of the presidential
race in July and endorsed Bush, said the governor must be more
critical of McCain. ``Bush is going to have to get up and fight,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who has not endorsed a
candidate, said Bush needs ``to bone up on a tremendous number of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire GOP Chairman Steve Duprey said Bush ``was
overhandled and overscripted.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist said phone lines have been buzzing as
key Bush financial backers, angry about the New Hampshire defeat,
try to figure out what went wrong. ``Oh, they're puckered up,'' the
strategist said, adding that Bush needs to ``throw away the cue
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast of MccCain standing in front of a crowd with a
mike and Bush standing in front of a podium with white guys behind
him, that needs to change,'' the GOP strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, however, dismissed the numbers, with Bush saying
``the prop-wash of defeat is going to be around a while.'' McCain,
saying ``the polls will bounce up and down,'' seemed more serious
about the prospect of leading the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully prepared to be commander in chief,'' McCain, a
former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war, told an audience
outside a waterfront home in Beaufort. ``I do not need on-the-job
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning veterans' votes from McCain, a bonafide war hero, won't
be easy for Bush, who served stateside in the Texas Air National
Guard during Vietnam. But he's determined to try. Bush has matched
McCain by appointing a ``veteran chairman'' in every one of South
Carolina's 46 counties. Both candidates have promised to raise
active duty pay. McCain says he'll improve education and health
benefits for veterans, while Bush promised Thursday to speed their
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of proof should not be on those who've worn the
uniforms. The burden of proof must be on the bureaucracy,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Currey was one of the veterans who stood behind Bush on
the steps of the courthouse here. Currey said he's impressed by the
heroism of McCain, who spent five and a half years in the infamous
Hanoi Hilton. After all, Currey knows what heroism is all about _
he earned the Medal of Honor for taking out four German tanks in
Belgium during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Currey, who was courted by both campaigns, said he's backing
Bush because he has been a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a broken pipe in your basement, and there were two
guys who said they could fix it, one who wasn't in the military but
was a good plumber, and the other who had a great military record
but didn't know anything about plumbing, who would you pick?''
Currey said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition and the
Coalition of Retired Military Benefits, which is based in Sumter,
also endorsed Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War
Veterans Coalition, said of McCain: ``He came home and forgot us.''
Afterward, Burch said the senator hadn't supported his group's
efforts on Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome and support for families
of soldiers missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fired back that some other veterans' groups have backed
him and given him their highest awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I fooled the veterans' organizations, or is there a
little foolishness going on here?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McMaster said, issues take a back seat to personal
history when it comes to McCain and veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others appeal to them on issues. McCain appeals to them on
brotherhood, camaraderie and shared experiences,'' McMaster said.

   Pensions That Get Bigger Than Their Sponsors &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a time of hard-to-explain stock valuations, many investors
wonder what makes a company a true value play. One possible answer
is this: When the company's pension plan is worth more than its
stock market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Pensions &AMP; Investments, a trade magazine, did some financial
analysis and discovered that at least 4 of the 100 largest
companies in the country, ranked by revenue, had pension funds
whose assets on Sept. 30 exceeded their total market
capitalizations on that date.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, that would mean that such pension funds were in a
position to acquire their sponsoring companies _ if federal law did
not limit the amount of company stock that a pension fund could
hold.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 on the list was General Motors, the world's largest
industrial corporation, whose assets in its defined benefit plans,
at $69.5 billion, were far above its market capitalization of $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies on the list were Lockheed Martin, with defined
benefit assets worth $23.8 billion and a market cap of just $13.2
billion, and UAL, the parent of United Airlines, at $8.3 billion
and $3.5 billion. And the USX-U.S. Steel Group had defined benefit
assets, that, at $10.9 billion, were more than four times its
market cap of $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The article, in the Jan. 24 issue of the magazine, quoted a
consultant, Keith Ambachtsheer of KPA Advisory Services in Toronto,
as suggesting that such companies might better be considered
specialized insurance businesses than the usual sort of operating
companies, because, to some degree, they focus on ``the business of
paying a pension until everyone dies.'' The magazine noted that USX
had about 100,000 pensioners but a work force of only 20,000.

   Tracking More Sectors &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Merrill Lynch introduced two new versions of one of
its hottest retail investment products _ Holdr's (pronounced
``holders''), securities that track specific industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The new securities, Telecom Holdr's and Pharmaceutical Holdr's,
were listed on the American Stock Exchange and began trading at
$87.875 and $91.875, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The securities, which may be traded only in round lots of 100,
each represent specific shares of 20 underlying companies in a
sector. A round lot of Telecom Holdr's, for example, represents 27
shares of SBC Communications, 22 of MCI WorldCom, 6 of Level 3
Communications and one of NTL, among other stocks. The
Pharmaceutical Holdr's represent 36 shares of Pfizer, 14 of Abbott
Laboratories and one each of Allergan, Forest Laboratories and
Ivax, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Holdr's have advantages over mutual funds. Annual expenses are
low, at 8 cents a share, and even those are waived if dividends
don't cover the amount. There is usually no turnover. And because
they are created and redeemed by the swapping of the underlying
stocks, Holdr's don't generate capital gains or losses for
investors until their are sold.

 &HT;    Makers of faux turf to square off in court
 &HT;    By Andrea Ball
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They can't agree on whose grass is greener. Or
softer. Or safer.
</P>
<P>
   And now the maker of AstroTurf, pummeled by a Canadian
competitor's accusations of unfair trade practices, is swinging
back with a lawsuit of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's allowed their one cheap shot at the market
leader,'' said Reed Seaton, president of Southwest Recreational
Industries in Leander. ``They've had theirs. This time, we're
standing firm.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 19-page federal lawsuit filed in Austin, Southwest accuses
its smaller rival, Montreal-based FieldTurf Inc., of unfairly
wielding a high-tech weapon: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   FieldTurf is improperly using the AstroTurf trademark to attract
visitors to its Web site, the lawsuit claims. Search engines given
the word ``AstroTurf'' will link Web surfers to FieldTurf's site,
where they are met with an AstroTurf smear campaign, Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic bait-and-switch,'' he said. ``It's, `Don't
look at our product. Look how bad their product is.'''
</P>
<P>
   FieldTurf attorney Arthur Beeman would not comment on the
details of the lawsuit. ``I'm not going to respond to allegations
in a public forum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's lawsuit accuses FieldTurf of trademark infringement,
unfair competition and commercial disparagement and defamation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to bar FieldTurf from using the AstroTurf
name, in addition to seeking an unspecified amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies make synthetic fields for sports and other
recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, the world's largest manufacturer of turf and running
tracks, employs about 500 people at its Leander facility and last
year generated $150 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   FieldTurf earned $19 million during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's lawsuit, filed last week, isn't the first time the
competitors have faced off in court.
</P>
<P>
   FieldTurf sued Southwest in 1998, claiming the Leander company
copied its design for an artificial turf FieldTurf claims offers
improved drainage, better traction and a more natural feel. The
parties settled last spring in a confidential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   FieldTurf resumed the battle last month, filing a lawsuit in
Kentucky that accused Southwest of maintaining a monopoly through
patent infringement and predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on the specific allegations, but the
lawsuit filed in Austin was clearly a reaction to the lawsuit we
filed in Lexington, Ky., and it's clearly retaliatory,'' said
Beeman, FieldTurf's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest denied it is trying to mow down the competition,
calling the suit a ploy to generate media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically harassment by publicity,'' Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   AstroTurf, the first artificial playing field surface, was
created more than 30 years ago after studies showed urban children
were in poorer physical condition than rural children. Monsanto Co.
developed a soft, cheap playing surface that could transform urban
rooftops and asphalt lots into playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial turf came to professional sports in 1966 when it was
used to carpet the Astrodome, inspiring the AstroTurf brand name.
Southwest, which entered the artificial turf business in 1989,
bought AstroTurf Industries Inc. in 1994 for $9.8 million.

   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is embarking
on the most aggressive campaign in its 30-year history to crack
down on corrupt gun dealers who help put firearms in the hands of
criminals and juveniles, White House and Treasury Department
officials said Thursday.

   The new enforcement campaign, to be announced by President
Clinton at the White House Friday, will use information developed
by the firearms bureau in tracing guns used in crimes. As a
byproduct of the tracing, the bureau discovered that just 1.2
percent of federally licensed firearms dealers, 1,020 of them,
originally sold 57 percent of the guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms agency will now intensify its inspections of these
dealers, some of whom have not been checked in years. It will also
require that some dealers start providing records for the first
time of sales of used guns, not just new guns.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau will also require a much fuller and prompter
accounting of sales by dealers who claim that many of their guns
were stolen or simply disappeared. And it will provide for revoking
the licenses of the 31 percent of dealers who say they have not
sold any guns in the past year, a possible sign, officials said,
that those dealers are actually selling to illegal gun traffickers
for a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real sea change,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the
deputy secretary of the treasury. ``In the lifetime of the ATF,
this is by far the most aggressive effort it has ever undertaken to
deal with suspect dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, the firearms bureau will also provide a
list, to any manufacturer that asks for it, of that company's guns
that have been traced to a crime in the previous year, along with
the name of the dealers who sold them.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers have long contended that they have no way of knowing
what happens to their firearms after they leave the factory and so
have no way to police their distributors and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will no longer have this little excuse,'' an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the firearms bureau has been a cautious agency,
often under attack by the National Rifle Association and its
supporters in Congress, and agents who demonstrated zeal in
targeting corrupt dealers were often subject to internal criticism
or had their careers truncated, agents say.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up enforcement program against suspect dealers
presents a challenge to the rifle association and its backers in
Congress. Officials of the rifle group have said repeatedly in
recent months that the government should enforce existing gun laws
rather than adopt new gun-control measures
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Reed, the president's adviser for domestic policy,
said, ``With our actions, we are giving Congress a chance to put
its money where its mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Powers, the rifle association's director of public
affairs, dismissed the announcement of the new plan as a publicity
stunt that would do nothing to reduce violent crime. ``There is
nothing new here,'' he said, adding that ``they already have the
authority'' to do all the things outlined in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painfully obvious that Bill Clinton and Al Gore don't
like people who sell guns, or who own them either,'' Powers said.
``When you are not doing anything, hold a press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Friday is part of a broader effort by the
administration to expand its gun-control efforts, Eizenstat said.
Last month, Clinton said he would ask Congress for 500 more agents
for the firearms bureau, which as a result of NRA pressure over the
years is no larger today than it was when it was established.
</P>
<P>
   The president is also expected to try to win passage this year
of a bill to require background checks on all handguns sold at gun
shows, a bill that passed the Senate last year but died in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement is to be accompanied by the release of
what administration officials said would be the first in an annual
series of comprehensive reports on the state of the gun industry.
The report shows that about 4.5 million new guns are sold in the
United States each year, but that the number of handguns has
increased from only 10 percent of all firearms sales in the 1940s
to more than 40 percent today. Handguns account for the vast
majority of gun deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of federally licensed dealers surged to 284,117 in
1992 from 161,927 in 1975, largely during the Reagan and Bush
administrations, making it harder for the ATF to regulate the gun
business, since its own number of agents did not increase, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Clinton became president, and with tougher criteria to
maintain a firearms license, the number dropped to 103,942 in 1999,
of which 80,570 are actual gun stores or pawnshops and not people
selling from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the report found that while 46 percent of the dealers had
not sold a gun in the previous year in 1992, last year 31 percent
of all gun stores and pawnshops reported they had not sold a gun in
the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is too high a number,'' said an administration official.
``These kinds of dealers have the opportunity to buy large numbers
of guns at wholesale prices and then sell them in the illicit
market at a steep mark up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations, every three years, when a dealer
applies to renew his license, he will have to show how many guns he
has sold in the previous three years, and if he is not actively
engaged in the business, his application may be denied.

<P>
   The report also found that in addition to the 1,020 dealers who
are responsible for 57 percent of all the crime guns traced by the
bureau, there are 450 dealers and pawnbrokers who sold more than 10
guns in 1998 with what the agency calls ``a short time to crime,''
guns that ended up being used in a crime in less than three years
from the date of purchase. The average time to crime is six years.
</P>
<P>
   These dealers, who in some cases may also be in the group with a
high volume of crime guns, will now be required to report
information to the bureau on their sales of used guns. The agency
has had great difficulty tracing secondhand guns because while it
may know the name of the original dealer and purchaser, the chain
is broken after the gun is resold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these actions are wonderful news and smart law
enforcement,'' said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence
Research Project at the University of California at Davis and an
emergency-medicine physician. ``The ATF is using its new
information from gun tracing in a very focused way.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a prevention standpoint, the good news is that the number
of suspect dealers is very limited, so given ATF's resources, it
can concentrate on these few,'' said Wintemute, who has helped
analyze some of the tracing information.

 &HT;    Immediate help on the way for Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech's diverse recruiting haul of 22 players _
plus holdover DL Jamey Hamilton from last season _ could produce
some immediate dividends, especially on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in are three outstanding linebackers, two quality
quarterbacks, six linemen, two fullback/H-backs, three defensive
backs, three wide receiver/athletes and a big, fast tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis throughout the class is on speed and athleticism.
The Yellow Jackets have it in virtually every area of need.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengths: The linebacker trio of Hobie Holiday, Daryl Smith
and Keyaron Fox joins outside linebacker Recardo Wimbush, who led
the team in tackles last season as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of middle linebacker Matt Uremovich to a
career-ending neck injury, immediate help will be needed in support
of Ross Mitchell, especially if Matt Miller does not fully recover
from a knee injury that sidelined him all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary, Jonathan Cox and Tony Hollings bring
man-to-man coverage skills that Tech lacked a year ago. Up front,
Reggie Koon (6 feet 4, 275 pounds) will be hard to keep off the
field, while Alfred Malone (6-4, 240) and Chirod Williams (6-4,
235), have been clocked in the 40-yard dash in 4.8 and 4.7 seconds,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, although Tech already had nine running backs
currently on scholarship, Jimmy Dixon (6-2, 210) should be a factor
early. Linemen Jeremy Phillips (6-7, 295), Leon Robinson (6-4, 275)
and Matt Graviet (6-2, 265) have solid credentials. Tech usually
redshirts offensive linemen, although freshman Raymond
Roberts-Blake played in four games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends Darius Williams and J.P. Foschi could add depth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weakness: None is apparent. The team appears to have filled
all of its needs with players who could contribute immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ One that got away: Marcus Jasmine, a defensive lineman from
New Orleans, signed with Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't miss: Holiday was on everyone's wish list, while
Hollings, Daryl Smith, Koon and Dixon, along with quarterbacks Mark
Logan and Brandon Sumner, passed up shots at possible early
starting roles at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleepers: Jonathan Smith played quarterback, wide receiver and
defensive back at Clinch County, and had near-equal success at all
spots. With 4.4 speed in the 40, Smith will find a spot.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was underrated most of the season at Westlake High, but once
recruiters took a closer look, the chase was on. As a junior, the
linebacker had 20 sacks and eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lumar, from Edgard, La., was a regular at LSU's football
camp. There, he caught the eye of David Kelly, who was an assistant
with the Tigers and now is Tech's receivers coach. Although the
Jackets are loaded at wide receiver, they couldn't afford to pass
on Lumar.

LABOR SHORTAGE: COLOR IT GRAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Goldberg has a warning for corporate America: Change
your attitude toward older workers or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, author of ``Age Works'' (The Free Press, $25), notes
that in 10 years vast numbers of the baby-boom generation will
begin reaching the traditional retirement age of 65. But, she says,
few companies have noticed that there will not be enough younger
workers to replace them. By comparison, today's tight labor market
could look benign.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the economy turned sour, the labor shortage would ease
only temporarily, says Goldberg, who is also a management
consultant and vice president of the Century Foundation, a New York
public policy research institute formerly known as the Twentieth
Century Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most problematic possibility is a continued strong economy
that collides with the retirement of the baby boomers,'' she
writes. ``That scenario would mean an economic catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 2005, when some boomers begin retiring early, a
sharp increase in the number of workers over 55 will be needed to
maintain the percentage of the population that is employed, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of companies will have to scramble to retain or hire older
workers or retirees, many of whom are sitting atop fat 401(k)
accounts. Money alone may not lure them. An adjustment in corporate
attitudes may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good news for companies that have engaged in even
the most subtle age bias. It is also a problem for big corporations
that _ through mergers, downsizings and restructurings _ have sowed
anger, fear and disillusionment among their workers, especially
their older ones.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Goldberg calls the current workplace a ``world of
anxiety and distrust.'' Despite a tight labor market, she says,
demands for higher wages remain weak, because many workers fear
losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I talk to older workers in big corporations, the one
thing I most often hear is how they just can't wait to retire,''
Goldberg said in an interview. ``They have had it. Not that they
want to quit working, but that they want to do something on their
own terms, or work hours that suit them.''
</P>
<P>
   One company that is heeding such warnings is the McDonald's
Corp. Its image as an employer of teenagers is changing through its
efforts to recruit more older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to see a mix of ages working in our
restaurants,''' said Barry Mehrmann, director of McDonald's Human
Resources Design Center in Oak Brook, Ill. ``But from a strategy
point of view, we are clearly looking at older workers and the
things we can do to attract them.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is looking specifically to increase the share of
older workers in its company-owned restaurants. Right now, about 7
percent, or three workers per restaurant, are 60 or older. The
company attracts older workers by offering flexible schedules and,
for those on Social Security, help in tracking earnings to avoid
losing benefits. It also offers management opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers are often good role models, Mehrmann said. ``Their
retention rate is very high,'' he explained. ``They go through our
training program just as fast and just as well as younger workers.
They are great employees that stay with us and add stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said more companies needed to follow the McDonald's
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies fail to train older workers, because they think
they're going to leave,'' she said. ``They really don't consider
them a part of the team or essential to the work that's being done.
They see them as sort of hanging around, which is a big mistake.
It's discouraging to the workers and doesn't get the best out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just wait a few years, when these companies try to retain or
rehire older workers, she added. ``These workers are going to say,
`never mind.' They're going to go off and do something else in
retirement _ start their own businesses, pursue hobbies or go back
to school and get a degree. And that's going to be a disaster for
these companies when workers are ever harder to find.''

   And the news gets worse...
</P>
<P>
   The way is now clear for Jorg Haider and his far-right Freedom
Party to become part of the new Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, has publicly expressed
his queasiness. But, like Britain's Queen Elizabeth, he is
powerless to prevent the formation of a government whose politics
he himself dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   That responsibility lies with other elected politicians, most
notably Wolfgang Schussel, leader of the conservative People's
Party, which wants to form a coalition with Haider.
</P>
<P>
   The forthright criticism from the European Union has fallen on
deaf ears in Austria itself, where the ``gross interference'' is
resented. The danger that Austrians may withdraw into a defiant
bunker is real. Turning a blind eye is, however, impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Haider's party has partly been based on the
growing dislike of the cozy consensus in Austria that has operated
for so long, not just a liking for his extreme policies. But the
underlying xenophobia is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   Haider put his name Thursday to a declaration that the new
government wants an Austria ``in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism
and racism have no place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the circumstances, however _ given that Haider has made
little attempt to distance himself from his previous statements _
such assurances are meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   If Haider were merely a flash in the populist pan, it would
matter less. But there is no reason to suppose that his rise to
power will stop here. He would like to be chancellor. On present
form, he could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, Austria's continued membership of the European
Union would make no sense at all. As Romano Prodi, president of the
European Commission, told The Independent Thursday: ``If we are not
vigilant, the basic democratic foundations of Europe are in
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   East European countries that bid to join the EU are rebuffed if
they show intolerance at home. It would be illogical for a
different set of values to be applied to countries that are already
members of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Haider will not be a second Hitler. There will be no new
concentration camps, but his populist xenophobia presents real
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is ready to withdraw its ambassador. Joschka Fischer, the
German Foreign Minister, insists: ``We cannot go on as if this were
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the European Parliament, British Labor MEPs have talked of
suspending Austria from the EU. But from the Foreign Office,
silence _ described as ``wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait and see was wrong in 1933; and it is wrong today. &QL;

   East European countries that bid to join the EU are rebuffed if
they show intolerance at home. It would be illogical for a
different set of values to be applied to countries that are already
members of the club.

   Haider will not be a second Hitler. There will be no new

   Wait and see was wrong in 1933; and it is wrong today. &QL;

EU MEMBERS SET TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST AUSTRIA
</HEADLINE>
   (See also AUSTRIA-POLITICS, AUSTRIA-VOICES) 
(sw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The European Union, which warned that it would shun
Austria if the far-right Freedom Party joined the government there,
is now preparing to carry out its threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, whose country
holds the rotating European Union presidency, said on Thursday
night that members would begin curtailing relations with Austria on
Friday, the day the Freedom Party will be sworn into the Austrian
government.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a bold, almost impulsive effort to thwart what
critics see as a neo-fascist sentiment rising in Austria has
developed into one of the most serious crises in the 40 years that
Europe has taken steps toward political and economic unity.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders will now feel compelled to prove their resolve,
without so isolating and alienating Austria that it only
strengthens the position of Joerg Haider, the far-right populist
whom European leaders hoped to exclude from their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 European leaders said they would cut bilateral ties to
Austria and blackball Austrian officials from assuming leadership
positions in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini spoke before
Italy's Parliament about Europe's tightrope. ``We need to be
consistent with the action taken by the European Union,'' he said,
but he warned that punishing Austria would be ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who heads the European
Commission, delicately expressed disagreement with European
leaders. A trans-European government body, he said on Wednesday,
has a duty ``not to isolate one of its members but to bind them
inextricably to its basic values.''
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by memories of World War II, Germany and France led the
revolt against what they described as an intolerable and all too
reminiscent xenophobia of Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Their alarm was heightened by fears that an empowered Haider
could infect Germany, where the scandals swirling around Helmet
Kohl, the former chancellor, have weakened his Christian Democratic
Union, a party that contains and tames the German far right. Some
people worry that a German could rise up to tap the same
anti-immigration sentiments that swelled the ranks of the Freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
   France, which has had difficulty containing the far-right party
of Jean-Marie Le Pen, shares similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's center-left government stepped ahead of the others on
Thursday and suggested that Austria should actually be expelled
from the European Union. In Belgium, extreme nationalist parties
have grown powerful by exploiting tensions between Flemish and
French citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In France and Britain, the threat to freeze relations with
Austria had mostly bipartisan support, though in Germany the
Christian Democrats did not support the government's program.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also was politically torn. Center-right opposition leaders
fiercely criticized the action as both a violation of Austrian
sovereignty and a tactical misstep that would backfire by
heightening Haider's popularity. And those arguments were echoed in
parliaments and editorial pages all across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with center-right governments, like Spain, relished
the chance to distance themselves from Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians felt that Europe had to take the risk of
sanctions to ensure that other members did not follow suit. The
stand against Austria had particular meaning in Denmark, where the
anti-immigration Danish People's Party is the country's third most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Henning Gjellerod, a member of the Danish Parliament and vice
president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe,
said the European Union's reprisals make it less likely that the
Danish People's Party would ever be invited to govern with a
conservative coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And the message was also aimed at applicants to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot really afford to sit back and accept what is
happening in Austria at the same time it is lecturing would-be
applicants to the European Union like Hungary and Turkey on the
need for democratic principles and respect for its ethnic
minorities,'' said Anand Menon, a lecturer on European politics at
Oxford who is currently teaching at New York University. ``They
would rightly be accused of hypocrisy.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Turkey, certainly, paid heed to the dispute. ``Can the EU
interfere in the internal affairs of a member state?'' Semih Idiz,
a columnist for the newspaper The Star, wrote on Thursday. ``The
answer to this question, which is very important to Turkey, is now
very clear: Yes, it can, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The past, however, molded the decision as much as concerns about
the future. ``This is the first time an anti-European, xenophobic
party with a very dubious relationship toward the Nazi past has
come into the government of a member state,'' Germany's foreign
minister, Joschka Fischer, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to paint Haider as a reincarnation of Hitler has
its own satisfactions, almost as if many Europeans were welcoming a
chance to rewrite the sins of omission of a generation ago. The
historian Peter Gay, who fled Nazi Germany as a child, commented
dryly, ``I was surprised when I heard about the European Union's
action, but then I thought, of course, it is high time we did
something about 1933.''
</P>
<P>
   To some Americans, drilled in the bedrock principle of free
speech, Europe's attempt to muzzle a politician elected with 27
percent of the popular vote seemed puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be a paradox,'' said Nadine Stossner,
president of the American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully
defended the right of American neo-Nazis to parade in Skokie, Ill.,
in 1977. ``To protect democracy and human rights, the Europeans
have adopted the very authoritarian methods that they say they are
acting to forestall.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``In Europe, people are always telling me I just
don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Many European countries have anti-fascist laws that restrict
free speech and freedom of association. Germany's Constitution,
which the United States helped draft, bans the Nazi Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' is banned, as are Nazi insignia and
uniforms. Germany, France and Holland have laws to prevent people
from asserting that the Holocaust never took place. Austria itself
has taken legal steps to rein in any return of Nazi sentiment. For
example it outlawed statements denying the existence of Auschwitz's
gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where Mussolini ruled for 21 years, the Constitution
forbids the resurrection of the Fascist Party. Fascist symbols and
anti-Semitic statements are also illegal.
</P>
<P>
   At a soccer match in Rome on Sunday, extremist fans held up
pictures of Mussolini and banners honoring Zeljko Raznatovic, the
Serbian paramiliary leader and war-crimes suspect known as Arkan,
who was recently assassinated. The Italian government warned that
if those gestures were repeated this weekend, the soccer match
would be halted and police would tear down the banners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole business of building the European Union was based on
the notion of `never again,''' said Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist
member of the French Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not for hampering Haider's free speech or even
questioning the right of Austrians to vote for him,'' he said.
``But I do not want to sleep in the same bed and make legislation
with him for Europe.''

A BLOW TO DUESSELDORF, BUT HARDLY A FATAL ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With VODAFONE-MANNESMANN, VODAFONE-OUTLOOK)  
(lh) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Had it not been in large part for
Mannesmann, this old industrial city might well have suffered a
decline similar to that of Gary, Ind., or Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as Mannesmann reinvented itself from a producer of
seamless steel pipe to a fast-growing telecommunications company,
Duesseldorf has reinvented itself as a prosperous center of high
technology and services. Both the city and the company at its heart
achieved what countless other cities in Europe and elsewhere only
talk about: They moved beyond their history, embraced change and
fostered entirely new jobs based on fast-growing advanced
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And despite all that, the most important company here is now
succumbing to a $183 billion hostile takeover by the British
telecommunications giant Vodafone AirTouch, which seems intent on
running the company from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if a German company decided to come along and buy
General Electric, only to sell off all the parts it didn't want,''
said Christoph Blume, Duesseldorf's director of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Yet business executives and political leaders here seem to share
an overwhelming view that there is no turning back. To the extent
that Duesseldorf and Mannesmann have achieved new prosperity, they
have done so by embracing high technology and ignoring national
borders, so they could tap into international trade and foreign
capital markets.

   City officials publicly decried Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann,
but no one tried to stop it. And in Germany's once-protective
financial circles, bankers argue that it would be far more
dangerous to block Vodafone than to let shareholders decide for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is apparent on the streets of this city: It is packed
with foreign companies, many of them providing highly paid jobs in
technology and management. Duesseldorf has shed 125,000 industrial
jobs since the early 1960s. But it has added almost the same number
in fields like accounting, management consulting, software
development, advertising and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up,'' said Michael Moenks, the leader of
the workers' council at Mannesmann's mobile phone subsidiary here,
``people called this the writing desk for the Ruhr Valley _ the
headquarters for heavy industry.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't anymore. The crumbling wharf along the Rhine River,
rusting and dormant 10 years ago, has been redeveloped as a ``media
harbor'' and now boasts gleaming buildings packed with new
companies and trendy restaurants. Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of
Sweden, two of the world's leading mobile telephone manufacturers,
have research and business centers here. The electronics
conglomerate Siemens AG has a development center here for computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   And at least half a dozen telecommunications companies have
installed fiber optic networks to provide high-speed data
communications through the main business areas. Mannesmann is at
the core of this new population of communications companies; others
include MCI Worldcom, Esprit Telecom of Britain and Isis Multimedia
of France.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have become more entwined with the international
economy than Mannesmann itself. The company was founded more than a
century ago by two brothers who came up with a method for making
seamless steel pipe. Later, it branched out into engineering
services, auto parts and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Since obtaining a license to supply mobile phone service
throughout Germany in 1989, Mannesmann has evolved into one of
Europe's most successful and internationally active competitors.
Until now the biggest mobile phone carrier in Germany, with
slightly more customers than Deutsche Telekom, Mannesmann has spent
tens of billions acquiring wireless businesses in Italy and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Such an enormous transformation required foreign partners and
foreign capital. Airtouch Communications, formerly the wireless arm
of the Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco, provided money and
technical expertise from the very beginning. Mannesmann also raised
billions through international bond markets and attracted scores of
foreign shareholders. About 60 percent of Mannesmann's shares are
in non-German hands, and at least 40 percent are held by American
or British institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   And Mannesmann is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Seifert, president of the Frankfurt stock exchange,
estimates that two of every five shares traded in the DAX index of
leading German stocks are held by foreigners. Far from viewing that
as a threat to German jobs and stability, Seifert argues that it
makes companies healthier by forcing them to compete in the global
markets. And takeovers, he said, are part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, the target companies in corporate
takeovers are usually companies in old industries that have not
been producing jobs,'' Seifert said. ``The market was punishing
companies that had not been able to create jobs.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The economic unification of western Europe _ where trade
barriers have all but disappeared and eleven countries including
Germany have adopted the euro as a common currency _ has added to
the pressure for mergers as well as openness. ``In the past, you
might have dominated your domestic market, but now you are just one
of many players, and you must build up your position across
borders,'' said Theodor Baums, a professor of banking and finance
at the University of Osnabruck. ``If you want to have operations
abroad, you have to recognize the rights of companies in other
countries to come in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, in sharp contrast to companies embroiled in takeover
battles in France or Italy, was careful never to deviate from that
standard. In his three-month barnstorming campaign to defeat
Vodafone's hostile bid, Mannesmann's chief executive, Klaus Esser,
never invoked political defenses and trained all his efforts on
convincing Mannesmann shareholders that Vodafone's offer was simply
too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final decision belongs to shareholders,'' he said again
and again. And though he might have grimaced at the results, Esser
generally acted in accordance with that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Joerg Pluta, director of the Deutsche Schutsverein fuer
Wertpapierbesitz, an advocacy group for individual investors,
praised Esser for his openness. ``I would give him an A for
transparency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may come as cold comfort to people here. Several recent
surveys have found that the overwhelming majority of individual
investors in Germany opposed selling out their Mannesmann shares to
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, employees at Mannesmann's wireless business say
they are not worried about their future. The wireless business,
which employs 8,000 people around the country, is growing rapidly
and is almost certain to need more rather than fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   But many people fret that Vodafone will move to sever ties
quickly with Mannesmann's older businesses, such as steel pipes and
auto components. While both companies had planned to spin off the
older businesses, Vodafone's Gent is widely expected to be harsher
than Esser in closing down older factories. ``All the evidence thus
far suggests that foreign takeovers lead to the disposal of
management functions and jobs,'' said Udo Siepmann, head of the
Duesseldorf Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Others business leaders are more sanguine. ``This city has shown
that it can go through a huge transformation,'' said Hans Georg
Crone-Erdmann, head of the Association of Chambers of Commerce for
North Rhine Westphalia. ``I have absolutely no worries about the
future.''

 &HT;    Bush opponents describe campaign stop at college as 'racist'
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ If Flordia Gov. Jeb Bush and his
Mexican-born wife, Columba, had met as students at Bob Jones
University, they would have been expelled for interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that didn't stop his big brother, George W. Bush, from
kicking off his South Carolina campaign there Wednesday, telling
his fundamentalist Christian audience that he ``shares their
values.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit _ coming a day before younger brother Jeb attended a
stormy hearing in Miami over his plan to revamp affirmative action
_ quickly led to charges by Democrats that the whole Bush family
theme of ``compassionate conservatism'' was little more than
warmed-over racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to call that policy but racist,'' said Florida
Democratic Party spokesman Tony Welch of the school's interracial
dating ban. ``And there's nothing to call his support of that
policy but racist.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said Thursday the Texas governor does not agree
with the school's policy, but that he went to the Greenville campus
to spread his message and values to potential voters, ``not the
other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has a proven inclusiveness record of reaching
out to people in all walks of life,'' said campaign spokesman Scott
McClellen.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, that wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's doublespeak,'' Welch said, adding that using that
logic, it would be OK to address a Ku Klux Klan rally, too. ``His
own brother could not be a student at that university!''
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-student school banned blacks until the federal
government threatened to take away its tax-exempt status in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The university's community relations coordinator, Jonathon Pait,
explained the school's position on interracial relations in a 1998
letter to a prospective applicant:
</P>
<P>
   ``God has made people different from one another and intends
those differences to remain. Bob Jones University is opposed to
intermarriage of the races because it breaks down the barriers God
has established,'' Pait wrote. ``When Jesus Christ returns to the
earth, He will establish world unity, but until then, a divided
earth seems to be His plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Pait would not take phone calls Thursday asking him to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, state campaign
chairman for Vice President Al Gore, was astounded by Bush's
appearance there. ``That's amazing. That's absolutely amazing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a candidate for office, you choose very carefully
where you speak,'' said Butterworth, speaking from Gore's national
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. He said he was also personally
offended because his wife of 15 years was born in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, who was attending the heated hearing on his One
Florida plan in Miami on Thursday, did not respond to e-mails
Thursday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth, though, predicted that candidate Bush's attempt to
court the Christian conservatives in South Carolina could come back
to haunt him. ``Sometimes when you get involved in a highly
contested primary you do things that'll hurt you in the general
election,'' he said.

JEB BUSH'S DRIVE AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ROILS FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ From school vouchers to the death penalty, Gov. Jeb Bush
of Florida has had one political success after another in his first
year in office. But his sweeping program to end affirmative action
in the state, modeled partly after the one in his brother's state
of Texas, has inflamed black leaders, even some who supported him,
and looms as the first real test of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The passions that have been swirling around his program, which
among other things gives a break in college admissions to the poor
instead of minority groups, broke out in a historic theater in
downtown Miami on Thursday, where 1,700 protesters filled the seats
in the orchestra and balcony and hundreds more circled the block
waiting their turn to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Republican, put his program, One Florida, into effect by
executive order last November without inviting public comment, and
he did not attend a hearing before 600 people last week in Tampa.
But Thursday he stayed for more than two hours, often taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed to ask a legislative committee to conduct three
hearings after two black legislators staged a sit-in the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are embracing diversity, not rejecting it,'' Bush, the
first speaker at Thursday's hearing, told the mostly black
audience. ``This plan will create more opportunity for people.''
</P>
<P>
   To a din of jeers, he added, ``This has been a difficult time
for me. The last two weeks I have carried a heavy heart around.''
</P>
<P>
   Then to deafening cheers, Rep. Carrie P. Meek, a Democrat from
Miami who is black, spoke: ``The pain the governor feels is a
self-inflicted wound.''
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread support among whites for Bush's program,
which would end preferences for businesses owned by women and
minorities in bidding for state contracts. And it would end college
admissions preferences based on race, substituting a program
guaranteeing admission to at least 1 of the 10 state universities
for high school students who graduate in the top 20 percent of
their class.
</P>
<P>
   But the outpouring from blacks in Florida has made it clear that
Bush's plan, an effort to fend off a more severe public referendum
on affirmative action like those that passed in California and
Washington, had failed to defuse the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has implications for politics far beyond Florida. It
draws national attention to the state, which has replaced
California as the primary battleground over affirmative action. And
the governor's college admission plan, modeled after one in Texas
that grants admission to the top 10 percent of high school
graduates, is likely to touch, at least tangentially, the
presidential campaign of Bush's brother, Gov. George W. Bush. The
Texas governor, who received about 27 percent of the black vote in
the last governor's race, is likely to confront the polarizing
issue before Florida's presidential primary March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Some black leaders see promise in the One Florida plan, in that
it might create opportunities for the poor, disproportionate
numbers of whom are black. But they bristle at the governor's
abolition of affirmative action, a lack of detail in his plan and
above all, his style and methods.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks held their fire until two weeks ago, when state Sen.
Kendrick Meek of Miami and state Rep. Tony Hill of Jacksonville
occupied the office of the Republican lieutenant governor, Frank
Brogan, in Tallahassee after they were rebuffed in attempts to see
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The sit-in ended after 20 hours, when Bush agreed to hold public
hearings on One Florida in Tallahassee, Tampa and Miami and to
delay the Board of Regents vote on the college admission plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's presence at Thursday's hearing, some blacks said
the governor's reaction to their opposition showed him to be
intransigent, secretive and petulant. And they complain of having
been excluded from the plan's preparations and finding closed doors
when they they ask to discuss it.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Calls Thursday and Wednesday to Bush's office for the governor's
reaction to these criticisms were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think you know better for your child, you do what's
best without asking him,'' said Kenneth Nunn, a black law professor
at the University of Florida and an expert on affirmative action.
``So we got One Florida. Now we have an enraged black community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. R.B. Holmes, pastor of the 6,000-member Bethel
Missionary Baptist Church in Tallahassee and a Democrat, was Bush's
most outspoken black supporter in the 1998 governor's campaign,
which Bush won with 55 percent of the vote. Now he said he felt
double-crossed and embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of One Florida, it's divisive Florida,'' Holmes said.
``This is the first time in a long time I've seen so many black
leaders so outraged by a governor's initiative. This has left me in
a very precarious position. It compromised my sense of `whoseness'
_ who I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Thursday's hearing, people chanted, ``We are not going
back. We are not going back.'' Sam Guydon, a teacher wearing the
baseball cap of the predominantly black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha,
said, ``It's not about giving us advantage. It's about taking away
the disadvantage. Racism is still here.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One Florida is an attempt to confront disparities in
opportunities and incomes of minority groups and whites. It is also
a means of dodging a court ruling like one four years ago against a
Texas affirmative action program that gave minorities an edge over
similarly qualified whites in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   It also seeks to avoid the sweeping referendums in California
and Washington promoted by Ward Connerly, a black businessman in
Sacramento. Connerly has made Florida his next battleground for the
November elections, and his proposed ballot initiative, which,
among other things, would banish affirmative action throughout the
public sector, is being reviewed by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under One Florida, the contracting provision that Bush put into
effect with an executive order in November asks state procurement
officials to strive harder to award more business to minority
contractors. But it leaves assessment of the procurement officers'
progress to their elected superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The college admission policy is expected to take effect in March
after approval of the university system's Board of Regents.

   Blacks accuse the governor of ignoring them. Rep. Leslie Miller
Jr., a Tampa Democrat and the minority leader in the state House of
Representatives, said that Bush had agreed to meet with him only
once for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're African-American and don't agree with him,'' Miller
said, ``he pushes you off to the lieutenant governor or his staff
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Victor T. Curry, pastor of the New Birth Baptist Church
in Miami and president of the Miami-Dade County branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of of Colored People,
recalled Bush's defeat in his first race for governor six years ago
and his statement then that he would do ``probably nothing'' to
help African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush began his second campaign two years ago, he sought out
people like Curry. ``Bush sat in my office,'' Curry said. ``I said,
`You've got to deal with this issue of doing nothing.''' Bush
campaigned actively in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bush won only about 14 percent of the black vote the
same as the state's black population. But he had won some good
will, Bishop Curry said, and blacks did not actively fight his
legislative agenda last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever good feeling Bush and the African American
community shared last year has been evaporating since Bush
announced One Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fulfillment of that philosophy,'' to do nothing
said Curry, who did not support Bush's election. ``There's no
compassion. He has no compassion for people who are
disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the sit-in, Bush was recorded on video tape using
profanity in telling an aide to throw them out, a remark that
Bush's office said later referred only to reporters. But Meek said
he took the governor's remark to mean him and Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a low point,'' said Susan MacManus, a political
scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida's presidential primary approaching, MacManus said,
``this will get national attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What affects one brother affects the other,'' she said.
``They're kind of joined at the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dario Mareno, professor of political science at Florida
International University, said, ``This is the first big problem for
Bush. Looking at One Florida carefully, he said, ``It is not bad.
But he's run into a real buzz saw. One of the things that has
contributed has been his stubbornness.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a bizarre episode that underscores the limits the
Kremlin has imposed on reporting from Chechnya, Russian authorities
Thursday handed over a Radio Liberty correspondent to Chechen
rebels in exchange for two captured Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities had detained Andrei Babitsky, a Russian
citizen who is a correspondent for the U.S.-funded Radio Liberty,
on Jan. 16 as he was leaving the rebel-controlled section of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He was later charged with ``membership
in an illegal, armed group.''
</P>
<P>
   The detention of Babitsky seems to reflect a shrinking tolerance
for a free press since Vladimir Putin became acting president.
</P>
<P>
   At first it appeared that the Kremlin had grudgingly yielded to
appeals by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and a variety of
press freedom organizations to set Babitsky free. Russian officials
suggested that he would be returned to Moscow and released on his
own recognizance pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Russian government's new
spokesman for the war in Chechnya, announced that Babitsky had been
traded to the Chechens Thursday afternoon at the crossroads between
the towns of Argun and Shali.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unexpected development,'' Yastrzhembsky conceded.
Then he read two statements, asserting that they were from Babitsky
and Said Usykhodzhiyev, whom the spokesman identified as a Chechen
field commander. The statement from Babitsky, dated Jan. 31, said
he had agreed to the swap to secure the release of the Russian
soldiers. The statement from the field commander said he had
proposed the swap and praised Babitsky as a ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister of the breakaway Chechen
republic, said that no one in the Chechen government had heard of
the commander.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said a videotape had been made of the exchange and
would be made available. Thursday night, however, Babitsky's
whereabouts were unknown and some of his friends said they feared
for his safety. Radio Liberty executives deplored the Russian
government's handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was held for more than two weeks with no access to a
telephone or access to legal representation,'' said Jeff Trimble,
Radio Liberty's director of broadcasting. ``That raises very
serious concern about the Russian government's attitude toward the
press. And the announcement that he has been exchanged for Russian
prisoners has made a bad situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, 36, was one of a handful of reporters who ventured
into the rebel-controlled areas of Grozny. His reports irritated
Russian authorities, who have sharply restricted access to the
battlefield and sought to discourage reporting from the Chechen
side.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen on Jan. 16 on the northern outskirts of Grozny in
the custody of Russian authorities. Nonetheless, Yastrzhembsky
insisted last week that Moscow had no knowledge of his whereabouts.
Radio Liberty was officially informed on Monday that Babitsky had
been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was a human rights activist during the Soviet era and
worked for the magazine Glasnost. He has worked since 1989 for
Radio Liberty, which was established by the United States during
the Cold War to broadcast news to the Soviet Union and East
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   When Chechen rebels seized a hospital in the southern Russian
town of Budyonnovsk during the first war in Chechnya, Babitsky
agreed to take the place of some of the rebels' hostages, a deed
that suggested to some of his associates that he might in the
current case have agreed to the exchange for Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, feared that the decision was made under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Some challenged the Russian account of the exchange. Babitsky's
wife, Lyudmila, who has not been able to talk to her husband for 19
days, said the Kremlin was trying to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who were the people they gave Andrei to?'' she said in an
interview. ``Nobody knowns a Chechen field commander by this
name.''

 &HT;    Teen's plans to plant bombs at school revealed by peers he tried
to recruit
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He had a floor plan of Royal Palm Beach
High School, an Internet cookbook for making bombs and a diary
detailing plans to come on campus shooting. The one thing the
17-year-old student didn't have is willing accomplices. The three
boys he tried to recruit became his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Derek Lehman's plans to launch an assault at
school were foiled when his would-be accomplices and their parents
alerted Principal Brenda Montgomery. By the end of the day, police
had scoured his house and Lehman was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great deal of animosity and anger towards other
students and had been harassed in the past,'' schools Police Chief
Jim Kelly said Thursday. Yet, up to now the boy had not displayed
any behavior that would have led administrators to suspect he might
do something violent, Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   The students told police they came forward because they feared
for their and others' safety. They said he warned them that on
Wednesday they should stay away from building No. 3, Kelly said.
The building is full of classrooms, including the room where Lehman
had his first period English class, according to a teacher who
wished to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's plans were elaborate, but so far it appears he hadn't
gotten his hands on any weapons, Kelly said. Police found no guns
or bomb-making materials in his house, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to his diary and subsequent police interviews, it
wasn't for lack of trying, Kelly said. ``He was trying to get them
from kids and anybody he knew,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The high school junior's plans unraveled Thursday morning before
the first bell rang. Three students and a father approached
Montgomery as she headed for the courtyard to monitor students
arriving for the day. They told her their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   She called in school police and pulled Lehman, clad head to toe
in black, out of class, Kelly said. He told police he had a plan, a
diary and a map of the school at home. Police then called the boy's
parents, who allowed them to search their home. Kelly wouldn't
disclose whether Lehman's plans targeted specific students, but
they did mention a school police officer, Kelly said. All Palm
Beach County high schools have armed, uniformed police on campus.
Two are stationed at Royal Palm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, police returned to the school and took Lehman
to a local hospital where he is being held for examination under
the state's Baker Act, a law that requires a person's mental health
be evaluated. His parents did not return phone calls Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Lehman was pulled from class, administrators and
a crisis team of faculty at the school were alerted, Montgomery
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many teachers and students didn't learn about the incident
until Thursday, about five minutes before the 2:50 p.m. school
dismissal. Montgomery told students over the public address system
that there indeed had been a threat, but that it had been handled.
After school Thursday, Montgomery followed up with a faculty
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a panic situation,'' said Martin Walsh, a physics
teacher. ``Everything was handled remarkably well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some teachers voiced concern Thursday that they should
have been clued in when police picked up Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Montgomery has requested counselors be available for any
students who need to talk about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a principal's worst nightmare to have this kind of
allegation or incident occur,'' Montgomery said. ``We're
responsible for 2,100 students. That's quite a burden. Every time I
leave campus I'm thankful when everyone is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important message from these events is that
students can and do act responsibly when confronted with something
they know is wrong, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so thankful that these three young men came forth. They
did the right thing.''

quite comfortably but with a residue of free-floating negativity;
the uniquely subdued, dispassionate tone (and some might argue the
chilling effect) of his photographs came from this sustained and
critical refusal to join.'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art/The New
York Times)

``Burroughs Family Cabin, Hale County'' (1936), by Walker Evans, at

basically because Evans, in a photographic style as spare as James
Agee's writing was the opposite, denied us what we expected: he
short-circuited pity for those people by cutting out the charm and
anecdote. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/The New York Times)

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Imagine if NBA rookies could shoot 3-pointers from an arc one foot
closer to the basket than the one the veterans use. Or if Major
League Baseball let rookies swing corked bats.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As absurd and unlikely as those scenarios may be, they're not so
far-fetched to a fan of horse racing. In this sport, all first-year
``apprentice'' jockeys are granted a five-pound weight allowance.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if NASCAR gave rookie drivers a bigger engine to make up
for their lack of experience at using it.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing is especially kind to newcomers by extending the
apprentice year in cases of injury. Because he missed seven months
recovering from thumb surgery, Jeremy Beasley, who began riding
professionally in the summer of 1998, is still an apprentice at Sam
Houston Race Park,
</P>
<P>
   But only until Saturday. That will be the last day he rides at
cut-weight.
</P>
<P>
   Even a lengthy honeymoon must end, and when it does, Beasley
realizes, ``The reality can be harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of his ``bug'' (racing parlance for the five-pound
break) is a sad day for any jockey. Often it's the prelude to
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the jockey becomes devalued. The quality of his (or
her) riding stock plummets, so the athlete's winning percentage
dwindles and a downward spiral develops. The more successful the
apprentice, the further the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Beasley, who rode at Sam Houston for three glorious
months last year before moving up to New York, was one of three
finalists for the Eclipse Award as the nation's top apprentice. He
didn't win, but he figures it's just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good riders never got it,'' he points out. ``And a
lot of riders have won the Eclipse Award and have never won
anything after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many racing fans have forgotten Eclipse-winning
apprentices of recent vintages. Juan Umana? Steve Capanas? Ramon
Perez? Roberto Rosado? These once-hot jockeys are now hanging on at
second- and third-rate tracks.
</P>
<P>
   That does not necessarily bode well for the 20-year-old Beasley,
who ranks 12th nationally with 19 wins this year. But if ever a
jockey appeared immune to the sophomore jinx, it is Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   On the elite New York circuit, the loss of the bug would be more
problematic. But at Sam Houston, where he mucked stalls as a
teen-ager, the 5-4, 109-pound Beasley is king. And probably will
continue to be, regardless of the weight in his saddle.
</P>
<P>
   John Adger, racing manager for the nation's 13th-ranked stable _
Bob McNair's Stonerside _ said, ``At Sam Houston he'll keep getting
good mounts, with the competition not as stiff. He'll keep winning,
and that will give him confidence. He's a fine, aggressive rider,
very athletic, and he's a nice young man. I think the real good
jockeys go forward after their apprentice years, and that's what
he'll do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-1970s, I was part-owner of a filly, a claimer named
Out of Order,'' Adger recalls. ``I have a picture of an apprentice
named Steve Cauthen in the winner's circle with her. He was 16, and
he looked like he was about 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Cauthen, the No. 1 apprentice in 1977, went on to win the Triple
Crown on Affirmed the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley's return to Sam Houston last month surprised many in the
industry. At that time, he ranked among Aqueduct's top 10 jockeys
and was winning 14.4 percent of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   But he may have made a shrewd career move _ into a market he can
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to be part of making horse racing grow in this
state,'' he says. ``I plan on winning the Kentucky Derby with a
Texas-bred horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the money's better in New York, but down here I still
make as much as any doctor. And the cost of living makes up a lot
of the difference. While I make less money here, I actually put
more away. Up there I had to spend $2,000 to put heating oil in my
house for two months.''
</P>
<P>
   However, economics had little to do with his decision to come
back to Houston, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was family first, plain and simple,'' he says. His father,
mother and grandfather reside in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse racing is my passion, but my grandfather needed me at
the moment, and I wanted to be with him,'' Beasley says. ``He's
always been my best friend. He means the world to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Hector Gonzalez, is 65 and ailing. Beasley
won't discuss the illness publicly, but he says, ``I think he'll
get better, God willing. Right now my priority is my family. As
soon as my grandfather's better, I'll be open to new
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with that sort of adventurous spirit that Beasley set out
for Aqueduct at this time last year. Because he was a hot bug boy _
winning 22 percent of his races here _ bigger tracts were
beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley had assured trainers here he would stay through the end
of the meet. But one of the nation's most respected jockeys, Jerry
Bailey, was calling him repeatedly and advising him not to let an
opportunity pass that might not come again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very bad about leaving like that,'' Beasley says. ``I
felt like I turned my back on the trainers here. But I felt it was
the right thing for my career, and I'm glad I went.''
</P>
<P>
   He adapted easily to New York. He rented a house ``on the
Atlantic beach, with a pier going out into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like New York,'' he says. ``You get a taste of
every culture _ cultures I never knew existed. I took total
advantage of New York. I tried to see as much as I could _ the
theater shows, the comedy clubs. And I loved going to Saratoga and
upstate New York; it's gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an instant sensation on the racetrack, even while
hampered by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day of riding at Sam Houston last winter, a horse
kicked him in the chest, fracturing his sternum. When he fell,
Beasley injured tendons in his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to New York the next day,'' he remembers, ``and the
following Sunday, my third day riding in New York, I got into a bad
spill. That's when I really messed myself up. I totally crushed my
thumb and dislocated it.''
</P>
<P>
   He feared that if the trainers knew the extent of his injury, he
wouldn't be offered many mounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a glove on my hand to hide it,'' he says. ``I did really
well, but the thumb kept getting worse. I had doctors telling me I
needed to stop, but I was being stubborn. It got to the point where
I was dangerous to myself and other people. I was having a hard
time controlling difficult horses.''
</P>
<P>
   So last spring he submitted to surgery. He's fully recovered
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven months off helped me tremendously,'' he says, ``even
though it denied me a chance to win the Eclipse. I got to sit back
and think about all the things that had happened to me. I made
adjustments in my thinking, fine-tuned myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from my injury I was a fan favorite in New
York. They called me, `Stevie Cauthen.' They'd be yelling,
`Stee-vie, Stee-vie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley impressed New Yorkers, the same way he has Texans, with
his work ethic (he eagerly gallops horses in the early mornings)
and his confident yet humble manner; he welcomes criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He's especially grateful for critiques from Jose Santos, winner
of last year's Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the jockeys, Santos probably helped me the most,''
Beasley says. ``He was right there, telling me, `Look, you need to
change this.' One day he said, `Hey, you looked like a monkey on
that horse.' But he saw I had some talent, and he told me how it is
because he wanted to help me better myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hudson, the former Super Bowl safety who trains horses at
Sam Houston and also at the major tracks of Kentucky, says,
``Jeremy has a lot of talent, as well as good work habits. He can
be one of the top 10 riders in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Morgan, Sam Houston's leading trainer, sees little
significance to the debugging. ``The weight is not going to make a
difference for me naming him to ride my horses,'' Morgan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bug opened doors for me,'' Beasley says. ``It got me the
invitation. But I think I'll continue to get my chances. I think
I'm 10 times the rider I was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At even weight, there's little doubt he still has the edge over
the competition _ at least in his home state.

SAAB 9-5 AERO AND 9-3 VIGGEN: NEW TURBO JETS FROM AIR SAAB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)

 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I bought a new 900 Turbo in 1985, Saab was basking in its
image as the purveyor of eccentric Swedish sports sedans for
30-somethings who couldn't afford BMWs and couldn't abide anything
as sensible as a Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Economic realities have since driven Saab up the luxury scale
and toward the conventional. Saab shares a lot of parts with Opel,
its buttoned-down cousin in General Motors' global family. And it
now costs almost as much to own a Saab as a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   But the old fire occasionally still shows. Nowhere is it more
evident than in the company's flagships, the 9-3 Viggen and the 9-5
Aero. Though very different cars, they share Saab trademarks: an
off-the-beaten-path design, remarkable pep and surprising
versatility. In short, both the Viggen and the Aero are niche
vehicles for affluent drivers who value being different almost as
much as they like performance and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Viggen, named for the delta-wing jet fighter made
by the Saab aerospace company. Introduced in the United States in
the 1999 model year, the Viggen can be distinguished from Saab's
standard 9-3 midsize car by the front and rear spoilers. Saab
insists, by the way, that the bad-boy styling is more than a
marketing ploy, that it reduces wind resistance by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the modifications are jazzy 17-inch alloy wheels
that show off the disk brakes and low-profile Dunlop tires (with a
Z, or high-speed, rating). And the eye-catching package is rounded
out with special colors: ``lightning blue,'' silver or black. For
2000, a Viggen sedan and convertible join the coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Viggen has terrific front bucket seats in leather
with supportive side bolsters, eight-way power adjustments and
optional heating elements. The rest of the interior accoutrements,
more or less what you'd expect on ``near luxury'' cars these days,
are borrowed from the 9-3 SE. These include an excellent sound
system, automatic climate control, automatic-dimming rear-view
mirror, trip computer and antitheft system with keyless locking.
OnStar, General Motors' concierge in the sky, is an $895 option.
</P>
<P>
   The list of safety features common to all 2000 Saabs borders on
the obsessive: antilock brakes, front air bags and belt tensioners,
side air bags for the front seat, head restraints that cradle the
head in a crash, side window defrosters, daytime running lights,
audio controls on the steering wheel, headlamp washers and wipers.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a night-panel button that shuts off the instrument
panel illumination to minimize glare but pops awake on a
need-to-know basis _ say, when the engine is revving near the red
line or the fuel is low.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the market is crowded with safe, luxurious, well-made
cars, many for less than $38,000. Apart from its innate Saab-ness,
the Viggen's main selling point is performance, and here the
verdict is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, there's the engine. Everyone knows that
Americans like cylinders: six good, eight better. Four-cylinder
powerplants seem indelibly associated with vibration, weak
acceleration and save-the-planet bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Saab learned this the hard way in the early 1990s when it was
forced to discount deeply to move its big 9000 model, the
forerunner to the 9-5. Today you can buy the 9-5 with a
200-horsepower V6. But Saab engineers' hearts are still in
four-cylinder engines, and both the Viggen and the Aero get along
nicely with 2.3-liter, dual-overhead-cam versions equipped with
potent turbochargers that yield 230 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monster turbocharger and fancy electronics, this
pocket workhorse produces 258 foot-pounds of torque at a modest
2,500 engine revolutions per minute, with no discernable ``turbo
lag.'' That means the relatively light (3,100 pounds) Viggen is a
rocket ship _ a jet fighter? _ when it counts: passing on a
two-lane road or merging with high-speed traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the turbo's kick in third gear at 60 mph provided one of
the most satisfying driving experiences I can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Car and Driver magazine pushed the Viggen from a stop to 60
miles an hour is 6.5 seconds. And, not that many Americans care
these days, the combination of big turbocharger and little engine
also produces pretty good mileage figures: 20 mpg in town, 29 on
the highway. I averaged 24 while pushing the car hard every chance
I got.
</P>
<P>
   In most circumstances, the handling is up to the standard set by
the engine. The brakes feel great. And while the suspension is
softer and busier more than one might expect of a serious road car,
it does the job.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So, why am I less than than ecstatic over the Viggen? One might
quibble about the vague five-speed shifter and clutch. Or the
limited visibility: The high hood and rear deck make parallel
parking a challenge. Or the rear seat: Getting in the back isn't
easy and the legroom is tight.
</P>
<P>
   My real beef, though, is with the steering. The Viggen usually
goes where it's pointed, and the power assist is nicely tempered to
allow adequate road feel. But with the pedal to the metal in second
or third gear, the Viggen exhibits the classic systems of ``torque
steer'' _ the tendency of high-powered front-drive cars to veer
erratically to the left or right under heavy acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab people try to make a virtue of torque steer, saying
that it adds to the excitement of driving the Viggen. Even so, the
company has set the engine's computer to take the edge off the
torque steer by limiting the power available in first and second
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Viggen worth $38,000 and change? For about the same money
you could take home the far more polished and only slightly less
peppy BMW 328i. But the BMW makes your upward mobility all too
obvious; a Viggen will have your friends and neighbors scratching
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   With the Aero, there is both less pain and less gain. The
steering manners in the version I drove were impeccable, most
likely because the Aero weighed 400 pounds more than the Viggen,
had wider tires and came with a slightly detuned four-speed
automatic transmission. The cabin is huge with big, ergonomically
correct seats up front, a back seat that is adequate for three
adults and a trunk that almost looks as though it could hold an old
VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   But every Saab 9-5 is big and comfy. The real question here is
what you get in the Aero for the $2,000 premium over the
dressed-for-success 9-5 SE.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is the trim: The Aero has a ground-effects chin
spoiler plus minor modifications to the lower body to offset the
extra drag created by that spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the engine: The 2.3-liter four-cylinder is a bit
noisier than the 3-liter V6 in the 9-5 SE, but it manages 30 more
horsepower. More important, the torque is a bit higher over a
broader range of engine speeds, though the Aero's transmission
limits peak torque to 243 foot-pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the wheel-tire combination. The Aero comes with
17-inch alloy wheels, as opposed to the SE's 16-inchers, and the
fatter, lower-profile tires are rated for higher speeds. The
suspension has been tuned for surer footing on curves.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to a noticeable improvement in an already
excellent sport sedan. The low-profile tires felt surprisingly
good, with none of the ride harshness usually found in rubber
designed for maximum performance. And though the car dives a bit
more than expected in heavy braking and leans a bit more than
expected in hard turns, the handling is a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   With the 400-pound weight disadvantage, the Aero is noticeably
tamer than the Viggen. But again, the turbo offers punch when you
need it. And with the smooth automatic set to ``sport'' mode, a
nudge of the throttle brings forth the turbo boost.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero is too close to a normal car in looks and performance
to attract the dyed-in-the-wool Saab crowd drawn to the Viggen. But
at a shade above $40,000, it is arguably a better buy. Like the
other 9-5s, the Aero is a practical luxury sedan with more interior
room than, say, the Mercedes E-Class. But unlike the other 9-5s,
its acceleration can make you feel young again. &QL;

MANUFACTURERS' DRIVING SCHOOLS: THE HOMEWORK IS IN YOUR CAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JIM McCRAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had your last driving lesson just before you got a
license, you may be ready for a refresher course. Four European
carmakers are offering instruction: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW
</P>
<P>
   This German manufacturer of high-performance cars now has a
high-performance driving school at a track near its factory in
Spartanburg, S.C. BMW offers six schools: for new drivers; for
car-control skills; for advanced car-control skills; a
performance-driving ``M school'' for owners of BMW M3 coupes and M
roadsters; an M5 school starting for owners of its new M5 sedan;
and an off-roading curriculum for buyers of its X5 sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's instructors emphasize skills used in everyday driving.
They take students through maneuvers intended to increase awareness
and control in extraordinary situations, like fast cornering,
driving through a wall of water or over a wet skid pad.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is free with the purchase of an M5; the other courses
range in price from $495 to $895, including the use of 3-Series
cars provided by the school. (Participants do not use their own
cars.) Detailed information is available at (888) 345-4269. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAND ROVER
</P>
<P>
   This was the first car company in the United States to offer
structured driver education. The original school, at the Equinox
resort in Manchester, Vt., opened in 1997; a second school has been
added at the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.
Instructors at both teach techniques for off-road driving; in the
winter, extra attention is given to driving on ice and snow.
</P>
<P>
   The school is open to all licensed and insured drivers, whether
or not they own a Land Rover. Tuition is $150 for a one-hour
session for up to three persons, and $100 for each additional hour,
with a $50 discount for four to eight hours of instruction. Land
Rover owners get a 10 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available at (800) 346-3493 or
www.LandRover.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the company began a training course for owners
of its M-Class utility vehicles near its factory in Tuscaloosa,
Ala. The emphasis is on off-road maneuvering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAAB
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of the 9-3 Viggen are invited to a special course at the
challenging Road Atlanta racetrack, near Saab's American
headquarters in Norcross, Ga. Because Saab builds aircraft with the
same name, the school is called the Viggen Flight Academy. The free
course is taught by instructors at the Panoz high-performance
school.
</P>
<P>
   Saab's school concentrates on steering, shifting and braking
maneuvers, skid control, slaloms and evasive techniques; it
concludes with an autocross and dinner with Saab management.
Information is available at www.saabusa.com/viggen.

RICHARD G. KLEINDIENST, FIGURE IN WATERGATE ERA, DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard G. Kleindienst, who was President Richard
Nixon's attorney general for less than a year in the Watergate era
and who pleaded guilty to a crime in a peripheral scandal, died
Thursday at his home in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Margaret, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleindienst came to Washington in 1969 with the kind of
conservative Republican credentials the new president loved.
Kleindienst had a small-town background; he had been elected to the
Arizona House of Representatives before he was 30 and had worked on
Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy attorney general, Kleindienst was a hard-liner on
law-and-order issues. He favored wiretaps in organized-crime cases
or in threats to national security. He supported mass arrests of
Vietnam War protesters.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of his critics credited him with pushing hard to
recruit more black lawyers for the Justice Department, and
Kleindienst made a point of sending his children to integrated
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He traced his concern for minorities to his childhood in
Winslow, Ariz., which had many Mexican-Americans and Indians. As a
child, he was cared for by a Navajo woman after his mother died,
and he grew up fluent in Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   Kleindienst served in the Army Air Forces in Italy in World War
II, then graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, where he also got
his law degree.
</P>
<P>
   His undoing began when he was picked to succeed John N. Mitchell
as attorney general after Mitchell resigned early in 1972 to lead
the Nixon re-election campaign. On March 8, 1972, Kleindienst was
asked during his Senate confirmation hearings whether the White
House had interfered with a Justice Department antitrust action
against International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not interfered with by anybody at the White House,'' the
nominee replied, repeatedly emphasizing his statement.
</P>
<P>
   He was confirmed on June 8, 1972, and sworn in on June 12, five
days before the break-in at the Democratic headquarters in the
Watergate office and apartment complex in Washington, a crime that
eventually brought down the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Kleindienst's downfall came from his own words.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had begun proceedings against ITT in 1969
over the corporation's acquisition of three companies. The
department agreed to a settlement in 1971, and accusations arose
that ITT got what it wanted in return for a pledge to help finance
the Republican National Convention in San Diego in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   And as a White House tape later revealed, Nixon telephoned
Kleindienst on April 19, 1971, and told him between expletives to
drop the ITT case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that clear?'' the president asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I understand that,'' Kleindienst replied. Later, he
acknowledged that John D. Ehrlichman, who was then Nixon's chief
domestic affairs adviser, called a short time later to reiterate
the president's order.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1973, Kleindienst resigned as attorney general,
saying too many of his close associates had been implicated in
scandal for him to stay on. At that time, many high administration
officials were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, 1974, Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of refusing to testify accurately before the Senate. A few
weeks later, he was fined $100 and given a 30-day suspended
sentence by a judge who called Kleindienst a man of ``highest
integrity'' but one who had ``a heart that is too loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleindienst returned to Arizona to practice law. In 1981 he was
acquitted of charges that he had perjured himself before the State
Bar of Arizona about his knowledge of the crimes of a client who
was convicted of an insurance swindle.
</P>
<P>
   He had been ill for about four years. Besides his wife, he is
survived by two sons and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kleindienst's name is loosely linked with the Watergate
scandals, he actually thwarted efforts by Nixon aides to cover up
their role in the break-in, according to E. Howard Hunt Jr., who
helped organize the Watergate break-in and was later convicted of
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1975 prison interview, Hunt recalled that another
conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy, frantically tracked down Kleindienst
at a Maryland golf club within hours of the Watergate break-in to
tell him that people working for the president's re-election were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling the FBI off the case, Kleindienst immediately
called a top Justice Department official and decreed that any
presidential campaign aides who were involved should be treated
like anyone else, it was disclosed months later.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Hunt said, ended the Nixon camp's last best chance for
a successful cover-up.

<P>
   The executive who made Barbie into a mega-brand stepped down
from the top post at Mattel Thursday as the toy maker reported a
loss for 1999 and continuing problems in its software unit.
</P>
<P>
   Jill E. Barad, chairman and chief executive of Mattel Inc. for
three years, announced her resignation after an unscheduled meeting
in New York of Mattel's directors. The board said it was searching
for a replacement for Barad and that two directors would serve as
top officers in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in El Segundo, Calif., has been struggling
for the last couple of years to broaden its offerings beyond dolls,
cars and preschool toys. Last May, it acquired Learning Co. for
$3.8 million in an attempt to broaden its software and interactive
game offerings. But the price proved far too high since the unit
not only failed to meet sales projections but dragged down the rest
of the company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   By acting ahead of the scheduled board meeting next week, the
company's board appeared to be trying to put its problems aside in
time for Toy Fair, which starts on Feb. 14 and is the biggest event
in the industry. Toy manufacturers use the event to showcase their
offerings for the next holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Barad was steadily criticized for her acquisition of Learning
Co., which failed to improve the company's bottom line despite her
repeated assurances that it was on the verge of doing so. Last
month, Mattel announced that it had hired Bernard Stolar, a
respected software executive, to turn around the unit, known for
its Reader Rabbit and Carmen Sandiego titles.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has to rebuild its credibility with Wall
Street. Stock analysts lost faith in Mattel's pronouncements
because earnings repeatedly fell short of what the company
estimated. For example, Mattel said in October that earnings for
the fourth quarter of last year would be 70 cents to 80 cents a
share. Instead, the company said Thursday that it lost 4 cents a
share, or $184 million, because of a one-time charge and sales
declines at Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time, it was the last time, and it wasn't going to happen
again,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst for Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``Lo and behold, it did happen again. Unfortunately, Jill
went to the well a couple of times too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co., which lost $183 million in the quarter and $206
million for the year, erased profits at the parent company, despite
strong sales of Fisher-Price and Pleasant Co. products. For the
full year, Mattel lost $82 million, or 21 cents a shares, compared
with a $206 million gain, or 51 cents a share in 1998, as
calculated to include the Learning Co. acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the problems are not over. Mattel said Thursday
that it would take another revamping charge of $75 million to $100
million in the first quarter to reflect continuing problems at the
software maker.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that two of its directors, William D. Rollnick
and Ronald M. Loeb, would serve as chairman and acting chief
executive officer, respectively. The company said that Richard
Ferry of Korn/Ferry International was conducting a search for a new
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts late Thursday, Barad, 48,
said she was leaving because of the unacceptable results at
Learning Co., but she insisted that other divisions, including
Barbie, Pleasant Co. and Fisher-Price, were doing better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Barad joined Mattel 20 years ago as a product manager. She was
named marketing director for Barbie in 1982, expanding what had
been a somewhat tired line into one that featured an entire
universe of cars, houses, pets and siblings for the surreally
sculpted, perpetually cheerful plastic doll.
</P>
<P>
   Largely on the strength of her success with Barbie, which
enjoyed little competition until the mid-1990s, Barad rose to
become chief operating officer before taking over as chief
executive in January 1997. She was one of just four women heading
major American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Her first year was a stellar one for Mattel. The company's sales
rose 6.6 percent, and earnings increased by 24.5 percent. But in
1998, the company reported declining sales, its first such report
in a decade. It was alarming for a company whose annual sales
growth had averaged 21 percent, with 35.7 percent annual earnings
growth, over the five years before Barad became chief executive.
Sales continued to decline last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's share price rose to a high of $45.625 in March 1998,
but plunged late last year. On Thursday, the stock closed at
$11.9375, but then fell 13 percent to $10.825 in after-hours
trading after the company's earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Barad is known as a keen marketer and brilliant presenter, but
her critics have said she failed in important management areas,
including financial matters and diplomacy. Even after she became
chief operating officer, she continued to keep close watch on the
Barbie division, monitoring doll designs down to minor details on
the dolls' faces. Sales began to trail off in 1994, as Beanie
Babies and other toys began to nibble away market share, and in
response, Mattel began producing thousands of Barbies from its
collectors' line _ angering collectors who had paid $50 to $100 for
the dolls, believing that they were limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can say to gloss over how devastating the
Learning Co.'s results have been to Mattel's overall performance,''
Barad said. ``Because there must be accountability, I and the board
agree that I must resign today as chairman and chief executive and
from the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Silver, publisher of the Toy Book, an industry journal,
said, ``They overpaid severely for a company that they felt was on
the way up, and it really wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties at Learning Co. have to do with slowing sales
in the CD-ROM business in general, a Mattel spokesman said. But one
analyst said the problem was a lack of new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't developed any new titles, and their business is
old and tired,'' Romm of Credit Suisse First Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it was unfortunate Barad would be remembered for
the debacle in the software division, since she had made other
useful acquisitions, including the Pleasant Co. line of dolls and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Her tenure was tumultuous, with several key executives resigning
over what one executive called ``the Jill Factor,'' an oblique
reference to her volatile management style. For that reason, the
board had little choice but to appoint directors to manage the
company while it conducts an outside search for a replacement.

SHIRREFFS A QUIET WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ John Shirreffs maintains a high winning
percentage and low profile. You'd get long odds on that double.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old former Marine saddled 28 winners in only 69
tries on the Southern California circuit in 1998-99, including 10
for 21 a year ago at Santa Anita and an unbelievable 7 for 10 at
the autumn Hollywood Park meet. His stakes winners, since becoming
the private trainer for Marshall Naify's 505 Farms in 1994, include
Bertrando and the enormous mare, Manistique.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few bettors would recognize Shirreffs under his baseball
cap.
</P>
<P>
   He's rarely seen on intertrack television interviews. He rarely
lingers in the winner's circle to talk to writers.
</P>
<P>
   After victories, he prefers to walk the horse back to his stall,
a task most trainers leave to a lowly groom. It's not as if he's
unfriendly or inarticulate. He just likes it better this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is the training of the horses,'' Shirreffs explained
Thursday by phone from his Hollywood Park barn. ``I try not to get
distracted by things.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs also sounds as if he's afraid he'd anger the racing
gods if he basked in his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that as great as things may seem at the time,
things can run in cycles. I think it's best to keep things in
perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the El Segundo resident's talent for avoiding the spotlight
is about to be tested, beginning Saturday at Santa Anita, when
he'll run California-bred Cliquot in the $500,000 Strub Stakes for
4-year-olds and million-dollar yearling purchase Malabar Gold in
the $150,000 San Vicente for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Malabar Gold, who'll be ridden by leading Santa Anita jockey
Corey Nakatani in the 7-furlong San Vicente, is one of several 505
Farms-owned prospects for the April 8 Santa Anita Derby and the May
6 Kentucky Derby. Too many to count on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs will hope Malabar Gold, a son of 1990 Kentucky Derby
winner Unbridled, runs as he did in a 12-length maiden victory at
Hollywood Park on Nov. 20, not as he did in a fade from first to
last in the Hollywood Futurity on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to look on the positive side of things,''
Shirreffs said of the decision to jump Malabar Gold up to the Grade
I stakes level after two starts. ``Probably, it was a great wakeup
call, (a signal to) not get carried away, and get back to the
things that make horses run better.''
</P>
<P>
   For Malabar Gold, those things include fitting him with a
stronger bit and training him harder. The former should allow
Nakatani more control than Eddie Delahoussaye had in the Futurity,
and the latter should rid the colt of the freshness that plagued
him that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After an awkward start, Delahoussaye sent him through traffic,
and then Malabar Gold ran off, leading by 4 lengths after
one-quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up 29 tired lengths behind winner Captain Steve at the
end of the 1 1/16-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets excited about a young horse with a lot of
ability. We tried to take a giant leap and it didn't work out,''
Shirreffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Malabar Gold will face five other 3-year-olds in the San
Vicente, which has sent five winners on to Kentucky Derby
victories, most recently Silver Charm in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents include Gibson County, winner of a Cal-bred stakes
for Bob Baffert; Joopy Doopy, third behind Shirreffs' Swept
Overboard in the San Miguel; and Tavasco, coming off his Remington
Park Futurity victory in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs doubts Swept Overboard is cut out for the Derby
distances. Hook and Ladder, a 5-length maiden winner at Hollywood
Park, is sidelined with a foot injury. The trainer is playing wait
and see with I've Decided, who lost a shoe when he ran seventh in
the Golden Gate Derby. David Copperfield, another Shirreffs
3-year-old with promise, will point for the March 4 San Rafael, the
next stepping stone to the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Shirreffs isn't boasting about his Derby possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to say, `We're going to do this, we're
going to do that,''' he said with an audible shrug. ``We have some
nice 3-year-olds if they continue to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Shirreffs' only experience with the Kentucky Derby
has been watching it on TV. A New Hampshire farm boy whose father
bred horses, Shirreffs served in Vietnam, then was on his way to
Hawaii to become a surfer when he stopped in California, as he
tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   He began his racing career as a stable hand for Gene Cleveland
in the early 1970s and worked as an assistant to Brian Mayberry and
Bill Spawr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Naify picked me out of nowhere (to be his trainer),''
Shirreffs said. ``I've never thought I'd be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ideal situation for him. The private training job
relieves him of a major headache, the worry about attracting and
keeping clients with different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who'd prefer to avoid the media distraction will
have his work cut out for him if he takes a horse to Churchill
Downs in May.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Shirreffs' Cliquot, fifth behind winner Saint's
Honor and fourth-place General Challenge in the San Fernando
Stakes, will face them as well as Cape Canaveral and Luftikus in
the Strub.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Cat Thief, second in the San Fernando, takes on older
horses in the $300,000 San Antonio Handicap, carrying a pound less
than top-weighted Budroyale (121) while Dixie Dot Com (119),
Elaborate (114) and Moore's Flat (113) are also expected to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The Strub and the San Antonio are preps for the March 4 Santa
Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the East Coast's top older horses are entered in the
$500,000 Donn Handicap on Saturday at Gulfstream Park: The entry of
Behrens (121) and Pleasant Breeze (112) is a 2-1 morning-line
favorite; Almutawakel (120) is 3-1. Trainer Jim Bond said Behrens
or Pleasant Breeze will start but not both; Jorge Chavez will
ride. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Corey Nakatani,
34 wins; Kent Desormeaux and Alex Solis, 22; David Flores, 17; Pat
Valenzuela, 16. Trainers: Bobby Frankel, 16; Bob Baffert, 14; Ron
McAnally, 8; Ron Ellis and Richard Mandella, 7. &QL; 
Pincay update: Laffit Pincay rode two winners Wednesday at Santa
Anita, giving him 15 at the meet, tying Chris McCarron for sixth in
the standings. Pincay's record win total is 8,859. He'll ride on
the Super Saturday card at Turf Paradise. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $500,000 Strub
Stakes, 4-year-olds, 1 miles, $150,000 San Vicente, 3-year-olds, 7
furlongs, and $150,000 Pro or Con Handicap, California-bred fillies
and mares, 1 mile on turf; Sunday, $300,000 San Antonio Handicap,
4-year-olds and up, 1 miles, and $200,000 La Canada, 4-year-old
fillies, 1 miles. At Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $500,000 Donn
Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 miles. &QL;

SOUTH CAROLINA: TOO CLOSE TO CALL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ An influential South Carolina pollster whose
poll recently showed Gov. George W. Bush with a 20-point lead here,
said Thursday that far more independents and Democrats may vote in
the Feb. 19 Republican primary than he had earlier anticipated. As
a result, he said, the race may now be too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster, David Woodard, a political science professor at
Clemson University who conducts the Palmetto Poll, said Thursday
that since his poll was conducted last month the Democratic party
canceled its March 9 primary and will hold only caucuses, which
will probably free many Democrats to cast a vote for McCain in the
open Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, he said, McCain's double-digit victory in
New Hampshire on Tuesday will energize South Carolina independents
in large numbers to vote for him, a factor that he said was not
anticipated in his earlier poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best polling minds in the country didn't anticipate the
size of the independent vote in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``If you
told me right now that the race was even, I would say that could
very well be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Two polls taken in South Carolina since the New Hampshire
primary, in fact, showed a much closer race than previously.
</P>
<P>
   Any registered voter can participate in the primary, regardless
of party affiliation. Although independents have traditionally not
been a factor in previous primaries, which tend to be dominated by
Republican regulars, Woodard said McCain may be the candidate to
change that tradition.

4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS ROSE 24 PERCENT AT THE TIMES COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. reported a rise of 24 percent
in fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, exceeding analysts' estimates,
on gains in advertising for technology products, financial services
and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's flagship newspaper, The New York Times,
advertising revenue growth continued to accelerate as the year
ended, increasing 35.5 percent in December, compared with December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As an industry, newspapers have long been classed by investors
as mature, with limited growth potential. Reflecting investors'
surprise that even the optimistic December revenue estimates had
understated the 1999 performance of several newspaper companies,
Kevin Gruneich, an analyst with Bear Stearns, said: ``You call this
mature media? It's going through the ceiling. These are the good
old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, the Times Co. earned $108.4 million,
or 61 cents a share, compared with $87.3 million, or 47 cents a
share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company took a charge of
$3.1 million after taxes to pay for expenses related to work-force
reductions at The Boston Globe and at the company's regional
newspaper group. Revenue rose 12.8 percent, to $882.5 million for
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 57 cents a share,
according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Class A shares of the Times company rose $1.75, or 3.8 percent,
to $47.625 in trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of strength in the industry during the fourth quarter
was help-wanted classified advertising, which provides high-margin
revenue. For six quarters, beginning in early 1998, classified
advertising had suffered significant downturns at newspapers like
The San Jose Mercury, which is owned by Knight Ridder, and The
Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth quarter of 1999, analysts said, The Mercury
and The Globe, both based in high-technology centers, saw steady
rises in their help-wanted advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. became the latest major newspaper company to
report strong double-digit percentile growth in fourth-quarter
earnings, following the Gannett Co., Knight Ridder and Dow Jones &AMP;
Co. The profits were buoyed in part by continuing declines in the
price of newsprint.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co.'s Internet properties, including The New York
Times on the Web (nytimes.com), boston.com and nytoday.com, all
showed increases in the number of sessions each day in December,
compared with the same month a year earlier. For 1999, average
daily page views at boston.com were up 44.5 percent; at nytimes.com
the increase was 59.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Times Co. said it would issue a new class of
stock to track the value of the company's Internet properties.
Times Company Digital, the unit that operates those properties,
includes the three sites mentioned above, and others like
winetoday.com, abuzz.com and golfdigest.com.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company reported that Times Company Digital had revenue of $15.3
million, up 48 percent from the first nine months of 1998. Its net
losses were $11.7 million, up 108 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
offered a note of caution Thbursday, saying that the company's
strong advertising revenue growth in the second half of 1999 would
provide a tough basis for comparison in this year's second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are really obviously outstanding, particularly
December,'' he said. ``The question is: Is this the peak?''

 BUSH AND PATAKI HALT EFFORTS TO KEEP McCAIN OFF N.Y. BALLOT  
(subs to delete extra `the' from lede graf, `...the presidential
primary...') 
(bl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fearing that they were energizing Sen. John McCain's
candidacy, Gov. George W. Bush and his chief supporter in New York,
Gov. George Pataki, on Thursday abandoned their efforts to keep
McCain out of the presidential primary and said they would insure
that he is on the ballot statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Pataki, who both had insisted for weeks that the
primary rules were not burdensome, reversed themselves after
McCain's landslide victory in New Hampshire had increasingly
exposed them to criticism that they were rigging the New York
contest to halt McCain's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the governors sensed the skirmish over the primary
ballot was giving McCain powerful ammunition in the upcoming
contests in South Carolina and Michigan to portray himself as an
outsider crusading against a corrupt political system. McCain, who
had qualified for the New York primary in only 19 of the state's 31
congressional districts, has also made overhauling the campaign
finance laws a cornerstone of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pataki conceded that the campaign leading to the
March 7 New York primary ``should be about ideas and issues, not
about technicalities. Gov. Bush will win that campaign because he
has the ideas and he has the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The surrender by Bush and Pataki over the ballot issue adds even
more luster to a McCain campaign that is on a remarkable upswing
this week, and hopes to continue its surge as it heads to the South
Carolina primary on Feb. 19, and then to Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has repeatedly demanded that Bush rein in the state
party, hailed the decision to let him on the ballot statewide.
``Republicans of New York, rejoice! You're free!'' he said while
campaigning in South Carolina on Thursday. ``I always thought
Texans wanted a fair fight, and he obviously didn't want one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought to distance himself from the dispute, saying
that it was up to the New York Republican State Committee to
determine how to handle the challenges to the McCain candidacy and
that everyone had to play by the same rules. But hours after Bush's
loss in New Hampshire, his chief strategist, Karl Rove, called
Republican leaders in New York on Wednesday and urged them to quell
what had been transformed into a David-and-Goliath fight and to
stem the political damage it had wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Thursday night on his campaign plane on a
tarmac in Dover, Del., before leaving for Michigan, Bush said
Pataki had informed Rove on Thursday afternoon that the party would
let McCain on the ballot in New York, which has the third-largest
number of delegates to the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that this was a decision that he and the party
made,'' Bush said, referring to Pataki. ``We said, `That's the
right decision.' I welcome the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an odd coda to the fight, McCain spoke by phone with former
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who had been Pataki's political
patron but had spoken out in recent weeks in favor of letting
McCain on the ballot statewide. ``Hey Alfonse, how are you doing,
pal?'' McCain told D'Amato. ``I understand you've been doing the
Lord's work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still faces uphill battles in states like South Carolina
and New York, where the Republican establishment stands solidly
behind Bush. Despite an influx of donations after his success in
New Hampshire, the senator's war chest is tens of millions of
dollars smaller than Bush's. And even with the burst of publicity
from New Hampshire and the ballot fight in New York, McCain still
confronts the daunting task of trying to finance increasingly
expensive campaigns in much larger states than New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday ended a lengthy battle that had
focused widespread attention on New York's rules, which are the
toughest in the country, requiring campaigns to circulate petitions
in each of the state's 31 congressional districts while adhering to
a bevy of do's and don't's. The rules heavily favor the candidate
backed by the state party _ in this case, Bush _ because underdogs
do not have the party foot soldiers to collect signatures and
weather the inevitable legal challenges to petitions.
</P>
<P>
   With a shoe-string organization that hardly crosses the whole
state, McCain had sought to get on the ballot, but after petition
challenges by the party, he had qualified in only 19 of the 31
districts. McCain's lawyers sued in federal court to overturn the
system, and a judge had been expected to rule soon in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   How Pataki will engineer getting McCain on the ballot statewide
was a question that Pataki aides declined to discuss Thursday
night. It may require that Pataki ask the Legislature to approve a
special bill putting the three major contenders _ Bush, McCain and
Steve Forbes _ on the ballot. Forbes has already qualified across
the state, while Bush is on the ballot in all but one district,
having been thrown off in the South Bronx because campaign workers
committed petition fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state party were engaged in talks with McCain's
lawyers Thursday night, hoping to settle the case without having
the precedent of a legal ruling by the federal court that could
affect future elections.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's lawyers were adamant that they would not simply
accept a deal that placed McCain on the ballot without overturning
many of the rules they believe are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain didn't fight this hard to get on the ballot just
for himself,'' said one of the lawyers, Burt Neuborne, legal
director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University
School of Law. ``One of the thing he wants is to reform the system.
Until they are willing to acknowledge that the system is
unconstitutional, I have nothing to say to them.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of the election rules are abolished, the outcome of the
legal case and the settlement talks could thus influence future
presidential primaries and other New York elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Pataki has been on the defensive over the ballot
challenges in recent weeks, his aides Thursday night sought to turn
the tables on McCain once again. ``We are going to make sure that
they focus on ideas and issues, not on ballot access,'' said Zenia
Mucha, a spokeswoman for Pataki. ``The fact of the matter is they
are hiding behind this issue because they are devoid of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the McCain campaign in New York, Guy Molinari,
the Staten Island borough president, said that no matter how the
Bush partisans depicted the shift, their candidate had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood why they would allow this thing to occur as
long as it had,'' Molinari said. ``It has helped our campaign
enormously. It is a great issue for us, but it's not an issue that
we wanted.''

WEARING YOUR HEART ON YOUR PORTFOLIO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're interested in security, get a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of that advice during a seminar I conducted last
month in Florida. An irate investor yelled at me, accusing me of
being a liar.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of his outburst, I was contrasting the short- and
long-term performances of Michael Murphy, editor of the
one-year-old Technology Investing newsletter and the
longer-established California Technology Stock Letter, of Half Moon
Bay, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Those two letters performed extraordinarily well in 1999,
earning 157 percent and 119.7 percent, respectively, enough to win
the No. 1 and No. 6 places among the 150 letters I monitor. But
even after 1999s blowout performance, the California Technology
Stock Letter had returned just 6.9 percent, annualized, since the
end of 1982, when I started tracking it. That is less than a
percentage point ahead of a money market fund over that time.
</P>
<P>
   The angry investor said that he made a lot of money in 1999 by
following Murphy's advice, and that my criticisms of the editor's
long-term record therefore had to be wrong. I might have argued
with his line of reasoning, but he stomped out.
</P>
<P>
   Had this investor found the results of my research threatening?
It wasn't that he needed a scorekeeper to tell him how much money
he made last year. He already knew that he did very well. And he
should have been happy that I was waving others away from his
preferred stock picker. After all, I have found that people receive
less favorable prices when trading on the advice of the most
popular letters than they do using less exposed ones.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced that this investor wanted some reassurance that he
was doing the right thing. And I suspect that he was also seeking
peer approval, in this case from the thousands of other investors
attending the conference. Instead of finding his psychological
needs met, he heard me criticize his investment adviser's record.
No wonder he might have felt so threatened.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction would be of little interest if it were isolated and
unique. But it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from my workshops over the years, such strong emotional
impulses are quite widespread _ even if this fellow's reactions
were a mite extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Investors often develop a cultlike devotion to one investment
guru or another. And when they do so, objectivity goes out the
window. That isn't to say that the investors' psychological needs
should be dismissed. After all, investing is an arena filled with
uncertainty; it's only natural for people to seek approval and
affirmation in such an environment. But it is hazardous to one's
wealth to seek such psychological security at the price of
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   I have two suggestions to help investors keep their cool:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take only those risks that are within your psychological
comfort zone. That can be tough in a bull market, when risk is an
abstract notion. But try this: Spend an hour or two at your local
library, reading the business pages of a newspaper from 1973 or
1974, during the last major bear market for stocks. Imagine your
current portfolio in such an era, when each market decline, far
from presaging a renewal of an up trend, precipitated yet another
decline. If you conclude that you're too heavily invested to
stomach such a market, reduce your exposure. Don't wait until the
bottom of the next bear market to discover your true comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Subscribe to an investment letter with which you strongly
disagree. If you have convincing responses to each of its
arguments, fine. But take it as a warning if you find that the
letter's positions eventually become as compelling as your own.
That can mean that you are not being entirely objective in your
assessments, and that you should scrutinize your reasoning more
closely. &QL;

JUST BEFORE JET CRASH, PILOTS CALLED MECHANIC FOR HELP
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Ariz.) (REWRITES head; UPDATES thruout; DELETES map note) 
 (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ A few minutes before an Alaska Airlines
jet crashed offshore here on Monday night, the crew radioed a
company mechanic in Los Angeles that the device that forms most of
the horizontal section of the tail was pushing the nose down and
asked if there was a way to cut power to the device.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had apparently run through its emergency procedures,
which included pulling out circuit breakers to try to cut off power
to the two motors that control the horizontal stabilizer, and they
asked the mechanic if he knew of any ``hidden circuit breakers,''
said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board assigned to the crash. All 88 people aboard the MD-83
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt, relating a summary of his investigators'
interview with the mechanic, said, ``The flight crew stated
something like, `We are in a worse situation than we were.''' But
the mechanic told the two pilots that he knew of no hidden circuit
breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San
Francisco and Seattle but was preparing for an emergency landing at
Los Angeles when the mechanic was called, crashed a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical problem in the tail of the plane, which led it to
turn upside down and corkscrew into the water, came in a system
that is supposed to withstand failures, engineers at Boeing said
Thursday, speaking as searchers recovered the second ``black box,''
which they hope will give them a clearer picture of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The second box, the flight data recorder, which was put on a
late afternoon flight to the board's headquarters in Washington,
keeps track of the position of the horizontal stabilizer, along
with other data. The first box, the cockpit voice recorder, was
recovered on Wednesday. When it was played by investigators in
Washington Thursday, it showed that the two pilots were in the
midst of discussing a problem with the horizontal stabilizer at the
beginning of the tape, more than 30 minutes before the crash.
Investigators said previously that the crew had first raised their
problem with air traffic controllers about 11 minutes before the
crash, after dropping rapidly from their assigned altitude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, James Hall, the chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said the voice tape showed that the
plane was pitching nose down. ``The crew was able to arrest the
descent,'' Hall said, and ``continued trouble-shooting and
preparing the airplane for landing'' in Los Angeles. But then, he
said, ``control was suddenly lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparations and the loss of control may be related. Boeing
engineers and pilots of the MD-80 series airplane say the airplane
tends to pitch up or down in response to changes in its speed or
fuel consumption or changes in the position of the flaps and the
slats, devices on the wings that are used on takeoff and landing.
Extending the slats and flaps, as a pilot would do while preparing
to land, would aggravate the nose-down tendency.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing engineers Thursday described a detailed emergency
procedure for coping with a malfunctioning stabilizer system. The
stabilizer, which makes up the front two-thirds of the horizontal
tail, can be angled up or down to keep the nose at the desired
angle and is typically adjusted hundreds of times in a flight, they
said. It is moved on its hinge by a jack screw, similar to the
long, thick screw that raises or lowers a garage door. Two motors
drive the screw, one at the command of the pilots and the other
when the autopilot is in charge, although pilots can operate that
one as well, if needed. The emergency procedure involves switching
off the circuit breakers on each motor, in alternation, to figure
out which one has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer system includes both motors and brakes, and both
would have to fail for the part to move in an undesired manner, the
Boeing engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is supposed to be flyable even if the stabilizer is
immobilized, although engineers said it might require the pilots to
pull hard on their control yokes, possibly both at once.
Hammerschmidt also said Thursday evening that investigators had
interviewed the crew that flew the plane into Puerto Vallarta
earlier on Monday and that they reported the plane had operated
without any problem between Seattle and San Francisco, and again
from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta. A newspaper report had said
that the plane experienced problems with the horizontal control
system in its last completed leg.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that large parts of the tail section had been
spotted by a robot submarine, and that searchers had found the
aircraft's log book, floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt also said that an American Airlines flight that
left Phoenix on Wednesday but returned quickly because of a problem
with its horizontal stabilizer had been found to have a
short-circuit in a cockpit switch. That plane was also an MD-83,
but whether there was a connection between the incidents remained
unclear.

 Pac Bell Accuses AT&AMP;T of Slamming Customers  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A month after AT&AMP;T bashed Pacific Bell for ``slamming'' 80,000 of
its local-toll customers _ or switching their service without
permission _ Pac Bell now claims it was AT&AMP;T who was responsible
for the foul play.
<P>
   In a complaint filed with the California Public Utilities
Commission yesterday, Pac Bell accused AT&AMP;T of engaging in a
``systematic and deceptive campaign to illegally switch customers'
local toll service away from Pacific Bell to AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pac Bell officials said one other company,
which it declined to name, was guilty of slamming more local-toll
customers than AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is strikingly similar to one filed by AT&AMP;T against
Pac Bell with the PUC in late December. At the time, AT&AMP;T chastised
Pac Bell for leading a ``systematic and fraudulent campaign'' of
misleading customers into switching to Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they took my press release (and rewrote it),''
said AT&AMP;T spokesman James Peterson. ``That's my language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell's Catherine McGreevy said, ``The difference is that
we handled the complaints'' from customers who said they'd been
slammed. McGreevy, the company's director of consumer protection,
said all of the 80,000 customers told Pac Bell telemarketers or
customer service representatives that they never wanted to be
switched to AT&AMP;T for local-toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were alarmed,'' she said. ``I don't know how AT&AMP;T can
blame us for slamming when it (involves) our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a customer switches to AT&AMP;T, Pac Bell sends the
customer ``Win Back'' letters and sometimes has telemarketers
follow up, asking whether the customer really wanted to drop Pac
Bell as their service provider. AT&AMP;T claims such practices are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling match is a byproduct of regulators' decision to
open up the California telecommunications market to competition.
Before May, only Pac Bell was able to directly handle local toll
calls, usually between 12 and 25 miles, too far for local service,
but too close for long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Billingsley, a telecommunications expert with the PUC's
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, said she wasn't surprised by Pac
Bell's response to AT&AMP;T's complaint. ``Pacific Bell is very
aggressive about defending its market share in all things,''
Billingsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell was apparently the first to raise the slamming
accusation. In its original complaint, AT&AMP;T said Pac Bell tried to
charge AT&AMP;T $1 million to recover the cost of switching the
customers back to Pac Bell by saying the customers were slammed.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell executives yesterday said they wanted to settle the
issue directly with AT&AMP;T, but were forced to complain to the PUC
after AT&AMP;T filed its complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In general, slamming is one of the biggest sources of complaints
with the PUC. But Linda Woods, a manager at the consumer services
division, said only a small number of the gripes involve local-toll
calling. Woods said she wasn't sure whether AT&AMP;T or Pac Bell had
drawn more complaints.

 Top Music Firms Buy Into Listen.com  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The world's five biggest record companies, along with pop singer
Madonna, have each bought a minority stake in Listen.com, a San
Francisco online music directory.
<P>
   The year-old startup, which is trying to position itself as the
Yahoo of downloadable music, will announce today that BMG
Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Universal Music Group and Warner
Music Group have each invested an undisclosed amount in the
privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth member of the record industry's top tier, Sony Music,
invested in Listen.com in October.
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com has reviewed and categorized about 50,000 songs from
artists who have made their work legally available for download on
the Internet. However, the vast majority are unknown artists
outside of the pop music mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the individual deals were not disclosed.
Listen.com CEO Rob Reid said that the combined investment only
gives the record companies minority stakes in his firm and that the
amount is still less than the $35 million the company raised in
three previous investment rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said the deals are more important for the future because
Listen.com will gain access to the latest music from mainstream
artists once the record labels start offering their top sellers for
direct download from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Malcolm Maclachlan of International Data Corp. said the
investment is a major endorsement of Listen.com since ``it's pretty
rare that the big five move together on anything related to online
music.''
</P>
<P>
   That's starting to change, however. On Wednesday, Artistdirect
Inc., an online music site in Encino (Los Angeles County),
announced it had received at total of $97.5 million in investments
from Universal Music, BMG Entertainment, Sony Music and Warner
Music and the Cisneros Television Group, a pay TV content provider
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And Universal, BMG, Sony, Warner and EMI also jointly announced
Wednesday they they had successfully completed a six-month online
music distribution test called AlbumDirect. The trial, done with
IBM and dubbed the ``Madison Project,'' delivered digital music for
sale over high-speed cable hookups to 1,000 households in San Diego
and 100 households in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have not said if AlbumDirect will continue or be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna bought a piece of Listen.com through her own label,
Maverick Records, and her business partners Guy Oseary and Ronnie
Dashev.

 Merger Assault Defended  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Silicon Valley big shots faced the crowned heads of accounting at a
public hearing in San Francisco yesterday, hoping to preserve a
rule that has made it easy for them to grow through acquisitions.
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, a seven-member private
body that governs the profession, wants to eliminate an accounting
practice called ``pooling of interests'' that lets companies make
acquisitions without taking write-offs that would hurt their bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley executives, led by venture capitalist John Doerr
and former Netscape CEO Jim Clark, said FASB would be foolish to
kill the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a direct frontal assault on the New Economy,'' said
Doerr, arguing that an end to pooling would slow mergers,
discourage venture capital investment and hurt Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs who have become ``the envy of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   FASB has said it might eliminate pooling of interests accounting
in 2001, because it conceals the true costs of mergers and makes it
difficult for investors to evaluate deals.
</P>
<P>
   FASB wants all mergers to be accounted for under the older
``purchase method'' of accounting. Here's the difference:
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Company A spends $100 million to take over Company B,
whose hard assets _ such as land, real estate and equipment _ have
a book value of $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under purchase accounting, the part of the purchase price that
exceeds book value _ $40 million in this case _ is considered
goodwill, and must be written off over time, decreasing the
company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In a pooling-of-interest mergers, the company is not required to
write off any goodwill. The two companies simply combine their
expenses and revenues and go forward, with no impact on the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   With certain limitations, companies can decide which type of
accounting treatment they want to use.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase accounting is tough on high-tech companies, which
typically have relatively few hard assets. Their value is often
tied up in patents and other intellectual property, which would be
considered goodwill that must be written off under purchase
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, who sold Netscape to America Online for $10 billion
in a pooling-of-interests deal, said that if AOL had had to write
off the huge goodwill involved, it would have depressed AOL's
earnings by so much, for so long, the deal would never have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change this (rule) when it's workin' real well?''
Barksdale asked.
</P>
<P>
   FASB Vice Chairman James Leisenring retorted, ``I don't think
it's working at all.''
</P>
<P>
   FASB contends that because they can avoid writing off goodwill
under the pooling method, high-tech firms have been able to pump up
the price of acquisitions, especially those done with stock.
</P>
<P>
   This has make tech pooling deals seem hotter than mergers
involving purchase accounting, said FASB staffer Todd Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors aren't able to make accurate comparisons between
companies in the high tech versus the smokestack or the
brick-and-mortar world, so capital may not be going where it
should,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Powell, corporate controller for Cisco Systems, which has
made dozens of pooling acquisitions in the last three years, said
FASB is trying to impose asset-based accounting from the industrial
era on companies that don't fit that mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investing in the know-how, the people and other things
that have no easy book value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time FASB has clashed with Silicon Valley.
In the early 1990s, when FASB proposed new accounting rules that
would have made companies write off the cost of stock options given
to employees, Silicon Valley companies and workers held sidewalk
protests that forced the accountants to back off.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters outside yesterday's hearing, Doerr said
such street tactics might be revisited if FASB doesn't retreat on
pooling.
</P>
<P>
   FASB will hold a similar public hearing next week in New York
and decide the issue by the end of the year. end.  &LR; Though FASB is a
private body, its standards are accepted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and have something approaching the force of law
on U.S. firms.

 ON THE DEFENSIVE, BUSH TALKS TOUGH AS McCAIN RIDES HIGH ON (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush struck an unusually combative
posture toward Sen. John McCain on Thursday, accusing him of
running misleading television commercials and insinuating that he
had not lived up to his own call for integrity in government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain, buoyed by a surge of fund-raising over the
Internet, moved through South Carolina with the air of a
front-runner, speaking to overflow crowds.
</P>
<P>
   At an oceanside rally in the retirement haven of Seabrook
Island, he touted his big victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Tuesday night we interfered with a coronation,'' McCain
said. ``They call it a bump in the road. My friends, it was a land
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush invoked McCain's crusade to diminish the influence of money
in Washington and said there were questions McCain needed to answer
about whether his own actions matched his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let him explain,'' Bush told reporters at a news
conference in Sumter, ``how receiving people before his committee
who then contribute to his campaign is consistent.'' Bush was
referring to the Arizona senator's chairmanship of the Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the commercial, which Bush characterized as an
unwarranted assertion that his proposal for a tax cut would
endanger Social Security, Bush began the news conference with a
sort of declaration of political war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start right now by saying that any ad that's
being run by John McCain that infers, implies or says that I don't
reserve money for Social Security is Washington-style politics,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this state are going to hear what the facts
are,'' Bush added. ``The people in South Carolina want an honest
campaign. They want an open campaign. They don't want
Washington-style politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was arguably the toughest talk that Bush had directed at
McCain and it reflected the defensive position in which Bush
suddenly found himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was trounced by McCain in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday,
and two polls released Thursday suggested that in South Carolina,
which holds its primary Feb. 19, McCain and Bush were now in a
close race. Before Tuesday, polls showed McCain trailing Bush by
margins of 20 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Sumter on Thursday morning that preceded the news
conference, Bush went directly after McCain's claim, as a military
hero and former prisoner of war in North Vietnam, to the hearts and
votes of veterans. Veterans represent a disproportionately large
percentage of the population in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush surrounded himself on the steps of an old, picturesque
courthouse with crisply uniformed veterans whose medals glinted
brightly on their chests. They included six medal of honor
recipients, five retired generals and Adm. Thomas Moorer, a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Richard M.
Nixon. All were throwing their formal support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous American flag hovered over Bush. The six white
pillars flanking him were festooned in red, white and blue bunting.
A marching band played.
</P>
<P>
   One of the veterans, J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the
National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, which was
formally endorsing Bush, listed several recent pieces of
legislation involving Vietnam or the Persian Gulf war that he said
McCain had not supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the power to help these veterans,'' Burch said. ``He
came home, forgot us. But, fortunately, we found a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then delivered remarks that promised not only a stronger
military but also better treatment of the men and women who served
in it.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain dismissed the criticism and Bush's effort to appeal
to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every major veterans group in American has given me their
highest award,'' McCain said in an interview. ``Here's the
question: Have I fooled all these veterans, or is there a little
bit of foolishness going on?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategists laughed off the accusations, saying they
showed the Bush campaign's desperation. But eager to shoot down the
assertions before they stick, McCain aides released a list of his
veterans awards, as well as legislation that the senator has backed
dealing with Agent Orange and gulf war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush is talking about the military, our strength, it
shows chaos over there,'' Michael Murphy, a McCain strategist, said
in an interview. ``It would be like me saying, `Mike Tyson, I want
you in the ring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added, ``Next thing, we'll see Bush in his Air National
Guard uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain, disputed Bush's
accusation that McCain was running a commercial that unfairly
characterized Bush's position on Social Security. Opinsky noted
that while the spot maintains that McCain is the Republican
presidential candidate who would most strenuously safeguard Social
Security, it does not mention Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments about McCain's ethics were restrained, but
stronger than those he made last month, when McCain faced several
days of tough questions from reporters and extensive news coverage
about the relationship between people who had given money to his
campaign and those who had business before the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he said: ``I'm not making any allegations at all. I am
just suggesting that his claim that he is the outsider is a claim
I'm not going to let him get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush kept hammering at the point that he had given McCain too
wide a berth and too free a pass in New Hampshire and that McCain's
committee chairmanship reflected nearly two decades in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, in the course of the debate, I'm tagged with
being the Washington guy,'' Bush told reporters, attacking McCain's
descriptions of himself as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that he's the person who's been the Washington
insider,'' Bush said. ``He's the person who's a chairman of a
committee, and I'm the person who has a reform agenda.''

FDA DRAWS FIRE FOR A RULE ON SUPPLEMENTS AND PREGNANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying they feared dietary supplements' unknown
effects on fetuses, two leading experts in birth defects asked the
Food and Drug Administration Thursday to revoke a new rule that
allows supplement manufacturers to market products for morning
sickness and leg swelling in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, to take effect on Monday, permits the makers to sell
herbal products and other supplements for those pregnancy-related
conditions without subjecting them to the safety and effectiveness
testing that is required of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the public health community, the rules should not be in the
direction of promoting the use of untested products for women
during pregnancy,'' said Dr. Godfrey Oakley, who retired in 1998
after 15 years as director of the division of birth defects at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``It's a setup for a
problem for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley and the other scholar, Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said they had been
unaware of the rule, announced last month, until the advocacy group
Public Citizen brought it to their attention.
</P>
<P>
   What effect they will have is unclear. An FDA spokesman said
only that the agency would ``carefully consider'' their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The rule stems from a 1994 law, the Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act, which severely restricts the FDA's authority to
regulate herbal products and other supplements. The law
distinguishes between supplements, which ``affect the structure or
function of the body,'' and drugs, which prevent, treat or cure
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the law, the FDA has reasoned that because
pregnancy is a natural life process and not a disease, supplements
may be marketed for ``ordinary morning sickness'' and for swelling,
or edema, without prior review of their safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the agency, Landrigan wrote that its decision
``has the potential to put pregnant women and their offspring at
serious risk of unwitting exposure to chemical teratogens'' _
substances that cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To any pediatrician of my generation,'' he wrote, ``this
statement calls powerfully to mind the chilling story of the
teratogen thalidomide that 40 years ago was specifically
recommended for the treatment of morning sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only because the FDA refused to approve the drug, he
said, that thousands of babies in this country were spared
deformity, a fate that befell many in Europe, Canada, Australia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the current debate is only academic: because the new
rule is just now taking effect, no supplements have yet been
marketed for morning sickness or any other pregnancy-related
condition, said a spokeswoman for the Consumer Products Healthcare
Association, which represents dietary supplement manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Soller, the association's director of science and
technology, noted that if the FDA determined that a supplement was
unsafe, it could take the product off the market. But Oakley said
it could take years of using a product before evidence of birth
defects emerged.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't be surprised if every resurgent, cash-poor
presidential campaign begins shamelessly plugging its campaign Web
sites, where Visa, MasterCard and Discover are accepted, no matter
how small the donation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 48 hours since his resounding triumph in New Hampshire on
Tuesday night, Sen. John McCain of Arizona has dropped his
campaign's Web address in nearly every nationally televised
interview he has done.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been a record $810,000 raised on the Internet,
McCain campaign officials said Thursday. Even more surprising, 40
percent of the donations came from first-time political givers and
34 percent of the contributors are under age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Internet surfers have flocked to the
McCain 2000 Web site, many armed with their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential candidate has never raised so much money on the
Internet in such a short period, and political strategists and
analysts said Thursday that it is a phenomenon that probably will
repeat itself often in national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take an emotional moment with the extraordinary outreach
capacity that the Web has and you have the makings of a totally new
form of raising money for candidates and causes in America,'' said
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan
political organization here. ``This is the first prime example in
political campaigns of the revolution that is taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, McCain's supporters said that even after the pace of
e-donations slows, as it inevitably will, the campaign will still
be in a position to meet its goal of $5 million raised by March 7,
the day of coast-to-coast primaries in 16 states, including New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The donations have come in at a clip of $18,000 an hour,''
said Howard Opinsky, the campaign's press secretary. ``That's
compared to the $10,000-a-day that we used to get. And our phone is
ringing off the hook. We're having trouble returning all the
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's resounding, 18-point triumph in New Hampshire was the
product of a grass-roots campaign of town meetings and, what the he
calls ``straight talk.'' But in the past 48 hours, the grass-roots
momentum of the campaign has shifted to the campaign's Web site
(www.McCain2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   Besides contributions, 7,000 new volunteers have signed up at
the Web site, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has raised $2.2 million on the Internet, the most among
the Republicans. It is perhaps not surprising that his campaign has
the most user-friendly site of all the major presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the first page, a window pops up with the headline, ``McCain
wins New Hampshire.'' It is accompanied by a challenge from McCain:
``Please join me today and together we can beat the special
interests.'' And below that, there is a prompt to ``click here to
contribute today.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The average donation on the campaign's Web site is $115, and
most of the donations are small enough to qualify for federal
matching funds. That means that McCain's Internet take alone in the
past day could mean a total of $1.5 million for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the infusion of cash, McCain will still struggle to
raise enough money to broadcast advertisements in the large
media-market states, such as New York and California. Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas has $31 million in the bank while McCain has just
$7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Internet fund-raising success has impressed even
fund-raisers who support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is phenomenal,'' said Ted Welch, one such Republican
fund-raiser. ``That bodes very well for Senator McCain that people
would respond to that extent.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two U.S. warships enforcing U.N. sanctions against
Iraq seized a Russian tanker in the Persian Gulf on Thursday after
boarding it and discovering evidence that it might be smuggling oil
out of southern Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A lightly armed boarding party from the guided missile cruiser
Monterey landed on the tanker by helicopter Wednesday after
repeated attempts to get the tanker to respond to radio queries
about its cargo, said the spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no incidents of violence whatsoever,'' he said. .
The Americans reviewed the tanker's navigational equipment and
documents, including bills of lading. They also took samples of the
cargo of gas oil to determine whether the petroleum had originated
in Iraq. As of late Thursday, the analysis of the petroleum _ and
the sediment carried in it, which should indicate its source _ had
not been completed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Volgoneft-147 tanker, flying a Russian flag, is only the
second Russian vessel stopped by the international patrols since
1990, when Iraq was prohibited from selling oil on the open market
as punishment for its invasion of Kuwait, Pentagon officials said.

<P>
   For the past month, the United States has warned the Russian
government of its monitoring of two Russian tankers that had
arrived on the Iraqi coast and appeared to be involved in smuggling
oil. The Russian ambassador to the United States was briefed
regularly on the issue, and U.S. diplomats in Moscow have discussed
it with the government there, said James P. Foley, a State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government has told us that this ship is privately
owned and that an investigation on the Russian side is under way,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ships trying to smuggle oil out of Iraq has risen
dramatically with the increase in oil prices to $27 a barrel from
$11 a year ago, a senior Pentagon official said. But the unusual
presence of Russian vessels pushed the United States to involve the
Moscow government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get the Russians to police this ship themselves,''
the Pentagon official said, ``but I guess with oil prices so high
it's hard to stop these entrepreneurs.''

CIA DIRECTOR EMPHASIZES DIFFERENCES IN SECURITY CASES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wading into a growing political debate already
tinged by accusations of racism and special treatment, the director
of central intelligence, George Tenet, dismissed comparisons
Thursday between the way the government had responded to evidence
of computer security lapses by a former director who lost his
security clearance and by a nuclear scientist who is in jail
waiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet told a Senate panel that while John Deutch, his
predecessor, was ``sloppy'' in his handling of classified
documents, there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a
foreign country by handing over American secrets. By contrast,
Tenet noted that the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, had been charged with
downloading and copying files containing nuclear secrets with the
intention of aiding a foreign country and damaging national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think there is a great difference in the two
cases,'' Tenet said at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``In both cases there was a referral made to the
Department of Justice. In one case the Department of Justice
declined any action, in the case of the director. In the case of
Wen Ho Lee there is an indictment pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one instance there is an intent to do harm to the United
States _ that's a legal judgment that's been made. In the other
instance, a similar legal judgment was not made. That's not to say
that this case involving the former director is not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet was responding to pointed questioning from Sen. Wayne
Allard, R-Colo., who asked why the two were being treated so
differently, a question that is being repeated by Lee's supporters
as he awaits trial in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
was arrested in December and accused of downloading and copying the
secret files onto portable computer tapes, some of which are now
missing. While the government has not charged him with espionage,
prosecutors say they can prove that he took the secret information
with the intent to aid a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, by contrast, was the subject of an internal CIA
investigation after officials learned that he had placed classified
documents on CIA-owned computers at his home, but the Justice
Department decided not to prosecute him in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, after the agency's inspector general office
completed its investigation of the case, Tenet suspended Deutch's
security clearances indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference Thursday about the impression of a
double standard, Attorney General Janet Reno said: ``I can't
comment with respect to the Wen Ho Lee case, because that is a
pending matter. But each case speaks for itself, based on the
evidence and the law, and a judgment has to be made, based on the
evidence in that particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   The different outcomes in the two cases has helped fuel charges
of racism and selective prosecution by Lee's supporters. They argue
that the Taiwan-born scientist had been singled out because of his
ethnicity as the government investigated evidence that China had
stolen U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators strongly deny that Lee was the victim
of racism. But accusations made by the intelligence inspector
general that some senior agency officials took actions that led to
a delay of a thorough investigation in the Deutch case have only
intensified the debate over the way the two cases have been
handled.
</P>
<P>
   Allard argued that there did seem to be parallels between the
Deutch and Lee cases, saying both had ``made similar mistakes in
the fact that they both had information that was very important to
this country on unsecured computers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet said that while Deutch was writing and creating
classified documents on unsecured computers so he could work at
home, his actions did not compare to Lee's efforts to download and
copy secret data on U.S. nuclear warheads from the classified
computer system at Los Alamos.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Separately, Tenet provided the Senate panel with a broad review
of global threats facing the United States, including terrorism. He
said that U.S. intelligence officials believe that Osama bin Laden,
charged in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa, had
developed new tactics to try to strike U.S. interests with his
terrorist network. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is now living in
Afghanistan. Tenet said the United States believed that bin Laden's
terrorist organization, along with other terrorist groups, were now
``placing increased emphasis on developing surrogates to carry out
attacks in an effort to avoid detection.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad
organization ``is closely linked to bin Laden's organization and
his operatives located around the world, including Europe, Yemen,
Pakistan, Lebanon and Afghanistan.'' Tenet also said: ``There is
now an intricate web of alliances among Sunni extremists worldwide,
including North Africans, radical Palestinians, Pakistanis and
Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these terrorists are actively sponsored by national
governments that harbor great antipathy for the United States. Iran
for one remains the most active state sponsor.''

CITING CURRENCY WEAKNESS, EUROPEANS RAISE KEY RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Declaring that the weakness of Europe's year-old single
currency had created concern about price stability, the European
Central Bank raised interest rates Thursday for the second time in
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the benchmark refinancing rate, to 3.25 percent from
3 percent, came the day after the Federal Reserve increased
interest rates in the United States and indicated that further
rises might be necessary to keep America's strong economy from
producing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investors had expected the European rate
increase, though many said they had not expected it before the
spring. The timing led some economists to express fear that
Europe's fledgling central bank would be seen as sailing in the
wake of the Federal Reserve. But financial markets in Europe
appeared, for the moment at least, to welcome the move.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg,
maintained that the timing of the move after the Federal Reserve
action was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices reacted favorably, with the benchmark index of the
Paris stock exchange closing up 3.41 percent and that in Frankfurt
rising 2.54 percent. In Britain, which has not adopted the single
currency, the euro, and sets monetary rates independently, stocks
gained one-third of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   The euro rose as well, settling in New York late in the day at
98.85 cents, up from 97.57 cents on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of Thursday's increase in the interest rate the European
Central Bank charges commercial banks for short-term loans had come
on Monday, when Duisenberg suggested that continued weakness of the
euro threatened to generate inflation. At a news conference at the
bank's headquarters in Frankfurt Thursday, Duisenberg repeated that
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's drop in value compared with the dollar, he said, was
becoming a ``cause of concern with regard to future price
stability.'' As the euro weakens, the prices Europeans pay for
goods they import from the United States or pay for in dollars,
such as oil, increase. So, Duisenberg said, ``import prices can be
expected to rise further, thereby increasing the risk that upward
pressure on consumer-price inflation might materialize in the
medium term.''
</P>
<P>
   An increase in interest rates tends to strengthen a currency by
making deposits denominated in that currency more attractive. Even
with the euro's improvement in trading Thursday, it has been
languishing below $1 for much of the last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of January, the European currency was valued almost
12 percent below its average worth during the first quarter of
1999, and it has continued to erode since then.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank, before increasing rates in November, to 3
percent from 2.5 percent, had been primarily concerned with stoking
sluggish European economies, which have shown less vigor than the
American economy through most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising rates Thursday, the central bank put its emphasis
clearly on avoiding inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Though evidence of inflation in European countries is sketchy,
Duisenberg said that the bank's principal yardstick for growth in
the supply of money, which is an inflation barometer, showed an
annual increase of 6.1 percent in the last quarter of 1999, well
above its 1999 target of 4.5 percent. Duisenberg said long-term
bond rates in Europe, another inflation signpost, showed evidence
of continued strong increases, reaching the highest level at the
end of January since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though economic growth has been strong in France and Spain, and
in several smaller European countries like Ireland and the
Netherlands, it remains fitful in Germany and Italy, which with
France form the core of the continent's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's move drew mixed reactions from economists. Many said
the rate increase was premature and the evidence of inflationary
danger cited by Duisenberg was overdrawn. Some accused the central
bank of acting primarily to slow or reverse the euro's slide
against the dollar, and said the move appeared to be a reaction to
the Fed's move on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   `With their timing, they threw into question their
independence,'' said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ramm said he saw little danger in the move for European growth
prospects, since many economists had expected a rate increase
within the next six to eight weeks. But he added, ``It would be a
real embarrassment if the euro fell further.''

LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO MORNING FINDS GORE LONG ON TALK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even with Michael Dukakis nodding off in the
second row, Al Gore kept talking. One of the Secret Service agents
standing at the edge of the crowd had his eyes closed, too, and the
press corps was literally moaning for mercy _ so loudly, in fact,
that many of the real people at the town hall meeting here at Los
Angeles City College turned around to look.
</P>
<P>
   But until nearly 1 o'clock Thursday morning _ or 4 a.m. back in
New York, where his day had begun _ the vice president stood close
to his questioners, looked straight into their eyes and tried to
close the sale, finally wrapping up after 3 hours 18 minutes (just
a few minutes shy, aides said, of his personal record, 3:24).
</P>
<P>
   He had warned them, though, telling the crowd of about 200
straight away that he would stay to answer all questions, until
California's presidential primary on March 7 if necessary. Often
his answers were so comprehensive that they seemed to begin with
the creation of the earth _ the biblical version of which, he
happened to mention, he does not believe should be taught in
science class.
</P>
<P>
   Though California is not considered a state where retail
politics works particularly well, the audience here, mostly
undecided Democrats, not only rewarded the candidate's endurance
but stayed afterward and asked him to elaborate on a variety of
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said later that they particularly appreciated his
not always giving the answer that his questioner seemed to want.
When a retired evangelist asked the vice president if he was a
born-again Christian, he said yes, but went on to say that this did
not mean he wanted to be associated with what he called the
intolerance of Jerry Falwell. ``I'm sorry to be long-winded,'' Gore
said by way of finishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, too,'' replied the man, who, having had a little fun at
Gore's expense, added that ``America needs to get back on its
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made clear that he did not agree with the
questioner's support for prayer in schools, and he also defended
the welfare overhaul to a man who said many people had been hurt by
it.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, correct a young man who said, ``Many years
ago you wrote books about the Internet.'' Instead, he joked about
having stretched the truth on that topic some time back: ``You
notice he didn't say I invented the Internet; I didn't say that
this evening either, did I?''
</P>
<P>
   He may have made a teensy overstatement, though, when he told
the crowd that ``we had a huge event with 3,000 people at Ohio
State University'' earlier in the day. Officials at that rally said
the room where it had taken place did not hold more than 1,200
people, and, given the area needed for the staging erected for the
occasion, they estimated the crowd at 500.
</P>
<P>
   In another answer, about how to keep youths from joining gangs,
Gore said the whole idea that quality time spent with children
could make up for a shortage of time with them ``is a lie,'' but
then added, ``There is some truth to that lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-minute answer to the young man's question about the
future of the Internet, Gore was nothing if not thorough. He began
with a description of ``stagflation'' caused by the oil crisis of
1973. Eventually moving into the present, he said, ``Now, instead
of big price increases, we have a price decrease for processing
information, low unemployment and low inflation because the price
of processing information is cut in half every 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he worked in a statement of support for
universal preschool and for smaller class sizes before finally
wrapping up that same answer about the Internet by admitting,
``I've given you a mouthful there.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Gore seemed to go out of his way to state the obvious.
To a woman who told him that she was disabled and that she and her
three children had previously been homeless, he said, ``I'm glad
you have a home.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience, though, seemed quite moved by his attentions.
</P>
<P>
   A man who spoke passionately about his work with children,
trying to keep them out of gangs, said he was holding down two jobs
and volunteering a lot of his time to help others in his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need support,'' the man said. ``Jesus Christ, we need more
people up there helping, and when you become president _ and I hope
you're not doubting yourself that you will become president _
hopefully you will remember what we said here at LACC''
</P>
<P>
   After the marathon, Brian Price, a previously undecided
screenwriter in the audience, said: ``I saw two things I hadn't
seen on television _ a plan and passion. I want somebody who can
take on the anti-gun-control morons on the other side, and I saw
somebody who looks like they have the pluck to fight.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID CORCORAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESHIRE, Conn. _ Professor Edward R. Tufte's books have a
certain austere elegance about them, starting with ``The Visual
Display of Quantitative Information'' (1983), which sold hundreds
of thousands of copies and established his reputation as a guru of
information graphics.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tufte was surfing Amazon.com recently for books about
business graphics presentations, he was perversely delighted with
what he found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The titles are so wonderfully bad,'' he said one gray morning
last month, sitting in the vast open kitchen of his low-slung house
in the hills north of New Haven. He waved a hand at a stack of new
books, their covers ablaze with rainbow-colored charts and
sock-you-in-the-face titles like ``Power Pitches,'' ``Creating Cool
PowerPoint 97 Presentations'' and ``Point, Click &AMP; Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Tufte opened a book more or less at random to a chart with the
headline ``U.S. &AMP; Canada: Sales Growth %.'' On a shimmering purple
background were maps of the United States in red and Canada in
bright green; alongside that, two rows of nine three-dimensional
bars, one red and one green, unlabeled except for the puzzling
caption ``To May 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice example of a very dopey graphic,'' he said.
``No scales; the variables aren't clear; three phony dimensions for
one-dimensional data. You could make an argument that graphics like
this actually subtract from the sum of human knowledge, by making
people stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tufte (pronounced TUF-tee), that chart exemplifies a
dismaying pattern in the way data are presented in too many
business meetings, especially those dominated by ``the overhead
projector that magically rises out of the rosewood table'' or its
electronic successor, a computer linked to a projector and equipped
with a presentation program, like Microsoft's PowerPoint.
</P>
<P>
   In these presentations, he says, visual flash and dash
substitute for real analysis of useful information. The images are
by nature ``low resolution'': they must be drawn big and bold to be
visible across a room, so the amount of information conveyed in any
one image is scant.
</P>
<P>
   And the resolution is driven even lower by what Tufte calls
chart junk: meaningless tricks done only because the software makes
them possible, like turning a one-dimensional piece of information
(a sales figure) into a three-dimensional bar, as if it were a
stack of potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   He says such graphics _ low in information, confused in display,
muddled in thinking _ can have catastrophic consequences. A chapter
in his latest book, ``Visual Explanations'' (1997; published, like
his others, by his own company, Graphics Press), is devoted to a
particularly hapless collection of charts and tables prepared by
frantic engineers for Morton Thiokol, which makes solid-fuel rocket
boosters for the space shuttle, as they tried unsuccessfully to
dissuade NASA from launching the shuttle Challenger in January
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in those tables, he said, were statistics that would have
made a more compelling case, if anyone had managed to display them
properly: the rubber O-ring seals in the boosters tended to leak at
low temperatures. The morning after those charts were faxed to NASA
at Cape Canaveral, the Challenger was launched during a rare
Florida freeze. An O-ring failed, and the rocket blew up 73 seconds
after liftoff, killing all seven astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the consequences of poorly presented graphics are
mundane _ wasted time and an audience bored into cynicism or
slumber. Typically, Tufte said, a presentation begins with an
overhead projection of ``the dreaded bullet list'' _ generic
objectives that resemble the automatic mission statements that you
can generate with a mouse-click on the ``Dilbert'' Web site. (``It
is our mission to enthusiastically maintain quality paradigms.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The pompous, inflated, generic thought gives you no leverage
on actually analyzing and solving a business situation,'' he said.
``And the problems with the bullet list and the overhead are
identically reproduced in PowerPoint. It's just that now we go
through a computer, and we're thankful if the presentation doesn't
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That view is hardly uncontroversial. Brian Reilly, president of
a computer consulting company in Manhattan and the author of one of
the books in Tufte's pile, ``Create PowerPoint Presentations in a
Weekend'' (Prima Publishing, 1997), acknowledges that
do-it-yourself graphics programs like PowerPoint have their
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``In the hands of a skilled designer, it's
fabulous. In the hands of an unskilled designer, a book is a
disaster, too. Anything can be misused.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the latest technology could overcome the problem of big,
fat, vacuous images: ``The new projectors can be very high
resolution. If you can see it on your monitor, you can see it on
the projector.''
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone agrees that low-resolution, high-impact visuals
are an inferior way to communicate. ``I hate to sound trite, but
sometimes less is more,'' said Stephen M. Kosslyn, a professor of
psychology at Harvard and the author of ``Elements of Graph
Design'' (W.H. Freeman, 1994). ``We need to respect the limitations
of our perception and memory systems. It's often better to have a
series of simple displays that can be taken in at a glance than to
try to pack everything into one graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tufte, 57, who taught in Yale's political science
department for 22 years before assuming emeritus status last year,
favors a different model. ``The task is not to have `high-impact
presentations,' or `point, click, wow!' or `power pitches,''' he
said. ``The point is to explain something. The right metaphor for
presentations is not power or PowerPoint. It's not television or
theater. It's teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes the way teachers often start their classes with
handouts. ``Handouts _ pieces of paper _ are by far the
highest-resolution means of information transfer,'' he said. ``A
good meeting probably begins with a handout. You might spend the
first 10 or 15 minutes of a meeting reading it, before anyone says
a thing. Then you use your talk for the reasoning about the
high-resolution material that's in front of us, instead of somebody
reading aloud from the bullet list.''
</P>
<P>
   He would eliminate meetings that result in no exchange of useful
information, as Louis V. Gerstner Jr. sought to do when he took
over as chief executive of IBM in 1993. ``Ask yourself, as they're
reading aloud: `Why are we having this meeting? The rate of
information transfer is just too low,''' Tufte said. ``The virtue
of this advice is it probably eliminates about half of all
corporate meetings, which would probably be the most profound
money-saving piece of advice ever given in the history of corporate
consulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosslyn, the Harvard psychologist, doubted that it would ever be
that simple. ``I think his books are gorgeous,'' he said of Tufte.
``He's done a huge service to the field by making people aware of
the importance of graphic displays. But that's not business
graphics. His graphics are often for explanatory data analysis _
not the same as crisp, clear communication.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tufte, business graphics are no different from any other
kind, because the goals are ultimately the same: exchanging
information, reasoning, problem-solving. ``Good design is clear
thinking made visible, and bad design is stupidity made visible,''
he said. ``So when you see a display filled with chart junk,
there's a deeper corruption: they don't know what they're talking
about.''

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Austria's president announced Thursday that he
would swear in a new government on Friday that includes Joerg
Haider's anti-immigrant Freedom Party, setting the country on a
collision course with the European Union, which regards Haider's
party as xenophobic and extremist.
</P>
<P>
   President Thomas Klestil announced the decision after a final
day of hesitation that was marked by objections to two proposed
Freedom Party members as cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Klestil's decision bowed to the logic of Austrian democracy,
since the Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party led by
Wolfgang Schuessel won enough seats in elections in October to
govern. But it also gave stature to a rightist party that has not
hesitated to employ bigotry and racist vitriol.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute declaration by the coalition promising to
work ``for an Austria in which xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism
have no place,'' reaction was swift. The other 14 governments of
the European Union confirmed that they would downgrade diplomatic
relations with Vienna and isolate the nation, as they had
threatened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said it would recall its ambassador as soon as the
swearing-in is completed. France and Portugal announced that they
would impose sanctions on Friday. And in Washington, a State
Department spokesman, James Foley, reiterated warnings that the
United States would review its relationship with Austria as soon as
Haider's party joined the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the new government, Schuessel will be chancellor. The
sensitive ministries of justice and defense will go to the Freedom
Party, but Haider himself will not be in the government. He has
made it clear that he prefers to remain out of national office
until he is strong enough to become chancellor. Haider's party got
the chance to join a coalition cabinet after talks between
Schuessel and the Social Democrats collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the election in October, the Social Democrats emerged as the
strongest party, but Haider's Freedom Party came in second for the
first time. The right-wing coalition has 104 seats in the
183-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union stand is based on the view that Haider's
politics, including isolated and subsequently regretted expressions
of sympathy for aspects of Hitler's rule, make him incompatible
with the values of the European Union, and on the pragmatic concern
that other extreme-right parties may benefit from his party's
inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Haider's arrival in power has set up a highly charged
test of the respective powers of nations and the embryonic
government of the European Union. How the test is resolved will
weigh heavily on Europe's unity and Europe's future, issues that in
turn affect the United States directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too simplistic to say that we must keep Austria in
Europe at all costs,'' Belgium's foreign minister, Louis Michel,
said Thursday in a statement indicating the passions Haider's rise
have ignited. ``I think Europe can very well do without Austria. We
don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, dressed in an uncharacteristically sober dark suit
and tie, Haider, 50, appeared in a vast hall of the gilt-dripping
Hofburg Palace and sat beneath the European Union's blue-and-gold
flag as he signed the declaration committing Austria to ``respect,
tolerance and understanding for all human beings irrespective of
their origin.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, drafted in part by Klestil, amounted to a
bizarre list of democratic commitments and mea culpas for the
prospective government of a modern European state to be signing.
But it reflected the degree of alarm that Haider's entry into
government has provoked in European nations governed mainly by the
center-left.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out the tragic
history of the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the
National Socialist regime,'' it said, referring to the Nazis
alongside whom many Austrians fought.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the son of a virulently Nazi family and owner of an
estate that once belonged to a Jewish family that fled, had
expressed admiration for the Waffen SS and for Hitler's labor
policies, before retracting the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's declaration continued: ``Nationalism, dictatorship
and intolerance brought war, xenophobia, bondage, racism and mass
murder. The singularity of the crimes of the Holocaust, which are
without precedent in history, are an exhortation to permanent
alertness against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel described the text as a ``pre-emptive political
strike'' intended to reassure the world about Austria's commitment
to human rights. ``This declaration is very important because it
deals with the fears of many friends at home and abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, who was foreign minister in the outgoing coalition of
Social Democratic and People's parties, has portrayed himself as
the guarantor of the presentability of the restless, chameleonic
Haider.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement, for all its evident worthiness, could not
conjure away the fact that Haider ran an election campaign last
year that included posters suggesting that most black people in
Austria are drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the governor of the southern province of Carinthia, has
been a consistent opponent of immigration and has somehow combined
his professed commitment to freedom with the view that Winston
Churchill was as evil as Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1988 and 1998, an estimated 405,000 immigrants entered
Austria, a country of 8 million people. Many came from the wartorn
Balkans, newly free countries in Eastern Europe and Turkey. Some
neighborhoods in Vienna have changed radically in appearance and
atmosphere, creating unease.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Austria's immigration policy, at least with
respect to Balkan refugees, has been more open than those of most
of its European critics. But the sudden arrival of many foreigners
bolstered Haider's political message among Austrians who are afraid
of losing jobs or are put off by schools in which most children are
foreign.

</P>
<P>
   A brief statement from Klestil's office, issued after a second
meeting Thursday with Haider and Schuessel, said: ``President
Thomas Klestil informed Wolfgang Schuessel that he should appear
tomorrow, Friday, Feb. 4, 2000, at 12 o'clock with his government
team in the president's official chambers to be sworn in.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement went on to say that two proposed Freedom Party
members of the government _ Thomas Prinzhorn and Hilmar Kabas _ had
been rejected as minister of innovation and defense respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In language typical of the regular excesses of Haider's
movement, Prinzhorn recently threatened to give Klestil ``a bloody
head'' if he did not approve the right-wing coalition. This is the
sort of tone that was also apparent in Haider's recent description
of the French president, Jacques Chirac, as a ``megalomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Freedom Party leader in Vienna, Kabas was immediately
responsible for the xenophobic election posters that clearly sought
to play on fears and misgivings over immigration in changing
neighborhoods of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kabas was replaced as defense minister by Herbert Scheibner, the
36-year-old spokesman for defense in the Freedom Party. The highly
sensitive justice ministry, which has some power to direct the
thrust of prosecutors' activities, went to another Freedom Party
member, Michael Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Heinz Grasser, a Freedom Party member and spokesman for the
Canadian automotive parts supplier Magna International, will become
finance minister. He will have the delicate task of working closely
with European Union partners, who seem likely to shun him, on
Europe's shared currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the People's Party and state
secretary at the Foreign Ministry in the outgoing government, was
promoted to foreign minister. She will clearly seek to mollify the
European Union, but it was not immediately clear how Austria could
circumvent its looming isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 European governments that issued the statement committing
themselves to punitive measures against Austria have said they will
avoid bilateral meetings with Austrian ministers. But the
governments stopped short of barring them from European Union
meetings for the simple reason that nothing has happened in Austria
that could legally justify such a step.

   Gov. George W. Bush came to Delaware on Thursday afternoon and
said the trip showed the sweep of his campaign. ``I think if
somebody is running for president of the United States, they need
to run in all the states,'' Bush told supporters in Dover. It was a
none-too-subtle dig at Sen. John McCain, who is largely ignoring
Delaware's primary on Feb. 8, focusing on South Carolina's on Feb
19.

   Vice President Al Gore has rejected former Sen. Bill Bradley's

debates. But Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said, ``Given the
vice president's interest in debating, we find this surprising.'' &QL;

U.S. SEARCHES FOR SOURCE OF TAINTED BEEF SENT TO SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Ill.)  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The discovery by Swiss health inspectors last July that
imported U.S. beef was contaminated with DES, an illegal hormone,
has prompted an effort by the United States government to trace its
source. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DES, or diethylstibestrol, was used as a growth stimulant,
primarily among cattle and sheep growers in the United States,
until 1979 when the Food and Drug Administration ordered it off the
market as a suspected carcinogen. Studies indicated that cancer and
other abnormalities could result in the female children of women
who had consumed DES while pregnant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After failing to discover any DES for several years, the
Agriculture Department stopped testing beef for the substance in
1991. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities said DES had been found during routine testing
of two samples of imported beef, which were supposed to be
hormone-free. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and
Drug Administration are trying to track the source of the
contaminated beef. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If sufficient evidence is found, it is potentially a criminal
matter that would be turned over to the Justice Department,'' said
Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss veterinary service takes regular samples of U.S. beef
imported into the country, mainly for use by restaurants
specializing in steaks. Dr. Roland Charriere, of the Swiss federal
health department in the capital of Bern, said contaminated
products were rarely found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States exported about 1,129 tons of beef to
Switzerland in 1998, the latest year statistics were available,
which is one-third of all Swiss beef imports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finding comes at a time when European consumers are
sensitive to tainted foods as a result of several scares involving
Coca-Cola products last year and reports of dioxin-contaminated
chicken in Belgium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beef, in particular, has drawn increased scrutiny because of the
outbreak of what is known as mad cow disease in British cattle,
which is caused by contaminants mixed into animal feed. There are
fears that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
could be linked to a similar brain-wasting disease in humans. After
England, Switzerland has the second-highest incidence of the
disease in Europe. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, the European Union has been at odds with the United
States over whether to allow the import of hormone-treated beef.
The United States has imposed sanctions on European goods in
retaliation for European barriers to beef products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland is not in the European Union, but it bans a number
of substances in meat that are legal in the United States,
including melengestrol acetate, which was also found in the beef
samples in July. According to Swiss officials, 26 samples were
tested and five were contaminated with melengestrol acetate, in
addition to the two tainted with DES. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A public interest group, the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, wrote the secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, on Jan.
31 that the ``discovery by the Swiss government was troubling both
because of the potential health risks to consumers overseas and
because similar contamination may be present in beef consumed by
Americans.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the discovery, Switzerland has barred two
companies from further imports. They were identified as the
Farmland National Beef Packing Co., a unit of Farmland Industries,
and the Bruss Co., a subsidiary of IBP Inc. Farmland, based in
Liberal, Kan., and Bruss, based in Chicago, are among the biggest
U.S. beef processors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charriere said the beef containing DES had been consumed before
it could be withdrawn from the market. ``It was already eaten by
the time the analysis came back,'' he said. &QL;

SALVAGE SHIPS PLAY KEY ROLE IN RECOVERY EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer of 1998 found the salvage ship M/V Kellie Chouest
trolling the waters off North Carolina, searching for the bones of
the Union Navy's first ironclad, the Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Chouest was pushing through the choppy waters off
Port Hueneme, Calif., looking for the remains of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   Orange-painted and with cranes extending into the sea, the
Chouest has excelled at its gruesome task: Wednesday evening, the
ship's remote-operated vehicle _ a remote-controlled unmanned
submarine named Scorpio I _ found the plane's cockpit voice
recorder in nearly 700 feet of water. Thursday morning, it found
the flight-data recorder at a similar depth.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian-owned, Navy-contracted salvage ship is one of a
virtual armada combing the seas off the southern California coast
for clues to Flight 261's crash into the sea. It has been grueling.
Crews aboard the Chouest spent 15 hours ordering Scorpio I to pick
through the debris on the ocean floor with its manipulator arm
before finding the data recorder covered in pieces of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important phase to any investigation is to conduct a
survey of the debris field,'' said Capt. Joe Leidig, commander of
the Navy's Submarine Development Squadron Five, which is assisting
in the salvage operation for the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``We've already done that, in a sense, to find the
recorders. The recorders are our first priority. After we find
them, then the NTSB can direct us to what we need to survey next.''
</P>
<P>
   Both recorders were found in the midst of the plane's debris
field, the inevitable result of a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   When a plane falls from a high altitude into water, it will
break apart wherever the forces of physics are strongest. As it
falls to the seabed, different pieces of the plane are caught by
currents, and litter the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   That litter can greatly complicate things. When oceanographer
Robert Ballard discovered the RMS Titanic in the 1980s, the ship's
debris field took up countless square miles of the North Atlantic
seabed, sending Ballard off in the wrong direction several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take an airplane and drop it in water 700 feet down,''
said Rick Benson, president of Ballard Dive and Salvage in Seattle,
who has been salvaging ships for 25 years, ``and look at what your
debris field looks like. It's going to be a pretty good-sized
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the recorders had ``pingers,'' noisemakers that give
off a signal so ships or planes can find them, and so the plane's
debris field was only an issue in that part of the search because
pieces of fractured jetliner covered the data-recorder on the sea
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Flight 261's flight and data recorders was the
first objective of the recovery mission. The recorders, which
contain the last 30 minutes of cockpit conversation and hours of
data from sensors around the aircraft. The recorders, sometimes
known as ``black boxes,'' can quickly tell investigators what went
wrong with a plane, often saving lengthy and costly recovery
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In separate 1996 incidents, two Boeing 757s crashed, once off
the coast of Peru, once off the coast of the Dominican Republic.
Like Flight 261, both planes crashed in deep water that made
recovery difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``pingers'' paid off, and investigators were able to
recover the black boxes, hastening the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the hard work begins. The rest of the wreckage has
no pingers attached. The NTSB will tell the Navy what the next
salvage priority is. And the Navy will send Scorpio I to the seabed
to recover the engines, the stabilizers, pieces of the fuselage,
pieces of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   It will send the Klein 2000 down, too. The Klein 2000 is another
remote-operated vehicle, but instead of carrying a manipulator arm,
spotlights and video cameras, it carries a sonar rig.
</P>
<P>
   The Klein 2000 bounces sound waves off the sea floor to draw a
silhouette of the seabed. It's very effective in locating large
pieces of metal, but far less effective when the seabed is covered
in metal. Everything generates a return, and the Klein 2000's ocean
floor imagery needs to be supplemented by the Scorpio I's cameras
so investigators can bring the right pieces to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the pieces are identified on the ocean floor, the Scorpio I
is able to lift up to 250 pounds on its own, or can place a large
basket on the ocean bed and sweep debris into it, as if it were a
broom, and the basket a dustpan.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the wreckage presents its own problem: because of
the water pressure and the lack of any light, divers can only work
for short times on the wreck without needing to rest. So the
Scorpio I must come down and put straps under large pieces of the
wreck, so they can be lifted out of the water by the Kellie
Chouest's two cranes.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't happened, yet. The NTSB and Navy are still
planning, and while the search area hasn't been defined exactly,
yet, every time a ship passes over the area and films the seabed or
paints a sonar image, the area becomes more defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the NTSB tells us what to do, we'll bring up everything
they ask us to,'' Leidig said. ``We'll do what they ask us to.
Parts of the plane, eventually, the victims.''

TIGER OUTSHINES FILM STARS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The hottest celebrity playing in this weekend's
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf tournament hasn't been an ``Am''
since his Nike-commercial debut, when he proclaimed to the world
``I Am Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, he's only gotten bigger since.
</P>
<P>
   So while Saturday's traditional TV day to gawk at club-carrying
Kevin Costner might be upstaged by an even bigger story _ Tiger's
pursuit of six PGA Tour wins in a row it really wouldn't be
improper for CBS' cameras to stay fixed on the Southern
California-native megastar and his entourage for every possible
second of scenic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Tin Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime Tiger plays in a tournament, he's part of the story,''
said CBS golf coordinating producer Lance Barrow. ``This tournament
is different in that Saturday all the celebrities come out and
people want to see Clint Eastwood and Andy Garcia and Kevin
Costner. It's always one of our highest-rated shows of the year.
But Sunday it really becomes a professional tournament. We won't
let him get in the way Saturday, but you can't help but watch Tiger
if he's anywhere close.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS golf analyst Gary McCord, who with partner David Feherty
started his late-night 15-minute highlight package/comedy routine
and continues it tonight at 12:35 a.m., has boldly gone on the
record as saying Woods will not break Byron Nelson's streak of 11
tour wins in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going with the odds, based on the pure fact no one
can win six in a row under these conditions and against these
players today,'' said McCord, who last year joined the PGA Senior
Tour and surprised many with a couple of victories, including the
Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Feherty, who usually has the on-course assignment of following
Woods, says if anyone can catch 11 in a row or more, it's Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for 25 years as a pro at the highest level and I can
honestly tell you there are some situations he finds himself that
there isn't another human on the planet who can do what he's
capable of doing,'' said Feherty. ``He's so far ahead of the rest
of the field. ... It's like you're watching a different species.''
</P>
<P>
   An issue of trust: Having reached the punitive phase in John
Rocker's slams-across-America case _ he has the players' union
appealing the one-month suspension and $20,000 fine handed down by
from Major League Baseball on Monday we'd like to take a moment to
assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The damage, that is, on the media's side.
</P>
<P>
   If you can detour past what the Atlanta Braves reliever said,
some could interpret this as another shameful hit-and-run,
media-created event.
</P>
<P>
   Since the article by baseball beat reporter Jeff Pearlman ran in
the Dec.27 Sports Illustrated, sports-talk radio hosts and TV
commentators have had no problem counter-attacking Rocker. But
there hasn't been much revealed about the other side of the story.
Pearlman has done only a couple of radio interviews, none out here,
and has since stopped because he feels the story stands on its own
and he didn't want to get in the way of it, said an SI spokesman.
That's unfortunate, because it leaves more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said what he said about minorities, homosexuals and
whatever else was flying through his mind during a car ride with
the reporter. Assuming it was all on the record _ Rocker never said
it wasn't or retracted what was printed, only apologized for it _
then, sure, it was probably fair game to include in the story. And
you have to assume that since the reporter spent six or seven hours
with Rocker, it was a fair representation of Rocker's personality,
not something taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the interview take place.
This wasn't Ted Koppel with Al Campanis, giving him second and
third chances to clarify or recant his statements.
</P>
<P>
   What this might lead to, however, is print journalists needing
to explain the process to the skeptical readers, to stop hiding
behind these walls that tend to separate rather than protect.

   Until that perception is clarified, readers are likely to
continue a love/hate relationship with the media, and athletes will
rely more on using their Web sites to filter their own words. And
interviews with athletes who feel there's even greater potential of
being set up won't happen. &QL;

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
__The Three Tenors of College Basketball _ Dick Enberg with Billy
Packer and Al McGuire _ might tour only once this year, namely
Saturday for CBS' coverage of the UConn-Michigan State game.
McGuire, 71, has even said this will be his last year of
broadcasting. So sports-media nostalgia buffs best have the tape
machine working. Said Enberg of the game he did two weeks ago with
Packer for his CBS debut: ``I felt I was stumbling around because
we didn't know the timing of each other. It was like driving an old
pickup and we found all the old gears. Now, how are we going to
make up 19, 20 years in a two-hour telecast? We won't let an encore
bow to get in the way of the game, though. But you know within 10
minutes, Al and Billy will get into some disagreement because when
Al says `black,' Billy says `white.' Our reportage won't be to soft
violin music.' '' &QL; 
__Cincinnati Reds play-by-play man Marty Brenneman was named
recipient of the Ford Frick Award and will be inducted into
Baseball's Hall of Fame. &QL; 
Dick Vermeil, a guest tonight with Jay Leno, is such an obvious
choice for ABC to add to the ``Monday Night Football'' booth that
they might as well go ahead and announce it. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__The history of sportscasting in a one-hour show? The documentary
called ``The Sportscasters: Behind the Mike,'' which debuts Monday
on The History Channel, manages to include interviews with all the
top names in the business. But it's only nicking the surface with
that kind of self-imposed time restriction. Maybe it's the way to
package for the masses today. But maybe this Frank Deford-narrated
piece that glosses over and includes Vin Scully and Al Michaels
should inspire someone to do a three- or four-part series on the
subject. Let it breathe, give it some depth. &QL; 
__Trying to take a well-worn topic _ gambling on the Super Bowl _
and give it a fresh spin is the purpose of today's ``Outside the
Lines Presented by AT&AMP;T'' on ESPN. And, yes, that's the official
name of the show now. So you know there won't be any commercial
influence or any attempt to show how a simple phone line can be
used to place bets. Next up: Fox Sports Net's ``Goin' Deep Dish
Pizza from Little Caesars'' show.

   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Neither rain nor wind nor the bogeyman's
bite can make Tiger Woods go away, although the first two problems
did keep him and everybody else from making their appointed rounds
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The rain came Thursday at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
So did the wind, which was more responsible than the wet stuff for
stopping play on the Monterey Peninsula before most players had
completed nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods wasn't in the lead during the tournament's infancy. But he
wasn't far from it. He survived three early bogeys to get back to
even-par after 10 holes at Poppy Hills Golf Club, four strokes
behind David Duval and three behind Vijay Singh, both also playing
at Poppy in the tournament, which is spread over three courses in
the Del Monte Forest and on the rocky points along the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It was the exposed midsection of Pebble Beach Golf Links that
led tournament organizers to stop play at 11:27 a.m. PST. Players
were buffeted by a consistent 40-mph wind that had gusts to 50 mph,
according to tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will resume today at 10 a.m. PST, with players
continuing where they picked up on Thursday. All players completed
at least one hole, but nobody made it past more than 12.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament then will proceed with 18 holes each day,
concluding with the final round Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Which means we will find out if Woods is as tough on Mondays as
he has been on Sundays for the past six months. He's going for his
sixth win in a row, something that hasn't been done since Ben Hogan
ran off six straight in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Though there wasn't enough golf played Thursday for any trends
to develop, Woods is solidly in the hunt after making three birdies
in six holes before play was called.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger story, however, was the revelation that Monterey
Peninsula's weathermen have even tougher duty than Houston
meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of seven hours, Pebble Beach showed a rainbow of
emotions. At 9 a.m., the weather was sunny and breezy. Two hours
later, the rain had started and the wind had kicked up to 30 mph.
Moments later, it was whipping hard enough to blow the pants legs
off of fans and golfers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The rain pelted the coast for several hours. But by
midafternoon, there wasn't a breath of wind and the sun had
returned.
</P>
<P>
   However, by that time the damage had been done. The drenched
greens had small lakes in their low spots, and the bunkers were a
mess. There was no chance of playing any golf after the storm blew
through. Tournament officials postponed play at 2:10 p.m. and made
the decision for a Monday finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing at 40 mph when we suspended play,'' said
Mark Russell, a tournament director for the PGA Tour. ``At that
point, out there on parts of Pebble Beach, you had trouble just
standing, much less marking your ball. We had several rulings that
were asked for by players. When they were marking their ball, once
they replaced it, it would blow totally off the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems on the greens were numerous. Houston's Steve Elkington
hit his tee shot on the 106-yard par-3 seventh at Pebble Beach onto
the back of the green. But the postage-stamp hole plays dead into
the wind, and Elkington's ball came to a temporary stop, then was
pushed by the wind off the front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Stewart Cink had his ball blow from one side of the
fourth green to the other after it had come to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those days that everybody talks about for the
rest of their careers,'' said Lee Janzen, who was even-par after
five holes at Pebble Beach. ``No. 7 must have been a 5-iron from
100 yards downhill. The group in front of us, Stewart Cink and
Justin Leonard, both their balls had stopped on the green on No. 4,
and while they were walking to the green, a gust picked up and the
balls started rolling toward the front. Both balls were still
rolling as they got to the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories such as these are rare on the PGA Tour. But
weather problems have too often become the story of the AT&AMP;T
Pro-Am. The tournament was rained out completely in 1996, and in
the past two years it has been shortened to 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the weather was beautiful Tuesday and Wednesday,
tournament organizers were prepared for the worst this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had pin placements on high parts of the greens in most
cases, expecting some rain,'' Janzen said. ``But when you do that,
the wind gets to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said there was no thought given to trying to finish the
first round and play the second round today, because players would
have to change courses after they complete round one. In addition,
grounds crews have to make the entire courses playable at the start
since players are scattered throughout, rather than starting on No.
1 or No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions Thursday were as brutal as anybody could recall
on Pebble Beach. But in 1990, when Cypress Point still was in the
playing rotation, the wind was so stiff on the 17th hole, Ed
Dougherty needed 11 shots to get his ball into the hole after
reaching the green in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the show will go on this week, even though it
means going to Monday.

HEALTH OFFICIALS FINE HOSPITAL WHERE DOCTOR CARVED PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The State Department of Health fined Beth Israel
Medical Center $14,000 Thursday and ordered it to improve its
oversight of doctors after an inquiry into a hospital obstetrician
who carved his initials into a patient's belly.
</P>
<P>
   The seven citations issued against Beth Israel, each carrying
the maximum fine of $2,000, are one of the harshest rebukes against
a New York hospital in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the hospital failed to file proper reports with
the state after the carving and did not sufficiently monitor the
doctor, Allan Zarkin, despite earlier complaints by hospital
workers about the doctor's erratic behavior, which included pulling
on the arms of newborn infants.
</P>
<P>
   The citations conclude a state investigation into the events of
Sept. 7, when Zarkin, 61, sliced his initials into the patient, Dr.
Liana Gedz, after delivering her first child via Caesarean section.
Lawyers for Zarkin, whose license was revoked Thursday, have
defended him by saying that he has a frontal lobe dementia similar
to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The state penalty is the second in two years citing major flaws
in Beth Israel's administration and, in particular, its obstetrics
and gynecology department. State officials said that department,
which was faulted two years ago for its role in a 1997 patient
death, needs major improvements and tighter oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the state is requiring that Beth Israel hire
an independent consultant to come up with recommendations, within
two months, on how to improve the department, particularly in
quality control and employee screening. The consultant must also
suggest hospitalwide improvements in those two areas within three
months. The hospital must make all changes within a month of
receiving the reports, pending approval by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many moments in the system where this could have
been halted, and something somewhere broke,'' said Dr. Antonia C.
Novello, the state health commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Health Department noted that administrators
had failed to properly document several complaints by nurses and
doctors regarding Zarkin's behavior in the year before the carving.
The report detailed complaints that Zarkin was screaming at workers
and ``pulling and yanking on newborn infants' arms after
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the hospital failed to report the carving incident
to the Health Department's hospital oversight division, even though
a report is required in such cases. The state report also faulted
the hospital's record-keeping, noting that the plastic surgeon
examining Gedz after her operation failed to even mention the
carving in his files.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said in a written statement that the hospital
had already ``implemented changes of procedure'' to ``strengthen
the monitoring of physician activities, and ensure consistent
adherence to the spirit as well as the letter of all reporting
requirements.''

EDITORIAL: FINALLY, AN OPEN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without begrudging how long it has taken Govs. George Pataki and
George W. Bush to recognize the need for an open presidential
primary in New York, it is time to celebrate the news that the
state's March 7 vote is now likely to be open to all major national
contenders. Bush, after being trounced by Sen. John McCain in New
Hampshire this week, has finally said the right thing _ that it is
time ``to put him (McCain) on the ballot.'' Pataki did much the
same, saying, ``I believe that John McCain should be on the
ballot.'' His communications director, Zenia Mucha, added that the
New York governor will ``take appropriate steps'' to make certain
that McCain is on all the ballots around the state.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's most difficult rules for running in a
presidential primary, New York state has presented the country with
an antiquated display of machine politics in recent weeks, as
swarms of ward-style lawyers tripped over each other to bump the
opposition off the ballots. By nitpicking every signature on
candidates' petitions and challenging each other in court, New
York's Republicans have presented a national audience with an
alarmingly anti-democratic spectacle. It has not been a good move
for Pataki, who has shown his own interest in stepping onto the
national stage. Still, he has time to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in this sticky process, Federal District Court
Judge Edward Korman is still mulling over ways to remedy this
unconstitutional mess. For now, Steve Forbes is the only Republican
on ballots statewide. Despite Bush's support from Pataki and other
key Republicans, his petitions have been invalidated in one
congressional district. McCain's name is missing in almost a dozen
congressional districts. Bush and Pataki Thursday made clear they
would not appeal a decision by Korman to restore McCain's name in
most areas of the state. They should also decline to challenge any
new signatures if Korman gives candidates more time to comply with
the rules. Any settlement of the federal case should make it clear
this law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than letting a federal court bring democracy to New
York, Pataki should take the initiative by pressing for an
immediate change in the law. All the Republican leaders and lawyers
who have been working feverishly to rig the election for Bush
should turn their attention to figuring out a quick legislative
remedy that insures that all nationally recognized candidates
appear on all ballots in all 31 congressional districts in the
state. It is time to end the comparisons to Iran or the old Soviet
Union once and for all. Pataki, Joseph Bruno, the State Senate
majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, should
simply replace this national embarrassment with a system that
allows New York voters, not party leaders, to choose presidential
candidates. &QL;

<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Two of the world's leading companies in
wireless communications agreed Thursday to merge in a $183 billion
deal, the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning end to the kind of hostile takeover attempt once
considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany. The
all-stock transaction easily shattered the previous record for a
takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the takeover will vastly expand the geographic
reach of Vodafone, which already is the world's biggest wireless
telephone company, giving it dominance in the European market and a
global base of more than 50 million customers. Vodafone already has
a major presence in the United States and two dozen countries in
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal is perhaps more important as a
watershed in European corporate behavior and the export to Europe
of bare-knuckled takeover tactics first honed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a European company carried off a hostile
takeover on such an audacious scale: cross-border, cross-cultural
and paid for with shares in a company that was almost unknown
outside of Britain 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann
still need to be approved by the German conglomerate's supervisory
board _ the equivalent of a board of directors. It is expected to
ratify the agreement at a meeting scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came just four days before the expiration of Vodafone's
takeover offer to holders of Mannesmann stock, which Mannesmann's
management had called unwanted, unfriendly and too low.
</P>
<P>
   And although it was nominally called a ``friendly'' merger
Thursday, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann, only
capitulated when it became obvious that a majority of his
shareholders were about to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann,
a great company, would be better together with Vodafone Airtouch,''
Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, told reporters in
Duesseldorf, where he has spent the last two days negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what the combined company would be called.
But the deal would bring together two businesses with vastly
different backgrounds. Mannesmann, founded more than a century ago
as a maker of steel pipe, has evolved into technology-driven leader
that specializes in communications. Vodafone, by contrast, was born
18 years ago as Britain's first cellular phone company, and that
has been its only business ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Vodafone and Mannesmann would have 42.4 million
subscribers. NTT DoCoMo of Japan is a distant No. 2 with 26.7
million, and Telecom Italia No. 3 with 17.8 million, according to
estimates by the Lehman Brothers investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who had been voluble in his opposition to Vodafone's
takeover designs and had been expected to resign, said he would
continue to work for the combined company, but he will be a clear
subordindate to Gent. Esser will become a non-exective chairman and
keep a seat on the company's board. Mannesmann will get an
additional four seats on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shareholders will control a 49.5 percent share of the
combined company and get 58.96 Vodafone shares for each Mannesmann
share they own. Based on Vodafone's closing share price Wednesday
of 3.855 pounds or $6.21, the day before word of the deal got out,
the total value is about $366.14 per share or $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone shares hold their value, the agreement will be a
huge bonanza for shareholders in Mannesmann, which is the most
widely owned foreign stock in the United States. The takeover price
for Mannesmann shares is more than double what they cost before the
takeover battle began.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has to be reviewed and approved by the European
Commission, which is expected to issue a preliminary decision on
Feb. 17. But the deal is a bitter defeat for Esser, who had
passionately fought to preserve his company's independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Esser insisted Thursday night that the situation was the best
possible outcome. ``It's not a change of opinion,'' he told
reporters. But the discomfort was evident between Esser and Gent
when the two men presented their agreement Thursday night. Despite
a show of collegiality, they could barely bring themselves to shake
hands for more than a moment. After a bit of prodding by
photographers, they were cajoled into shaking hands again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Esser's public nonchalance, the takeover is also a shock
to Mannesmann, an old-line industrial conglomerate that had
brilliantly transformed itself into the biggest provider of
wireless communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann owns national networks in Germany, Italy and Britain,
while Vodafone owns Britain's second-largest network and scores of
other stakes around Europe and on other continents.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent outmaneuvered Esser on the chessboard of Europe's
wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely
valuable national wireless licenses in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed
to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies _ Vivendi SA of
France. That move derailed Esser's desperate attempt to hammer out
a merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a
major French network and greatly strengthened his position with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie
Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal
convinced wavering shareholders that Esser had lost the upper hand,
even with his allies, and they immediately began betting on a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies began to work in earnest together
at the start of the week. The companies reached a basic agreement
in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Negotiations continued for
most of Thursday until the announcement was made late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's
three biggest markets _ Britain, Germany and Italy _ along with a
45 percent stake in the biggest U.S. network and holdings in more
than 30 other countries, from Sweden and Poland to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of Mannesmann makes history on several fronts
besides its size.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has seen a surge of hostile takeovers, the only
successful ones only have been between competitors within a single
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Mannesmann marked one of the first real battles
for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants
recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption
of a single currency in eleven countries made it crucial to
overcome national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also marked one of the first cases in which national
political leaders did not try to interfere in order to protect an
important domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated
takeover battle last year, the battle was largely sanctioned and
guided by the French Ministry of Finance, which wanted to
consolidate the nation's banking industry and keep out foreign
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true when Totalfina SA, the French-Belgian oil
company, launched a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine
SA. Likewise, Italian political leaders actively opposed the
proposed telephone merger between Deutsche Telekom of Germany and
Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Italy's Olivetti SPA.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reaction was entirely different. Despite the
angry rhetoric from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about the
dangers of hostile takeovers, the German government stayed out of
the fight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That reflected a widespread view among German business
executives that it was far more dangerous to interfere with a
legitimate if hostile bid and jeopardize the ability of German
companies like DaimlerChrysler to buy up foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser and Gent waged their battle almost entirely
through direct appeals to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market view was that following the deal with Vivendi there
really weren't any more ways that Mannesmann could present a better
strategy,'' Andrew Moffat, telecommunications analyst at the Dutch
bank ABN Amro said. ``A friendly deal is what both sets of
shareholders were aggressively trying to push through.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a power struggle between two companies that
both wanted to command the European market. It began in January
1999 when Vodafone acquired AirTouch of the United States, a long
time minority partner in all of Mannesmann's communication
ventures. But the conflict deepened when Mannesmann invaded
Vodafone's home territory by buying Orange, Britain's third largest
mobile phone network for $33 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Mannesmann's direct attack in Britain, Gent decided
that Vodafone could not remain a real player unless it took over
its partner-turned-rival.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies employed armies of investment bankers to advise
them. Vodafone's lead adviser was Goldman Sachs which devoted more
than 100 people to the cause and will earn about $75 million,
analysts estimate. Vodafone is also advised by Warburg Dillon Read,
which is expected to take home $50 million. It is unclear how much
Mannesmann's advisers stand to earn.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's advisers are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Deutsche Bank AG. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

 &HT;    Former Texas A&AMP;M president in 1990 urged reduction of bonfire's
size, alcohol limits
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A former president of Texas A&AMP;M University told
an A&AMP;M regent in 1990 that he supported reducing the size of the
Aggie bonfire and limiting alcohol consumption, new documents
released Thursday say.
</P>
<P>
   Former President William Mobley _ who went on to become A&AMP;M
System chancellor _ wrote in a May 22, 1990, memo to former regent
Ross D. Margraves Jr. that he concurred with a faculty and staff
recommendation that the size of the stack be reduced from 55 to 44
feet and that alcohol be limited.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that officials were concerned about alcohol
consumption during the bonfire's lighting. What is clear is that
university officials in later years worked to limit alcohol
consumption during both lighting and construction.
</P>
<P>
   However, documents suggest that the size of the stack in some
years actually grew beyond its allowable height, including last
year. At the time of the deadly Nov. 18 collapse, the bonfire was
about 60 feet tall and on its way toward topping out near 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that on at least three occasions more than a
decade before the fatal collapse, the university was urged to
reduce the height of the stack.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, university officials said reducing the size would
draw ``negative reaction'' from students. Another time _ when
Mobley weighed in _ the university instead moved the bonfire and
considered the safety concerns related to its size moot.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the university responded the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley was reacting to a report issued in 1990 by a committee
that was considering moving the bonfire because of complaints by
university neighbors. The committee looking at this question also
considered safety, environmental and even academic issues, the
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reducing the size of Bonfire, fewer trees would need to be
cut and burned, less student time would be required for its
construction, and risks both of injury during construction and
property damage during burning would be reduced,'' the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mobley's support, the committee's suggestion to reduce
the bonfire's size was not implemented, former and current faculty
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking at it, it wasn't obvious to me that (the
recommendation) was being followed,'' said Richard Shumway, a
former A&AMP;M faculty member who helped write the report and is now at
Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kibler, A&AMP;M associate vice president for student affairs,
said it's likely the recommendation became moot after the bonfire
stack was moved in 1992. The new Polo Field location _ where the
bonfire is now built _ was not as close to neighborhoods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Robert H. Stiteler, then the university's safety and
health officer, also suggested that the height be reduced,
documents released earlier show.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Stiteler, Kibler wrote that he had ``serious
concerns about such a drastic reduction in the size of Bonfire''
and that it would ``almost assuredly result in extremely negative
reaction and protest from a significant portion of the student body
...''
</P>
<P>
   A third recommendation to reduce the height came in 1989 from
James Reynolds, then the Memorial Student Center Director.

 &HT;    Beach music is love, living for Hardy
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ He grew up shaggin' to music by the Four
Tops, the Isley Brothers and The Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed over the last 35 years. Songs like ``Can't
Help Myself,'' ``This Old Heart of Mine'' and ``My Girl'' still get
his feet dancing and his arms swinging. His love for beach music
goes deep. So deep, that he has made a living sharing the songs
with much of eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hardy, 53, has been in the radio business since 1971. His
show, ``Steve Hardy's Original Beach Party,'' is a request show
playing beach music and rhythm and blues. The show airs from 5 to
10 p.m. Sundays on WNCT-FM (Oldies 107.9). Tens of thousands of
listeners join him, dedicating songs to loved ones or requesting
songs for special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meeting new people and making new friends that make my
job worthwhile,'' said Hardy, during a telephone interview from his
home in Greene County. ``I love the personal, one-on-one contact. I
love being able to promote my listeners and their feelings on the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is a radio personality, Hardy spends much of his
time in the public eye. When he has not on the air, he is out
promoting his show. He is his own advertising agent. He calls
clients and goes door-to-door visiting customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy doesn't have a degree in communications. He attended a
community college, but never graduated. Instead, he joined the Air
Force. Four years later, he got a job at a radio station in
Farmville. After he worked behind the scenes for two days, the
station's producer put him on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Success didn't come right away. It took years before Hardy's
name became a household name in many homes in eastern North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   When he thinks about his life, he smiles. He feels fortunate he
has been able to make a living doing what he loves. It is something
he hoped for, but never expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music has been my livelihood and my life,'' Hardy said. ``I
feel fortunate and blessed that something like this has gone on
this good for so long. I can only hope it lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   On the radio for 25 years, Hardy's program is the longest
running radio beach show.
</P>
<P>
   As a spin-off from the radio show, Hardy takes his music on the
road and plays at private parties and nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hardy's accomplishments include being voted a member of
the Beach Music Hall of Fame, being voted disc jockey of the year
twice at beach music's Cammy Awards and being a recipient of the
Billy Scott Lifetime Achievement Award at the Cammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy also lends his hand to promote a variety of charities,
including the American Cancer Society and a charity golf tournament
for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation which bears his name. The event
has special meaning to Hardy; his nephew suffers from cystic
fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy doesn't know where time will take him. He'd like to stay
in the music business for as long as he can. But if he were to
explore another medium, he says it would have to be newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chance I can get of interacting with others I'll take,''
Hardy said. ``With newspapers, just like music, you have the
opportunity to reach so many people and greatly impact their
lives.''

NO WARNING BY POLICE TO DIALLO, WITNESS SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE FRITSCH and AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A woman who lived across the street from Amadou
Diallo in the Bronx testified Thursday that she saw four white men
in casual clothes approach Diallo's building early last Feb. 4,
and, moments later, heard a volley of rapid gunfire. She did not,
she said, hear the men shout out any warning.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Debbie Rivera, was the first witness at the trial of
four police officers charged with Diallo's murder who was near the
scene at the time of the shooting. But on cross-examination,
defense lawyers suggested that she had been too far away to hear
voices, and pointed out apparent inconsistencies and omissions in
her several statements to the police since the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional day for Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, who wept
as her son's roommate choked up and cried on the witness stand when
Diallo's photo ID card was flashed on a courtroom screen. The
roommate, Momodou Kujabi, had fallen asleep just before Diallo was
shot to death in the lobby of their apartment building. Kujabi was
awakened by the police banging on the door and was then taken to
identify the body.
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, the testimony of a police supervisor they
called to the witness stand raised a problem that they will face
throughout their case: the police witnesses can also be good
defense witnesses. On cross-examination, the supervisor, Lt. Kevin
Cantwell, said the four were dazed and unable to speak when he
arrived on the scene. When he finished testifying for the
prosecution, he was made a defense witness and continued
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's testimony was intended, in part, to shore up the
prosecution's contention that the officers did not identify
themselves to Diallo or shout any warnings before they began
shooting. He was hit by 19 of 41 shots fired at him as he stood,
unarmed, in the vestibule of his building at 1157 Wheeler Ave. in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy _ acknowledge firing the shots but said they thought
Diallo was carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said she heard a car engine sometime after midnight and,
because she was expecting her husband, went to a bedroom window in
their second-floor apartment to look for him. Instead, she saw four
white men in casual clothes, one with a hat, standing near a
double-parked maroon car. She returned to the living room, she
said, and a short time later heard two bursts of rapid gunfire
separated by a pause of not more than a second, according to her
re-creation of the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she said, she ran back into the bedroom to move her two
sleeping children and two sisters to safety in the living room.
When the shooting stopped, she said, she returned to the bedroom
window from which she had first seen the four men. The outside pane
of one of three double-hung windows in the room was open, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a man walking in the street, looking under the cars,''
she said. The man, in a T-shirt, jeans and dark jacket with a
police badge hanging in front, removed a baseball cap from his
head, threw it into the street and swore, she said. Then he stopped
and leaned against a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, defense lawyers pointed to inconsistencies
between Rivera's testimony Thursday and previous statements made to
investigators and under oath. She had told the grand jury, for
example, that the officer she saw out her window was ``shaking'';
Thursday, she denied that was the case.
</P>
<P>
   If one issue crucial to both sides is what orders the officers
did or did not give Diallo, the other is how much light there was
in the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Kujabi, Diallo's roommate, testified that all of the lights in
the vestibule and hallway were on when he came home and were still
on when he was led out of his apartment after the shooting.
Cantwell also said the light was on as he approached the vestibule
after the shooting.

ANOTHER VILLENEUVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIMOTHY HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rene Villeneuve has the racing name. After this
weekend's Rolex 24 at Daytona, otherwise known as the 24 hours of
Daytona, the Woodland Hills resident hopes to become part of the
champion Villeneuve auto racing family.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Villeneuve is a distant cousin to Formula One driver and
former CART series champion Jacques Villeneuve. He is also a cousin
of former Grand Prix driver Gilles Villeneuve, winner of the 1979
Grand Prix of Long Beach. And he credits Jacques Villeneuve's
uncle, whom Rene refers to as ``Big Jacques,'' as an inspirational
force behind his pursuing an auto racing career.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Canada and reared in Massachusetts, Rene grew up around
his racing cousins. But it wasn't until he was 10, while living in
France and after seeing the 1976 Grand Prix of Monaco with a
fast-talking Frenchman who gave him a free ticket to the race, that
Rene Villeneuve made up his mind to become a professional auto
racer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Villeneuve's father, Raymond, moved his family to La
Fontonne, France. Raymond Villeneuve was pursuing his master's
degree in French and was doing research toward finishing his
degree.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Rene Villeneuve's older brother, Robert, decided he
wanted to see the Grand Prix of Monaco, which was being run about
30 miles west of their hometown in France. The Villeneuves made the
trek to Monaco but were shocked to discover that tickets to the
race were selling for the equivalent of $50 apiece. Disappointed,
they watched practice from outside the race course. That is until a
fast-talking Frenchman approached 10-year-old Rene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stunned me. I couldn't understand what he was saying,''
Villeneuve said. His father explained that the man had tickets for
his family and one extra. He wanted to bring an impressionable
young race fan into the race. Rene's father agreed and Villeneuve
watched Niki Lauda win the 1976 Grand Prix of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``That inspired me to want to become a race-car driver,''
Villeneuve said. ``Unfortunately, we were not necessarily a family
of means. And it was unusual to pursue a dream. We went to college,
then got a job. It was really unusual for someone in my family to
do something different. But my parents are quietly proud. I'll
never forget my father's face. I've never seen him so proud (than)
after I finished my first race in Barber Saab at Del Mar. People
don't understand this is a difficult journey it's a difficult
journey just to get there in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the past 10 years driving in series such as
Barber Saab, Formula Ford 2000, Japanese Formula 3 and Speedvision
Cup, the 35-year-old Villeneuve has landed a spot in endurance
racing. It's been a long, steady road for him, but it's one he has
few regrets taking.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolex 24 at Daytona begins today and ends Sunday at Daytona
International Speedway. This will be Villeneuve's first 24 hours of
Daytona, but his racing teammates have plenty of experience. His
co-driver and team owner, Scott Watkins of Atlanta, has raced in
the 24 Hours of Daytona three times. His other racing teammates,
Daniel Urrutia and Gaston Aguirre of Argentina, are strangers to
Villeneuve. As of Wednesday, he had never met them. But he is
confident that his team will finish in the top five in the Grand
Touring Over (GTO) class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very proven package,'' said Villeneuve, whose team
will be driving a Corvette with a C-5 body and NASCAR-spec motor
and transmission. ``We're not going to be equal in speed to the
other Corvette and Viper teams. We have to capitalize on our
reliability and minimize our time in the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rolex 24 at Daytona will be televised live on ESPN2. The
sports network will show the opening part of the race Saturday from
9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. (PST). Coverage will continue Sunday from 4 to
10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking records already: The NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Series might set a record before its season even gets started.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the opening race of the 2000 Southwest Series
season, 74 teams have registered to race in the Copper World
Classic at Phoenix International Raceway Sunday. That would tie a
record for the number of entrants in a Southwest Series race.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper World Classic will field 40 cars for the 50-lap race.
Race promoters are expecting the qualifying track record of 27.38
seconds at 131.748 mph set by Ron Hornaday Jr. in 1995 to fall.
</P>
<P>
   More racing at Irwindale: Irwindale Speedway has added six USAC
open wheel races _ five USAC Three-Quarter Midget races and one
Sprint Car race _ to its 2000 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the addition of events, ESPN announced it
will televise the 60th running of USAC's Turkey Night Grand Prix
Nov. 26 and the Oct. 14 USAC Silver Crown race from Irwindale
Speedway. The Turkey Night Grand Prix will be televised on ESPN2
the night of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The additional USAC Three-Quarter Midget races are set for April
22, May 13, July 8, Aug. 26 and Oct. 21. The additional Sprint Car
race will be Oct. 14
</P>
<P>
   Joy riding: Saugus High graduate Sean Woodside got to test a
NASCAR Busch Series car at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Tuesday
after driver Shane Hall broke his ankle in an accident during
practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, who will drive for Bob Farmer's REF Motorsports team
on the Southwest Series, tested Hall's car, but there is no
indication that the Winston West champion will be making the jump
to the Busch Series any time soon.

EDITORIAL: AN UNWELCOME AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that Austria's president has approved formation of a new
government that includes an intolerant far-right party, the rest of
the world has to decide how to respond. The appropriate reaction is
to cool relations with Austria, which is what the European Union,
the United States and Israel seem prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian people have a right to vote for whatever parties
they choose, and the 27 percent support won by the Freedom Party
made it the second-largest group in parliament. But Austria's
neighbors and friends are not obliged to conduct business as usual
with a government that will now include a xenophobic anti-immigrant
party whose leader has expressed admiration for Nazi labor policies
and praised veterans of the murderous Waffen SS.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that international criticism would fuel a
nationalist backlash in Austria, warnings from abroad already
appear to have done some good. President Thomas Klestil, through
his statements and delays in accepting the new coalition, made
clear his own view that including Haider's party in the government
is bad for Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Freedom Party, with its mainstream conservative
partner, issued a statement pledging devotion to tolerance and
human rights and proclaiming Austria's need to face up to its own
responsibility for Nazi-era crimes. The Freedom Party has made
insincere protestations of good intentions in the past and Haider's
retractions of his comments about Nazi Germany have been
unconvincing. But if he and his party now intend to be guided by
the principles of this statement, there are at least some grounds
for encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is rightly recalling its ambassador to signal its disgust
at Haider's equivocations over Holocaust crimes. Washington should
consider doing the same. Further steps should be based on the new
government's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's fellow members in the EU face a particularly difficult
challenge, since in the normal course of events top officials from
all member governments meet with each other all the time. But
European governments should be able to proceed with EU meetings
while minimizing direct government-to-government contacts with
Vienna and refusing to back Austrian candidates for international
positions. The European Union's founding treaty condemns racial and
ethnic discrimination and envisions measures to combat these evils,
which brought Europe so much suffering in the past. Austria's
partners can honor the treaty's principles by distancing themselves
from the new government in Vienna.

PBS REPORTED READY TO NAME CNN EXECUTIVE TO TOP POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service has chosen Pat Mitchell, a
longtime program executive for Turner Broadcasting, to take the job
of president, a PBS executive said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If elected at a meeting of the PBS board this weekend, Mitchell,
who is now the president of CNN Productions, will succeed Ervin
Duggan, who resigned in September. Her appointment is expected to
be announced officially at a news conference in Washington on
Monday afternoon. The executive who disclosed Mitchell's selection
spoke on condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who declined to comment on the prospective
appointment, would become the fourth president in PBS history.
Duggan served for five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   At Turner, Mitchell has held a range of positions, mostly in the
area of news and documentaries. She is perhaps best known for
supervising two of the biggest projects ever undertaken by CNN, the
24-hour documentary series ``Cold War'' and the recent 10-hour
series ``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turner quickly shut down Mitchell's most ambitious project,
a Women's Network cable channel. She was named as the executive in
charge of the channel last June but Turner scrapped the project
only weeks after it had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has an extensive background as a producer of
non-fiction television, and has also worked in front of the camera.
She has been a correspondent for the ``Today'' show on NBC, and an
arts correspondent for ``Sunday Morning'' on CBS. She was also host
of her own nationally syndicated talk show ``Woman to Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Duggan left PBS at the end of October amid reports that he had
been opposed by the managers of some PBS stations for pushing too
hard to concentrate power in the national organization. That
problem has been frequently mentioned as a source of conflict
between PBS and its member stations.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the acting president of PBS, John Swope, said at a
news conference in California that finding a new president who
would work to build a better relationship with station managers was
a chief priority.
</P>
<P>
   PBS has also been without a chief programmer since May when
Kathy Quattrone left the network to join Discovery Communications.
Tom Epstein, the vice president for communications at PBS, would
not comment on Mitchell's possible appointment but said that
selecting a new programming chief would probably be a priority for
the new president.

   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton begins her official U.S.
Senate campaign, her husband has presented Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
with two disagreeable alternatives: Criticize billions of dollars
in Clinton education and anti-crime initiatives that would help New
York City, or praise the husband of his political enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union speech last month and in his 2001
budget to be released next week, President Clinton is offering up a
cornucopia of popular programs aimed at bolstering Democrats, but
chiefly Al Gore and the first lady. Some are already bringing in
millions of dollars for new teachers and after-school programs in
Harlem and the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Others, like gun
control, are issues on which Giuliani, Clinton's opponent, has
aligned himself with the president in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in fact, the mayor infuriated his fellow Republicans by
flying with Mr. Clinton to Minnesota on Air Force One to campaign
for the president's anti-crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   But how times have changed. Giuliani's new approach is to be
more of a Republican, and embrace the proposals in principle, but
belittle them in practice. He also suggests that Congress is
unlikely to pass much of what the president wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you an example,'' Giuliani said at a news briefing
this week. ``The president offered a billion dollars more for the
Head Start program. New York City's school budget in a given year
is $11 billion. The amount of money involved in those programs
would have very little significance for a city the size of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Such programs ``sound good,'' the mayor added, ``but nobody
should have the false illusion that this is a substantial amount of
money when it gets translated into New York City with a million
schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, which administers Head Start, said he did not
understand why the Head Start money the federal government was
sending to New York City was not considered substantial. For this
school year, he said, the city received $136 million for Head Start
preschool programs for 20,000 children aged 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not insubstantial to the lives of those
children and their families,'' Kharfen said. New York City, he
added, received the bulk of the $305 million in Head Start money
that went to New York state this year, and has one of the country's
largest Head Start programs. Clinton's proposal, which, if passed
by Congress, would be the largest expansion of Head Start in
history, calls for the state to receive $411 million in Head Start
money in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also dismissed Clinton's proposal to spend $1 billion
in 2001 to hire new teachers to reduce class size. ``The State of
the Union in previous years has offered lots of money, and then by
the time you get to the budget, that money isn't there, or it's
one-tenth of what it was exaggerated to be,'' Giuliani said. ``So
we're going to have to wait some months to find out are their
programs really there and can we access it?''
</P>
<P>
   This school year the city received $61.2 million in a Clinton
initiative to reduce class size, which allowed the Board of
Education to hire 800 new teachers. Along with a state program that
provided money for 800 more teachers, the board was able to create
900 new classes with an average size of 20 for children in
kindergarten through third grade, plus add a second teacher to
other classes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Mrs. Clinton's latest radio commercial,
broadcast statewide this week, echoes the same programs as the
president's State of the Union speech. The commercial intersperses
Mrs. Clinton's voice with the voices of two women, a man and a
child, and has them finishing one another's sentences about the
need for health insurance, after-school programs, money for school
construction and tax deductions for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should also be a $10,000 college tuition ... '' Mrs.
Clinton says in the ad, trailing off so that a woman's voice
immediately finishes her sentence with `` ... tax cut so we can
afford to send every child to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the president's speech called for a $10,000 tax
deduction for college tuition for families making up to $100,000
annually, and smaller deductions for families making up to $120,000
a year. The plan is similar to a bipartisan bill introduced last
year by Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. ``Whether Hillary was
running or not, the president would have proposed almost all of
this budget,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the Clinton tuition tax credit proposal ``does
help Hillary,'' particularly among suburban voters with college-age
children who make more money than allowed under an existing Clinton
tuition program. Under that program, families with less than
$80,000 in annual income can take up to $1,500 in tax credits for
the first two years of college, plus a $5,000 tax credit for
additional schooling or retraining.

   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. _ It is a real estate story that Franz Kafka
might have concocted.
</P>
<P>
   A homeowner here for four years makes all of her mortgage
payments on time, throwing in an extra $400 a month so she can own
her neat, brown-shingled town house outright even sooner. In turn,
the mortgage company distributes all property tax payments for her
from an escrow account, as it does for many clients. Those payments
are up to date _ except for one: a $58 straggler that somehow falls
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   And for $58, Mireille Leroy, a 38-year-old registered nurse and
mother who 17 years ago immigrated to the United States from Haiti
and 3 years ago became a U.S. citizen, loses a $114,000 house in a
foreclosure proceeding without knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy first learned of her transformation from homeowner to
tenant two Saturdays ago when a county sheriff showed up at her
door at 9 a.m. with an eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started laughing,'' she said in an interview Wednesday in
her living room. ``I thought it was a joke. I said, `It's a
mistake.' When I'm in shock, I laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Leroy, who lives with her 14-year-old daughter, was
no longer laughing, but rather trying to unravel the events that
led to the auction of her house last fall by Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are calls by the County Legislature to restore Leroy's
homeowner status and to change the way the county handles
foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an immigrant woman who came to the United States to
realize the American dream, and the Rockland Department of Finance
took it away from her without even a phone call,'' said Ryan S.
Karben, a county legislator who chairs the Tax Delinquency
Committee. ``It's appalling. It can happen to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite abundant finger-pointing from all corners, county and
town officials, as well as spokesmen for Leroy's bank, seem to
agree that her plight is highly unusual, the consequence of a
series of fateful missteps.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with the previous owner, who had a special tax
exemption for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   When Leroy bought the house, at 73 Sharon Drive, that exemption
was in effect for the remaining months of 1996. In 1997, the town
of Ramapo, which includes the village of Spring Valley, sent her a
bill for $58, which represented the portion of the exemption that
had not applied to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ramapo did not send a copy of the bill to her mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Oberman, Ramapo's tax receiver, said the town now
includes such bills in the ``general tax bill'' given to the
mortgage company because ``it was a problem for other people as
well.'' But, he added, ``No one lost their house over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy contended that she never received that bill, or anything
else in the mail from either the town or the county regarding the
delinquent $58 and the impending foreclosure proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, after a Ramapo reminder notice went unanswered, the
town turned the matter over to the county's Department of Finance,
which is responsible for collecting unpaid taxes. A spokeswoman for
the county, Susan Tolve, said the department sent ``at least four
notices'' to Leroy's address, and none were returned. The notices
are sent by first class mail, but are not certified, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rockland County began notifying the mortgage
company of the delinquent tax bill, which had increased to $270
with penalties. But in what is now a common practice, Leroy's
mortgage had already been sold twice to other lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Finance relies on records in the county
clerk's office to determine the name and address of the current
mortgage company, Tolve said, but that information had not been
updated by the new mortgage holder. As a result, the notices went
to the wrong company.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the delinquent bill never made it to Norwest Mortgage,
the final company to hold Leroy's loan. ``We consider her a stellar
customer,'' said Jon Ferchen, a company spokesman. ``She's made all
her payments on time. Norwest Mortgage was never notified of this
delinquency. Our records indicate all taxes are current on this
loan.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is investigating when it updated the county's
records, Ferchen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Leroy tossed the notices out or did not grasp their
import, county legislators say at the very least the county should
have called her or made a personal visit before auctioning her
house. ``This is what happens when a bureaucracy views people as
numbers on a list rather than human beings,'' Karben said.
</P>
<P>
   The county legislator is working on two fronts: to have the sale
declared void or to have the county buy the house back from the new
owner, a local real estate investor who agreed to halt the
eviction.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Finance Department insists that it abided by
the state statute governing foreclosures, and it noted that the
Legislature itself approved the sale of Leroy's house along with
other foreclosed properties. But the county, too, is exploring ways
to help Leroy, who says she has lost five pounds from stress since
her ordeal began. ``We followed the law,'' Tolve said, ``but that
doesn't mean we feel OK about the way this worked out.''

FORGET WHAT PSYCHICS SEE. AT LEAST THEY LISTEN.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the news broke recently that New York City, in its zeal to
place welfare recipients in jobs, was sending some of them to work
at a psychic hot line, the future was easy to divine. Embarrassed
city officials promptly called a halt, leaving some low-income New
Yorkers with reduced employment prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have accused some telephone psychic services of
padding phone charges and the like, but there's no evidence of such
complaints against the company that was involved with the city.
</P>
<P>
   So assume for now an honestly run psychic hot line _ one that,
if perhaps not truly psychic, is at least not thieving. The
question is, what exactly is wrong with placing workers in a
company like that?
</P>
<P>
   To an atheist, a job at a religious organization must seem no
less bizarre. And to someone who wants to get through dinner
someday without being assailed by telemarketers, the psychics, at
least, have the virtue of waiting for you to call them.
</P>
<P>
   But law-abiding telephone psychics are not merely harmless. They
perform a public service _ maybe even several _ for which customers
appear glad to pay.
</P>
<P>
   First, they provide entertainment, which is how their lawyers
make them describe what they do in their ads. Like dressing up as
Donald Duck at Disney World or selling lottery tickets at the
corner store, offering psychic consultations is a relatively
harmless means of conspiring with your customers in a brief escape
from the suffocating weight of the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, telephone psychics appear to serve as a
fiber optic lifeline of sorts for people nobody else wants to pay
attention to. They may even save lives now and then.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who worked as a telephone psychic for a Florida
company reported that many of her callers were poor people ``with
problems that not even a soap opera can list.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. We all need someone to tell our troubles to,
after all. Who knows how many suicides have been averted by calls
to sympathetic psychics?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy for the affluent to scoff at all this. For them,
high-priced therapists have shouldered aside clergy and even
friends in the brutal competition for market share in tears.
</P>
<P>
   If you are poor, however, it's a different story. Life is
harder, your troubles are probably worse, yet there is precious
little money to pay for a sympathetic ear.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford years on the couch with a devout Freudian,
maybe you dial a psychic help line instead. Are you thereby
receiving the services of a trained professional? Well, sort of.
Obviously, $4.99-a-minute psychics can't really see the future; if
they could, they'd be cleaning up as bond traders. Their real skill
is in listening to people's troubles, intuiting their situation and
helping them feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the recruitment flier from the city made no mention of
clairvoyance, but it did cite the need for ``a caring and
compassionate personality.'' Such personality types enjoy a
time-honored position in the marketplace _ think of bartenders, for
instance. And didn't Charles Revson say of the cosmetics industry
that it amounted to selling a jar of hope?
</P>
<P>
   The readiness of desperate people to reach out and touch a
dial-a-seer suggests a market demand that can't be made to vanish
simply by eliminating psychics.
</P>
<P>
   The poor, in fact, must make do in a number of analogous ways
that are equally frowned upon by the well-intentioned affluent.
They pay high interest rates on loans, for example, to unofficial
credit sources, because no one else will lend them money; critics
call this usury. Often, it's against the law, but borrowers in
desperate need are undeterred by a lender's obvious dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while prosperous types take advantage of the bulk
discounts at warehouse clubs, there's usually a store in the
poorest neighborhoods selling cigarettes one at a time, just as
telephone psychics dispense comfort by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   The psychics are criticized for trying to stretch out each call
and pump up the bill, but therapists with doctoral degrees charge
by the clock, too _ for a 50-minute ``hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe instead of shutting down the welfare-to-psychic pipeline,
public officials ought to order up some research on whether
psychics and therapists, given the same constraints, achieve
measurably different outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   The results may save health insurers a lot of money. &QL;

AD COLUMN: A NEW NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST SMOKING GENERATES
DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Del.)  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is intended as the largest single national anti-smoking
initiative starts Friday amid continuing debate over some
commercials that are to be part of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is sponsored by the American Legacy Foundation in
Washington, which was financed by the recent $206 billion
settlement reached by 46 state attorneys general and the tobacco
industry. The advertising, marketing and public relations campaign
_ developed by teen-agers in partnership with Madison Avenue
professionals _ is meant to ``unsell'' cigarette smoking to young
people ages 12 to 17 by countering the tactics the tobacco makers
have long used to peddle their best-selling brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capacity to create a classic social marketing
program that will reduce the prevalence of youth tobacco use,''
Cheryl Healton, president and chief executive of the foundation,
said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``I'm incredibly confident
the ads, in combination with other work of the foundation, will
achieve our primary goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial element of the initiative, which will have a
first-year budget of about $185 million, is a Web site that is
expected to go up Friday at www.thetruth.com. ``Truth'' is the
theme of the campaign, with the word presented as if it was the
name of a product being pitched to counteract the effect of
cigarette advertising on teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are launching a brand, and the brand has a name, and the
name is `Truth,''' said Healton, who is also a professor of public
health at Columbia University. The concept is based on a campaign
produced in 1997 for the Florida Department of Public Health by
Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky in Miami. That agency is one of nine in a
consortium that is creating the national initiative; the agencies
were selected in September after a long review process.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the introduction of the campaign is scheduled
to take place on Monday, when a commercial is planned to run on TV.
Six networks have agreed to accept at least one commercial from the
campaign, Healton said, adding that it was still being decided
which commercial would be the first to run on which network.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has had some difficulty in gaining acceptance for
its spots from the three largest broadcast TV networks _ ABC, CBS
and NBC _ which initially rejected concepts submitted for approval
in the form of story boards by Crispin Porter and by Arnold
Communications in Boston, a unit of Snyder Communications that is
also a member of the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic our advertising will clear the
networks,'' Healton said. ``It's my understanding from the people
we're working with that what we're going through with the networks
is the same process of negotiations that others go through.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek reported that
the networks had objected to the commercial proposals for
content-related reasons. There were concerns, for example, that one
spot that showed a teen-ager actually smoking would glamorize what
it was seeking to disparage.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot used a name for an imaginary product ``that sounded
too much like Clorox,'' Healton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Kaino, a spokeswoman for NBC, which is part of General
Electric Co., said one commercial was accepted after the proposed
script was revised. Healton said it would appear during an NBC
Sports program with a predominantly teen-age viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Dana McClintock, a spokesman for CBS, owned by CBS Corp., said
the foundation's commercials ``continue to remain under review.''
Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, part of Walt Disney Co., said
the network's policy opposed the public discussion of business
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The other networks listed by Healton as agreeing to run at least
one commercial are youth-focused; they include Fox Broadcasting
Co., part of News Corp. That emphasis is no accident because of the
campaign's intended audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're helping with marketing strategies, what kinds of shows
the commercials should be in, what kinds of shows should be
avoided,'' said Jason Chase of Dover, Del., a 17-year-old high
school senior who is among the teen-agers working on developing the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep everything at a teen's perspective, in a
teen's voice,'' he added, ``because teens understand how to speak
to other teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Delaware, I'm the chair of a group called the Delaware
Kick Butts Generation,'' Chase said, ``and a lot of time we hear
people call us `window dressing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the legacy foundation and the Truth campaign, we are
the ones calling the shots. We talk directly to the agency people,
give them ideas, get back story boards. I've seen story boards
tossed if kids didn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The other agencies in the consortium include Bromley
Communications in San Antonio, part of BDM, for youth marketing and
ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers; Burrell Communications
Group in Chicago, which is 49 percent owned by Publicis S.A., for
youth marketing and ads aimed at blacks; and Porter Novelli in
Washington, a unit of the Omnicom Group, for public relations and
social marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will also include print ads, radio commercials, a
youth meeting in Seattle in June and a ``Truth truck tour'' that
will travel across the country, concluding at the World Tobacco
Conference in Chicago in August. The initiative, which is to
supplement anti-smoking campaigns at the state level, is scheduled
to be financed for $1.5 billion through 2004.

 ON THE DEFENSIVE, BUSH TALKS TOUGH AS McCAIN RIDES HIGH ON (Inserts new graf between 1st and original 2nd grafs to emphasize
Bush's challenge to McCain's military image; expands original 12th
graf for more details on poll findings; in double byline, changes

 By FRANK BRUNI with MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMTER, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush struck an unusually combative
posture toward Sen. John McCain on Thursday, accusing him of
running misleading television commercials and insinuating that he
had not lived up to his own call for integrity in government.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also took aim at the appeal of McCain's
stature as a military hero. Bush held a rally here that featured
prominent veterans who were supporting him, and he said a
distinguished military career did not necessarily make someone the
best candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain, buoyed by a surge of fund-raising over the
Internet, moved through South Carolina with the air of a
front-runner, speaking to overflow crowds.
</P>
<P>
   At an oceanside rally in the retirement haven of Seabrook
Island, he touted his big victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Tuesday night we interfered with a coronation,'' McCain
said. ``They call it a bump in the road. My friends, it was a land
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush invoked McCain's crusade to diminish the influence of money
in Washington and said there were questions McCain needed to answer
about whether his own actions matched his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let him explain,'' Bush told reporters at a news
conference in Sumter, ``how receiving people before his committee
who then contribute to his campaign is consistent.'' Bush was
referring to the Arizona senator's chairmanship of the Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the commercial, which Bush characterized as an
unwarranted assertion that his proposal for a tax cut would
endanger Social Security, Bush began the news conference with a
sort of declaration of political war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start right now by saying that any ad that's
being run by John McCain that infers, implies or says that I don't
reserve money for Social Security is Washington-style politics,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this state are going to hear what the facts
are,'' Bush added. ``The people in South Carolina want an honest
campaign. They want an open campaign. They don't want
Washington-style politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was arguably the toughest talk that Bush had directed at
McCain and it reflected the defensive position in which Bush
suddenly found himself.
</P>
<P>
   Two polls taken in South Carolina since the New Hampshire
primary, in fact, showed a much closer race than had earlier been
predicted. A poll by Rasmussen Research showed Bush with 41 percent
of likely voters and Mr. McCain with 40 percent. Another, by Zogby
International, showed McCain actually leading Bush by 44 percent to
39 percent..
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Sumter on Thursday morning that preceded the news
conference, Bush went directly after McCain's claim, as a military
hero and former prisoner of war in North Vietnam, to the hearts and
votes of veterans. Veterans represent a disproportionately large
percentage of the population in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush surrounded himself on the steps of an old, picturesque
courthouse with crisply uniformed veterans whose medals glinted
brightly on their chests. They included six medal of honor
recipients, five retired generals and Adm. Thomas Moorer, a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Richard M.
Nixon. All were throwing their formal support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous American flag hovered over Bush. The six white
pillars flanking him were festooned in red, white and blue bunting.
A marching band played.
</P>
<P>
   One of the veterans, J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the
National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, which was
formally endorsing Bush, listed several recent pieces of
legislation involving Vietnam or the Persian Gulf war that he said
McCain had not supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the power to help these veterans,'' Burch said. ``He
came home, forgot us. But, fortunately, we found a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then delivered remarks that promised not only a stronger
military but also better treatment of the men and women who served
in it.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain dismissed the criticism and Bush's effort to appeal
to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every major veterans group in American has given me their
highest award,'' McCain said in an interview. ``Here's the
question: Have I fooled all these veterans, or is there a little
bit of foolishness going on?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategists laughed off the accusations, saying they
showed the Bush campaign's desperation. But eager to shoot down the
assertions before they stick, McCain aides released a list of his
veterans awards, as well as legislation that the senator has backed
dealing with Agent Orange and gulf war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush is talking about the military, our strength, it
shows chaos over there,'' Michael Murphy, a McCain strategist, said
in an interview. ``It would be like me saying, `Mike Tyson, I want
you in the ring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added, ``Next thing, we'll see Bush in his Air National
Guard uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain, disputed Bush's
accusation that McCain was running a commercial that unfairly
characterized Bush's position on Social Security. Opinsky noted
that while the spot maintains that McCain is the Republican
presidential candidate who would most strenuously safeguard Social
Security, it does not mention Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments about McCain's ethics were restrained, but
stronger than those he made last month, when McCain faced several
days of tough questions from reporters and extensive news coverage
about the relationship between people who had given money to his
campaign and those who had business before the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he said: ``I'm not making any allegations at all. I am
just suggesting that his claim that he is the outsider is a claim
I'm not going to let him get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush kept hammering at the point that he had given McCain too
wide a berth and too free a pass in New Hampshire and that McCain's
committee chairmanship reflected nearly two decades in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, in the course of the debate, I'm tagged with
being the Washington guy,'' Bush told reporters, attacking McCain's
descriptions of himself as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that he's the person who's been the Washington
insider,'' Bush said. ``He's the person who's a chairman of a
committee, and I'm the person who has a reform agenda.''

 PCs VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, EXPERTS SAY  
 (With SECRET-PAPERS)  
(lh) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless a home PC is placed in an isolation tank, computer
security experts say, it is vulnerable to a panoply of potential
intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it can be an extremely hazardous place to keep
anything remotely confidential, much less the classified documents
that John M. Deutch, the former director of central intelligence,
had stored on his unsecured home computers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more software people have on their computers, and the more
they are online, the more vulnerable they become to attack,'' said
Avi Rubin, an Internet security expert at AT&AMP;T Labs Research in
Florham Park, N.J. ``All the factors that contribute to increased
vulnerability are becoming more and more common.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, general awareness of security vulnerabilities among
home PC users was not very high in 1996, when people were beginning
to explore the World Wide Web in increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the level of vulnerability depended largely on how
the computer was used and on what precautions were taken.
</P>
<P>
   A computer user's vulnerability to attack does not depend as
much on which Web site is visited as on what software is used to
gain access to the Internet, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's computers had access to the Web via America Online.
And, in 1996, America Online accounts were among the most frequent
targets of attackers, who used sundry ploys to gain access to
members' passwords. This included planting malicious hidden
programs known as trojan horses on the victims' hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, experts have exposed a number of security holes
in browsing software. In general, however, e-mail programs are the
software most vulnerable to intrusion, said Richard Smith, an
Internet security consultant in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a trojan horse attack can come in the form of a
malicious program attached to a piece of e-mail or, in some
instances, can be carried within the e-mail message itself. In
either case, these programs end up on a computer's hard drive,
where they can do many kinds of mischief. For example, some have
been known to capture passwords by monitoring the victim's
keystrokes. This has been a common attack on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that you can read files off a hard drive and
then send them back on the Web as e-mail to someone else, or post
them to a news group,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of a trojan horse is that it is a seemingly
legitimate program that hides _ and eventually executes _ a
malicious code.
</P>
<P>
   While many such attacks are mounted randomly, Smith said that
such a method of gaining access to a computer would be ideal for
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These security holes would be a great way for spying,'' he
said. This could be accomplished, he said, by sending an e-mail
message containing a clandestine program that lowers the computer's
security settings, paving the way for a second, more malicious
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the spy business,'' he said, ``what better way to
do it than to get the home e-mail addresses of important people and
use some of these security holes to bug their computer?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he knew of no such incidents involving espionage, but
he added that a portion of a fast-spreading virus called Melissa,
which infected thousands of computers last year, worked by lowering
the security settings on target computers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it was only relatively recently that security holes
in Internet-based software were systematically documented.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Deutch had anti-virus software installed on his
computers has not been made public. Even if he did, Rubin said,
anti-virus software offers protection only against known viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is a virus that's creative and new and acts in
a way unanticipated by the anti-virus writers,'' he said. ``There's
no way to defend against a virus like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not revealed the kind of lines with which
Deutch's computers had been connected to the Internet, but it is
likely that they had used a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   A dial-up connection poses less of a security risk than what is
known as a persistent connection _ like a cable modem or digital
subscriber line, or DSL _ in which a computer is always online.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent connections typically are much higher speed than
dial-up connections and have surged in popularity only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Seiden, chief network security consultant to the
Kroll-O'Gara Information Security Group in Palo Alto, Calif., said
a more interesting question was the extent to which Deutch was
sending and receiving sensitive information from the home computer
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail traveling over the Internet is vulnerable to
interception. Unless it is encrypted, its contents are there for
the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to someone at the CIA about sending
something there, they said to send it by U.S. mail,'' Seiden said.
``They didn't want me to e-mail them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that no computer is an island these days, Rubin said,
has put security experts in something of an ``arms race'' with
potential intruders. ``They take a few steps forward, then we take
a few steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a tremendous effort on the part of security
professionals to secure computers, Rubin said, ``I'd say the
attackers have the edge.''

BALLOT FUROR MIGHT HURT NEW YORK GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
  (with McCain-Ballot) 
 (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the end, the word came from the office of the
man who had insisted that the dispute had nothing to do with him.
Aides to Gov. George Pataki announced Thursday that Sen. John
McCain would be on New York's presidential primary ballot after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had said all along that it was the Republican State
Committee, not he, who was trying to keep McCain off the March 7
ballot, and that he could not tell the party and its powerful
chairman, Bill Powers, what to do. But it was the governor's aides
who publicly defended the party's position, and Thursday it was
they who told reporters that the party had done an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the party's decision, not ours,'' said Zenia Mucha,
Pataki's communications chief.
</P>
<P>
   But few people in politics or government doubted that Powers was
acting with the governor's full support, or that Pataki wielded
great influence over the party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a booster of the party favorite, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, has made no secret of his desire to be considered for the
vice presidential nomination. He was always considered a long shot,
and the fight over ballot access may have hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pataki might have thought he was ingratiating himself with
Bush with this ballot stuff,'' said a prominent Republican
political consultant, ``but this has become an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is the public personification of the state party,
and to the extent that the party has made itself look
anti-democratic, the governor cannot benefit. Pataki clearly wants
to be seen as a power in national Republican circles, and losing
the fight over ballot access hurts there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole episode is a black mark on Pataki, and more so if
McCain now does well in New York,'' said John Zogby, a pollster.
``It makes the governor and the party look bad and, more important,
look weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of New York's most prominent Republicans, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York City and former Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, have
said publicly that the state rules that make it hard to get on the
ballot _ and easy to knock an underdog off _ were wrong. In fact,
McCain thanked D'Amato Thursday night for helping him get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the state party tried _ and failed _ to keep Steve
Forbes off the primary ballot in favor of the establishment choice,
Bob Dole. The publicity was so negative that the Republicans agreed
to change the state law governing ballot access, though the rules
remain the toughest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, everyone knew that D'Amato dominated the party.
These days, voters looking for the face of the state party have
nowhere to turn but to Pataki.

A.E. VAN VOGT, 87, FORCEFUL SCIENCE-FICTION VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By GERALD JONAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A.E. van Vogt, a writer who smuggled raw emotion into modern
science fiction, died on on Jan. 26 at a hospital in Los Angeles.
He was 87 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Van Vogt's most memorable stories were published from 1939 to
1951, a period often called science fiction's golden age. Like
Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he made his
name in the monthly magazines known as pulps because of the
inferior quality of their paper. The best science fiction of the
1940s and '50s celebrated the rational mind while evoking a sense
of wonder about the vast universe revealed by modern science. In
his own work van Vogt paid lip service to science and reason, but
his heart was elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Elton van Vogt was born in 1912 on a farm in Manitoba,
Canada. He was an avid reader who taught himself to write by
studying how-to manuals from libraries. At 21 he began selling
fictional ``confession'' pieces to pulp magazines like True Story.
</P>
<P>
   His first published science-fiction story, ``Black Destroyer,''
appeared in the July 1939 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. It
began with the sentence: ``On and on Coeurl prowled.'' Coeurl
turned out to be a catlike alien who preyed on other life forms by
sucking out their ``id'' energy. In the alien's confrontation with
a team of human explorers, reason won in the end, as it always did
in van Vogt's stories. But what readers remembered was the way he
plunged them directly into the center of Coeurl's ravening need.
``Black Destroyer'' has been cited as the inspiration for the movie
``Alien'' and its many sequels and imitations.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the United States in 1944, van Vogt published
``Slan'' (1946), the story of a confrontation between the
telepathic mutants known as slans and normal humans fearful of
being displaced by their superhuman offspring. Among his other
well-known works are ``The World of Null-A'' (1948) and ``The
Weapon Shops of Isher'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   Following his own dictum that a story should unfold in a
sequence of 800-word scenes with one new idea per scene, van Vogt
complicated his fast-moving narratives beyond comprehension. But
even critics who mocked the absurdities of his plots and the
awkwardness of his prose paid tribute to the emotional power of his
dreamlike tales.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lydia.

FREDERICK WARDER, 95, DECORATED SUBMARINE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., W.Va., Calif., Conn., La.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rear Adm. Frederick B. Warder, a submariner whose
exploits in World War II won him a Navy Cross and a nickname he
detested, died Feb. 1 at his home in Ocala, Fla. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   As a lieutenant commander, he was skipper of the Seawolf from
1939 to 1943. The submarine resupplied the besieged island fortress
of Corregidor in the Philippines in spring 1942 and sank a Japanese
destroyer, cruiser, transport ship and several other vessels on
seven missions in the following months.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old officer was awarded the Navy Cross, one of the
service's highest honors, for his work. The citation noted that,
after firing its torpedoes, the Seawolf was often the target of
prolonged depth-charge attacks by Japanese destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Commander Warder kept a veneer of calm for his men and
brought the Seawolf home unscathed each time. Soon, he learned that
his crew and sailors from other ships were calling him ``Fearless
Freddie,'' though never within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Grace Harde of Woodstock, Vt., said Thursday that
the nickname actually had its genesis just before Pearl Harbor,
when several Seawolf sailors overimbibed one night and gave the
Shore Patrol that name for their commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
   The sobriquet might have faded away except for the seven
missions that made it stick, his daughter said. Harde said her
father hated the nickname because he was afraid just like everyone
else under enemy fire, and he believed that the real heroes were
those who had died.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted to commander, he was in charge of several submarines
operating in the Mariana Islands. In addition to the Navy Cross,
his wartime decorations included a Bronze Star, Legion of Merit and
several other medals.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Burdett Warder was born on March 19, 1904, in Grafton,
W.Va., and graduated from the Naval Academy in 1925. He earned a
master's degree in science from the University of California at
Berkeley and held several submarine posts before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoted to captain and, from 1944 to 1946, headed the
Navy's submarine school at New London, Conn. After several other
assignments, he became a rear admiral in 1952. From 1957 to 1960,
he was commander of the Atlantic submarine force; his flagship was
a nuclear submarine bearing the name of his World War II craft, the
Seawolf.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he became commandant of the 8th Naval District, with
headquarters in New Orleans. He retired in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   His first two wives, Mary Brydon and Eleanor Modisette, died. He
is survived by his wife of 15 years, Gladys; two daughters from his
first marriage, Harde and Susan Savard of Ottawa; a brother,
Thomas, of Millsboro, Del.; a sister, Margaret Byrd of Grafton; 10
grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren. Two children from his
first marriage, Frederick Jr. and Mary Smith, have died.
</P>
<P>
   Harde said today that, not only was her father not fearless, he
was also anything but an underwater predator. In his later years,
he would occasionally reminisce about sinking a Japanese ship, then
surfacing to see enemy survivors in the water, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Japanese sailors refused to come aboard, the Seawolf
skipper ordered his men to toss them life jackets. Harde said her
father believed that ``your enemy is also your brother, in a
sense.''

HARDSHIPS TEACH A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Most afternoons 13-year-old Cherrie Redwine
goes outside to do her homework, even when the temperature is in
the 40s and snow is on the ground, as it was this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hardly breathe with five people living inside
there,'' she said, as she sat outside her family's one-bedroom
trailer at the temporary housing site for displaced victims of the
September floods that followed Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Residents throughout North Carolina dug out from one of the
worst snowstorms in state history this week. About 20 inches fell
in the Raleigh area, and 4 to 10 inches fell here to the east.
Coming only five months after the state's worst flooding, the snow
just added to the myriad troubles facing those displaced by the
flood.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest practical problems from the recent snowstorm were
occasional frozen pipes and lack of heating. But the more insidious
effect was psychological. The threat of bad weather seemed to bring
back memories of the flood for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gives you a flashback, especially for those of us
who were flooded out,'' said Earl Parker, a 37-year-old barber who
used to live in Tarboro. ``When you look at the news and see bad
weather, you think, `Oh Lord, what's going to happen now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is the mix of frustration, longing and gratitude
that the flood victims have experienced more evident than in the
eight temporary trailer parks, like this one in Rocky Mount, set up
by the state and federal emergency management agencies. Altogether,
more than 9,000 people who lost homes in the flooding from
Hurricane Floyd live in the parks, scattered throughout the
hard-hit areas of eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 families have been living in 310 one-bedroom trailers
and 74 larger mobile homes at the Fountain Park site here for
almost five months. About 25 families have taken their
state-supplied trailers back to the property where their houses are
being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   The state Emergency Response Team and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency have set an 18-month deadline for residents at
the trailer parks to get back on their feet in rebuilt houses or
new apartments. ``I don't think anyone wants to live in those
travel trailers forever,'' said Jay Acre, a spokesman for FEMA,
``although it is rent free.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Allen, 62, a cashier at a restaurant in Rocky Mount, is one
of the lucky ones. She found an apartment this week despite the
tight market created by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking since Christmas,'' she said, sitting in her
neatly kept trailer. ``It's hard to find a nice place to live. But
I know I can't stay here, so I don't want to wait until the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   For others who are rebuilding houses, the wait will be longer.
Before the flooding, Cherrie Redwine lived in Princeville with her
mother, her 10-year-old sister, her 7-year-old brother and her
mother's boyfriend in their own house. Since October, they have all
been living in the 240-square-foot trailer. Her neighbors' trailers
on each side are inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Each trailer is heated by two 30-pound propane gas tanks, and
none of the trailers have telephones. The gas tanks last about two
days in the cold weather and cost $12 to refill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had a house, we weren't so smushed up together,''
Cherrie said. ``I could walk to stores close by. I could ride my
bike. I had my own room. I had my clothes, a phone, a stereo. And
we had central heat and air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer park is behind a women's prison, and many people
must rely on public transportation to get out of the area because
they also lost their cars in the flood. Rows of trailers line
streets of packed dirt, so when it rains or the snow melts, mud is
everywhere, and children track it into the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrie said she did not realize how good she had it before her
family lost everything it owned. ``I didn't appreciate anything,''
she said. ``If I got something, I wanted more. Now I appreciate
what I get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months before Christmas, donations flowed freely to the
flood victims, many of whom were not used to accepting help. But as
the months have passed, there is less help. Some church groups have
adopted flooded-out families for the duration, and many others have
come to help in the rebuilding. But some people here are looking at
another year or more before they get back into their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cherrie's homework assignments this week was to write a
poem for English class about what it is like to be a flood victim
and live in the trailer park. So she was thinking hard about the
past five months and how her life had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the flood, I used to be a mean little girl,'' she said.
``I used to make fun of people for the way they looked and always
pick on people about wearing Kmart clothes. But then I started
wearing Kmart clothes. After the flood, I turned out to be just
like them. I reaped what I sowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Exum, 35, an Edgecombe County deputy sheriff, who patrols
the park as part of his beat, has known Cherrie for many years. ``I
knew her before the flood, and she has changed,'' Exum said. ``I've
seen a lot of people do that. People have really come together to
help everyone in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another effect of the flood is that Cherrie has grown to love
reading, especially mysteries. She used to hate reading, but after
the flood she said she found it was one of her favorite ways to
escape boredom.
</P>
<P>
   After many versions, Cherrie, who said she plans to be a nurse,
not a writer, came up with the final draft of her poem for English
class:
</P>
<P>
   Today as I sit here, I begin to think about all the things I've
been through.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I hate myself because of the things I used to do.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I be so happy that I have learned from these things.
</P>
<P>
   Every day I pray to God to help me through.

EWING SAVES HIS SEASON'S BEST TO BEAT THE BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are times when Patrick Ewing's tireless pride
can overcome age, injury and odds, and when his desire to prove he
is not done in this league emanates through on a night like
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   After his name was kicked around in trade discussions between
the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, after his dedication to the
game had been questioned, Ewing unearthed his most impressive
performance since his return from injury 24 games ago. As he faded
away for an array of jumpers, he tortured the league's best team,
the Portland Trail Blazers, for 20 points and 9 rebounds in the
Knicks' 98-88 victory at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awakening for a Knick team that had slumbered through
its game on Tuesday against the Orlando Magic. The Knicks held the
Trail Blazers to 42 percent shooting from the field and forced them
into 14 turnovers while committing only 8 themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, led by Allan Houston's 22 points, shot 41.8 percent
and were outrebounded, 48-38. The key was the Knicks' getting to
the free-throw line 35 times while the Trail Blazers went 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   Portland was led by Steve Smith's 18 points but could not get
anyone else in the mix except for the reserve Bonzi Wells, who
scored 18 off the bench. The Blazers were a frustrated group,
evident when Rasheed Wallace, sitting on the bench, was tossed from
the game after his second technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led by 79-71 with 8 minutes 5 seconds left in the
game, but Wells came out of nowhere to unleash a stream of jumpers
to pull the Trail Blazers to within 4 points, at 81-77, with 6:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But then Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has been prone to benching
Ewing in the final minutes, put him back in with 4:58 left and
watched him sink a baseline jumper three seconds later. He led the
Knicks the rest of the way, and they built a 12-point lead with
less than three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The victory should give the Knicks confidence should these two
teams make their way to meet in the National Basketball Association
finals.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, the Knicks had to live with their inept and
uninspired performance against the Magic. Usually, the Knicks
respond well when given a second chance to redeem themselves. But
Thursday night required more than just a higher plane of
preparation and focus against a team that is leading the mighty
Pacific Division and swaggered into town with the best record in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   During the Trail Blazers' six-game winning streak, they had
beaten the Spurs, the Jazz and the Lakers. Not only did they
possess stars like Scottie Pippen, Smith and Wallace, they came
with a loaded bench as well. Not only can they shoot for a high
percentage, they also came in holding opponents to a league-low 88
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just another game,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ``It's a
challenge for us. This is another elite team, and we want to see
where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held their own at halftime, down by 46-45. But every
point, every rebound was a struggle for the Knicks while the Trail
Blazers seemed to be pacing themselves. At one point, Portland held
the Knicks without a field goal for four minutes of the second
quarter. With the Knicks down by 41-35, Houston broke the drought
and scored on a 3-pointer as a part of his 12 first-half points in
the face of his defender, Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston was about the only Knick going. Sprewell, struggling
to find air against Pippen, finished the first half shooting 1 for
5 but was part of a third-quarter surge that irritated and
surprised the Trail Blazers. Sprewell hit a 3-pointer with 6:40
left in the third to give the Knicks a 56-55 lead. The Knicks
finished out the third quarter on a 17-9 run and took a 73-64 lead
entering the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were getting under the skin of Portland's big men.
After Wallace was called on a foul for pushing off on Sprewell for
a rebound, the volatile forward lost his temper and was called for
a technical foul. The Knicks then pumped up their lead to 61-56
when Ewing sprang free for a smooth baseline jumper, proving he
still has a little magic left in his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing tried to be everywhere. He was fighting for rebounds and
leaping to keep the ball alive. But after expending all of that
energy, he had nothing left when he went to the free-throw line
with 7:04 left in the third and came up empty on two attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Where there was life, there was Sprewell. He came flying down
the lane on a fast-break layup to give the Knicks a 68-62 lead with
1:30 remaining in the third period. He had found a way to beat
Pippen: outrun him. With Sprewell running and Ewing picking up
fouls in the post, the Knicks held a 73-64 lead at the end of the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Until the third quarter, the Trail Blazers were playing it cool.
Before Houston started feeling his groove in the second quarter,
the Knicks went through a two-minute spell in which they turned the
ball over twice and Houston blew a dunk as he drove right down the
lane. But once Houston began to feel his jumper again, the Knicks
also began to mix it up and bang inside. They got to the free-throw
line five times in the last 3:14 of the half, but Marcus Camby,
Houston and Ewing combined to hit just 3 of 9 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks had scraped up enough points to stay close to
the Trail Blazers despite being outrebounded, 25-18, and outshot,
41.9 percent to 38.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Knicks' inability to score could be attributed to
the matchup of Pippen, a sinewy 6 feet 7 inches, overshadowing the
6-5 Sprewell. It was a rough situation for Sprewell, but the tone
of that matchup changed in the third quarter when Sprewell began to
make an impact. &QL;

GIULIANI FAULTS MRS. CLINTON ON TRIP COSTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani accused Hillary Rodham
Clinton Thursday of failing to fully reimburse taxpayers for the
cost of using government airplanes on political trips to New York
and elsewhere. The White House and Clinton's campaign said prompt
reimbursements had been made.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign finance filings made public on Wednesday, Clinton
reported reimbursing $34,000 in travel costs. Under federal law,
Clinton, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, must pay the
government the equivalent of a first-class commercial airline
ticket for herself and any political staff members traveling with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's security detail is paid for by the government, and as
first lady, she may be accompanied by one government aide at
taxpayers' expense. But even given these allowances, Giuliani and
the manager of his Senate campaign, Bruce Teitelbaum, suggested,
Clinton made more trips and took along a bigger entourage than
accounted for in the figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like that deal, not only for my campaign but for my
vacation,'' Giuliani said Thursday. ``I mean if you can get that
deal for you and your family, take it, because Disneyland, here I
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton's campaign nor the White House would provide a
detailed accounting of the trips she had taken or how much her
campaign, the Democratic National Committee or other organizations
had been billed for them.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said the White House
counsel's office determines billing for political travel. ``We in
fact bill in a timely fashion,'' he said, ``and any suggestion to
the contrary is partisan and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, said that her campaign pays
all bills from the White House and suggested that Giuliani was
trying to divert attention from this week's allegations of illegal
city welfare contracts. ``The mayor should explain why he is giving
no-bid contracts to his political cronies,'' he said.

SUIT SEEKS TO OVERTURN A WINE LAW IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Washington law firm sued Thursday to overturn New
York laws prohibiting direct shipments of wine by out-of-state
wineries to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Representing three New York consumers and two small wineries in
Virginia and California, the Institute for Justice, which calls
itself a libertarian law firm, also seeks repeal of a law that
limits the advertising of wines by producers outside the state.
That law, it says, violates First Amendment free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The firm chose New York for a national test case because the
state is the second biggest wine market in the country after
California, and is a major wine-growing state. It has 140 producers
in four regions: Long Island, the Finger Lakes, the Hudson Valley
and Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   In suing the state Liquor Authority, which enforces the law, the
institute argues that the legislation discriminates against sellers
and buyers and provides unconstitutional protectionism. Clint
Bolick, the director of litigation, said in a statement that the
legislation was ``designed to preserve the monopoly of liquor
wholesalers who control all out-of-state wine in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs include Juanita Swedenburg, proprietor of the
Swedenburg Winery in Virginia, and David Lucas, owner of the Lucas
Winery in California. They are joined in the suit by New Yorkers
who, the institute said, are wine enthusiasts who tried to order
bottles from them ``for direct shipment, furnishing proper
identification that they are adult consumers.'' Because of the law,
the institute said, ``the wineries were compelled to decline their
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet opened up a fantastic new way for boutique
wineries to find new customers,'' Bolick said. But, he added, under
New York laws, every out-of-state winery or retailer who advertises
on the Internet is an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Violette, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office in Albany, which would defend the legislation, said, ``We'll
wait to be served with papers, analyze the lawsuit and then comment
appropriately at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states bar direct wine sales from out-of-state producers
to consumers, and seven of those treat such transactions as
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, regulation of alcoholic
beverages has been left to the states. The lawsuit seeks to weaken
the power held by wholesalers in many states under the so-called
three-tiered system, under which producers must sell wine to
wholesalers, who add a markup and sell it to stores and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   New York law does not bar shipments by New York producers and
merchants inside the state. This, the law firm argues, give them an
unfair, privileged position.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Pellegrini Vineyards, in Cutchogue on the North
Fork of Long Island, established a wine club under which it ships
New Yorkers bottles four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to open the club to people in Ohio who say, `We'd
like to have your wine' and we have to say, `Sorry, you can't,'''
said Joyce Pellegrini, an owner. ``People can get flowers and books
by the month. Why not wine?''

41 SHOTS BELIE ANY DANGER FROM POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On this, the first anniversary of Amadou Diallo's
shocking death at police hands, the city weeps for its adopted son.
But through the tears, and certainly through the shouts of the many
anti-police protesters over the last year, a significant fact tends
to be obscured. It is this:
</P>
<P>
   New York police officers are firing less often at civilians _
black, white, brown or any other shade _ than at any point in
recent history. Not only that, but when they do shoot, it is at a
rate appreciably lower than found in many other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir credits better firearms
training, which includes role playing and video simulators to
create ``many, many scenarios of shoot-or-don't-shoot situations.''
He and others who make it their business to analyze police
practices say it also does not hurt that crime is way down from its
early '90s peaks. Officers are less likely these days to run into
situations that lead them to pull out their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, when it comes to the use of firearms, we are the
most restrained large city police department in the United
States,'' Safir said. ``But you wouldn't know that from reading you
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Being generous souls, we will let that personal attack slide.
The more important point is that shootings by the police have
starkly declined no matter how you measure them: number of
incidents, bullets fired, civilians wounded or, obviously the most
critical category, civilians killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the police say, 11 people were shot to death by
officers, including Diallo and the victim in another controversial
case, Gidone Busch of Borough Park, Brooklyn. The 1998 body count
was 19. The number of wounded fell to 31 last year from 43 in 1998.
Incidents dropped to 155 from 249, and bullets fired to 477 from
526. Bear in mind that the 1999 figure included the extraordinary
41 shots fired at Diallo last Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suspect that the Diallo killing and the subsequent
protests traumatized the police somewhat, producing a high degree
of self-restraint and, with it, the eye-catching dip in numbers.
Safir rejects the idea of a Post-Diallo Syndrome in shooting
situations. It must be said that, while the 1999 decline was
uncommonly steep, the indicators were already heading the right way
before anyone here heard of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, 31 people were fatally shot by the police
and 48 were wounded. The number of shooting incidents that year was
317 and bullets fired, 894, figures roughly double those last year.
</P>
<P>
   And if you go further back in time _ say, to the early 1970s,
when the number of civilians shot to death by the police averaged
63 a year _ you can see that the rules of engagement for officers
have been considerably tightened. While the death toll has
fluctuated over the years, it is far from what it was in the '70s
or even as recently as 1990, when crime was rampant and 41
civilians were shot dead by the police.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing this city with others, Safir likes to single out
Washington, where officers fire their weapons five times more per
capita than the New York police do. Maybe the commissioner mentions
the capital because he is from there. Or maybe it is because
Washington's police force, like its population, is largely black,
blunting the argument that race is by definition the key factor
when the police open fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, there would seem to be little in New York's
numbers to support a claim that ``it is open season on blacks,'' as
the Rev. Jesse Jackson said after the Diallo killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message in the Police Academy is that you shoot in
defense of life, and it better be something that a reasonable
person would do,'' said Thomas A. Repetto, president of the
Citizens Crime Commission, a police watchdog group. Professor Eli
Silverman of John Jay College of Criminal Justice added: ``Most
officers don't ever want to shoot. They don't want to live that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that 11 deaths represent perfection. Some
reporters who cover police matters say that officers' performance
could be better evaluated if the department would only provide
detailed tactical information on firearms use.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, a case like the Diallo shooting overwhelms
statistics. An inevitable result, said City Councilman Sheldon
Leffler, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, is that
``people conclude officers are too quick on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the available numbers are hard to ignore. ``They are what
they are,'' Safir said.

JUST BEFORE JET CRASH, PILOTS CALLED MECHANIC FOR HELP
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Ariz.) (DELETES ``night'' from lede) 
 (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ A few minutes before an Alaska Airlines
jet crashed offshore here on Monday, the crew radioed a company
mechanic in Los Angeles that the device that forms most of the
horizontal section of the tail was pushing the nose down and asked
if there was a way to cut power to the device.
</P>
<P>
   The crew had apparently run through its emergency procedures,
which included pulling out circuit breakers to try to cut off power
to the two motors that control the horizontal stabilizer, and they
asked the mechanic if he knew of any ``hidden circuit breakers,''
said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board assigned to the crash. All 88 people aboard the MD-83
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt, relating a summary of his investigators'
interview with the mechanic, said, ``The flight crew stated
something like, `We are in a worse situation than we were.''' But
the mechanic told the two pilots that he knew of no hidden circuit
breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San
Francisco and Seattle but was preparing for an emergency landing at
Los Angeles when the mechanic was called, crashed a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical problem in the tail of the plane, which led it to
turn upside down and corkscrew into the water, came in a system
that is supposed to withstand failures, engineers at Boeing said
Thursday, speaking as searchers recovered the second ``black box,''
which they hope will give them a clearer picture of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The second box, the flight data recorder, which was put on a
late afternoon flight to the board's headquarters in Washington,
keeps track of the position of the horizontal stabilizer, along
with other data. The first box, the cockpit voice recorder, was
recovered on Wednesday. When it was played by investigators in
Washington Thursday, it showed that the two pilots were in the
midst of discussing a problem with the horizontal stabilizer at the
beginning of the tape, more than 30 minutes before the crash.
Investigators said previously that the crew had first raised their
problem with air traffic controllers about 11 minutes before the
crash, after dropping rapidly from their assigned altitude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, James Hall, the chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said the voice tape showed that the
plane was pitching nose down. ``The crew was able to arrest the
descent,'' Hall said, and ``continued trouble-shooting and
preparing the airplane for landing'' in Los Angeles. But then, he
said, ``control was suddenly lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparations and the loss of control may be related. Boeing
engineers and pilots of the MD-80 series airplane say the airplane
tends to pitch up or down in response to changes in its speed or
fuel consumption or changes in the position of the flaps and the
slats, devices on the wings that are used on takeoff and landing.
Extending the slats and flaps, as a pilot would do while preparing
to land, would aggravate the nose-down tendency.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing engineers Thursday described a detailed emergency
procedure for coping with a malfunctioning stabilizer system. The
stabilizer, which makes up the front two-thirds of the horizontal
tail, can be angled up or down to keep the nose at the desired
angle and is typically adjusted hundreds of times in a flight, they
said. It is moved on its hinge by a jack screw, similar to the
long, thick screw that raises or lowers a garage door. Two motors
drive the screw, one at the command of the pilots and the other
when the autopilot is in charge, although pilots can operate that
one as well, if needed. The emergency procedure involves switching
off the circuit breakers on each motor, in alternation, to figure
out which one has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer system includes both motors and brakes, and both
would have to fail for the part to move in an undesired manner, the
Boeing engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is supposed to be flyable even if the stabilizer is
immobilized, although engineers said it might require the pilots to
pull hard on their control yokes, possibly both at once.
Hammerschmidt also said Thursday evening that investigators had
interviewed the crew that flew the plane into Puerto Vallarta
earlier on Monday and that they reported the plane had operated
without any problem between Seattle and San Francisco, and again
from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta. A newspaper report had said
that the plane experienced problems with the horizontal control
system in its last completed leg.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that large parts of the tail section had been
spotted by a robot submarine, and that searchers had found the
aircraft's log book, floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt also said that an American Airlines flight that
left Phoenix on Wednesday but returned quickly because of a problem
with its horizontal stabilizer had been found to have a
short-circuit in a cockpit switch. That plane was also an MD-83,
but whether there was a connection between the incidents remained
unclear.

<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ Two of the world's leading companies in
wireless communications agreed Thursday to merge in a $183 billion
deal, the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning end to the kind of hostile takeover attempt once
considered unthinkable in Europe, Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain
negotiated the acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany. The
all-stock transaction easily shattered the previous record for a
takeover deal, America Online's $165 billion purchase of Time
Warner announced less than three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If consummated, the takeover will vastly expand the geographic
reach of Vodafone, which already is the world's biggest wireless
telephone company, giving it dominance in the European market and a
global base of more than 50 million customers. Vodafone already has
a major presence in the United States and two dozen countries in
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vodafone-Mannesmann deal is perhaps more important as a
watershed in European corporate behavior and the export to Europe
of bare-knuckled takeover tactics first honed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a European company carried off a hostile
takeover on such an audacious scale: cross-border, cross-cultural
and paid for with shares in a company that was almost unknown
outside of Britain 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of the Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann
still need to be approved by the German conglomerate's supervisory
board _ the equivalent of a board of directors. It is expected to
ratify the agreement at a meeting scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came just four days before the expiration of Vodafone's
takeover offer to holders of Mannesmann stock, which Mannesmann's
management had called unwanted, unfriendly and too low.
</P>
<P>
   And although it was nominally called a ``friendly'' merger
Thursday, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann, only
capitulated when it became obvious that a majority of his
shareholders were about to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shareholders clearly think that this company, Mannesmann,
a great company, would be better together with Vodafone Airtouch,''
Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, told reporters in
Duesseldorf, where he has spent the last two days negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what the combined company would be called.
But the deal would bring together two businesses with vastly
different backgrounds. Mannesmann, founded more than a century ago
as a maker of steel pipe, has evolved into technology-driven leader
that specializes in communications. Vodafone, by contrast, was born
18 years ago as Britain's first cellular phone company, and that
has been its only business ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Vodafone and Mannesmann would have 42.4 million
subscribers. NTT DoCoMo of Japan is a distant No. 2 with 26.7
million, and Telecom Italia No. 3 with 17.8 million, according to
estimates by the Lehman Brothers investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, who had been voluble in his opposition to Vodafone's
takeover designs and had been expected to resign, said he would
continue to work for the combined company, but he will be a clear
subordindate to Gent. Esser will become a non-exective chairman and
keep a seat on the company's board. Mannesmann will get an
additional four seats on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shareholders will control a 49.5 percent share of the
combined company and get 58.96 Vodafone shares for each Mannesmann
share they own. Based on Vodafone's closing share price Wednesday
of 3.855 pounds or $6.21, the day before word of the deal got out,
the total value is about $366.14 per share or $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone shares hold their value, the agreement will be a
huge bonanza for shareholders in Mannesmann, which is the most
widely owned foreign stock in the United States. The takeover price
for Mannesmann shares is more than double what they cost before the
takeover battle began.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has to be reviewed and approved by the European
Commission, which is expected to issue a preliminary decision on
Feb. 17. But the deal is a bitter defeat for Esser, who had
passionately fought to preserve his company's independence.

</P>
<P>
   Esser insisted Thursday night that the situation was the best
possible outcome. ``It's not a change of opinion,'' he told
reporters. But the discomfort was evident between Esser and Gent
when the two men presented their agreement Thursday night. Despite
a show of collegiality, they could barely bring themselves to shake
hands for more than a moment. After a bit of prodding by
photographers, they were cajoled into shaking hands again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Esser's public nonchalance, the takeover is also a shock
to Mannesmann, an old-line industrial conglomerate that had
brilliantly transformed itself into the biggest provider of
wireless communications in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann owns national networks in Germany, Italy and Britain,
while Vodafone owns Britain's second-largest network and scores of
other stakes around Europe and on other continents.
</P>
<P>
   But Gent outmaneuvered Esser on the chessboard of Europe's
wireless industry, which is based on a handful of immensely
valuable national wireless licenses in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's biggest victory came last Sunday, when Vodafone managed
to steal one of Mannesmann's longtime allies _ Vivendi SA of
France. That move derailed Esser's desperate attempt to hammer out
a merger with Vivendi, which would have given him control of a
major French network and greatly strengthened his position with
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gent cut his own deal with Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie
Messier, by forming a joint venture in Internet services. That deal
convinced wavering shareholders that Esser had lost the upper hand,
even with his allies, and they immediately began betting on a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies began to work in earnest together
at the start of the week. The companies reached a basic agreement
in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Negotiations continued for
most of Thursday until the announcement was made late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will control wireless networks in Europe's
three biggest markets _ Britain, Germany and Italy _ along with a
45 percent stake in the biggest U.S. network and holdings in more
than 30 other countries, from Sweden and Poland to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover of Mannesmann makes history on several fronts
besides its size.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europe has seen a surge of hostile takeovers, the only
successful ones only have been between competitors within a single
European nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Mannesmann marked one of the first real battles
for the entire European market, one in which both the combatants
recognized that the economic integration of Europe and the adoption
of a single currency in eleven countries made it crucial to
overcome national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also marked one of the first cases in which national
political leaders did not try to interfere in order to protect an
important domestic company.
</P>
<P>
   When three of France's biggest banks plunged into a heated
takeover battle last year, the battle was largely sanctioned and
guided by the French Ministry of Finance, which wanted to
consolidate the nation's banking industry and keep out foreign
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true when Totalfina SA, the French-Belgian oil
company, launched a successful hostile takeover of Elf Aquitaine
SA. Likewise, Italian political leaders actively opposed the
proposed telephone merger between Deutsche Telekom of Germany and
Telecom Italia in favor of a hostile bid by Italy's Olivetti SPA.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reaction was entirely different. Despite the
angry rhetoric from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about the
dangers of hostile takeovers, the German government stayed out of
the fight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That reflected a widespread view among German business
executives that it was far more dangerous to interfere with a
legitimate if hostile bid and jeopardize the ability of German
companies like DaimlerChrysler to buy up foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Esser and Gent waged their battle almost entirely
through direct appeals to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market view was that following the deal with Vivendi there
really weren't any more ways that Mannesmann could present a better
strategy,'' Andrew Moffat, telecommunications analyst at the Dutch
bank ABN Amro said. ``A friendly deal is what both sets of
shareholders were aggressively trying to push through.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a power struggle between two companies that
both wanted to command the European market. It began in January
1999 when Vodafone acquired AirTouch of the United States, a long
time minority partner in all of Mannesmann's communication
ventures. But the conflict deepened when Mannesmann invaded
Vodafone's home territory by buying Orange, Britain's third largest
mobile phone network for $33 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Mannesmann's direct attack in Britain, Gent decided
that Vodafone could not remain a real player unless it took over
its partner-turned-rival.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the deal weakened Vodafone's share price. In London
trading, shares ended at 368.5 pence, down 17. In Frankfurt,
Mannesmann shares added 0.5 euro to 325.50 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies employed armies of investment bankers to advise
them. Vodafone's lead adviser was Goldman Sachs which devoted more
than 100 people to the cause and will earn about $75 million,
analysts estimate. Vodafone is also advised by Warburg Dillon Read,
which is expected to take home $50 million. It is unclear how much
Mannesmann's advisers stand to earn.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's advisers are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Deutsche Bank AG. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of workers willing to bathe, dress, feed, clean and
care for the elderly, in their homes and in nursing homes, has
grown worse in the last two years as the economy has continued to
soar, creating many other jobs that pay as well or better for much
less demanding work. Fast-food restaurants and Target stores now
may offer equal wages, steadier work and better benefits, and
zookeepers, toll-takers and manicurists actually earn more.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as was reported in The New York Times recently, is
in part a result of economic and demographic trends. But it is also
the product of public attitudes and government policies that place
little value on the comfort and dignity of the oldest, most
vulnerable citizens, and on the labor of those who keep them safe.
The lack of care, by a work force stretched too thin, results in
accidents, malnutrition and bedsores, which are painful and can
lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   The very old now form the nation's fastest-growing population.
They are the parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles of the
boomers, but in two decades, they will begin to include the boomers
themselves. Ninety percent of the hired care those old people get
is given by nurses aides.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the jobs that are now so hard to fill. The sheer
number of aides needed is expected to grow by 76 percent from 1996
to 2006. Yet ombudsmen in 41 states already report that nursing
homes cannot recruit or retain the aides they need.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the nation's 1.6 million nursing home
residents are poor old women who do not vote and are likely to be
senile. Ninety-three per cent of the aides who care for them are
female and poor. Most are between 25 and 44, and 30 percent are
black, Asian or Hispanic. They are thought to earn between $7 and
$8 an hour, and the aides who work in home health care even less.
</P>
<P>
   Their wages are held at such low levels in part because of cuts
in Medicare, which pays for some home health care, and because
state legislatures have been determined to hold down the cost of
Medicaid, which pays for two-thirds of all nursing home care.
Legislators are prudent to try to contain costs, but not if it
produces a system that encourages the neglect and abuse of the old.

EDITORIAL: CALIFORNIA'S TOBACCO TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 4:
</P>
<P>
   On the March 7 ballot, California voters will be asked to repeal
Proposition 10, a groundbreaking anti-tobacco initiative that
raised the state cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack. Nullifying
Proposition 10 would be a serious public-health mistake. In 1998,
Californians set an admirable example for the rest of the nation by
passing this measure, which generates about $680 million a year to
pay for smoking prevention programs and an array of early childhood
education and health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, that tax increase is helping to reduce
tobacco consumption. Health experts have long argued that the best
way to cut smoking rates, particularly among teen-agers, is to
raise the cost of cigarettes. California officials report that the
Proposition 10 tax increase along with higher prices charged by
tobacco manufacturers have caused cigarette sales to fall by 30
percent, a drop that, if sustained, can substantially reduce the
number of young people becoming hooked on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But the supporters of the repeal measure, Proposition 28,
spearheaded by a national chain of retail cigarette stores called
``Cigarettes Cheaper!,'' want to stop the impressive progress
California is making. Proposition 10 squeaked through with a tiny 1
percent approval margin, even though the tobacco industry spent $30
million in a media blitz to attack the measure. The Proposition 28
supporters think that the small margin gives them a chance to turn
the vote around. But this time, the big tobacco manufacturers,
perhaps chastened by public dismay at the industry's tactics and
the fact that they lost in 1998 despite their heavy spending, are
apparently not financing the repeal effort. Even without that
infusion of tobacco cash, the ballot fight will be tough.
California voters did the right thing in approving Proposition 10.
They should reaffirm that vote by turning down Proposition 28.

FOURFOLD RISE IN CONTRACTS HIGHLIGHTS EDS EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Electronic Data Systems, the Texas computer services
concern that is rebounding from two disastrous years, reported
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that topped Wall Street estimates,
and announced a more than fourfold increase in new contracts during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EDS, based in Plano, Texas, said it earned 61 cents a share, or
$295 million, during the three months ended Dec. 31, up from 53
cents a share, or $264.1 million, the year earlier. Both numbers
exclude special gains and charges, including $422.2 million in
pretax revamping charges during the fourth quarter of 1999, which
was attributed mainly to a continued reduction in the number of
employees. Revenue for the quarter rose 11 percent from the
year-earlier quarter, to $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who said the results appeared to indicate the
company's turnaround was progressing faster than anticipated, had
expected earnings of 59 cents a share, and several said Thursday
that the consensus forecast for full-year 2000 earnings of $2.26 a
share now appeared too conservative. But Wall Street seemed to be
more surprised by the $11.2 billion in new contract signings during
the quarter. Total new signings for the year were $24.9 billion,
double the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Burns, a PaineWebber analyst, said he expected to
increase his estimates for earnings this year to around $2.30 a
share from $2.25, and that there might still be ``upside to those
numbers as well.'' At Merrill Lynch, Stephen McClellan said his
estimate of $2.30 a share this year now appeared conservative given
the results, and he said the amount of new bookings exceeded even
bullish estimates. ``It's quite a nice confirmation of a building
momentum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose strongly in trading Thursday morning before the
results were officially released, touching highs above $73, after
partial information appeared on the company's Web page because of
what EDS officials said was human error. After trading was halted
and the earnings report was released in full, shares resumed
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, finishing at $69.9375, up
$1.5625.
</P>
<P>
   EDS was demoralized and in disarray during much of 1997 and
1998, as both customers and investors viewed the company as
rudderless. It repeatedly missed earnings estimates amid what EDS
officials said was an increasingly competitive market as well as
the discovery that a number of contracts would be less profitable
than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The company's operating profit margin rose to 9.7 percent for
the quarter, from 8.9 percent during the same period in 1998. In an
interview, Richard H. Brown, the company's chief executive officer,
whom the board hired late in 1998, attributed the increase in the
profit margin to the reduction of employees and other measures.
``This is proof that our cost-reduction efforts and other
improvements we promised are clearly taking traction,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brown said the company's total backlog of contracts now stood at
well more than $60 billion, an increase of more than 20 percent
from last year, and that excluding revenue from General Motors
Corp., which used to own EDS, the company would post revenue growth
of at least 14 percent to 16 percent this year. But he also said
investors should not expect a big gain in revenue during the first
quarter, because it usually takes several quarters for the effect
of new contract bookings to be fully felt.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which now has revenue of more than $1 billion
annually from Internet business, also said it had started a $1.5
billion venture fund to invest in Internet-related companies.

   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ For those who thought the fight to keep
John McCain off the Republican ballot played out like a grand
political potboiler, try this one.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Republican boss who resembles a latter-day Marlon
Brando is indicted on corruption charges. One of the boss's former
allies drowns in the Hudson River. Another former ally videotapes
two women engaged in lesbian trysts at a water-pumping station,
later asks one to murder the other, according to court documents,
then tries to commit suicide himself.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the boss' son? He loses to an unknown Democrat in his
re-election race for county clerk by 59 votes, then forces an
unprecedented do-over vote in one remote town with the support of
the Republican elections commissioner, who happens to be his
father.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday in Brooklyn, a state appellate court heard
arguments from lawyers for the Democratic candidate for county
clerk, Richard Anderson, to reverse a lower court's decision and
let the November results stand, canceling the repeat vote in the
town of Northeast scheduled for Tuesday. A decision is expected on
Friday, and further appeals are still possible.
</P>
<P>
   A new election would give a second chance to the Republican
incumbent, William L. Paroli Jr., the son of William L. Paroli Sr.,
the former county Republican leader who is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a baroque tale of exurban intrigue, made all the
more incongruous by its pastoral and genteel setting. But it is
also a cautionary tale about politics and power, since much of
upstate New York is dominated by the cozy world of one-party
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the cast as minor characters, are big names from both
parties who are trying to frame the events of the last year or so
to serve their political interests.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki, for one, has responded to the drumbeat of
concerns that Paroli may be a liability to the Republicans,
appointing a New York City lawyer to investigate the removal of
Paroli as elections commissioner. Most Republicans here, meanwhile,
have distanced themselves from Paroli, even though Paroli has
always maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Most people expected that Anderson, a 57-year-old retired IBM
employee, would be routed in his race for county clerk against
Paroli, a 49-year-old former sales manager who had easily won his
two previous races. But, shocker of shockers, Anderson edged Paroli
by 59 votes out of 47,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for an unfamiliar political dogfight in a
county accustomed to Republican sweeps. The repercussions included,
among other twists, the attempt by Paroli's father to schedule an
extra day of voting once the results had come in, citing bad
weather on Election Day. Ultimately, Judge John LaCava of state
Supreme Court, a Republican, ordered a special election only in the
town of Northeast, where Anderson had prevailed 308-294, saying
that the ballot had been confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect has been an odd spectacle: a nonprimary race in
February in which Anderson and Paroli have been campaigning door to
door in order to capture an $85,000-a-year post overseeing motor
vehicle registrations and maintaining tax, land and other official
records.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has not been shy about linking Paroli pere and fils;
Paroli, on the other hand, has been trying to run on his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to confuse me with my father, and it's
frustrating,'' Paroli said during a recent visit to the dairy farm
of Northeast's Republican leader, John J. Perotti. ``But I'm
telling people: Should you visit the alleged sins of the father on
the son, or vote for the best man with the best record?''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Paroli, 71, a retired police detective, has developed
a reputation for being a tenacious, Boss Tweed-like party figure.
</P>
<P>
   But last year he was indicted by federal authorities on 16
counts of corruption that contend that he forced developers to make
payments to the local Republican party and himself totaling more
than $100,000 over a six-year period, in exchange for permits and
tax breaks. Paroli's case is scheduled to go to trial late next
month, but four others have been convicted on federal charges
stemming from the same investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his house here, Paroli, an affable man with a
gravelly voice, repeated that he is innocent, and that his current
quagmire is the work of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Paroli blamed two of his former Republican
friends: Basil Raucci, Poughkeepsie's former tax assessor, and Fred
Andros, Poughkeepsie's former water superintendent. Paroli saved
his harshest words for Andros, who pleaded guilty in U.S. District
Court in White Plains in May to collecting bribes for Paroli.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a small man with a Napoleonic complex who wants to be
bigger than he is,'' Paroli said. ``These guys were really out
there, shaking the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Raucci and Andros are not exactly in a position to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Raucci was found drowned in 1997 in the Hudson River. His death
was ruled a suicide, but rumors of foul play have never dissipated.
Andros, meanwhile, is in the Dutchess County jail's infirmary ward,
recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   Andros shot himself just before police were going to charge him
in connection with the shooting death of Susan Fassett, 48,
Poughkeepsie's former personnel director. The police also arrested
Dawn Silvernail, 50, of upstate Greene County, for shooting Fassett
in a church parking lot in October. Silvernail and Andros have both
been charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents released last week, Silvernail was quoted by
the police as saying that Andros _ her former lover _ had coerced
her into shooting Fassett. She also said that Andros had paid her
to have sex with Fassett on several occasions inside a town
water-pumping station.
</P>
<P>
   Andros, she added, videotaped the encounters, then joined them.
</P>
<P>
   How all of this will register for voters of Northeast,
population 3,000, in Tuesday's scheduled election is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just talking to people, I think there's a general sense of
`Geez, isn't this over yet? What's going on?''' said Steve
Utterback, news director of WKZE in Sharon, Conn., across the
border from Northeast. ``People see it as a soap opera playing down
in Poughkeepsie. It's like, `Oh, those people from the big city
again.'''
