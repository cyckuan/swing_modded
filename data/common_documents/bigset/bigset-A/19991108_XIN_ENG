<HEADLINE> U.S. Policy on Iran Contradictory: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Sunday that the U.S. has no
unified policy toward Iran and the stand taken by the
U.S. officials are contradictory.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the contradictions of the U.S. officials
are obvious in their words and deeds, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. is honest about what it says in this respect, it is
required to remove the high wall of mistrust between the two
countries by taking practical steps, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several senior U.S. officials, including Assistant Secretary of
State Martin Indyk and State Department spokesman James Rubin
called for "unconditional dialog" between the two countries to
set a road map for normal relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Vice President Al Gore recently termed Iran
as a "repressive and fundamentalist regime."
</P>
<P>
Al Gore's remark angered Iranian officials and Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday ruled out the
possibility for a resumption of ties between Iran and the U.S.,
and termed the campaign against the U.S. arrogance as "an innate
part of the Islamic revolution."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. administration is the symbol of arrogance and that
the anti-arrogance campaign is the innate part of the Islamic
revolution," Khamenei told a group of students on the eve of the
20th anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. is not honest in its alleged desire to
have relations with Iran, but they want relations with Iran to
dictate and impose their policy on Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of students from Iranian universities and
schools on Thursday morning staged a massive rally in front of the
former embassy of the United States in Tehran, also rejecting any
compromise with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the Wednesday's strong-worded speech of the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the demonstrators burned
a dozen of U.S. flags, images of "Uncle Sam" as well as Israeli
flags at the rally to mark the 20th anniversary of the takeover
of the U.S. embassy in Iran by students.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed their diplomatic relations in 1980
after Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Iran and held
the embassy staff members as hostages for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Tehran and Washington exchanged
goodwill signals, but Tehran insisted that the U.S. must change
its policy towards Iran before any direct talks.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Hold Grand Gathering to Welcome Britain's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Several thousands of Iraqis
gathered on Sunday at the Great Conference Hall in Baghdad to
welcome Britain's anti-sanctions legislator George Galloway whose
Mariam humanitarian convoy arrived here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the welcoming gathering, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz spoke highly of Galloway's Mariam humanitarian
crusade and called him a real friend of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed Iraq would not accept any U.N.
resolution short of the total lifting of sanctions on Iraq,
nor would it accept any amendments to the British-Dutch proposal
being discussed inside the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The British-Dutch proposal recommends a conditional suspension
of sanctions on Iraq after Iraq allows an enlarged weapons
inspection body to return and puts its oil revenues under the
U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival of his red London double-decker in Baghdad on
Saturday evening, Galloway received a hero's welcome when his
Mariam Convoy finally reached its destination after a two-month
London-to-Baghdad bus trip to garner support for lifting sanctions
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual gesture, Tariq Aziz received Galloway and the
accompanying delegation in front of the Rasheed Hotel at the
city center.
</P>
<P>
Galloway told reporters that the aim behind the Mariam
Appeal humanitarian crusade is to enlighten the world and Arab
public opinion with the sufferings sustained by the Iraqi people
under the embargo.
</P>
<P>
He said sympathizers of Iraq had joined his convoy on stops in
France, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and Jordan to
support efforts to lift the nine-year-old sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The intercontinental trip has been dubbed the Mariam Convoy
after a five-year-old Iraqi girl Mariam Hamza suffering from
leukemia who Galloway says reflects the consequences of the U.N.
sanctions on the health of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Galloway established the Mariam Appeal in 1998 when he
brought Mariam to Glasgow of Scotland, Britain for leukemia
treatment in a blaze of publicity.
</P>
<P>
Mariam Hamza was the first child that Galloway saw in a ward of
Baghdad Hospital where he visited. Mariam was flown from Baghdad
to Scotland via Amman for emergency treatment at the renowned
Yorkhill Royal Hospital for sick children.
</P>
<P>
After several months, and with leukaemia in full remission,
Mariam was flown back to her eagerly-awaiting family in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Mariam was admitted to Amman's al-Amal Center for cancer
treatment last month. She suffered from neurological disorders
such as blindness, seizure and weakness.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Burundi to Continue Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has called upon all parties involved in the Burundi
conflict to continue with negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The president told a visiting Burundi delegation Saturday that
negotiations should continue on the condition that a facilitator
could be found to succeed Tanzania's former president Julius
Nyerere, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the Burundian delegation led by the Minister
for Foreign Affairs Severin Ntahomvukiye, Mkapa also made it clear
that Tanzania did not mind whether the negotiations continue to be
held in Tanzania or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania does not want to be seen as an obstructionist of the
Burundi peace process, the Sunday Observer newspaper quoted the
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, the Burundi minister said that his government
is willing to continue with the negotiations since there is no
other choice.
</P>
<P>
A political dialog is the only way to reach a lasting political
solution in Burundi,Ntahomvukiye said, expressing his hope that a
new mediator could be appointed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first Hutu
president in October 1993, an estimated 200,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed in fighting between the Hutu
rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
The year-long peace talks aimed at ending the conflict have come
to a standstill following the death last month of former Tanzanian
President Nyerere, who was an active mediator in the Burundi peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya has asked South Africa to
take up the mediator's role. But South Africa has not given a
definite candidate.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda's Son, Victim of Politics: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Wezi Kaunda, a politically
promising son of former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, had been
a victim of politics, a Zambian newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wezi, 58, was shot in the evening last Wednesday by unknown
gunmen at the gate of his residence in Lusaka and died in hospital
on Thursday morning. The cause of this assassination is still
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Old Kaunda was quoted by Zambian newspapers as saying the
killing of Wezi could be the work of insiders within his
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
He said that some UNIP members have got increasingly unsettled
with Wezi' s aspiration for the post of secretary-general at the
party's congress to be held next month.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail newspaper said that Kaunda's revelation that
Wezi was vying for the position could also be somewhat of a
confirmation that Wezi is being lined-up as UNIP presidential
candidate for the 2001 general elections.
</P>
<P>
UNIP Chairman Malimba Masheke has called for calm and restraint
as careless remarks and conduct could only inflame the situation
and create confusion within the party.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is important to wait for the police to complete
their investigations.
</P>
<P>
The government must stand up to protect its citizens because
"many dignitaries have died in similar circumstances," Masheke
urged.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has said that his
government would thoroughly investigate into the murder, promising
to bring those responsible to book.

</P>
<P>
The visit by 100 Egyptian businessmen is aimed at attracting
British investments and encouraging British companies to
contribute to private projects and joint ventures in Egypt, Ghali

U.S. dollars in Egypt's 175 projects, making it the largest
European investor in Egypt and the second largest worldwide after
the United States.
</P>
<P>
A mission representing 100 British companies came to Egypt in
November 1998 and toured a number of towns to seek investment and
trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume stood at 1.28 billion dollars between the two
countries in the first 10 months of 1999, with British imports
amounting to 465 million dollars. Britain is the third largest

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister
Prince Saud Al-Faisal on Sunday called on the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states to unify their political, economic and
security policies to counter future challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We want the GCC to be a credible deterrent and solid fort
against any aggression," said Saud at the opening session of the
two-day GCC foreign ministers' meeting, which are being held in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this aim, Saud said, "we must have a frank view of
our future needs, which are based on common interest and solid
ties."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said the Gulf alliance, which was
established in 1981, has proved it is capable of making progress
in face of difficulties and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the GCC states including Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are
meeting to prepare for the 20th GCC summit, due in Riyadh on
November 27.
</P>
<P>
Prince Saud, currently chairman of GCC foreign ministers'
meeting, said economic issues topped the agenda of their
meeting. They will also discuss military, security media and
legal issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier reports available here said the Iraqi issue
and Gulf security and stability are likely to dominate the
discussions of the GCC diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will re GCC diplomatic sources, quoted by Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the officials will also discuss the dispute
between the UAE and Iran over the islands of Abu Moussa and
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located in the Strait of
Hormuz in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Both UAE and Iran claim the three strategic islands, which
have been controlled by Tehran since Britain retreated from
the region in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Storms Cause Flooding, Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A storm sweeping across Italy
caused extensive damage, flooding, high water in Venice, the
closing of mountain passes and even the re-routing of trains
between Bologna and Milan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the north, flooding closed many rural roads while snow
forced the closing of the Stelvio, Giovo and Pennes Passes.
</P>
<P>
The Rombo and Stalle Passes were already closed. For all other
passes and roads in the Mountain Dolomites, the highway patrol was
warned motorists to be equipped with chains and to exercise
caution above 1,300 meters because of icy conditions.
</P>
<P>
Venice reported high water Sunday morning with tides running
116 centimeters above normal, the third highest it has been all
year.
</P>
<P>
Because of flooding from the Lavino River, the state railways
were forced to re- direct trains running between Bologna and
Milan, as a precautionary measure, for much of the morning.
</P>
<P>
Firemen in Rome spent much of the night clearing fallen trees,
especially along the roads leading in and out of the city, a
problem that also plagued Liguria, Piedmont and Tuscany, while
coastline in the Marches was slashed by high waves.
</P>
<P>
High winds were also responsible for the death of an amateur
soccer club manager who was crushed by a tree that fell on the
bench he was sitting on while watching a match, The incident took
place in Castelfranco di Sotti, near Pisa. Three other people were
taken to hospital.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Carry Out Privatization With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The privatization process
in Tanzania needs to be approached with caution for the benefit of
 the workers, investors and the government, a senior Tanzanian
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Though it is urgent to privatize the parastatals, there is a
need to take into account the economic situation, Permanent
Secretary of the Tanzanian Planning Commission Charles Mutalemwa
said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to create an ideal environment within the
enterprise which would lead into a smooth take-over by an
investor, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The pace of privatization has been stalled by a number of
factors, Mutalemwa said. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"Some workers went to court to seek injunctions to stop the
exercise," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government established the so-called fast track
system early this year to hasten the pace of privatizing a
particular category of parastatal organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the system, a total of 15 parastatals
have been cleared, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Parastatal Sector Reform Commission has reportedly presided
over the divestiture of 263 parastatal organizations and a total
of 395 parastatals were entrusted to the commission by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Since the commission was established in 1993, public
corporations and production concerns in Tanzania have been
privatized to ease the government of budget burden.

<HEADLINE> Strategy Against AIDS Needs Popular Participation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada said here Sunday that the strategy against HIV/AIDS depends
upon the cooperation of the whole society.
</P>
<P>
While the government has its priority to do everything to curb
the pandemic, the participation of people in all walks of life is
also very much necessary, the president told the First
International Conference on HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia opened here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The conference was designed to promote public realization of
the danger and harm of HIV/AIDS both inside and outside Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The deadly AIDS has become a great obstacle to the development
of Ethiopia and other African countries, said Negasso.
</P>
<P>
The president said that illiteracy and poverty had apparently
prompted the rampancy of the killer disease throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 professionals, representatives of the governments,
officials of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and
diplomats participated in the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
An international education campaign and a social mobilization
against HIV/AIDS are expected, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
According to Seyoum Ayehunie, the conference's scientific
chairman, some 34 million people in the world have been infected
with HIV/AIDS, of which Ethiopian cases have amounted to three
million.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 800,000 children in Ethiopia have reportedly
become orphans after their parents died of AIDS.

<HEADLINE> British Queen Starts Africa Tour in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British Queen Elizabeth began a
three- nation African tour Sunday with a state visit to Ghana, her
first tour to the former British colony since 1961, according to
information from Accra.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings greeted the royal couple at
the Kotoka International Airport in capital Accra, with thousands
of cheering Ghanaians waving flags of the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, the Queen, accompanied by her husband Prince
Philip, will hold talks with Rawlings, address Ghana's parliament
and attend a traditional Durbar meeting of the country's tribal
chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Ghana gained independence in 1957 from British colonial rule
and became a republic in 1960. The country had suffered decades
of political instability and economic downgrade until entering the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Ghana hopes the visit will mean more aid from Britain, its
biggest trading partner with substantial mining, manufacturing
interests in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Queen is to leave Ghana for South Africa Tuesday, where she
will open the biannual Commonwealth heads of government summit,
and concludes his three-country African tour in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denounces Netanya Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) strongly denounced Sunday the bomb explosion that took place
in Israeli coastal city of Netanya Sunday morning and injured more
than 20 people.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Palestinian Presidential Office
Al-Tayib Abdul-Rahim was quoted by the Palestine News Agency
(WAFA) as saying that the PNA considers the attack a "design
targeting the breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process after the Sharm El-Sheikh and Oslo summits."
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the attack is to undermine the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process as we are on the threshold of the final-status
talks and the settlement of the remaining issues of the interim
stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No one is unaware of the elements behind such attacks who
oppose the national project and seek to undermine the peace
process to prevent the Palestinian people from restoring their
rights," the PNA official added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that before and after Sharm El-Sheikh deal, the
Islamic Jihad, Hamas and Hezbollah organizations joined hands in
in carrying out military operations to hinder the the
implementation of the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
The PNA made great efforts to foil such plans and the
Palestinian security organs managed recently to abort some of
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the remarks of the Israeli leaders that the
Netanya would not hold back the final-status talks and the
requirements of the interim stage," Al-Tayib added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks are scheduled to
start in Ramallah Monday and the Israeli troops are expected to
pull out from 5 percent of the West Bank areas on Tuesday under
the Sharm El-Sheikh memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The pro-peace front should, according to the PNA official,
beware of the designs of the few opponents of peace in both sides
who try to abort momentum of the peace process after the recent
Oslo summit and to prevent a potential political solution.
</P>
<P>
The PNA abides strictly by all its obligations under the signed
accords, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El-Sheikh memorandum the PNA vowed to toughen
its crackdown on the terror attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator in the final-status
talks Yasser Abd-Rabbo condemned the Netanya blast as targeting
the promising environment prepared by the Palestinians and Israelis
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police arrested a Palestinian man and a woman who
are suspected of involvement in the bomb blast in a main street in
Netanya while no organization claimed responsibility for the
attack so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak renewed his government
determination to uproot terrorism and urged the Palestinian side
to prevent the hardliners from harming the peace endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Minister of Defense Akram Sneh said the Sunday
explosion would not hinder the Monday talks. The few opponents
of peace would not be allowed to undermine the peace process, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place just one day after Hamas reportedly
distributed a leaflet threatening to attack Israeli targets.

JERUSALEM -- Israel has rejected 40 percent of the
Palestinians who have applied for using the safe passage between
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, local daily Ha'aretz reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the route 11 days ago, some 10,000
applications have been submitted, but the Israeli security
authorities have issued the necessary magnetic cards to only
about 6,000 Palestinians, a senior security source told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The high rejection rate grows out of the fact that a large
proportion of the applicants are residents of Gaza who are on the
list of those barred from entering Israel, and some of the
applications are still being processed, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala FRG Claims Victory in Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala's rightist
Guatemalan republican Frong (FRG) early Monday morning claimed
that its candidate Alfonso Portillo won 52.4 votes in Sunday's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But reports said Guatemala's first peacetime presidential
election in nearly 40 years appeared headed for a runoff as
fragmentary results Monday suggested no candidate had captured the
50 percent needed to win outright.
</P>
<P>
With 41 percent of the votes in the capital district reported _
and none from anywhere else _ Oscar Berger of the ruling party and
conservative Alfonso Portillo were almost tied. Nine other
candidates trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
The voting Sunday was quiet, with no signs of the heavy
military presence that marked past elections. The Electoral
Tribunal estimated that more than 50 percent of the 4.46 million
registered voters had gone to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala began its first presidential election Sunday after
the signing of peace accords in 1996 which ended the 36-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
During the voting, while most Guatemalans said they wish the
government to continue implementing the peace accords, most are
more concerned about their subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 international observers and 2,000 local observers were
in Guatemala City to supervise the elections to guarantee the
transparency of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the electoral law, the presidential candidate winning at
least 51 percent of the votes will be the elected president who
will take office on January 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
If none of them gets the absolute majority, the top two will
continue a runoff on December 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Alberto Zaccheroni was voted the
top coach in Serie A last season by his Italian league
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Zaccheroni guided AC Milan to the 1998-1999 season league title
in his first year with the club.
</P>
<P>
But Zaccheroni nearly lost his job days ago as AC Milan was
eliminated from the European cup play after losing to Turkish team
Galatasaray 3-2.
</P>
<P>
He quickly put himself on stronger ground on Sunday as AC Milan
beat Venezia 3-0 to keep unbeaten in the league.
</P>
<P>
Zaccheroni said he was happy to get the Golden Bench award but
joked that he hopes not to meet the same fate as last year's
winner Luigi Simoni.
</P>
<P>
Simoni was fired by Inter Milan within hours of learning he had
been selected the best coach of the season.

<HEADLINE> Russia Active in Handling Refugee Problem: Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia can solve the North
Caucasus issues on its own abilities and is adopting vigorous
measures to cope with the Chechen refugee problem, said Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and Shoigu made this statement at a briefing after a
meeting with the Group- 8 ambassadors, the ambassador of Finland,
which now holds the rotating European Union presidency, and the
envoy of Norway, which chairs the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian government can solve all the problems that have
emerged in the North Caucasus on its own," Ivanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow is ready to "positively consider" humanitarian
aid proposals coming from international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no talk and can not be any talk about international
sanctions against Russia," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"A rigorous tone should not be used in dealing with Russia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the term "humanitarian catastrophe" should be
used more carefully.
</P>
<P>
"There was no humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, and this term
was used exclusively to justify the NATO military operation in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that rumors about a humanitarian catastrophe in the
North Caucasus are being spread "for the sole purpose of putting
pressure on Russia."
</P>
<P>
"It's a banal scenario which was also used in the Balkans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu absolutely agreed with Ivanov in that the Russian
government is capable of dealing with its problems in the North
Caucasus by itself.
</P>
<P>
"We have everything we need to create normal living conditions
for the displaced persons from Chechnya," said Shoigu.
</P>
<P>
"There is no talk about any humanitarian catastrophe," he said,
adding that refugees are gradually returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"The first ten buses brought groups of Chechen refugees to
their home villages Sunday," said Shoigu.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Frees 13 Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) Monday released 13 Lebanese prisoners on humanitarian
reasons, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that all prisoners, who were detained for
collaborating with Lebanese guerrillas to fight Israeli forces,
were taken by the SLA from Khiam jail in south Lebanon to their
homes inside the Israeli-occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces and its ally SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Lebanese are still held without any trial in the
jail, which has been run by the militia under Israeli
supervision.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leaders Injured in Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Four veteran leaders of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) were injured seriously as
police fired shotguns into their procession here Monday on the
second day of the opposition's dawn-to-dusk countrywide hartal
(strike).
</P>
<P>
The shootings triggered angry street protests in various parts
of the capital city and the opposition planned tougher action
programs.
</P>
<P>
Among the four injured was city party chief Sadek Hossain
Khoka.
</P>
<P>
The three other leaders hit by pellets are former minister and
BNP Joint Secretary General Abdullah Al Noman, opposition whip
Joynal Abedin Farugue and Dhaka City Corporation Commissioner of
the local ward Nabiullah Nabi.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 other BNP activists were also injured in the massive
troubles that erupted when the procession came under police
attack, witnesses and opposition sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police fired dozens of teargas shells to scare off the
protesters as BNP leaders and activists tried to take out a
procession from their party central office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League brought out big anti-hartal
processions in the capital as well as other cities in the country
protesting the two-day hartal called by the BNP-led opposition
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Mohammad Nasim Monday strongly criticized the
opposition for resorting to frequent hartals, saying that they
have been making the people hostage, disrupting normal life and
hindering the education of the children.
</P>
<P>
Making a statement in the parliament, Nasim called upon the
opposition to refrain from creating chaos in the country and join
parliament in response to the call of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
to settle all issues through discussion.
</P>
<P>
At least two people were killed on the first day of the hartal,
enforced by the opposition alliance to press their demand for
resignation of the government.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As computers revolutionize many aspects of life, military
officials have stepped up development of cyber weapons and spoken
ominously of their potential to change the nature of war. Instead
of risking planes to bomb power grids, telephone exchanges or rail
lines, for example, Pentagon planners envision soldiers at
computer terminals silently invading foreign networks to shut down
electrical facilities, interrupt phone service, crash trains and
disrupt financial systems.
</P>
<P>
-- Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a former state governor and
cabinet minister seen as the favored candidate of Mexico's ruling
party establishment, appeared to have won a landslide victory in
the country's first presidential primary Sunday, according to
preliminary official returns and independent exit polls.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. State Department will offer paid trips home for
hundreds of government employees and family members from Russia
and three other former Soviet republics before Jan, because of
concerns over Year 2000 computer problems, even though experts at
the American Embassy in Moscow conclude there is virtually no risk
to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
-- A bitter struggle has erupted over a plan by President
Clinton to allow states to pay unemployment benefits to workers
who take time off to care for newborns. The policy could help
millions of people struggling to balance the demands of work and
family, White House officials said. But employers and many state
officials said Mr. Clinton was exceeding his legal authority.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft was found by a federal judge to be a relentless
and predatory monopolist, in a harsh rebuke to the company and
Chairman Bill Gates. The preliminary ruling comes as Microsoft is
in the midst of talks with potential partners in the cable and
telecommunications industries. A meeting with the judge is likely
to examine settlement prospects, people close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
-- Three pipe bombs in Israel wounded 33 people in the coastal
town of Netanya on the eve of talks on a permanent peace accord
with the Palestinians. Separately, the son and heir apparent of
Syria's leader said that he hopes talks with Israel will open soon.

<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China voiced its strong
indignation and firm opposition to a decision by U.S. immigration
authorities to grant political asylum in the United States to a
Chinese Falun Gong practitioner.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that
China has made solemn representations to the U.S. on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Falun Gong organization is an evil cult
that jeopardizes the Chinese society and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The banning of the organization by the Chinese government
according to law is aimed at protecting the fundamental human
rights and freedom of Chinese citizens, and it is also an
effective measure for safeguarding social stability and preventing
the organization from bringing greater harm to the public, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's handling of the Falun Gong problem has
earned staunch support from the people across the country and the
understanding of the international community, Zhang noted.

She noted that the Chinese government will only punish,
according to law, a small number of criminals who have designed,
organized and incited turmoils. Meanwhile, the government will
educate and unite the overwhelming majority of practitioners,
therefore, there is no problem of so-called persecution of Falun
Gong practitioners, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. immigration officials, disregarding these basic
facts, went so far as to grant so-called political asylum to a
Falun Gong practitioner, she said, adding that this is a typical
demonstration of the double standard the U.S. side adopts on the
cult problem.
</P>
<P>
"This is a groundless charge against the Chinese government and
a gross interference in China's internal affairs," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the U.S. government understand and respect the
Chinese government's principled stand in handling the Falun Gong
problem by correcting this erroneous act of the U.S. immigration
authorities, and no longer interfere in China's internal affairs,
so as to avoid bringing more difficulties to Sino-U.S. ties," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Mediation Between Iran and U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Monday expressed welcome to mediation by any third
country between Iran and the United States aimed to "convince
Washington to change its hostile policy toward Tehran."
</P>
<P>
"If a third country is interested in making an attempt in this
connection by conveying the realities and accomplishing the task
on time, it is a good idea," Kharrazi said in an exclusive
interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied rumors that Britain is currently mediating
between Iran and the U.S., saying that there is no talk of
mediation and that the required political will should exist in the
two countries before they can speak of mediation.
</P>
<P>
"If other countries could talk to the Americans and convince
them to change their attitude, it is desirous, otherwise, there
will be no talk about mediation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent U.S. proposal of unconditional talks
with Iran, Kharrazi said Washington translates Iran's demand that
the U.S. change its hostile attitude towards Iran to
pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the U.S. continues its hostile
policies, talks would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there have been instances in which the
U.S. has changed its stance, such as in the case of fighting drugs
and excluding Iran's name in their list.
</P>
<P>
Last month, several senior U.S. officials, including Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk and State Department spokesman
James Rubin, called for "unconditional dialog" between Washington
and Tehran to set a road map for a normal relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Vice President Al Gore later termed Iran as a
"repressive and fundamentalist regime," which angered Iranian
officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday ruled
out the possibility of a resumption of ties between Iran and the
U.S., and termed the campaign against "U.S. arrogance" as "an
innate part of the Islamic revolution."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on
Sunday that the U.S. has no unified policy toward Iran and the
stand taken by the U.S. officials are contradictory.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the contradictions of the U.S. officials are
obvious in their words and deeds, adding that if the U.S. is
honest about what it says in this respect, it is required to
remove the high wall of mistrust between the two countries by
taking practical steps.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after
Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held the
embassy staff hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, there was exchange of goodwill
signals, but Tehran insisted that Washington must change its
policy before any direct talks can begin.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Spells Out Qualifications for New Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Burundian military
government has spelled out qualifications of a new mediator in the
country's peace talks which have been stalled since former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere died last month, Tanzania's
"Guardian" newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a document circulated in the countries of the
Great Lakes region, the Burundian government said that a new
mediator should have international stature, professional
competence, moral and political authority, neutrality and
spiritual independence, and be acceptable to all parties in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"A new mediator should be designated without delay so as to
avoid any straying away and various conjectures, which might
undermine, if not completely destroy, all advances already
accomplished," says the document.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government also reiterated its commitment to
continued negotiations in an irrevocable manner for peace and
national reconciliation, until a comprehensive peace agreement was
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burundian foreign minister Severin Ntahomvukiye
suggested that the new facilitator should come from outside the
Great Lakes region when he met Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
in Dar es Salaam last Saturday, the "Guardian" quoted reliable
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first Hutu
president in October 1993, an estimated 200,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed in the fighting between Hutu
rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
Year-long peace talks aimed to end Burundi's conflict in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha have failed to make much
progress in reaching a settlement to the war.

TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari on Monday criticized European countries
for not offering serious assistance to Iran in its fight against
drug trafficking.

Lari expressed hope that European countries would play their

community's call for a dialogue to address the root causes of
tension between Pakistan and India, including specifically
Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who had served as Pakistan's high
commissioner in India for six years, attributed the protracted
hostility between the two South Asian neighbors to India's faults.
</P>
<P>
He said reduction of tension between the two countries is
"obviously desirable" and "Pakistan wants to improve relations,"
but India "does not give the prospect a chance."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of resolving differences on the basis of law and
justice, it seeks to exploit power disparity to impose unilateral
preferences," he said, adding "attempts at domination and
dictation cannot be an acceptable basis for international
relations."
</P>
<P>
Sattar also urged India to give the Kashmiri people "their
inherent right" of self-determination. "It was pledged to them by
India as well as Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Viewed as a hardliner in Islamabad, Sattar, however, denied
that Pakistan's policy towards India will become stronger. He said
he will act under the guidance of the objects of the current
government and in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan will continue to implement the Lahore
Declaration signed by deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his
Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee in February this year,
saying the new government will respect all binding agreements and
international laws endorsed by all preceding governments in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the forthcoming summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Sattar blamed India
for being "unmindful of the injurious blow to the hopes implicit
in SAARC" through "unilaterally aborting the scheduled summit."
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has quested to postpone the summit, which was
scheduled to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal, from November 26 to 28.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- During his visit to Russia, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
emphasized that Turkey attaches great importance to relations with
Russia. There has been even an atmosphere in Turkey of forming a
strategic partnership with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a declaration was signed to form a cooperation
against terror and the fact that ways to accelerate economic
relations have been sought for, were the positive outcome of the
visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara lost a big point as the Russian operations
continue in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- The United States does not deliver compressor station for
the Turko-Iranian natural gas pipeline. If the line is not
completed by the end of the year, Turkey will pay 200 million
U.S. dollars annually to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which pressed Ecevit not to sign the Blue Stream
Project while in Moscow, was found out to prevent for six months
the Iranian Natural Gas Project. The natural gas agreement with
Iran was signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- As the number of Chechen refugees at the Turkish border
increases, Turkey is once again reminded of its much debated
Ottoman Empire legacy.
</P>
<P>
In the post-Cold War era, Turkey had to struggle with several
massive influxes of refugees. All of these people were once
subjects of the Ottoman Empire.

<HEADLINE> Containing Nuclear Danger to Get Top Priority: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Monday said containing nuclear dangers in South Asia
will be accorded top priority of the present government, but
Pakistan will maintain minimum credible deterrence.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing his maiden press conference here after
assuming charge of his portfolio as the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will not take a provocative initiative. We will
remain sensitive to the world community's concerns for
non-proliferation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said that Pakistan would not participate in piling
strategic arsenals. "A nuclear arms race by Pakistan is a figment.
We cannot afford it. Nor it is necessary."
</P>
<P>
On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), he said, Pakistan
has "no objection in principle to the treaty" but the people need
to be assured against the "discriminatory approach on part of one
or more nuclear weapon powers, offering rewards to one signatory
but refusing to extend the same to another."
</P>
<P>
He said, "clarification on this aspect and removal of sanctions
will be indispensable for domestic consensus on this sensitive
issue."
</P>
<P>
On the present government's foreign policy, Sattar said:
"principles of international law, norms of peaceful coexistence
and reciprocity" will be the guide in the promotion of "mutually
beneficial relations with all countries."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of Pakistan's relations with the
Gulf countries. He said Pakistan will make unremitting efforts to
"reconstruct and fortify" mutual confidence and enhance
cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said that Pakistan cherished its partnership with China,
saying the bonds between the two peoples "contributed to global
stability" and is "a cornerstone for peace and security in the
region."
</P>
<P>
It will be Pakistan's constant endeavor to expand cooperation
with the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and
other industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"Their economic assistance has contributed to development of
our economy. Greater access to their markets and flow of
investment are crucial to our hopes for modernization," Sattar
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Pakistan desires peace and unity
the war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Ground realities recommend more intense dialogue and
engagement with the Afghan government and observance of
international norms by all including Afghanistan," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Beats Nepal 5-0 in Asian Women's Football Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iloilo City, Philippines, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The host
Philippines, led by star midfielder Camaclang, scored a 5-0 win
over Nepal Monday in the 12th Asian Women's Football Championship
at the Iloilo Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
The petite and pretty midfielder provided the spark by scoring
the first two goals as the Filipina eleven chalked up their
initial victory in Group C--and their first ever in the tourney
since they began competing in this event in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nami Otake scored four goals to power Japan to a 9-0
rout of Thailand in the same group.
</P>
<P>
"We were able to execute our game plan well and keep the
pressure on our opponents. This win is great for us," said
Philippine coach Marlon Maro after the well-earned accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by 2,000 Ilonggo fans, Camaclang galvanized her
teammates with a looping 35-yard goal in the 20th minute, the ball
landing just behind Nepal goalie Lila Tapa, bouncing into the top
left corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Camaclang, who underwent a two-month training stint in the
United States just before the start of the tournament, then added
her second just before the interval in what could be considered
the goal of the match.
</P>
<P>
Amid a swarm of Nepalese defenders, the diminutive Filipina saw
a slight opening and volleyed from 20 feet inside the goalbox that
gave the Philippines a 2-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The host team never looked back after that as they continued to
dominate the second half, with Karen Cacho (76th), Shella
Barlovento (80th) and Rachel delos Reyes (90th) adding to the
tally.
</P>
<P>
They were also able to survive the loss of first string forward
Marinella Salvador who pulled out of the tournament on Sunday due
to nagging back injury. She was replaced by Karen Octaviano.
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is to reach the semifinals. With this win, I
think we have a good chance," added Maro later as his charges had
a three-day respite before going up against Uzbekistan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maro said the Uzbeks were practically the same team they lost
to 1-3 in the 1997 Asian championship held in Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
"But I believe we are better prepared for them this time," Maro
said.
</P>
<P>
The pone-tailed Otake, a Women's World Cup veteran and Japan's
top striker, toyed with the Thai defense in the first half to
score goals in the 10th, 35th, 39th and 45th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Highlight of that scoring rampage was her second goal, a solo
breakaway where she eluded one Thai defender before outfoxing Thai
goalie Praew Semaksuk to blast in a 20-foot roller.
</P>
<P>
Asako Takakura (10th and 26th) and Tamaki Uchiyama (17th and
45th)added two goals apiece while Yasuyo Tamagaishi (6th)
accounted for the other Japanese goal.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our players are new faces after the World Cup. We were
a bit tentative. But the match went well," said Japanese coach
Suzuki Tamotsu through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Suzuki added they were keen on topping their group to assure
their place in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Kazakhstan defeated Hong Kong, China 8-0 in the
Group B in Bacolod City.
</P>
<P>
Play will resume in Bacolod City on Tuesday with China gunning
for its second win against Guam at 4:00 p.m. and Kazakhstan trying
to keep pace when it faces South Korea at 6:00 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Accepts Adviser's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Monday his decision to let his presidential
adviser on Low Cost and Open Market Housing Luis Yulo go, while
expressing "deep regret" in losing a member of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the president noted Yulo's resignation letter
in which he aired concerns over reports linking him to a string of
cases which he said, could take his mind of his duties in
implementing the housing program of the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
"I have therefore reluctantly agreed to his request to be
relieved of his responsibilities effective immediately," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper reported earlier that there are at least nine cases
pending against Yulo, one of which has an outstanding warrant of
arrest issued against him.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors have demanded for Yulo's resignation, saying he
would have no credibility in providing President Estrada advise in
handling the housing program, if he is facing criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said President Estrada is
still not considering any replacement for Yulo, confident that the
latter's resignation will not disrupt the implementation of the
housing program of the government.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Foreign Troops Fighting for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
denied involvement of foreign troops in the Angolan civil war in
favor of the government.
</P>
<P>
The government categorically refuted the report in the
"Saturday Star", a South African weekly, which said that a
2,000-strong Zimbabwean contingent had been found in the Angolan
territory fighting alongside the government troops against the
Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government said in a communique, obtained here
Monday, that such news was invented as a lame excuse for the
recent defeat inflicted on the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), which was considered as
combat-worthy and well organized forces.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government considers the illegal existence of the
armed forces of UNITA as an internal affair and a result of the
non- implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which was signed in
1994 by the government and UNITA, stipulating the disarmament of
the rebel organization, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, secretary-general of the ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola Joao Lourenco said that UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi had "few days for continuing his flight".

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Denounces Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Moves (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fact is that the motherland has always maintained that the
two sides should hold talks under the principle of "one China." It
has never suggested that the two have talks in the name of central
government-to-local government and that Taiwan is a renegade
province.
</P>
<P>
"This is a 'scarecrow' set up by Lee and his kind," the
newspaper said, adding that "whenever their splittist moves met
with the displeasure of the Chinese nation, they would make
themselves look like victims so as to win the world's sympathy."
</P>
<P>
When Lee made public his "two states" statement, he was harshly
criticized by the Chinese people at home and abroad. He was also
deemed a troublemaker by the international community, who,
meanwhile, reiterated their stand of "one China."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed out that to divert people's attention and
cover up his ineffective leadership in Taiwan's earthquake relief,
Lee has launched a smear campaign against the motherland and used
every occasion to sell his "two states" theory.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Lee has put his support behind some
people in Taiwan who have concocted, in line with his "two states"
statement, the so-called "basic law" of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely dangerous move," the newspaper warned,
adding that the real motives are to split the island from the
motherland and make it impossible for the motherland to be
reunited.
</P>
<P>
Peddling his "two states" theory and "special state-to-state
relationship" in the American journal, Lee has again sounded the
alarm to the whole Chinese nation that he will try anything
necessary to promote his splittist stand, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that so long as Lee does not give up his splittist
position of "two states," the Chinese people will never stop their
struggle against the separatism and "independence of Taiwan."

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Denounces Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Moves (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's leading national
newspaper, the People's Daily, carried a signed article today
denouncing Lee Teng-hui's splittist remarks in his article
appearing in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, a bi-monthly
American journal.
</P>
<P>
Lee's article further exposes his will to betray the Chinese
nation and split the motherland, the Daily stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lee clearly reveals his separatist intentions by harping on the
so-called split of China, Beijing's military threat and the
statehood of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also complains that the international community has ignored
the island's achievements, saying that the world should let Taiwan
play a responsible role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
By openly deviating from the principle of "one China" and
stubbornly insisting on his splittist ideas, Lee has once again
brought to the world's attention his desire for "two states" and a
"special state-to-state relationship" between Taiwan and the
motherland, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Lee's sinister intentions are meant to shape world opinion,
internationalize the issue of Taiwan, drag in some anti-China
forces and eventually split the island from China, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But nothing will alter the fate of the "two states" theory
advocated by Lee. "No matter how glib a tongue Lee has, the world
will not believe in his lies," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Lee denied the historic fact that there is only
one China and that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Lee's distortion of history only demonstrates that he has gone
so far in his pursuit of separation as to have no regard for basic
facts," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also claimed repeatedly in the article that Beijing regards
Taiwan as a "renegade province."
</P>
<P>
"This is a big lie designed to distort world opinion," the
newspaper stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The first conference of the
Mainland-Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission is aimed at "providing a high-level exchange and
liaison channel for both commercial and trade departments,"
according to An Min, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
As the first high-level liaison mechanism established between
both sides in commerce and trade since Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, it will open a new door for bilateral trade
cooperation, said Chau Tak Hay, secretary for Trade and Industry
of the HKSAR Government, who co-chaired the conference with An.
</P>
<P>
The work of the commission will be carried out under two
principles: It will follow the Basic Law of HKSAR and proceed
within the framework of trade relationship between a sovereign
state and an individual customs zone. It will not infringe upon
the trade laws of both the Chinese mainland and HKSAR, but instead
abide by the regular conventions governing international trade
activities.

<P>
Chau, who is heading HK's largest official trade delegation to
visit Beijing since HK returned on July 1, 1997, showed his
approval of the scope and working mode of the commission.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, the four special working groups
under the commission will convene meetings on trade, investment,
contracting projects and labor management, technical trade, and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The mainland and HK have become each other's largest trade
partners after nearly 20 years of development.
</P>
<P>
At present, the export volume of the mainland to HK registers
over one fifth of the total export volume, while HK has always
been the primary source of overseas capital to the mainland by
taking up half of the total the mainland has absorbed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that trade between the Chinese mainland and HK
has dropped continuously for the past years due to the Asian
financial crisis, bilateral trade reported an increase of 6.7
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the recuperative growth in export of the mainland
and the gradual recovery of the Asian economy, HK's trade has
shown signs of recovery as well," Chau said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua)-- China's housing reform is
progressing smoothly, with 24 provinces and autonomous regions as
well as 35 large and medium-sized cities releasing detailed plans,
according to the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The ministry source said that provinces such as Jiangsu, Hebei
and Hunan have completed a survey of housing conditions, and other
provinces have announced regulations for selling houses.
</P>
<P>
According to the housing plan released in August, China will
stop allocating houses as a form of welfare and new houses and
older public-owned housing will be sold rather than rented.
</P>
<P>
Government employees will have to buy their houses with public
housing funds and loans. People living in poverty can qualify for
low-income housing offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
People without housing or living in sub-standard housing can
apply for housing subsidies based on their length of employment
prior to the establishment of the public housing fund system.
</P>
<P>
The plan also stipulated that the Chinese government will
gradually raise rents on the present public-owned apartments,
while families in extreme poverty, even those receiving subsidies,
are eligible for exemptions or rent reduction.

Chea Sophara was formally appointed mayor of Phnom Penh, the
capital of Cambodia with one million citizens, by the king on

</P>
<P>
The governorship has been vacant for nearly a year since the
new coalition government was formed in November last year, until

Ranariddh reached an agreement recently to put Chea Sophara in the
slot.

The university was formed last September by combining four

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Monday voiced Tehran's readiness for talks with Iraq
over remaining issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic
News Agency, Kharrazi said Iran has tried to solve wartime
problems, and "if the Iraqis showed more cooperation, especially
in determining the fate of the Iranian prisoners of war,"
outstanding issues would be solved in a more smooth manner.
</P>
<P>
"However, due to certain imaginations which are mainly
generated by pressures, they (Iraqis) frequently adopt
unpredictable stances which makes the task difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in a difficult condition and under heavy economic,
social and international pressures, and as a result of such
pressures, Iraqi officials might make imaginary interpretations of
every single move, the minister elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of the territorial integrity
of Iraq, saying that no foreign interference should be made in the
internal affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have taken some positive steps in the past two
years to solve the remaining issues of the 1980-1988 bloody war
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadar arrived in
Baghdad on Saturday for a five-day visit aimed to to boost trade
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic relations between the two countries still
remain at the level of charge d'affaires and each side hosts and
supports the opposition groups of the other.

BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Narcotics will remain a threat
to the world in the next millennium, visiting Director of the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the International Law
Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Bangkok, Freeh said threats to the
new millennium are in most cases the same as in the outgoing
century.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned methamphetamine, saying its production,
consumption and distribution have become much more pronounced
recently in all the countries he has just visited.
</P>
<P>
Freeh is currently on a five-Asian nation tour, which has
already taken him to Japan, the Philippines and Singapore. He will
also visit South Korea after Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The FBI chief said methamphetamine has become one of the
fastest growing narcotics problems within the United States.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said that as a result of globalization and technological
development, criminals are able to move and communicate quicker
than ever.
</P>
<P>
"It means the border between our countries and jurisdiction
between our police agencies have less and less importance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is to apply the rules of law and be as
competent, fast moving and coordinated as those who break the
laws, using the advantages of globalization and technology," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Freeh called for better efforts in law enforcement
internationally and regionally, saying the new millennium will
require international cooperation at an unprecedented level.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement and public safety issues must be given the
highest priority, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (WEST BANK), November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators for final-status talks ended their first
meeting here on Monday, saying the talks were "historic."
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters After their two-hour meeting, Oded Eran,
head of the Israel's final-status negotiating team, and his
Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the first meeting
was a historic movement for the final-status talks, as well as for
the entire Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting was conducted in a friendly atmosphere,
which could be described as "open, frank and without any
barriers," Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides issued their respective
statement regarding the principles for the final-status talks and
discussed the specific agendas for future talks to be held at
different levels, Rabbo added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides decided to hold two or three meetings a week and the
next meeting will be held again in Ramallah on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Eran said that "although we can not totally agree
with what has been stated by Rabbo concerning the Palestinian
principle policy for the final-status talks, the meeting opened
the historic process for the final-status talks between us."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side will make joint efforts with the Palestinians
to reach agreements within the time-frame stipulated by the signed
agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the so-called "back channel" contacts between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat as part of the final-status talks, Eran and Rabbo said
there are no conflicts between meetings of leaders and negotiating
teams.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Rabbo's call that Israel immediately halt the
settlement activities which the Palestinians regard as illegal,
Eren said the 1993 Oslo Accord and other signed agreements have
already defined how this issue will be solved and this issue will
definitely be resolved in the framework agreement by next February.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have different explanations of the United Nations
resolutions 242 and 338, the Oslo Accord will serve as a solid
base for reaching a permanent agreement between the two sides,
Eran said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also expressed their confidence that the framework
agreement will be reached by the February next year. A final
accord will be in place by September, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Start Final Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (WEST BANK), November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators started the final status talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah Monday to resolve the thorniest issues
between them.
</P>
<P>
The historic talks opened at the Grand Park Hotel here with the
participation of Oded Eran, head of the Israeli negotiating team,
and Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the Palestinian team and
information minister of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
They made opening speeches to set forth theof the United
Nations and the agreements signed by Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement and the permanent one on the
final-status settlement must include the self-determination of the
Palestinian people, which will be conducive to achieving a
lasting peace in the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Rabbo said, the important issue of the right of the
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland must be
addressed. He pledged the Palestinian Liberation Organization
will do its best to push the final-status talks forward and do
everything possible to guarantee the talks proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The talks opened despite three pipe-bomb attacks on Sunday in
Israel's northern seaside city of Netanya, in which at least 34
people were injured. The bombings were classified as terrorist
attacks, aimed at derailling Monday's final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the bombing attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak vowed to push ahead the talks set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly set out a number of guidelines for the
Israeli delegation: the framework agreement will signal the end of
the conflict between the two sides; the accord will bring about a
separation of political and security between Israel and "the
Palestinian entity"; adherence to the "five red lines" - no return
to the 1967 border, a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital, no
foreign army west of the Jordan Valley, no return of refugees to
Israeli territory and most of the settlements to be absorbed by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians are committed to a framework
agreement by next February and then a final accord on permanent
peace by September, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators have about 100 days to work out the outlines of
an agreement on resolving the issues such as conflicting claims
over Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in occupied territories, return
of Palestinian refugees, final borders between the two sides and
allocation of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched their ceremonial final-status talks on
September 13 at Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
but the talks had been stalled due to Israel's delay in naming the
head of its negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Monday's commencement of talks at the Grand Park Hotel here
will focus on formulating a strategy and schedule for the talks to
proceed and decide whether the six subcommittees, including the
subcommittee on economy, will start their meetings before the
framework agreement has been worked out.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss the next Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank, slated for November 15.
</P>
<P>
The talks on final status issues will prove to be an uphill
task, which requires strong political will from both sides to make
tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat met in Oslo, Norway a week ago, together with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, to renew their pledges to continue
the path of peace in the conflict-stricken Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in Oslo on setting up a new mechanism for the final
status talks and a hotline between Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak and Arafat are meeting in Paris on the
sidelines of the 21st Socialist International conference.

<HEADLINE> Further Interest Rate Rises on the Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- the Australian Reserve Bank
indicated on Monday that inflation will continue to rise and
further interest rate rises are on the way.
</P>
<P>
Five days ago, the bank lifted interest rates a quarter of a
percentage point to head off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its semi-annual statement that "the Consumer
price index is expected to increase by around 2.75 percent over
the year to June 2000. This figure is a good deal higher than the
1.7 per cent for the latest year-ended rise in the CPI."
</P>
<P>
Economists saw the statement as confirmation that at least one,
and possibly as many as three more rate rises of a quarter of a
percentage point were now on the way, beginning early in the new
year.

</P>
<P>
With an overall investment budget of 100 million HK dollars (12.
8 million U.S. dollars), CHINA10K.COM is a pioneer of the new
generation of worldwide information service and entertainment
websites that are set to transform the process of knowledge
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The website aims to deliver a wealth of historical wisdom by
using lively and interesting presentation to bring the past to
life, said Dennis Chan, chief operating officer of the website.
</P>
<P>
"We will exploit the power of the Internet to capture the 10,

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Stronger Commitment to AIDS Control in Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has called on governments in Central America
and the Caribbean to bear stronger political commitment to
fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of an effective vaccine we have little choice
but to drastically scale up our efforts based on lessons learned
and to do everything we possibly can to slow the AIDS epidemic,"
said Olavi Elo, Director of the UNAIDS Department of Country
Planning and Program Development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at the opening of the first Central American
Congress on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS in San Pedro
Sula of Honduras, Elo warned that without political commitment
stretching from national to community levels, there would be no
effective program and no lasting support.
</P>
<P>
Over 1.4 million HIV-infected persons live in Latin America
with an additional 330,000 in the Caribbean, according to the
UNAIDS. The alarming situation there has led the UNAIDS governing
body to recommend at its June 1999 meeting that these areas are
considered priority regions.
</P>
<P>
In Central America, 17,222 cases of AIDS had been reported by
August 31, 1999, with a marked increase among heterosexuals, who
make up 56 percent of the total, said the UNAIDS.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Sell Elephant Tusks for Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
considering a proposal to sell a stockpile of African elephant
tusks worth 25 million rand (4.17 million U.S. dollars) to raise
money for elephant preservation.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Tourism and Environmental Affairs in the
country said on Sunday the proposal would be presented at the 11th
Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the International
Trade of Endangered Species, according to a press report Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal was accepted, the money would be used to
implement a new elephant management program in South Africa's
Kruger National Park.
</P>
<P>
It would also help control the illegal hunting of elephants and
to create protected areas large enough for elephants to live.
</P>
<P>
According to 1999 surveys, the current elephant population in
Kruger is over 9,000 while the ideal elephant population for the
park is 7,000.

<HEADLINE> China's Banking System Y2K-Compliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's banking industry is Y2K-
ready after three nationwide tests, said a central bank official
today.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the millennium bug will not affect
normal operations of the country's banks, said Chen Jing, director
of the payment and technology department with the People's Bank of
China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
All the computer systems have been modified, upgraded and
tested, and contingency plans have been drawn up, the PBOC
official said. "All the banking sector will smoothly pass into
2000."
</P>
<P>
From now on, the Y2K preparations will focus on the continued
review and improvement of the contingency plans, training of staff
and rehearsals in case of emergencies, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that to ensure the smooth transition of the system,
the PBOC has suggested the central government set December 31 as a
holiday, so the banks could be closed to customers and concentrate
on end-year settlements and preparing for the contingency measures.
</P>
<P>
The Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) will also be off to
customers that day, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
As for January 1 and 2, which are traditional holidays for
Chinese, Chen said that the commercial banks will decide for
themselves whether or not to open.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will not set restrictions on drawing money
around the year 2000, noting that runs on banks will not occur as
Chinese customers now have confidence in banks.
</P>
<P>
"Should such circumstances occur, the central bank would
support the commercial banks with plenty of liquidity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the country so far has invested some ten billion yuan
in the Y2K modifications, not including the cost on staff payrolls
and tests.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem originates from the two-digit numbers computer
scientists used in the early stages of computer technology to
indicate years. When the year 2000 comes, the timing systems of
computers may not be able to correctly discern the year 2000 from
1900, which may result in disorder in the computer systems.

<HEADLINE> WWF Accuses Japan of Attempting to Overthrow Whaling Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
WWF) has criticized Japan's scheme to reverse the global
moratorium on whale hunting as the Japanese whaling fleet prepares
to set sail for its 13th "scientific" whale hunt.
</P>
<P>
In a press release distributed here Monday, WWF said that Japan
is using its Official Development Assistance (ODA) to "encourage"
13 pro-whaling countries, many of which from the developing world,
to join the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
</P>
<P>
This would give Japan a majority of votes in the IWC, according
to WWF. It could then overturn the 13-year-old global moratorium
on commercial whaling, which is credited with ending the large-
scale whaling that was devastating the world's whale stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is blatantly misusing development aid to buy votes in
international fora," said Cassandra Phillips, WWF's coordinator
for whales and the Antarctic. "Such steps violate the spirit if
not the law of international treaties."
</P>
<P>
WWF said that the Japanese whaling fleet has hunted whales in
the Southern Ocean around the Antarctic for each of the 13 years
that the global moratorium has been in place. Even after the IWC
declared the whole of the Southern Ocean a sanctuary for whales in
1994, Japan continued to hunt there, it noted.

KATHMANDU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Dr.
Ram Sharan Mahat, ending a three-day visit to Bhutan, said Monday
his country hoped that the 11th summit of the South Asian
Association For Regional Cooperation (SAARC) would take place
soon.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said he and Bhutanese leaders discussed the latest
developments about the SAARC summit.
</P>
<P>
The 11th SAARC summit, which had been scheduled for November
26-28 in Kathmandu, was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Mahat returned home Sunday evening after concluding his
three-day visit. Bilateral issues between Nepal and Bhutan were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said serious discussions were also held on the issue of
repatriating Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of verification of the Bhutanese refugees was
also taken up during the talks with his Bhutanese counterpart. But
the time frame for the verification was not fixed, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the date for refugee verification will be fixed in the
next meeting to be held in Bhutan in a month or two. Bhutan has
also proposed for the meeting," said Mahat.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks have been held so far between
the two countries but they failed to reach an agreement on the
repatriation of the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees who were evicted
from Bhutan around 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said that in discussing the possibility of expanding
bilateral trade, Nepal proposed a new trade treaty with Bhutan and
a review of the high customs tariff levied on Nepalese goods
exported to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The issue of simplification of the Bhutanese visa regime was
also discussed, he said.

<HEADLINE> British FM Calls for Cooperation in Anti-drug Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook on Monday called for effective bilateral and international
cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the call in a message to his Iranian counterpart
Kamal Kharrazi, expressing condolence over the recent killings of
38 Iranian soldiers in combating drug smugglers in southeastern
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security forces were ambushed on Wednesday by drug
traffickers in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan.
Thirty-eight soldiers were killed and over 40 others wounded in
hours of exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
Such a tragic incident further underlines the need for
effective bilateral and international cooperation as well as
increased collaboration in fighting this universal catastrophe,
Cook said in the message.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that his country's efforts towards
effective bilateral cooperation with Iran in its anti-drug
campaign would be dynamically increased.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an Iranian official said that 146 Iranian anti-drug
personnel lost their lives in various operations since the
beginning of this Iranian year in March, bringing the total number
martyred to this end to 2,088 since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly complained that it has been fighting alone
against drug trafficking and claims that it spends over 8,000
billion rials (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) annually on
fighting drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The country has been a transit for drug trafficking from
Afghanistan to European and the Gulf markets.

Clarifying a news report Sunday that Australia said Malaysia

<HEADLINE> BC-Palestine-Israel-Final Status Talks 4th Ld-Add ... proceed smoothly. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talks opened despite three pipe-bomb attacks on Sunday in
Israel's northern seaside city of Netanya, in which at least 34
people were injured. The bombings were classified as terrorist
attacks, aimed at derailing Monday's final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the bombing attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak vowed to push ahead the talks set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly set out a number of guidelines for the
Israeli delegation: the framework agreement will signal the end of
the conflict between the two sides; the accord will bring about a
separation of political and security between Israel and "the
Palestinian entity"; adherence to the "five red lines" - no return
to the 1967 border, a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital, no
foreign army west of the Jordan Valley, no return of refugees to
Israeli territory and most of the set of
an agreement on resolving the issues such as conflicting claims
over Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in occupied territories, return
of Palestinian refugees, final borders between the two sides and
allocation of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched their ceremonial final-status talks on
September 13 at Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
but the talks had been stalled due to Israel's delay in naming the
head of its negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Monday's commencement of talks at the Grand Park Hotel here
will focus on formulating a strategy and schedule for the talks to
proceed and decide whether the six subcommittees, including the
subcommittee on economy, will start their meetings before the
framework agreement has been worked out.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss the next Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank, slated for November 15.
</P>
<P>
The talks on final status issues will prove to be an uphill
task, wman Yasser
Arafat met in Oslo, Norway a week ago, together with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, to renew their pledges to continue
the path of peace in the conflict-stricken Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in Oslo on setting up a new mechanism for the final
status talks and a hotline between Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak and Arafat are meeting in Paris on the
sidelines of the 21st Socialist International conference.

<HEADLINE> Freight Information Network Starts Trial Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Individual freight haulers in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and 63 other major Chinese cities can
get up-to-the-minute information about deliveries through a
national freight information network which started trial
operations today.
</P>
<P>
The network was set up to facilitate the communication between
shippers and carriers, according to the Beijing A&AMP;B Freight
Information Co., which operates the system.
</P>
<P>
The idea was jointly developed by the State Information Center
and the China Communication and Transportation Association.
</P>
<P>
Reports are on the rise of trucks being sent back from
deliveries empty or with insufficient goods, said Wang Derong,
vice-president of the association.
</P>
<P>
Most of the individual haulers do not know how to get timely
information on shipping orders, and yet they own 1.9 million
trucks, accounting for 30 percent of the total in the country's
freight sector in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
The network offers paging services, as pagers are popular with
Chinese and the Internet is inconvenient for drivers traveling
around the country, said Wang Jinsheng, general manager of Beijing
A&AMP;B Freight Information Co.
</P>
<P>
The company has promoted a paging hotline -- 126 -- with Guoxin
Telecom, China's largest paging business. Through this number, the
paging station will transmit messages from shippers to haulers
registered with the service.
</P>
<P>
A national Internet-based data exchange system will also be set
up in the near future and the services will be expanded from
highway freight to railroad, waterway and air cargo, Wang Jinsheng
said.

ZHENGZHOU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A leopard whose front right
paw was injured in a trap had the seriously infected limb
amputated over the weekend in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the Zhengzhou Orthopedics Hospital examined the
leopard and said it had lost blood circulation to its toes, which
could have led to blood poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The leopard was in good condition after the one-hour operation,
and was eating up to three pounds of fresh meat a day.
</P>
<P>
The handicapped cat will not be returned to the wild, and the
State Forestry Administration will decide where to place it.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a villager in Henan Province discover the nearly
four-year-old leopard yowling in pain on a cliff near the National
Mihou Nature Reserve. It was rescued and sent to the Animal
Hospital of Zhengzhou Zoo for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The leopard was believed to have caught its paw in a trap, and
had been stranded on the cliff for at least four days.
</P>
<P>
Leopards are the only mammals under intensive state protection
in Henan Province. They number less than 100 in the province.
</P>
<P>
The situation is under investigation as a case of illegal
hunting of a state-protected animal, local authorities said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (WEST BANK), November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators started the final status talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah Monday to resolve the thorniest issues
between them.
</P>
<P>
The historic talks opened despite pipe bomb explosions on
Sunday in Israel's northern coastal city of Netanya, which injured
dozens of people and were considered an attempt to derail the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, head of the Israeli negotiating team, and Yasser
Abed Rabbo, head of the Palestinian team and information minister
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), made opening speeches
to set forth their governments' basic positions.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians are committed to a framework
agreement by next February and then a final accord on permanent
peace by September, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators have about 100 days to work out the outlines of
an agreement on resolving the issues such as conflicting claims
over Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in occupied territories, return
of Palestinian refugees, final borders between the two sides and
allocation of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched their ceremonial final-status talks on
September 13 at Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
but the talks had been stalled due to Israel's delay in naming the
head of its negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Monday's commencement of talks at the Grandttees, including the
subcommittee on economy, will start their meetings before the
framework agreement has been worked out.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss the next Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank, slated for November 15.
</P>
<P>
The talks on final status issues will prove to be an uphill
task, which requires strong political will from both sides to make
tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat met in Oslo, Norway a week ago, together with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, to renew their pledges to continue
the path of peace in the conflict-stricken Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in Oslo on setting up a new mechanism for the final
status talks and a hotline between Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak and Arafat are meeting in Paris on the
sidelines of the 21st Socialist International conference.

S.Korea to Replace All Policemen Supervising Entertainment
Industry
</P>
<P>
SEOUL, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Police
Agency (NPA) Monday decided to replace all officers at police
stations in charge of managing the entertainment industry before
November 20.
</P>
<P>
The decision came nine days after 55 people, most of them
teenagers, were burned dead and 58 wounded in a bar which was
operating illegally due to bribes from the bar boss to police
officers and other public servants.
</P>
<P>
"At least 1,000 police officers will be replaced and we are now
preparing the selection process for the new officers," said a NPA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
NPA Commissioner Kim Kwang-shick unveiled a 13-point plan to
eradicate institutional corruption at a meeting of police leaders.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the agency will conduct a special inspection
on illegal operations of entertainment places and police officers
supervising those areas and will reprimand or punish those who
protected or turned a blind eye to the illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency will assign officers with clean records
to police stations in entertainment districts and change policeman
's jurisdiction over the merry-making quarters at each police box
every other month. And a crackdown on entertainment areas by
police will be conducted at least one time every three months.

Palestinian negotiators started the final status talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah Monday to resolve the thorniest issues

<P>
The historic talks opened in the Grand Park hotel here despite
three pipe-bomb attacks on Sunday in Israel's northern seaside city

</P>
<P>
Condemning the bombing attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak vowed to push ahead the talks set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly set out a number of guidelines for the
Israeli delegation: the framework agreement will signal the end of
the conflict between the two sides; the accord will bring about a
separation of political and security between Israel and "the
Palestinian entity"; adherence to the "five red lines" - no return
to the 1967 border, a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital, no
foreign army west of the Jordan Valley, no return of refugees to
Israeli territory and most of the settlements to be absorbed by
Israel.

<HEADLINE> UAE Regrets GCC Silence Over Disputes with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) expressed on Monday its frustration over the silence of a
Gulf Cooperation Council committee on its dispute with Iran over
three strategic Gulf islands during Sunday's GCC ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee of foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Oman and
Qatar, charged with resolving the dispute between the UAE and Iran
over the islands of Abu Musa and Great and Lesser Tunbs, did not
even issue a communique at the end of the GCC meeting in Riyadh,
complained the official Al Ittihad daily.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed last May, has not even disclosed to the
UAE the result of its contacts with Iran over the land dispute,
the paper said. Instead, it has chosen to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
Iran took control of the two Tunbs islands in 1971 after
British troops withdrew from the region and seized full control of
the Abu Musa in 1994 after sharing its sovereignty with the UAE
for over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim full sovereignty over the three
strategic islands at the mouth of the oil-rich Hormuz Strait.
</P>
<P>
The UAE seeks to solve the dispute through internatio
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, supports the UAE claim of
sovereignty over the three islands. But the UAE has been uneasy
over the rapprochement tendency of some GCC members, particularly
the influential Saudi Arabia, towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has accused Riyadh as well as some other GCC members of
trying to improve relations with Tehran while paying no attention
to its claim over the Tehran-occupied islands.
</P>
<P>
The issue is likely to drag on well into the next century as it
has become evident that some people want it so, because to them,
"interests are sometimes placed before rights," the paper said,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal, whose country
now takes over the chairmanship of the GCC ministerial council
from the UAE, said in Sunday's meeting that relations between Iran
and GCC countries were improving due to the positive political
approach of the new Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of this, there are still some problems that needed to
be resolved in order to get relations back to their proper places
and these include the issue of the UAE islands being occupied by
Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he told the London-based Al Hayat newspaper that the
three-party committee was continuing its work to create a
conducive atmosphere for direct negotiations between the UAE and
Iran for a peaceful solution of the islands issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee would present its report to the GCC
summit in Riyadh in 2000.

COLOMBO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Monday were reestablishing new defenses in the north of the
country after losing vast territory to the Tamil rebels in fierce
fighting last week, military sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The troops were engaging the Tamil rebels in counter-attacks
near the northern town of Omanthai while the fresh defense line
was being built to hold back possible further thrusts by the
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have captured at least 10 towns as ferocious battles
are raging in the north of the country, leaving up to 1,200
combatants dead on both sides, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The troops need to stabilize their defenses to ensure that they
can hold rebels back, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the government
for a separate state for the Tamil minority in the north and east
of the country since 1983. Over 55,000 people have reportedly been
killed in the war.

MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The third batch of the 353-man
Philippine contingent to East Timor will leave Tuesday aboard a
United States Air Force (USAF) plane to join the United Nations
peacekeeping forces there, the Philippine government announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Armed Forces chief of staff General Angelo Reyes
said this will bring to a battalion-size of 600 officers and men
of the Philippine Humanitarian Support Mission to East Timor
(Philhsmet) deployed for civic action duties in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines had earlier sent 247 troops to East Timor
following the flare-up of violence in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that like the other two batches, the third batch
will be composed mostly of doctors, nurses, dentists and
engineers. It will also have a security component.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a second USAF plane will airlift the cargoes of
provisions of the Philhsmet, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
With the upgrading of Filipino forces to East Timor, the
Philhsmet will be reorganized into a headquarters company and four
task groups that will extend humanitarian and other basic services
to East Timorese refugees.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the Philhsmet went to Dili, the capital of
East Timor, in September.
</P>

The Philhsmet is under the operational command of the
International Force for East Timor (Interfet). However, the
operational command of the Philippine contingent remains with the

<HEADLINE> Scientists: EPR Used For Clues To Cancer, Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign scientists
have discovered that Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
technology can be used to determine the causes of cancer and aging.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the second Asia-Pacific EPR symposium
which closed recently in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The use of EPR technology will help researchers to further
study molecular structure.
</P>
<P>
EPR has been proved helpful in the detection of free radicals
in the human body which are closely related to some diseases such
as cancer, as well as arthritis and aging.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are experimenting with uses of EPR in biomedicine,
and in other areas like the analysis of nuclear fallout,
geological surveys and food preservation.
</P>
<P>
In 1944, Russia's scientists discovered the EPR phenomenon,
which has since been widely used in chemical and biological areas.

<HEADLINE> Ethical Improvement Among People Urged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities
have urged the Chinese people to improve their ethical standards
and stand tall when facing the challenges brought on by modern-day
life.
</P>
<P>
In the latest suggestion on strengthening ideological and
ethical work, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
ordered all its local branches to carry out the suggestion in
accordance with their different conditions.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises are urged to deepen the inside reform so as to
enhance their management efficiency. Rural areas should carry out
various kinds of legal and scientific education. College and
school students must combine learning with social practice. Urban
communities should help shape friendly relationships among
neighbors, the suggestion said.
</P>
<P>
It particularly stressed that the problems of retirees, laid-
off workers and migrant workers from rural areas be solved.
</P>
<P>
The CPC plans to take an extremely important role in enhancing
the people's ethical level during the socialist reform and opening-
up process.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities will publicly recognize a group of
outstanding model workers and professionals in society and greatly
enrich the cultural life of the people.
</P>
<P>
All CPC members are urged to remain clear-headed so as to solve
new problems in today's society which is filled with diverse
lifestyles, different social systems and various types of
employment, the suggestion said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The CPC vows to adhere to Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought
and Deng Xiaoping Theory, as well as to stick to the basic line
and principles of the Party.
</P>
<P>
The Party will continue to educate its members and the entire
public on the correct outlook on the world, life and values.
</P>
<P>
In promoting ethical education, the CPC underscores economic
construction as one of its most important tasks. Improving people'
s ideological outlook also serves the major goal of economic
development, the suggestion said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the suggestion ordered that all levels of society be
united in fulfilling the ethical improvement work.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will also focus on perfecting related laws or
regulations in the field.
</P>
<P>
Solving ideological problems must be combined with settling
practical issues, the suggestion said.
</P>
<P>
The Party will unswervingly popularize scientific knowledge
among the people, safeguard social stability and form a good moral
norm in society. Under the principle of emancipating the mind and
seeking truth from facts, the Party should find new ways to
resolve new problems.
</P>
<P>
Mass media in the country are also called on to encourage
healthy ideological trends.
</P>
<P>
Mass cultural organizations, museums and stadiums should become
centers for people's leisure entertainment, the suggestion said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Start Final Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (WEST BANK), November 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators started the final status talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah Monday to resolve the thorniest issues
between them.
</P>
<P>
The historic talks opened despite pipe bomb explosions on
Sunday in Israel's northern coastal city of Netanya, which injured
dozens of people and were considered an attempt to derail the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, head of the Israeli negotiating team, and Yasser
Abed Rabbo, head of the Palestinian team and information minister
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), made opening speeches
to set forth their governments' basic positions.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians are committed to a framework
agreement by February and then a final accord on permanent peace
by September.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators have about 100 days to work out the outlines of
an agreement on resolving the tough issues such as conflicting
claims over Jerusalem, Jewish settlement in occupied territories,
return of Palestinian refugees, final borders between the two
sides and allocation of water resources.
</P>
<P>
It will prove to be an uphill task, which requires strong
political will to make tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat met in Oslo, Norway a week ago, together with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, to renew their pledges to continue
the path of peace in the conflict-stricken Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in Oslo on setting up a new mechanism for the final
status talks and a hotline between Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak and Arafat are meeting in Paris on the
sidelines of the 21st Socialist International conference.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Lower in Tokyo on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Monday, dragged down by profit-taking following their recent
gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 113.92 points, or 0.62
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,240.98, after
gaining some 365 points during the previous two trading days.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all First
Section issues, dropped 23.11 points or 1.45 percent to 1,573.74.
</P>
<P>
A downward revision in Japan's gross domestic product (GDP)
data for the April-June quarter, together with fears that New York
stock prices may decline Monday, led investors to sell stocks, a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency said earlier in the day that
the GDP for the second quarter of this year grew 0.1 percent from
the preceding quarter, adjusting the figure downward from the
preliminary forecast of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investors are also worried about a possible decline on Wall
Street on Monday, after a U.S. federal court ruled Friday that
Microsoft Corp. is a monopoly, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 596.58 million
shares from 623.99 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Trust and Banking was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower in 29 of the 33 business sectors, with
the nonbank money lenders falling 4.02 percent as a sector to
become the biggest loser.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 840 to 382, with 121 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Suspends Links With UN Tribunal on Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has announced it
is suspending c unconditional release of a genocide suspect last
week.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan State Prosecutor Gerald Gahima said Saturday the
decision was "very wrong" and that the Rwandan people felt
betrayed by it, Tanzanian newspaper "The Guardian" reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR's Appeal Chamber in The Hague, the Netherlands, on
November 3 ordered Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza's release on the grounds
that procedures had not been properly followed during his
detention in Cameroon and in the United Nations detention facility
in Arusha, northern Tanzania after his transfer.
</P>
<P>
The court said Barayagwiza had been detained in Cameroon for 19
months without being informed of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
However, Prosecutor Gahima denounced such an arrangement on
national television, saying "Any hardship which Barayagwiza may
have suffered in Cameroon custody is negligible compared with what
his victims suffered. There is no justification for this
decision."
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor said that the Kigali government was
therefore suspending "all co-operation and assistance with the
organs of the tribunal" .
</P>
<P>
However, "Rwanda looks forward to discussing with the organs
concerned measures which can help to reverse this deplorable
precedent," Gahima said.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, former Director of Political Affairs in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Rwanda at the time of the genocide,
was transferred to the Tribunal in Arusha on November 19, 1997
from Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with six counts of genocide, complicity in
genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public
incitement to genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded not guilty to these charges on February 23, 1998 and
filed a motion seeking to nullify his arrest, though such a motion
was dismissed by the Tribunal on November 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try people suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody.
</P>
<P>
About half a million Rwandans were reportedly killed during the
1994 genocide when the majority Hutus oppressed the minority
Tutsis.

educate Africans on the challenges of peace and development as
major concerns of the continent.

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
said here Monday that bilateral relations between China and
Singapore have all along maintained good momentum since the two
countries established diplomatic ties in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the New
Complex of the Chinese Embassy in Singapore, Chinese Vice-Foreign
Minister Yang Wenchang said that thanks to the joint efforts of
both governments, the relationship between China and Singapore has
now gone deeper and deeper into politics, economy, culture,
science and technology, religion, tourism and many other fields.

The two countries are enjoying an all-round partnership of
good-neighborly friendship and cooperation.

<P>
Referring to the visit to China by Singapore Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew in September 1999 and the forthcoming visit to
Singapore by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, Yang said such frequent
exchange of visits by the leaders of the two countries will surely
have a huge impact on the development of the bilateral ties and
help bring into the 21st century an increasingly close and
friendly relationship between China and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Singapore Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Ow Chin Hock said Singapore and China have
developed a strong and multiple relationship in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Birds Endangering Safety Of Flights in East China Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Changbei Airport, which
inaugurated its first flight two months ago, deserves to be proud
of its first-class navigation system, but now finds itself with an
unexpected threat to air safety: birds.
</P>
<P>
The airport, situated in the suburbs of Nanchang, capital of
Jiangxi Province, east China, is situated within a dozen
kilometers of nests of perennial bird species like egrets and some
migratory birds like white cranes.
</P>
<P>
In winter, the sparse bird population presents no threat, but
once the weather turns warm, the gathering flocks are hard to
ignore, said an airport administrator.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials have taken steps to dispel the birds, many of
which are under state protection, and their actions have caught
the attention of local animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
The aviation administration bureau, forestry and nature
protection departments in Jiangxi have joined Changbei Airport to
seek humane ways to keep the airport bird-free in the coming
spring.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's important air hubs, Changbei Airport now
accommodates 130 flights per week, and two million passengers a
year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Accepts Foreign-funded Bank's Request for RMB Rediscounting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of People'
s Bank of China, China's central bank, recently rediscounted a
commercial bill in Chinese currency which had been discounted by a
foreign-funded bank.
</P>
<P>
The bill, whose par value hits 1.14 million yuan (about 130,000
US dollars), had been discounted by the Shanghai branch of Sanwa
Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time China's central bank branch has offered
such a rediscount.
</P>
<P>
This means that those foreign-funded banks which deal in
Renminbi-based business (business based on Chinese currency) will
be able to get more Renminbi capital, according to officials with
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The act is a breakthrough in the use of the rediscount currency
policy of China's central bank, explained the officials, and will
promote the opening of China's banking.
</P>
<P>
In late 1996, foreign-funded banks in China were given the go-
ahead to deal in Renminbi-based business. Since then, the central
bank has made some favorable policies to expand the scope of
foreign banks in such business activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics provided by the central bank's
Shanghai branch, by the end of September 1999, the total assets of
19 foreign-funded banks which deal in Renminbi-based business in
Shanghai hit 4.4 billion yuan (532 million US dollars), and their

WELLINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Revenue of the New
Zealand-owned information technology giant, Datacom Group, is on
track to pass the 200 million NZ dollars (104 million U.S.

If the company can meet that target, it will rank in the top

Monday.
</P>
<P>
Datacom, a privately-owned company in New Zealand, recorded a

MEXICO CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's former Interior
Minister Francisco Labastida was elected the presidential
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) on
Sunday, according to initial results here.
</P>
<P>
Early results showed that Labastida took 251 districts, and his
nearest rival, former Tabasco governor Roberto Madrazo took 29
while former Puebla governor Manuel Bartlett and former PRI leader
Humberto Roque trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
The candidate who wins a majority of the 300 districts will be
the PRI candidate in the presidential elections in July next year.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election is a milestone in Mexico's political history,
dominated for 70 years by the PRI, a party created in 1929 as a
convergence of the political, economic and social forces of the
country, after the end of the 1910 revolution.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Closer Thai-Chinese Ties Lead to Tourism Surge: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals from China
surpassed those from Singapore to rank third in the first eight
months of this year thanks to the closer Thai-Chinese ties,
according to a report by the Thai Farmers Research Center received
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tourists had been the fourth largest group last year
after arrivals from Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 800,000 Chinese tourists are expected to
visit Thailand in 1999, generating foreign exchange revenue of
24.1 billion baht (634 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country, however, was unable to gain the full benefits as
unethical travel agents and tour guides were damaging its image in
the emerging Chinese market by offering cheap, low-quality tour
packages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Travel agents were offering heavily discounted tour packages to
Chinese visitors -- costing Thailand at least 1 billion baht (26.3
million dollars) per year, it said, calling for a crackdown on
tour operators who were using questionable tactics to compensate
for their rock-bottom price tour packages.
</P>
<P>
These tactics damaged Thailand's tourism image among the
Chinese visitors and were considered very detrimental to the
entire tourism business in Thailand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"High quality tourism programs should be promoted among the
premium tourists in China, given their promising growth potential
and higher purchasing power," it said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Holds Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala began its
first presidential election Sunday after the signing of peace
accords in 1996 which ended the 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, many Guatemalans went to voting booths to cast their
ballots for a new president, new congress members and 330 mayors.
</P>
<P>
During the voting, while most Guatemalans said they wish the
government to continue implementing the peace accords, most are
more concerned about their subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 international observers and 2,000 local observers were
in Guatemala City to supervise the elections when more than 17,000
policemen and 12,000 army troops were deployed at the ballot boxes
to guarantee the transparency of the elections.
</P>
<P>
So far no violence has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The electoral authorities expected about 4.46 million eligible
Guatemalans to take part in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Under the electoral law, the presidential candidate winning at
least 51 percent of the votes will be the elected president who
will take office on January 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
If none of them gets the absolute majority, the top two will
continue a runoff on December 26.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Portillo, candidate of the rightist Guatemalan
Republican Front (FGR), is the front runner followed by Oscar
Berger of the ruling National Advanced Party (PAN), and Alvaro
Colom of the New Nation Alliance (ANN).

<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's largest carmaker
Astra International predicted that domestic car sales would reach
80,000 this year, up from an initial forecast of 60,000, the
Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company said it increased the sales target after seeing
improved domestic car sales in the first nine months of 1999, and
especially after the landmark general election in June.
</P>
<P>
Domestic car sales reached 51,635 in the first nine months,
compared to sales of 58,312 last year when the economic crisis,
which started in mid-1997, became more severe and the country's
political situation turned worse following the downfall of former
president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Annual car sales reached a peak of 403,000 in 1996 before
plunging soon after the financial crisis hit the country in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Astra said its domestic car sales markedly rose to 11,212 in
September from 4,719 in June and 1,896 in January.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic car demand is steadily on the rise this year as the
public's confidence in the social political situation, especially
after the June general election improved and the interest rate
fell," the company said.
</P>
<P>
Publicly listed Astra also projected domestic motorcycle sales
to reach 450,000 this year, up from an initial projection of
420,000.
</P>
<P>
It said motorcycle sales in the domestic market were recorded
at 313,801 in the first nine months, with September sales reaching
54,747, up from 35,242 in June and 14,456 in January.
</P>
<P>
Domestic motorcycle sales reached 431,185 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Soccer Team Beats S. Korea 5-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's World Cup runners-up
team routed South Korea 5-2 on Sunday as the "She-Devils" started
their campaign to emphasize their dominance in the 12th Asian
Women's Football Championship at the Panaad Stadium in Bacolod
City in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
With the field relatively soggy from Saturday's rains, the
Chinese women sliced through the inexperienced South Korean's
defenses to grab the upper-hand after they were held to 1-1 in the
opening minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
After Kang Sung-mi equalized in less than a minute for the
South Koreans, Liu Ying, the leading scorer in the World Cup, and
her teammates Sun Wen and Zhang Ouying retaliated quickly to
practically decide the game.
</P>
<P>
Liu scored on the 31st, followed by Sun Wen on the 41st and
Zhang Ouying added on one more just the first half ended in the
45th minute.
</P>
<P>
Liu added on more on the 71st and Kang Sung-mi converted on the
76th for the final score.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPR Korea and the Chinese Taipei overwhelmed
separate rivals Sunday in Iloilo City in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korea crushed India, 7-0, while Chinese Taipei were even
impressive in mauling Malaysia, 16-0, as both squads picked up
their first wins in Group A of this tournament organized by the
Philippine Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
The solidly built DPR Koreans, a Women's World Cup qualifier
and runners-up to the Chinese in the 1997 Asian title in Guangzhou,
China, virtually settle the issue in the fast and furious first
half as Ri Hyang-ok opened the scoring with goals in the eighth
and 20th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Indian goalkeeper Binasori Devi never had a respite after that
and the score would have been bigger if not for her timely saves
in the face of superior opposition.
</P>
<P>
Still, DPR Korean coach Kim Mun-choi was not too elated with
the outcome, saying "we still have to work hard on our teamwork."
</P>
<P>
Striker Pak Jong-ae knocked in her second goal in the 55th
minute, completing a 180-degree turn to elude several Indian
defenders to blast in from the center just atop the penalty box
before Jin Pyol-hui and O Kum-ran closed out the lopsided match
with Goals in the 77th and 86th minutes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"My team has only been training for a month. And we're
accustomed to playing on a hard ground, not the soft pitch that
you have. But our rival is definitely one of the favorites," said
Indian coach Gosh Kwantala.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei were even more relentless against a hapless
Malaysian side as prolific forward Lin Chi led the charge with
four goals in the first half to power her team to a 10-0 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain why they were too score-conscious, coach Chang
Ming Shen said they were keen on reaching the semifinals and
wanted to avoid the playoff complications.

<HEADLINE> Power Firm Set Up to Tap Yellow River Upper Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China has given the go-ahead for
the establishment of a company responsible for power generation on
the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the second longest of the
country after the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Upper Reaches Power Development Co., Ltd. has
a registered capital of one billion yuan at its initial stage,
with cash from ten power companies at state and provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
Company officials say that the new power company will first
concentrate on the development of the Gongboxia Power Station with
a total installed capacity of 1.5 million kw, the fourth largest
on the Yellow River, using funds gained from power generation at
Longyangxia and Lijiaxia power stations. Two other hydropower
stations will be built after that.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the company is a significant step of the
Chinese government to form a comprehensive energy base to develop
the rich resources of hydropower, thermal power and natural gas as
well as new types of energy sources in northwest China, said a
company official.
</P>
<P>
The upper reaches of the Yellow River has been listed one of
the 12 hydro-electric energy bases in China. Seven power stations,
with combined installed capacity of 5.6 million kw, have been
built or are being built on the 918-meter section between
Longyangxia in Qinghai Province and Qingtongxia in Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to China's development program, a total of 25 power
stations with aggregate installed capacity of 15.88 million kw
will be built in this area for an annual production of 56.77
billion kwh of electricity.

BELGRADE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's ambassador to the
United Nations, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, on Sunday for a two-day visit to the Yugoslavia's war-torn
province, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy held talks at Pristina airport with Stanimir
Vukichevich, chairman of the Yugoslavia's Committee of Cooperation
with the U.N. administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), and Zoran
Andjelkovich, president of the Kosovo's provincial executive
committee, on the situation in Kosovo.

terrorism acts targeted at non-Albanian residents, including Serbs,
have constantly taken place since the KFOR peacekeeping force and

<P>
The KFOR and the UNMIK should bear responsibility for the
worsening situation in the region as they take an indulgent
attitude to the Albanians' violent acts, they said.

<P>
After the talks, Lavrov told reporters that the international
community must strictly abide by the obligations contained in the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Ruling Party Starts Historical Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been in power for seven
decades in Mexico, started a historic primary elections to
nominate its presidential candidate on Sunday on a cold and cloudy
morning.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the elections must face his rivals of the Mexican
opposition in presidential elections next July 2, now considered
as the most disputed and democratic in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the Sunday's elections is a milestone in Mexico's political
history, dominated for 70 years by the PRI, a party created in
1929 as a convergence of the political, economic and social forces
of the country, after the end of the 1910 revolution.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Mexican history, Mexican president
Ernesto Zedillo virtually relinquished "his right" of election, in
what for decades has been known as "hand-picking" a successor.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the ruling PRI started a new machinery to
choose the candidate that will carry its banner in next year's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the PRI new rules, four prominent members of
the ruling party are vying this Sunday for the nomination of the
presidential candidate: former Interior Minister Francisco
Labastida, Governor on leave of the southwestern Tabasco state
Roberto Madrazo, former Governor of the central Puebla state
Manuel Bartlett and the former PRI national chairman Humberto
Roque.
</P>
<P>
One of them will be chosen as the candidate to the presidency
of Mexico on Sunday in the first open process in the PRI's history.
</P>
<P>
Most of the analysts and the most recent opinion polls point to
Labastida, a 57-year-old economist, as the politician to be
elected as the ruling party presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The PRI had never held an internal consultation to nominate its
candidate before, and neither any Mexican president had ever
resigned his privilege to designate his successor.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of the PRI presidential candidate is not the
only thing being gambled in the election, but also the unity of
the party that has assured the stability of Mexico in the last 70
years.
</P>
<P>
Although most analysts forecast a triumph for Labastida, they
do not completely rule out a last minute surprise. Madrazo, the
most contentious among the hopefuls, could be the dark horse.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Madrazo could contest the legitimacy of the PRI
internal process, and even promote an internal fracture of the
party, which could endanger its dominance in power.
</P>
<P>
Even Bartlett and Roque have warned that they will not play a
partner role in a farce and that they will disavow the triumph of
Labastida if there is no transparency in the process.
</P>
<P>
The results of the voting day costing some 30 million pesos (
approximately 3 million U.S. dollars) are expected this afternoon.

JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of disappointed

<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- American teenager Michelle Kwan
Sunday flew her Los Angeles home with a Skate Canada gold medal
and a cheque of 30,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old's free-skating performance, though somewhat
flawed as she fell on a botched jump landing, was still good
enough to be given top prize at Saint John, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit disappointed, but I have time to get myself
together before my next competition," she said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Julia Soldatova, 18, took second place which was
awarded a cheque of 18,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canadian champion Jennifer Robinson, 22, won 10,000 U.S.
dollars for third place. She, too, fell on a jump, but eventually
managed to step on a podium with two world medalists
</P>
<P>
An American student-athlete, Kwan will be just another freshman
on the UCLA campus in mid-term university exams.
</P>
<P>
"Now I have to completely switch gears and turn my mind to
studying," she told her post-win news conference.
</P>
<P>
Her Sunday's medal has added to her 15 wins in the 18
competitions for the past two years. The five-foot-two skating
star won at Skate America nine days ago and will return to the
spotlight at a pro-am meet on December 18 in the state of
Washington.

division respectively in the New York City Marathon last year, won
the championship in the 1999 race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Each of them is awarded 50,000 U.S. dollars plus a Mazda Miata

<HEADLINE> Fairs, Exhibitions Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Activities such as fairs and
exhibitions are becoming ever more popular in China as methods for
obtaining information, promoting a market presence and increasing
economic exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This is specially true in Shanghai, the country's leading
industrial and commercial center, where an average of two such
showcase events are held every week.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has hosted as many as 80 international commercial
exhibitions and is paying increasing attention to these activities,
which are proving to be highly profitable and a catalyst for
boosting the development of the economy overall.
</P>
<P>
The city of Jinhua in Zhejiang Province, east China, has held a
national trade fair for automobile and motorcycle parts for two
consecutive years. These fairs help not only promote the presence
of the city nationwide, but also give a big push to the
development of the local automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
A three-day trade fair that closed recently in Jinhua is
estimated to have brought in at least 200 million yuan to the
local economy through restaurants, hotels, entertainment, and
shopping.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of the country's cities, including Shanghai,
Shenzhen and Ningbo, have resorted to these commercial activities
as a major method for attracting businesses and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Though the Internet is becoming ever more popular as a way of
doing business, many take the view that these fairs and similar
activities are able to get twice the results with half the effort
through face-to-face dealings, and this means growing business
opportunities.

KUWAIT CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Olympic soccer
side is poised to qualify for the Sydney Olympic Games by
overwhelming Saudi Arabia 3-0 in an Asian Zone Group A match here
on Sunday.
</P>

The win left Kuwait topping the table on six points with a game
remaining, in which they will play Qatar in Doha on November 12.
Qatar would have to make five or more goal differences in that
match to deny Kuwait their Sydney ticket.

The Saudis have literally missed the boat, having all their
matches played already but still on six points.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Outside Levis Headquarters in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A time-bomb exploded on Sunday
night outside the headquarters of the Levis Strauss Hellas offices
in the Athens district of Halandri, damaging the store front and
breaking windows in the building as well as adjacent buildings.
</P>
<P>
The time-bomb was placed on the ground floor level of the
three-story building on 11 Argonauton street, which was closed and
unguarded at the time, police said.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the blast, which was described by
police as of medium force.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one or group has claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, two unknown persons fired some six rounds
at the Hellenic American Union's offices in downtown Athens,
breaking several windows in the building.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the two attacks were part of a
number of attacks against U.S. President Bill Clinton's
forthcoming visit to Greece next week.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, seven cars were damaged at a dealership selling
French and German vehicles in an attack claimed by a terrorist
group calling itself "Anti-State Action".
</P>
<P>
ON Friday, police also disposed of a dynamite-packed time-bomb
left outside a sporting goods store selling U.S.-based Nike
products in a possible attempt to attack American targets prior to
the Athens visit by Clinton.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Asks U.S. Lift Cuban Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said on Sunday that the economic embargo the United States
maintains against Cuba is savage, and that there is no reason to
continue it.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said during his Sunday radio program "Hallo President"
about the situation in Cuba that they continue asking the United
States to lift the blockade that affects the Cubans, since it has
no justification after 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embargo against Cuba was established since 1962 by
President John Kennedy after Havana established a military
agreement with former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he will travel next Friday to Havana to attend the
Ibero-American Summit to be held November 15 and 16, and that after
the end of this important assembly, he will make a state visit to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will meet during his official visit with President Fidel
Castro and will attend the exhibition "Venezuelan Week in Cuba."
He will end his visit November 18 with a baseball game between the
Venezuelan team and its Cuban counterpart.
